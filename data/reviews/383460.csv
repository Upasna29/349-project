Most of the graphics have been updated, and new scenarios have been added.\nIt is not a cutesy high school romance visual novel. It is a gripping, disturbing tale of horror which takes place within an aquarium for those who love the horror genre this will suit your taste perfectly.\nThe secrets of the Manten Aquarium will be revealed!\n\nThe storyThe visual novel starts off with Himeno sharing a urban legend off Manten Aquriam with Mayumi as we are introduced to two best friends Mayu and Himeno. Himeno likes paranormal related things and suggests they head to the Manten Aquarium even though Mayu wants nothing to do with the Manten Aquarium but they decided to visit Manten Aquarium to investigate these urban legends. But then...\nThey caught a glimpse of Mayu’s missing little sister, Mari that disappeared at Manten Aquarium 5 years ago.\n\nTaking place at the heart of Tokyo, the quaint little aquarium, Manten Aquarium. Numerous urban legends have arisen from here. According to rumors passed throughout the student body, this location is filled with all sorts of paranormal activity alongside with more serious things like unexplained disappearances and deaths AND supposedly, there are things like a fish with a human face and that the aquarium water turns to blood on full moons.\n\nManten AquariumAn urban aquarium inconspicuously settled inside Manten East Building. It is situated on the top floor of the section protruding outward, utilizing a sturdy steel frame. There was once an esteemed Deep-sea Fish booth, but it was closed down approximately five years ago.\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual elements - are absolutely stunning the background are smooth, while glommy colors are being put to use to set up the overall creepy atmosphere.\nEvent CG are extremely detailed, the CG alone have the ability to depict the overall environment.\nChibi art of the characters are cute and sprites are detailed.\n\nAudio elements - are PERFECT soundtracks used, fits in perfectly into the creepy atmosphere, and honestly it made me felt a chill down my spine, yes I honestly felt scared when playing this because of the creepy music. I loved the part where you start up the game and you are immediately greeted with a atmospheric and soothing music with a girl seemed that seems to be Mayumi somewhat drowning these 2 things the menu music and Mayumi drowning compliments with each other so well together.\nThere is no voice acting in this visual novel regardless despite not having voice actors it still manages to strike fear into the reader hearts with just soundtracks and backgrounds.\n\nTo sum upSound of Drop – fall into poison – is an impressive visual novel for how it manages to utterly disturb players with simple text and artwork with creepy music. People who loves the horror genre even if they’ve never played a visual novel before I am very sure you will enjoy this visual novel.\n\nAtogakiPersonally I write reviews for a hobby but when I was writing a this visual novel a review i find very enjoying, reason it is because I absolutely love this visual novel the music, art style, characters.\nIn my opinion this is ONE of the top/best visual novel that is releasing on Steam this year other than clannad etc.\nHere is a link to their opening movie i really suggest you to watch and listen to it, it is really good. I personally loved it and here's the truth i have listened to it 127 times (yes i recorded it down) and more to come. In short I loved it lots.\n\nClick her for the full review![azusantiara.wordpress.com]\n\nKagame Shizuku no Oto\nしずくのおと - fall into poison - OP https://youtu.be/jsZafLfEXn4","October 30, 2015","true","30.6"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","68","74","4","0"

The art, graphics, and music are very detailed, high quality, and fitting to the story. The story itself is mysterious and gripping, and I played 9 hours of it in one sitting, the amount of time it took for me to experience the 4 true endings (some only unlocked after finishing the game once), and the numerous bad endings (the ways you die).\n\nThoughts, story wiseThe story follows Miyu and her friend, Himeno, who go to Manten Aquarium following some urban legends regarding people going crazy or disappearing in the Aquarium. However, Miyu has her own dark past regarding the aquarium - her sister, Mari, disappeared there 5 years ago. The setting with urban legends is quite standard for horror games, and as the story progresses, the main characters find themselves in another, twisted version of the Aquarium - "Red Manten Aquarium". Miyu toughens up and navigates this ghastly world in order to save Himeno, and find out the secrets behind her younger sister's disappearance.\n\nI enjoyed the way the endings were set up: the normal endings have quite enough information as you gradually unravel the secrets of why there is twisted, alternate version of Manten Aquarium. However, you still do not know that much about some other characters at this point. When you replay the game, there is a bonus beginning scene that gives you much more information about other characters, and there is much more interaction regarding the history behind the eerie corruption of the "Red Menten Aquarium".\n\nThe main character Miyu starts off as more of a timid character, and is prone to being scared to the point she can't really act. I don't really blame her as she is in junior high school, but you get to see her grow and change throughout the hardships she suffers in the grotesque other world. Compared to the more massive, 30+ hour visual novels, this game doesn't have such an amount of world building and character development, but it's quite well executed how Sound of Drop packs so much in 4~ hours (first playthrough).\n\nI found the atmosphere genuinely creepy, and while there aren't very sudden jump scares like in first or third person games, I think the writers did a good job in the horror elements. One small gripe I have is that the translation is off at times, and there were about 4 instances I had to re-read the log a couple times and couldn't quite understand.\n\nThoughts, game play wiseThe game has standard visual novel controls and menu options. A nice addition was a button where you could hide the dialog window so you can take nice screenshots of the graphics. In the main menu there is an endings list so you can check what's missing. Everything runs smoothly and will be familiar if you've played other VNs.\n\nConclusionSound of Drop - fall into poison - is a great horror visual novel, with a well made setting and horror elements. For fans of visual novels or just horror stories, I think you'll enjoy this gem, and definitely play it more than once to explore more of the universe and backstory!\n\n~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other reviews by me and others!~","December 30, 2015","true","9.1"," 44 of 46 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","44","46","0","6"

I am not an enthusiastic visual novel fan, though I own several.  I also generally avoid any game dealing with horror or psychological trauma.  This game is all those things.  So for me to actually, first, even play this game, and secondarily, recommend this game "says" more then I could possibly ever express in this review.\n\nStoryline: 3rd year junior high student, Himeno Tamagawa, convinces her best friend, Mayumi Nakanobe, who Himeno calls Mayu, to go the Manten Aquarium to see if the urban legends about human-faced fish, blood red water in the fish tanks, an unknown room only accessible on a full moon night, and mysterious disappearances are true.  Mayu is reluctant, for very good reason, but goes anyway. (To say any more would be getting into spoiler territory.)\n\nThe storyline is an enigma wrapped in a supernatural horror mystery.  Possibly even a horror survival game with adventure elements.  Mostly it is a mystery though; many different mysteries, in fact, involving an entire cast of characters each with their own back story, motives, intentions and mystery to solve.  (All these mysteries are solved if one completes all 4 storylines.)  The character storylines intertwine and often overlap giving the entire story at times a confusing feeling much in vein of Wuthering Heights (Bronte).  Yet if the gamer continues on everything is explained eventually.  In fact the story mechanics remind me of Wuthering Heights (Emily Bronte), Jane Eyre (Charlotte Bronte), and Rebecca (Daphne du Maurier).  Even love is portrayed in a chilling way.\n\nThe main character is Mayu who is age 14.  She is a rather shy person with an introverted personality who has become friends with the active, self-assured, exuberant Himeno.  Of course there is drama between them which plays a brief yet rather significant counter point to main storyline. (What 14 year old girls do not have drama among their friends?  Or have those types of anxieties and doubts about their friends and themselves?  Every 14 year old girl I have ever meet acts like the girls in this story.)  I only point this out because for me this is the believability factor and this believability factor is the main reason I can accept the story being told.  Given the situations Mayu finds herself in I can believe she would react the way she does, think those thoughts and say the things she does.  So basically the Mayu character does not seem contrived or out of character for the person she is portrayed as.  The same can be said for all the other characters as well.  They are who they are portrayed as and act and speak accordingly.\n\nThis game is a remake or an upgraded version of the 2014 original.  For the Steam release version, a new game plus replay version was added.  This replay plus version can only be accessed once the gamer goes through the entire story once, and starts with a side story about another girl named Sayo (tying in many elements and back story from the first play through).  The game plus also adds 2 new storylines (giving the game 2 more True Endings) and 7 more Bad Endings.  Bad Endings are death, by the way, 27 in total.  I have not died this much since I played Long Live the Queen or Team Fortress 2.  The storyline is linear (with side ventures into death) with what I am given to understand are the typical safe choices (blue) and the (red) possible death (no, most likely death does wait) choices.\n\nAfter 8 hours of playing this game (which is mostly reading) just to finish the entire story (and most side ventures) I can easily say and without fabrication this is definitely not a boring story line.  The story line keeps one intrigued and wanting to know what will happen next.  Horror, suspense, mystery, adventure (?), supernatural and many character deaths, some of which I even chose on purpose.  It was like reading a book I simply could not put down until the end (which I did not.)\n\nI am not an expert on visual novels, but the few I own and actually like, are well written stories that have believable characters that stay in character, in relatively realistic situations and few to none glaring plot holes.  I recommend this game at any price.  It is well worth the read.","November 28, 2015","true","22.1"," 30 of 30 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","30","30","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/383460/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3204 products in account","I rarely play Visual Novels, but when I do...\nSound of Drop - Fall into Poison, which I'll shorthand to Poison from here on out, is one of those rare VN's which I took a keen interest in long before the release, I tend to steer clear of VNs on account of them being pretty sugary affairs on the whole, and not my bag (I don't waifu, yo). Poison however is a horror VN, and much more path based, having echoes of the highly acclaimed 9 Doors series that featured on the NDS (which I was a big big fan of).\n\nAfter much pondering and considering, I decided to put my money where my mouth is, and shelled out on Poison, because I felt it was worth a punt. The game touts a lot of bad endings compared to good ones, and it doesn't disappoint one bit. For four "good" endings, there's a sum of twenty seven "bad" ones. This is getting on for Long Live the Queen territory, and some of them are pretty brutal, others are downright creepy (we're talking Elven Lied levels of ick, whilst it's not overtly graphical, the descriptions allude to enough to put the idea in your head).\n\nI'm blue, la-da-de-da-da-daaaa....\nProtagonist Mayu is well written, played out as something of a weaker main character who over the course of the novel (depending on the path you take) becomes either strong as a team leader of sorts, or strong in herself, and depending on the choices you make, the paths -will- diverge pretty significantly. There's some pretty big storyline branches which lead towards the various ending options, which lend themselves well towards replayability, with the nice touch that you can skip at near lightspeed over passages you don't feel like re-reading if you're simply playing to discover a new ending that time around.\n\nHer counterpart, Himeno, is immediately likeable, and there's a very clear sense that the friendship has the capacity to develop into something much deeper and more real depending on how the evening plays out in the aquarium. The stage sets up early to indicate that you'll be spending a lot of time together, only for the story to then switch directions back and forth, I won't spoiler much beyond this, because it's hard to explain without giving tons of the plot away, but suffice to say, you'll be confronted with Mayu facing some deeply difficult emotional decisions, and forcing her to be logical even when her heart is trying to make her pick up the idiot ball at times.\n\n(side note, feel free to pick up said idiot ball when fishing for the bad endings, some of them are ... well... *shudder* )\n\nThe rest of the cast are minor part players, with the antagonists being somewhat tangential because of the way the plot is structured, but you'll come to -really- dislike at least one person (and the way they've been written, that's by design), another will in one path be quite likeable, and in another will probably have you wanting to strangle them through the monitor, and so on. Suffice to say, it's a good sign when the writing makes you want to root for characters and feel satisfied when the conclusion has been reached.\n\nThe beauty of the aquarium and the wonder of the sound...\nParticular merit goes to the sound and graphics, which are practically wallpaper worthy in many cases, the sound design too is of an absolutely excellent standard, with the music very clearly and beautifully conveying both emotion and tone all the way through the novel. This is a game where everything "fits", which is a rare treat. Considering how rarely I do these VNs, and so often I've been disappointed by the lack of quality production, it's been a treat seeing just how polished this particular one has been.\n\nI -do- have one minor complaint though. Just one. The endings are gathered together in an unlocked grid for your perusal, however, that grid isn't clickable so you can't revisit them seperately. THAT is an annoyance, perhaps something that could be fixed, because it would be nice to revisit those endings (both good and bad) just out of curiosity, as well as being able to revisit areas of the story (there's a generous number of save slots as well as a quicksave option provided, so you can bookmark just about everywhere, thankfully).\n\nClosing thoughts...\nI don't do VN's. This might be the only review for a VN I ever write, which should give you an idea of how much of an impression it's left on me. It's been such a departure from the norm for VNs, and with it's horror theme and unique take on things. Mechanically, it's a path based VN, and I'm sure that's not going to be new for anyone, but the high production values, the original setting, the quality writing, all add up to a quality product.\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended - Especially to fans of Horror stories and Visual Novels\n\nWriter and columnist for Just Reviews, where you can get similar fine reading material.

Depending on your reading speed, this can be a short or long VN.  However, if you're expecting to be scared or terrified...don't look for a visual novel for that.  In my opinion, it was not scary in the slightest.  Someone with less of a tolerance to blood and such may say something different, it may just be me.  I will admit, there are some pretty unsettling, and very graphic descriptions of death.  The soundtrack adds to these scenes nicely.  Also, the cast itself is likeable in my opinion.  Don't expect to finish all the paths without hating or feeling something for someone though...they're written well.  Basically, the story itself has a nice combination of:  love, creepin' horror, loss, and a speck of betrayal..sort of.  Play to find out..!

I would say this is pretty standard intro for a lot of horror books/movies/(insert medium here). Obviously, it will turn out those legends are true and girls will experience them. What really grabbed my attention was its setting: aquarium. You don't see setting like this very often, to be honest this first time I have seen it.\n\nFrom my first impressions you can already see one big problem I have with this game: its intro. It is slow, kinda dull and cliche. Mayumi is this shy gril and Himeno is her polar oppostie, being loud, always in happy mood and curious. You know how that saying goes: "Curiosity killed the cat." There are so many options why they would go there, but they went with "One of the characters is curious so he/she will go there." And since Mayumi is your tipical shy girl, she has no choice but to go there too.\n\nThis is where my biggest problem ends. Once that amazing opening hits (see trailer for this game), it all gets better. And when Mayumi runs after ghost of her sister (this is not spoiler, it is mentioned in game description) is when it really starts.\n\nAs of right now, game has 4 true endings and 27 bad endings. Only when you have all 4 true endings, you will know the entire story. It is sometimes hard to follow but overall, there is nothing I could complain about (just a side note, people that are not native English speakers should keep their dictionary open as there are many words and phrases that your average english learner does not know). You should know by now that this game with choices. Make right choices and you will get all endings. There are two types of choices, blue and red. Blue have little to no impact on the game (with two exceptions) while red will either push the story forward or lead to bad ending. Almost all red choices are like this which makes the whole novel kinda straight forward. Now, I have only played two VN, first one being The Way We All Go. Both of them have choices, but TWWAG has so much more options, so much more routes and ways to get endings, here, you will either continue on or die.\n\nI think I should return to Mayumi. She, as already stated, is the main protagonist. But out of all characters, she is definitely the least interesting, at least for me. She starts as a shy girl, but as the story progresses, she turns into a character that acts as plot wants. "Oh, we want to introduce new character, Mayumi, go follow her" And this happens more than once. Again, she is not completely bland or flat as a pancake (hehehe), she is just not as interesting as let's say her sister, Himeno or Sayo.\n\nAs you play, you will experience these phenomena A.K.A. something that wants to kill you. Creators knew that their setting opens for a lot of creativity. Frop orca swimming around you to fish with human faces, all this is really fun to read enjoyable and creative. Couple that with great images and you have great horror VN. Of course, we can't forget music! Is the soundtrack as good as Bastion's, Undertale's or Transistor's? Not really. Is it good? You bet it is. There are some tracks that just serve as a way to fill the silence, there are some very repetitive songs (example would be track that starts playing when you are drowning) but there are also songs that just rock. Best example would be opening. I know I have been praising since the beggining of this review, but god. I love it so much. And that is not the only song I would listen to on repeat if I could (I couldn't find it anywhere ;-;). Really, out of all the tracks, maybe 3 are songs I would rather not listen to. Rest of the soundtrack is really good.\n\nI have not talked about art enough. This game looks amazing. From character sprites to CG pictures to backgrounds. Just scroll through the pictures or, again, watch the opening and you will see. However, there is one thing that bugs me. Himeno and her breasts. I have nothing against fanservice, but I don't want to see it in a game like this. There are some serious scenes with Himeno but her "plot" is too distracting. Again, nothing against fanservice, but there are people out there that dislike it and because of them I had to mention this.\n\nTo sum it up:\nPros+Great story\n+Characters\n+Art\n+Soundtrack\n+THE ♥♥♥♥ING OPENING\nCons-Unnecessary fan service\n-Dull intro\n-Choice making is rather straightforward\n\nFinal Verdict: 9/10\n\nEven though this game has flaws, its amazing art, soundtrack, enjoyable characters and story make them all almost nonexistent. Game this game if you have at least some interest in horror genre.","December 2, 2015","true","13.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The atmosphere is very unnerving (but cheery when it should be), I found my nerves going crazy throughout, I bawled, and I even got a basically yuri end. Looking forward to getting all the ends (though dreading a particular one, well, what it might be. I haven't read up on what the endings are or anything). I also must add that the story was really great. I know it only says I played for 1.3 hours. But that's Steam messing up. I put around 7 hours into my first ending.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of horror, and also fans of Corpse Party. it has a very similar feel. Though, this one is 100% a V/N, while the Corpse Party games (outside Anthology) have actual gameplay segments in them. And the main drawback is that there are no voices in this. Still, there's a lot of work with sound and visuals to create the right atmosphere. And it didn't feel empty at all without the voices. I would have liked voices for sure, but it doesn't need them.\n\nOne other drawback is that the bad ends are generally real easy to avoid. Well, from my experience on the route I took. It could be more difficult in the other paths. Either way, the Bad Ends are really great. Either very unnerving, or crushingly depressing. That "Bad End" image is very deceiving on what actaully goes on.\n\nGo for it! it's the perfect time of the year for something like this!","October 31, 2015","true","2.0"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampiricsLove/recommended/383460/","VampiricsLove","Heavenly Kitten","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampiricsLove/","168 products in account","Some Possible Spoilers:\n\nSound of Drop - fall into poison - is a magnificent horror/mystery visual novel that drags the reader into a dimensional rift within an Aquarium. You take the role of Nakanobe Mayumi who goes with her friend Tamagawa Himeno to the Manten Aquarium to learn about the many rumors of the place. Do to certain incidents that happen while there, Mayu ends up having to work her way through the altered Aquarium in order to save her best friend.\n\nThe story for the game is very well done and actually has some cultural beliefs that connect the altered/dimensional world to the real world. I won't go into too much detail but it is related to the Moon and portals. The story was well set up with the many choices. You have different colored choices, Red usually meaning that it will lead to a possible bad ending, and blue which are calming moments that give you a chance to breath and pick whatever you want without ruining your story. The choices vary through out the story. You will sometimes have a choice followed by another choice which actually works with your decision making choices during the different scenes. Then you may get some free time before your next choice to get the story and how the characters are feeling about what just happened. This gives the player a chance to calm down after an event and try to focus back on the story some more. There were actually very few, if any, grammer and spelling mistakes that I encountered (I can recall a few, but they did not really interfere with the story). The steam edition actually added more content to the story and reading the main story and then going to New Game + actually adds even more story that helps to complete more questions you may have had from the first playthrough. I actually think the addition was very well done and made for an even better experience.\n\nThe music choice is also very well done. The opening and ending songs for both the main and new game + are very good and add to the atmosphere. The music switches based on what is going on in the aquarium. The darker scenes have scarier, more heavily tones notes that emphasize something bad is approaching, while the calmer scenes have softer notes that bring some calm to the reader. The music greatly adds to the atmosphere so that the reader will be tensed up in the darker moments and be able to calm down and be ready for the next event when they are calming down with the softer sides.\n\nThere are only a few downsides to the game that lower the experience of the game. Even though the music is very well done, a few of the songs are a little repetative and can get a little tiring to listen to. Even these songs add to the atmosphere, but they can also make you not want to listen to them anymore. I would take my headphones off every so often because I got a little tired of hearing them. Now, granted, I am a slow reader so I tend to hear a song loop many times compared to most readers. So it may not actually bother most people.\n\nAnother downside is the choices. The story is pretty linear with the choices. Usually only one choice is right and if you dont pick that, then you will get a bad ending. There are very few choices that actually change the course of the ending, and most of those are mid to late game. However, some of the endings you get are actually not that bad. A couple are repeats (even though they are considered different ending), and can just be a bit dull to deal with. Yet, there are quite a few that are adding to the story. I think getting some of the bad endings actually adds to the story and makes it a bit better. The New game + choices actually lead to a slightly better ending, but there are not as many new choices in the add on content compaired to the main story. That also deters some people in the long run. You may be playing and getting choices but then suddenly have no choice for 30 minutes. They are using that time usually to tell the story, which is well needed, but it changes your pattern and thought process. You were picking choicese every 5-10 minutes and then suddenly you are given a choice 30 -45 minutes later.\n\nIn the long run, this Visual Novel is probably one of the best VN's I've read in a while and I would highly recommend it. The soundtrack is suppose to be added some time in the future and I would gladly say you pick that up if you enjoy the music in the game. There may not be voice acting, but as a Sound Novel, the atmosphere is well done with the music and no VA. I think the VA would hinder the game a little. The story and the idea of the altered aquarium actually make the game well worth reading and enjoyable. If you are into the horror/mystery visual novels, I would recommend. Note: there is blood and there is horror, so be advised that you may not want to let younger viewers or even yourself read this if you do not like these kinds of things.\n\nHighly Recommended 9.0/10","November 16, 2015","true","16.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Historically, I've found there's a certain vibe to visual novel horror that isn't really present in anything else, with a gloomy, oppressive type of tone.\n\nWell, I admit the actual horror scenes, when examined by themselves, do a pretty good job of creating that type of atmosphere.  It relies on evoking the type of horror you would actually experience in encountering certain dangerous creatures in real life, and it combines it with a warped physical reality as described by a dazed, confused narrator, such that everything feels like being stuck in a nightmare come to life.\n\nBut this all stopped mattering to me pretty quickly because the rest of the story is so stupid.\n\nUsually I'm willing to let a story get away with a lot of things as long as it can play up its emotions well enough.  In the case of this particular story, though, it's just too distracting.  Every time you make the correct series of lucky guesses necessary to survive a particular dangerous event, you are rewarded with an expositional plot dump.  That probably would have done well to play up the story's mystery aspects if this was a different story, but in this case, there IS no mystery.  It's ghosts, okay?  Everything's caused by ghosts.  If anything weird happens, a ghost did it.  There's no joy to be had in analyzing the story when it's already established that there's no logic or consistency to any of it.\n\nAgain, I'd probably even be okay with that as long as the emotions were played well enough, but it turns out the only emotion the story plays well is horror.  The characters are all one-note, only there to serve functional roles within the story (hero, villain, sidekick, damsel, etc.) rather than be actual people.  The story attempts to create drama, but it does it mainly by explaining that the characters are upset about what's happening, rather than demonstrating why they would be.\n\nWhy is this teenage schoolgirl crying after her close friend went running off down the hallway to chase something?  Why is this enough to end their friendship?  How am I supposed to believe that they're close friends in the first place if this is enough to end their friendship, and I have no other information about their relationship other than one girl tends to get pushed around by the other as it is? Why is the other schoolgirl now trying to save a ghost from being killed when the ghost is already dead, and the schoolgirl herself acknowledges that this doesn't make any sense?  Why is there a load-bearing boss in this non-action story!? I don't know, but you better get worked up about it, because the story tension is depending on it!  Drama!!\n\nThe horror is good, but even if the horror is good, it's hard to really be affected by it if you don't relate to the characters.  And it's hard to get from one horror scene to the next if, in between each one, you have to rapidly click through several minutes of dialogue while going "uuuugghhhh".\n\nAnd I would probably even forgive all that if the choice system was better.  Sometimes I like visual novels just because your choices lead to branching paths, and I like carving my own personal path through the story, whether it's bad or not.  That's why I was intrigued when I read that this game has lots of choices, and four different main endings.\n\nHere's how the choice system works.  When you're presented with a choice, the choices are either all blue, or they are all red.  If they are all blue, the choices don't mean anything--it arbitrarily changes the next few lines of dialogue, then the story continues as usual.  If the choices are all red, what the game is actually asking you is "Do you want to die horribly right now, or do you want the story to continue?"  And it's not always clear which option is which.\n\nThere ARE branching paths, but this is one of those visual novels where you are not even given the option to pursue certain paths until you've already achieved other endings.  And since you're specifically locked into only one ending for your first playthrough, it kind of diminishes the joy of pursuing your own path.\n\nSo, final point, I think you should only consider getting this if you can overlook all the negative points I listed above.  If you ignore the overarching story and just focus on the horror scenes, you might get something out of it.  Or if you like reading poorly written stories for whatever reason, it's got that going for it, too.  Otherwise, just go get a better horror story.  The first two episodes of Higurashi are out on Steam now, if you haven't already tried them.","December 27, 2015","false","3.9"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

And as a fan of horror in any medium it is a real treat to see a visual novel create such a great horror atmosphere. I couldn’t wait to try each decision I’d left before and find the new ending, especially as there were several choices that threw me off completely (examining the cutlass-fish anyone?). And these bad endings are horrifying at times, the detail in which these are written is utterly amazing and more than once I was staring at the screen in awe at how brutal and disturbing these could get, and a couple of times it’s difficult to tell if this is a bad ending or if Miyu can turn it around at the last minute. That’s story-writing I am very envious of. I had not originally purchased the soundtrack but after a hundred percenting the game I immediately grabbed it at the end of the sale as the music is just beautiful, especially that amazing opening song.\n\nHowever the biggest thing that really pushed Sound of Drop above and beyond for me personally is its replay-ability. I imagine there are at least one or two people like me who make a save at every choice and when the story is over, go back to each individual choice and make the opposite decision. I very rarely replay visual novels from the beginning unless there’s a section I didn’t save for, as I can usually get all the endings/achievements just by going back to the decisions saved. But after doing that thoroughly there were several bad endings and a couple of true endings I didn’t have yet, no matter what I did. So I finally started from the beginning again and not only was I treated to a completely new opening scene that developed one character and introduced another, but this actually changed a few aspects of the main plotline, it was an amazing experience.\n\nOverall a fantastic visual novel and just a fantastic game in general, I can only hope to find more horror games that are this creative in their execution.","January 7","true","8.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Since I know very little Japanese, having the game in English was a dream come true. This version manages to be even better than the original.\n\nSound of Drop -fall into poison- (AKA Shizuku no Oto -fall into poison-) is an expanded remake of the original 2014 game. The game has been rebuilt from the ground up in the Ren'Py engine with dual-language settings. In addition to this, a large amount of new content was added to the game, which almost doubles the playtime. The bonus routes that are added to this version of the game not only expand on characters that were a bit lacking in characterization in the original, but adds a new character to the story seamlessly. One of the 7 new endings added for -fall into poison- ended up being my favorite ending in the game.\n\nThe story is a horror/mystery set in an aquarium that has spawned numerous urban legends. While the story expects you to take a lot on faith early on, almost everything is explained in one or more of the "True Endings" to the story. While some of the characters are lacking on development in the original route, they are expanded on enough in the new scenario to make everyone an interesting character to learn about.\n\nTo get the most out of this game, be prepared for at least 2-3 full playthroughs and using save files to find the extra endings. While many of the "Bad Endings" will mostly interest horror and/or gore fans, it's nearly essential to get all of the "True Endings" to get the full story of the game. The new content requires completing one of the original True Endings to unlock (sort of like a New Game+ bonus), so you'll want to start a new game as soon as you finish an ending.\n\nBottom line: If you're someone who is interested in a horror/mystery visual novel focused on a mostly-female cast, you'll want to get this game.","November 1, 2015","true","11.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

As a result this is the first VN I cant recommend (and I tend to recommend even cheap not good ones). Why is that soo you may ask?\n\nBecause of the game design. I cant say good word about it 30 endings with 4 true endings? That sounds better than it looks. Game is linear and your choices doesn't really matter in the end everything goes the same way. Also you will be blocked (dont ask me why) from achieving all stories in first playthrough. Your decisions will either let you progress through Manten Aquarium or you will be dead instantly. Soo forget about any mysteries hiding behind the corner. They doesn't exist. Everything is served straight on a plate. If you want to see what I expect from horror routes for lower price I recommend playing "Notch - The Innocent LunA".\n\nIts really a shame for "Sound of Drop" since I liked the characters and endings. Especially Mayu and Himeno had really beautiful friendship. I generally didnt dislike anyone but things lacked depth. Everyone has a motive and story is slowly revealing with second playthrough. Aqua scenes are great with deep depressing ambients and horror is settled up with inteligence and logic it is believable!

Junior High students Mayumi and Himeno head there, Himeno insisting that they should investigate these legends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeream/recommended/383460/","zeream","Zeream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeream/","160 products in account","I came into this VN expecting two things: Some kind of quality comparable to previous Sekai Project titles (I’m riding the Sekai Project hype train) and a mazelike, non-linear experience (since that is what it advertised itself as).  Unfortunately, the game failed to deliver on these fronts.  I sparingly read visual novels, however, and doubtless that influences this review.  For those of you who are in the tl;dr crowd, just skip to the last paragraph.  All spoilers in this review are properly tagged, so it can be read spoiler free.\n\n\nWhat I got was a very linear experience.  Keep in mind, when I say linear I mean linear in the context of the visual novel genre.  Linear games are not a problem; the issue here is that the game poses itself as one that offers you a lot of choice when the nature of the game is simply just giving you the ILLUSION of choice.  It’s false advertising on the game’s part.  Why?\n\nThere are three types of choices in this game.  The first kind of choice are the ones with red boxes which show you “do or die” situations, so they are all are meaningful towards your progression through the game.  Failing to choose the right decision leads to a bad end, and all bad ends are short and immediate.  Indeed, the game is in no way a maze.  You could easily get through purely by quicksaving at every red choice.  The second kind of choice are one with blue boxes which are non-branching and thus not meaningful.  The final kind of choice are the very rare, seen only once per playthrough single blue box choices, one with an actual lasting affect game that determines which “true end” you receive.  The true endings are not meaningful since they are only determined by this single choice, even if its midway through the game.  The late game true endings are less meaningful and interesting because of their redundancy of the first set of the early game endings.  In the early game, this choice seems like an inconsequential afterthought by Mayumi when it’s presented as well.  The choice doesn't even branch how the story ends up playing out, besides tone of the epilogue and maybe a few paragraphs of text immediately after the choice.  So yeah, the game is very linear on the early side of things.  On the late game side, the game becomes slightly less linear by branching in two general directions, one towards the early game true endings and the other towards the late game true endings.\n\nSince the game is linear, most of the choices will not feel meaningful towards the outcome of the plot, just your ability to progress through it.  This makes the choice system itself feel underwhelming, to the point where the choices simply become puzzles, traps to avoid death.  Unfortunately, most of the choices are dominated by simple common sense or logic, so they are very easy puzzles.  You will likely never hesitate to make a single choice throughout the entire game, and you probably won’t make any wrong ones either.  However, there is one choice in the beginning that is completely counterintuitive (It’s the choice with the jellyfish).  I’m pretty sure it’s just there to troll you, making you think twice about using common sense in the future, despite common sense being your best tool in the game.  Getting a wrong choice will not reward you beyond the process of elimination, because…\n\nThe plot is your run of the mill haunted house story, this time set in an aquarium.  It features one genuine satisfying “WTF” moment Soya’s death, a few minor plot inconsistencies, and copious amounts of fridge logic and hand waves.  The game isn't scary, there are no jumpscares; the most it manages is an intermittent, mildly creepy or cringy mood.  The deaths are not entertaining; most of them end up being cookie cutter.  It’s REALLY hurt since the main character's Mayumi’s reactions to death (especially her own) are very underwhelming.  For a horror visual novel it’s surprisingly light on the drama, and this was the most disappointing aspect of the game for me.  If anything, it attempts to be more of a heart-string tugger than most horror stories end up being, but falls flat on its face some the characters are so utterly boring and their words and intentions so hollow.\n\nIn order to unlock the game past 50% some unintuitive 4th wall breaking is required.  Unfortunately that is one of the worse staples of the VN genre in my strong opinion.  Its presence here was not hinted at in the slightest.  I had to take off additional points for this dubious mechanic.\n\nBy the time I 100%ed the game, one thing was clear to me.  None of the endings felt unique; they are all just different ways to essentially get the same ending.  The endings that require more work don’t feel more rewarding than the ones that require less work either because the people you “save” are not likeable characters and the ways and reasons you save them feel utterly redundant for their longer length.  As such, completing the game felt significantly underwhelming and like a large waste of time.  Once you get one ending you’ve gotten them all, unless you want those miniscule deviations in plot or if you want the game to explain everything to you.  Unfortunately, the explanation isn’t worth the time it takes to read it, as pretty much all it did (for me at least) was confirm all the guesswork I had up until that point, and I’m willing to bet others would have similar experiences.\n\nI found it particularly annoying that, when trying to collect the bad endings, you can’t skip the two ending animations, so you’ll be waiting for 20 seconds staring at a blank imagery waiting to farm the next bad ending.\n\nThe music score is mediocre and loops relatively quickly.  Its not bad though, and succeeds in capturing the mood at various points in the game.\n\nI have to take away points on CG-plot inconsistencies, especially since they were pretty numerous.  If you want some examples, take a look at my game screenshots, quite a few of them are pointing them out.  The quality checking really could have been more diligent.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that there were parts of the game that felt very poorly conveyed.  Some moments ideas seem way too abstract, and on others characters' identities seem to blur as they talk to themselves or the void or soliloque, WHILE being abstract.  Its not clear whether this was entirely intentional or due to translation errors, and the lack of clarity or resolution in this respect distracts from the mood of the game.  You're stuck sitting there trying to figure out what in the world was said half the time.  The game also seems to want you to play the later half in a particular order, as not doing so will seriously confuse you.\n\nOn the bright side, Mari-chan is cute!  I did want to save her, for at least the first ending / playthrough.  Game did a good job of convincing you to do that, at least.  Unfortunately, most of the other characters (including Mayumi) end up being uninteresting and two dimensional, likely a byproduct of the distinct lack of drama and conflict resolution in this novel.  Not to mention, the repeated attempts and similar endings pretty much trashed any interest I had in repeatedly saving Mari.\n\nIn conclusion, Poison Drop is towards the worse end of mediocrity.  It doesn’t measure up to my expected quality standards from Sekai Project, and it also drew me in with false expectations of a non-linear, maze-like experience.  It’s likely a Halloween cash grab by Sekai Project, actually.  As such, I cannot recommend it beyond being a cheap, light-horror way to spend Halloween and the end of Fall.","November 9, 2015","false","19.5"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","40","12","30","3","3"

For me there was nothing I really found engaging about it, nothing really kept me interested. What ultimately made me purchase this was the horror tag, but unfortunately It wan not really scary. Sure the main character was always in danger, but that isn't scary. It was gory at times, but again, to me that does not frighten. To be fair, there was a handful of moments that were frightening, but unfortunately far too few.\n\nAnother thing was the story. No spoilers, but when the mystery is reveled, it is really rather bad. The reason all the bad things are happening to our character is as cliche as they come. The characters themselves are pretty good. There personality is generic but while not immediate apparent, the motivations of all of them are good. All of the characters have reasons for being there and they all do things that make sense in there own internal stories.\n\nIn the end tho, this game is flat and boring as they come.","December 9, 2015","false","7.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

I think it's because you are not allowed to get attached to any character and instantly have to mark them off for dead, which is not really fun in my sense. You either, choose to die yourself, let somebody die, find somebody and let them die again. So same story really repeating itself really.

So no pressure: I went in with zero expectations.\n\nFirst off: artwork and CG scenes are beautifully rendered. The characters each have a distinct personality and everyone's there for a reason. While there are some cliches, they don't detract from the story. There's a hefty number of endings, all of which are worth seeing (well... maybe aside from some of the bad ones...). I have a newfound interest in aquariums now.\n\nThe themes addressed are fairly deep, and the true endings do resonate with you for a while. You might find yourself pondering certain concepts Mayu (the protagonist) is exposed to. Horror elements in the game don't come from jump scares (thankfully), and the use of colours throughout the storytelling helps unify the visual novel as a whole.\n\nTl;dr: GET!

The characters are not animated, but they do move around, as does the camera, to display actions being taken in the narrative. The use of effects, both sound and visual, helps add to the scares and atmosphere. There is no voice acting, but the music is good, particularly the addictive opening.\nThe characters seem to be pretty well written, and while the designs aren't going to blow your socks off, they are well drawn and look appropriate for their roles.

However, after some consideration, i decided to bought this one, because\n1. I like Horror stories\n2. I like aquariums\n3. Seems to be not focused on romance\n\nGotta say, it was not dissapoint, the story while a bit cheesy at times is interesting, and multiple endings make me want to keep replaying it until i got everything, there are about 31 endings in total, with 4 true endings. The art is quite detailed, combined with good use of music, it's able to create a creepy atmosphere when it need to. too bad it's not voiced though.\n\nPros :\n- Great story i don't consider myself to be someone who easily moved, but man, the feels.\n- Likeable main character\n- Many interesting side characters\n- GREAT Soundtrack, fall in love the first time i listen to the opening, and that particular ending.\n- Great art\n- Many choices\n- Great atmosphere\n\nMiddle :\n+/- Kinda short, i was able to get first true ending within 3 hour, even less after that because i skip the part that i have read before. Still, getting all the endings take quite some times, and by the time i got every ending, i feel that the length is right, it's not too long and not too short, for some reason it just feel.. Right\n\nCons :\n- Not Voiced\n- Sometimes a bit confusing\n\nOverral i recommend this vn for everyone who like horror story or visual novel. 10/10","November 8, 2015","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But I feel that so far the game warrants a positive recommendation to visual novel/horror fans.\nThe production values are very good. The characters are not animated, but they do move around, as does the camera, to display actions being taken in the narrative. The use of effects, both sound and visual, helps add to the scares and atmosphere. There is no voice acting, but the music is good, particularly the addictive opening.\nThe characters seem to be pretty well written, and while the designs aren't going to blow your socks off, they are well drawn and look appropriate for their roles. The setting is interesting, and so far the plot is intriguing enough to want to play more and the horror is pretty well doen in my opinion.\nI should mention, as you might have been told, that there are a lot of bad ends in the game. Though I am not not sure how much gore is really in the game, but the one bad end I got so far (of which there are many) was fairly brutual in it's description, but not very graphic. Hopefully the other endings are more graphic.\n","November 1, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I usually try to avoid that kind of thing, as I rarely get help with these games and prefer to only get what I can myself. The gameplay for these games basically is the story because the game has its own intuition and decides what actions are actually prudent via a semi-linear story (ie you second guess the game, not necessarly use IRL common sense or knowledge the game provides you with). This game kept me on my toes with horrific events that fit the theme. I cannot go into details on this because any details would be spoilers. All I can say is think Higurashi (watched the anime, but did not play that VN) but at an aquarium instead of a town.","February 15","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

HOLY FUDGE...... First five mintues spent dying in ways I couldn't even imagine (ripped apart, stabbed, etc...) . Overall this is a diecision making game so be preapred to do a thing no gamer should (Being serious). Nice thing is the gore (and trust me plenty of that!), art (Facial expressions and some movenment),  Fishies, and most of all the story. Characters can be likable (For me it's Mayu cause she dealing with some freaking crazy stuff) Controls are pretty easy it's called spam quick save and prepare your body for death. Otherwise soundtrack is OK and can if your really in the game can send tingles up your spine or make you feel happy (For a matter of three seconds to the Fit hits the shan)  I feel its a great game overall but if you not into horrible death's, Ghosts?, and other fricking nightmare making day wreckers this is not your game friend.

It goes together very well. The story is alright and the characters are befitting of the story too, but there are some non-sensical moments where the story plays on the fact that its non-sensical. Kind of weird, but at the same time that is what gives the story its charm.\n\nThere is one thing that both bugs and doesn't bug me: If you only go through it once, you will miss out on knowing the actual story behind all the events. The novel/game requires you go go through it twice in order to know all the events of the story, and by extension the true events of the 'true' endings. In a sense, it rewards those who read till the end, but if you only go through it once, you miss major events and plot points.\n\nStill, I would recommend this visual novel.

So no pressure: I went in with zero expectations.\n\nFirst off: artwork and CG scenes are beautifully rendered. The characters each have a distinct personality and everyone's there for a reason. While there are some cliches, they don't detract from the story. There's a hefty number of endings, all of which are worth seeing (well... maybe aside from some of the bad ones...). I have a newfound interest in aquariums now.\n\nThe themes addressed are fairly deep, and the true endings do resonate with you for a while. You might find yourself pondering certain concepts Mayu (the protagonist) is exposed to. Horror elements in the game don't come from jump scares (thankfully), and the use of colours throughout the storytelling helps unify the visual novel as a whole.\n\nTl;dr: GET! Worth playing and replaying until you've seen all the endings. Manten Aquarium definitely has a special place in my heart, too.","February 20","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
