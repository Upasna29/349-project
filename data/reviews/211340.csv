"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortemaster/recommended/211340/","fortemaster","Fiona, Queen of Machines","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fortemaster/","448 products in account","A dating sim for the young witch in all of us! Like Harry Potter, with a liberal dose of anime and without all that uptight britishness that makes me kinda hate it. Also a liberal dose of progressive gender and sexuality, which is always a fun one, and racial politics too. (That said, I was a *little* offput by the 'marriage is kind of a year-long thing' plot point, even if it makes sense in context...)\n\nDon't be fooled - this is mostly a dating/life sim. There are 'dungeons', but they're more obtuse and annoying puzzle roadblocks I could honestly do without. Persona 3/4 this ain't. Also, you have to be a girl, though you have a wide range of options for your love life, three straight and two gay, and a wide variety of other non-romance events. Romance is legitimate and well-handled - the opposite of Bioware's efforts. (Oh god, flashbacks to terrible competing english VN Planet Stronghold DDDDDDD:)\n\nOverall, takes itself just seriously enough not to be a broad parody, but not so much that it's hard to get into or requires heavy investment. (The default character's name is Mary Sue, if that tells you anything.) Highly recommended for anyone who's even a little into the idea, and even better, sequels are on the way!\n\nSadly, the best character is unromanceable, despite her obviously being open to the idea of a relationship with a student and a lady. :C Oh, Professor Potsdam, how I long for some private lessons with you... ;o; (maybe she's married? i dunno.)","November 8, 2013","true","6.4"," 83 of 98 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","83","98","0","0"

(You know, so long as you're a guy who is fine with playing a female character trying to get a date in a very LGBT-friendly setting.)\n\nThe character creator is fun, if a bit limited.  The sheer fact that it has a character creator at all is a big advantage this game has, and I have no idea why it's not a more popular idea.  Most accessories, however, have to be purchased in-game, and have stats associated with them, so if you wanted to wear glasses, you can, but they cost money, and if you wore some stupid-looking giant star glasses, you might get more of the stats you want... Cat paws look dumb, but they give massive boosts to (nature-related) Green magic, so it's sometimes that old World of Warcraft "killer clownsuit" choice between aesthetics and effectiveness.\n\nChoices are very diverse, although some aspects of your past aren't up for your choosing.  Most of the time, however, your choices amount to which classes you go to, and which stats you therefore train, with the occasional tests that demand specific skills.\n\nThe dungeons are perhaps the best part of the game, and are presented in a Wizardry-style, but where your spells are tested as a puzzle.  Each school of magic gives different methods of solving a given puzzle, so practically any choice of magic schools will be correct if you just have enough of it to get a diverse enough set of spells.\n\nThat said, there are some dissapointments.  It feels like the dungeon sections could have been expanded so much more, and the game would have been better for it.  The spells you collect are like puzzle pieces begging for some clever puzzle they can unlock, and the first few dungeons you go through feel like a warm-up for some truly challenging puzzle to come... and then the game says that you completed them all, and yay for your happy ending.  I felt a bit robbed of a chance to have some big climactic moments where that huge book full of spells could save the day, and instead just got a final exam where they checked the size of my book and said, yeah, you passed.","March 16, 2015","true","88.5"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","47","51","6","0"

I loved that I could go for one of my female roommates. :)\n- You get to customize your characters hair, eyes, and body type. This makes the protagonist feel more "yours."\n- The characters get put in absolutely hilarious situations.\n- Your choices in the plot certainly have a big impact and can lead you to many different routes, so replay value is deifnitely there.\n- The "magical school" setting is unique compared to some other dating sims.\n\nCons:\n- I felt like the personality traits were worthless. I saw no point in getting points in the "cute/weird/smart" categories because they don't seem to affect anything.\n- The magical tests never seem to get interesting/complex.\n- Art was subpar. The characters all look similar in the face and their appearance doesn't change a whole lot. It starts to feel monotonous.\n- There are huuuuge chunks of dialogue/description with no pictures sometimes, which gets annoying. With such a cool, magical setting, I would expect to actually see some of the magic going on. Unfortunately, you never do. This is what makes this dating sim way less enjoyable than ones like Dandelion, which go above and beyond with scenery and drawing out pivotal scenes. The only time Magical Diary shows you a picture to go with a scene is if you kiss somebody, which for me, was only twice.\n\nOverall: If you tend to like visual novels or dating sims, this one is worth a try, especially if you value the choice to either date men or women. However, don't expect this game to knock your socks off. It's entertaining, but somewhat underwhelming at times.","November 23, 2014","true","4.9"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","0"

I just wish the game was just a little more interactive, especially with the creation of your character (you can choose appearance, but no other characteristics).

Although the size of the eyes still bugged me sometimes, but thats something you can easily forget about while playing the game - its written in a way that makes it rather easy to focus your attention on the plot.\nIts kind of sad there were almost no cgs, but i guess thats the price for being able to customize your character in a couple of ways.\nOh, and if youre not too much into this whole stat raising thing, there are cheats that you can use to swiftly progress through it by maxing all your stats instantly. Makes life much easier when youre replaying the game many times to get all the endings.\nI definitely recommend this game, especially if you like cute GxG romances, as this game has two such routes.","January 6","true","23.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

But hardly has any time to develop on themas the campaign is so brutally short. Your first run through will last about 4 hours in real time. Which is far too little, regardless of the somewhat limited replayability. I would expect a minimum of 20+ hours and even then I might have een disappointed.\n\nThe game has multiple endings but after your first there's very little drive to go back and replay every ending unless you saved periodically after every somewhat major choice in the game. Otherwise you'll be forced to drudge through the first 30 minutes of gameplay you've completed already. That's not fun at all.\n\nAnother complaint would be that the game has no 'real ' endings. Every ending leaves you expecting something else to happen and you're left with little resolution. Which isn't a satisfying end for me. I would have een much happier if the game ran through the full 4 years, instead of the first year, which was mostly spent building relationships with characters and finding your click.\n\nIn conculsion, the game has an interesting and grippign storyline with many relatable, interesting characters. But falls flat because of the brutally short campaign, no sense of resolution in any ending and relatively high price point. If the game is on a 50% off or more sale I would recommend picking it up for a short but sweet story. Other than that, I see no reason to pick this game up for £10.99, when there are much longer and more gripping visual novels available.","July 7, 2014","false","9.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","2"

Don't get me wrong, your relationships will be a major plot point however you also need to manage your friendship with your two roommates as well as the role you play in school. You might be treasurer and have to help plan events, or be part of a club designed to seek revenge on others.\n\nOf course, your love interest still does play a point in the game. You can date either a male or female or even a Professor if you go down the right path. What makes this game great is how it developes the relationships. Your character is not swept off her feet instantly but the first cute face. Each relationship feels realistic and is built on many layers. You even get quite a bit of back story to each character you date (save for one bonus Steam added relationship which is a secret bonus one added to the Steam version of the game). But don't think you can't get dumped at any time by your SO. Pick the wrong options and it's back to the single life.\n\nOf course since there's magic in the game and you're going to school, you do take exams where you use a few spells and common sense to solve the problems in a dungeon that is a screen by screen styled place (aka it's not a free roaming thing but you move from one screen to the next like a hidden object game without the hidden objects).\n\nIt's really nice to have your own PC (playable character) have internal conflict as well with her family so you get some character developement as well.\n\nOverall, I've put over 10 hours into a graphic novel game and I read fast. There are so many paths to go down and things to do differently in each run through that the replay value is super high. It's a very interesting game which incorporates a lot of different aspects into one wonderful game.","April 10, 2014","true","11.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

I liked it and it kept me going on. At some point it began to be fun and the plot caught me wanting to know more each moment. It was like reading a good book - makes You come back and read more just to satisfy curiosity.\n\nExcept here You get to make the choices.\n\nWhich brings us to more serious part of game.

Magical Diary, unlike other games, contains bonus features including a chance to cast spells, use some point of strategy in dungeons, and with surprise events every other *game* week!\n\nAlthough the puzzles aren't very difficult, they grow in level and, in the end, have many more 'dead' ends and less 'good' ends. Five merits are for basic answers whilst ten for greater ones, driving you to complete it in as many ways possible! The numerous amount of save slots allows 'stop', 'replay, 'stop', 'replay.\n\nA downpoint in the game is that there are only female characters but this game is very loose in sexual orientation so you could be heterosexual, homosexual, or asexual. In fact, you can totally ignore the romance part of the game (though it's a gigantic, huge, overshadowing punch).\n\nThe art is beautiful and expressions are neat, character customization is limited but not non-existent (which, in many otome games, feature pre-generated avatars). The subplot is light but there and you could enjoy the ways the plot unravels.\n\nHowever, despite all its positive points, I have many negative rulings for this game too;\n-> Short (For a game so expensive, the game is entirely too short! Of course, you could spend hours characterizing, spam save, and decide who your beloved one would be, but most of it is useless informative events [which deepens the plot but doesn't really relate to anything in the story] and reading the dialogue.]\n\n-> Impossibilities {Anyone ever recorded has never won the title of 'President' because it simply isn't possible. The plot relies a bit on your treasurer or non-treasurer standing and, as of thus, you must be either one or the other. You have a good selection of characters but it's impossible if you do a simple slip-up!)\n\n-> Non-expansive Magic System (Personally, I think it would be much better if they include a broader and stronger magical interface into the system! It would be great to actually practice this rare function more and try a more....mystical setting. Heavily reliant on Harry Potter (if thinking of Professor Hiero...something and the 'Wildseeds'.)\n\n-----\n\nHacks -> Go to options.

Its my first graphic novel type game at least from what I can remember and I have not played any others yet although I do want to in the future. What I am getting at here is that I really have nothing to compare this game to so my review may seem a bit to positive but oh well I think it deserves it. So this game is about a girl that was told that she was a witch and that she could, if she chose to, go to a magical school. She then goes to class meets people and lives her one year at the school in which the game ends with here dating someone or the other multiple endings.. or you might just screw up and get expelled before school finishes. The game did really well opening up the magical world to you without hammering you down with uneeded explanation at the start. You basically learn about the world as you go along. The relationships for the most part felt real and were not to over the top romantic which allows you to get much more involved with the characters I find. The game had a lot of story lines and a lot of your choices effected how that storyline would go. I have replayed this game many times and still havn't uncovered every storyline part. I know this because I still have not unlocked all the achievements yet. So the game can easily be replayed many times. The game is also pretty short so that also makes it easier to replay.\n\nUmm there not really any huge issues with the game, i guess after replaying the game a few times you will get a lot of scenes that you have seen before, especially at the start, but you can quickly skip over those if you want to. I remember reading some one elses review saying that the game was to short and that it was only one year of school. I dont know if this is an issue for me really because if the game was longer than I think the replay value would probably lower so good job developers with making the game short. Maybe the developers can make a second game. Thats always a possibility I guess.","August 9, 2014","true","26.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game literally changed my tastes in gaming.\n\nAs for the game itself; you play as a 16 year old witch (you can only play as a female) who starts her first year at a magic school where you learn and practice spells, perform school duties and form relationships with your classmates... and teachers if you're that unlucky... :p\n\nIt's just a shame the game ends after a few hours with so many spells and items I didn't get to use...

The world has a deep plot with lots of lore, multipul playthroughs only have some content overlap with each other. This is my absolute favorite game of this genre; all of the characters are believable, decisions actually matter and frequently have consequences one way or the other, and the exams are fun! There are a large number of different ways to beat the exams which is very satisfying so you can focus on different types of magic.\n\nGraphics can put some people off with their Anime-ish style but they add a certain spice to the world that I think adds to the magical nature of the world. They are not fantastic but they are by no means awful and there are quite a few options in terms of hair style and color and eye shape and color.

This is a pretty specific genre, but surprisingly there's some competition.\n\nAfter playing through Magical Diary I cannot give it a recommendation. Compared to games like Academagia and Long Live the Queen, Magical Diary is has a story that's too linear, gameplay that's too simplistic, and RPG mechanics that are too shallow. It might be good for younger audiences, but for those who enjoy the challenge of life simulators in a graphic novel RPG experience - this game just isn't going to cut it.\n\nI hope that the developer produces a second year sequel to this title and addresses these concerns. If so, I'll come back and edit this review with a qualified recommendation.

It's a little like finding a bizarre Harry Potter fanfiction Choose Your Own Adventure while drunk: at first you feel like you shouldn't be enjoying the experience, but after a while you stop caring.\n\nThe game handles itself with a refreshing lack of gravity (the main character's default name is "Mary Sue," for gods' sakes), but some of the plotlines and relationships are remarkably smart, well-written affairs. In example, there's a character I will refer to as NotSnape. My character, a girl in her late teens, accidentally got married to NotSnape. I nearly bailed on the game right there, but what followed was a downright heartfelt relationship that did not shy away from how bloody creepy it was.\n\nSome use of walkthroughs/guides is more or less required to see a lot of the content, but given the genre, I can't really hold that against it. I recommend this game, but don't pay too much for it; if it's on sale, give it a go.

The child in me adored the animae feel to it so I purchased it.\nAs much as i enjoy the games style. It gives you an option just about all games like this have. Choice. The power of choice in a game it strong, which I believe is why The Stanly Parable did so well, but I suppose thats off topic. While the game gives you choice, the slightest move in the begining might give you the exact same ending, even if what you do after is completely different. There are few endings that surround 4 characters in the story. That is a good amount but the game, being more of a story, is hard. You can aim for a specific character ending but chances are you will be kicked out ahead of time, or be with the person you didn't want.\nMy main complaint is the tests. The game throws tests at you, and the game itself doesn't teach you what you need to be taught and many people (like myself) will not read the lessons and skip through them. The game gives you "Study Time" but doesn't give you the ability to study. I have played the game, possible 10 times and have been kicked out 9 times. I finished once by using a website to ensure I get the Damien ending.\nThe demerits you recieve in the begining, which you CAN'T PREVENT is what slowly brings me down. Plus, giving them in groups of five, while when you recieve 15 your kicked out, come on!\nI know my complaint list is long, but I just ramble and go into detail.\nThis game is incredibly long and is a game you can play over and over reaching different endings.\n\nI very muchh enjoyed this game.","January 11, 2014","true","19.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are 5 different kinds of magic to learn as well as 5 characters to win over. And all of them are interesting!

I found the characters to be mostly interesting, and was surprised at how much depth some of them have. I picked out the guy I wanted to get my magical paws on right away, and it took me the majority of the school year to break him down. Perseverance was key though, eventually I got that kiss!\n\nThe great thing about Magical Diary is the amount of possibilities I turned down in order to go down this route. This game has a lot of replayability as in the first two weeks of game time alone there are at least three distinctive massive plot-lines available if the right options are chosen.\n\nThe RPG elements come from learning the right subjects, and unlocking spells to use in dungeons. Dungeons are used as tests, and there are 5 or 6 of them in the game. They're not very impressive, but without them the lessons you learn and items you buy would be a pretty needless.\n\nOverall, Magical Diary is a game that shouldn't be taken to seriously.

My feelings are mixed about the game, but you will probably get a good laugh out of it anyways. I've put a lot of hours into this game and replayed it a bunch and have enjoyed it each time.\n\nPROS\nVariety of choices about spells, activities, which person you'd like to romance, etc. Many of the cut scenes and events also give you options.\n\nReplayability. The game isn't very long, but becuase there are so many choices, you may find yourself wanting to play again.. just to see what it is that you could do differently.\n\nLight sense of humor, sort of funny, a little bit disturbing, and even a little bit romantic.\n\nYou're not bound to date only boys. You can date women, or nobody at all. It doesn't define what relationships are right and wrong, and so that's sort of nice to see. Hell, you're not really pressured to have a relationship at all.\n\nThe font is easy to read. Which is good, because that's mostly what you'll be doing in this game.\n\nYou can basically marry Snape. So, there's that.\n\nCONS\nThe game IS short. If you don't find interest in the game and don't feel like replaying it, then it may not be worth your money for the few game play hours that you'll get out of it.\n\nYou can only play as a female. Character customization is also very limited.\n\nThe artwork is pretty crude. The characters look like they've all been done in Paint.\n\nThe music. This is probably one of the things I hated most about this game. There were only four (I think) different songs/tunes that play depending on the event or what you're doing, and they loop. There really wasn't a lot of creativity or anything put into that I feel, and it gets on your nerves after awhile.\n\nYou'll need to play the game multiple times to unlock all of the different achievements, if that's your thing. So again, if you're not interested, that may suck if you're a completionist. There is also a pretty large room for error if you haven't researched/played the game before, so it can be frustrating if you're trying to reach a certain goal.\n\nNo voice overs. Nothing is voiced in this game, so you'll have to read everything. I mean, it is a point and click simulator so a lot of reading and clicking is expected, but voices may have helped give a little bit of life to the characters.\n\nNo "new game+". It would be nice to be able to keep your money or some of your clothing items when you go to start a new game. It would help make things a bit easier, and speed up additional playthroughs.","January 16, 2014","true","14.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The creators did not take chances that you would not make the decisions you were expected to, and made alternate endings to agree with that.\n\nThe different storylines that can be followed are very well-written, and have made this 21-year-old girl squeal out loud. Characters are unpredictable, like actual people. They still act in ways that agree with their personality, but it's not always the way you'd think a game character should act.\n\nOptions, at times, are quite limited. However, I do find it understandable, as a game can't quite be as fulfilling as real life. If the creators of this game made an extended edition or some DLC for the rest of the school years, I'd buy it in an instant.","July 3, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This one has significantly fewer skills and world changing decisions, but has more personality than LLtQ. You create your own character from scratch and decide what to do in school, with your life etc, without the constant pressure that LLtQ had. I liked it very much but I have some concerns. First, I would really like to see a story based on a male protagonist. I liked this story and playing as a female character, but I missed the choice of gender. Second, if the gender choice is not possible, why not extent the story at least? I mean, right when I felt the story started getting awesome, the game finished. We saw only the first year in the Magic School. Why not extending it to see two, or three years in the school. That would be awesome.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game to fans of japanese school simulation games and visual novels. I don't know if the price is the best for what the game has to offer. It has huge replayability for sure, but the short extent of the story diminishes the quality in my eyes.","February 17, 2014","true","3.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, this game is considerably more forgiving and it is much easier to complete the game. There is some replay value in that there are multiple mini-routes, often romantic, you can follow depending upon what conversation choices you make. Sadly, like LLTQ, once you have played through it once or twice having to go through the same dialogues early on just to get to the later ones that get you on different routes gets a little tiring. Unless of course you don't care about such things and are perfectly fine with one or two playthroughs.\n\nIn short, it is an easier Long Live the Queen that trades the brutal violence and murderous intrigue for a (mostly) benign school life experience with some romance possibilities.

You play as 'Mary Sue', a young wildseed (read: mudblood) witch who has entered a boarding school for magical folk to learn the craft.\n\nMy initial impression of Magical Diary is not favourable. On the upside the anime-style character is very customizable, some of the background artwork is nice, and there seem to be a number of different narrative paths that you may take through the game with hints at mysteries to uncover, making for good replay value. On the downside much of the character art is amateurish, and the game does little to hide its fanfiction roots. Because of this you wind up with a narrative that is chock-full of cliches, making the story very predictable. The strategic gameplay also feels overwhelmed at times by the sheer amount of narrative exposition there is to read. It took me almost 30 minutes to get through 2 weeks' worth of decisions, when it should have taken 5 minutes at most.\n\nBottom Line? This game will not appeal to everyone. If you enjoy reading Harry Potter fanfiction and love visual novel style games you may enjoy playing Magical Diary.

At its best the Genre is Character Development/Discovery condensed. Saddly most studios use that excuse to release sub-par titles with little to no imagination and even less effort, and while Magical Diary may not lack the latter, it definetly lacks imagination.\n\n\nThe Characters: Copy Paste. You've seen it before, you'll see it again. A forgettable parade of cliches.\n\nThe Choices: Linear in all but appearance. Choose in whoose pants you want to get and stick with it. This would be less of a problem if not for....\n\nGameplay and Story integration:  The Holy Grail of all dating sims.    Does it feel like you are playing the game, or like you are gaming the system?  Magical Diary takes the sledgehammer approach to subtlety and even those unafiliated with the Genre will see any character twist coming for miles.\nExcept for the magic system, which I had alluded to earlier. Along with the usual fair of stats, as the game progresses you  get to learn a selection of different colour coded magics. In theory you get to use these to influence the events arround you. In practice, the rather ethereal description, limited application of every spell, and utter lack of audio-visual cues, I often felt thrown back into the era of Adventure games, where every puzzle was solved by liberaly rubbing anything in your inventory on anything in the environment.\nThat's where the game steps in, and limits just what you can try via an MP-Gauge, or simply time constraint.\n\n\nI'm sure after a second or third playthrough I could have gotten the results I wanted, but the entirely predictable characters, and obvious right/wrong choice system left me with little desire to play again.\n\n\nAll in all Magical Diary is rather tragic: A novel idea that lacks any kind of substance to back it up.","January 3, 2015","false","3.0"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

As a Visual Novel it's a bit marginal too, but not thumbs down territory.\n\nFirstly, this game NEEDS a guide. If you don't have the correct spells at the correct times you WILL FAIL the exam. While the game tells you that you don't need to ALL the magical colors IT IS LYING.\nTHAT being said, you don't need all the colors up all the way, as a matter of fact 90% of the spells you get are completely useless. After certain time periods you can just stop leveling colors, like level Black Magic to 30 then just never put anything more into it.\nThis is not a good design. It is not a design that gives you freedom. All of the puzzle have VERY SPECIFIC solutions and only just a few have optional ways to solve them.\n\nThe VN part. All of the male romance choices are annoying. The one you probably want "William" isn't getable due to him having a misogyny crisis. (He's bi, but he's sworn off women...

The world built has many interesting facets and feels pretty real, though I would take issue with some of the school's required events. Perhaps the best part of Magical Diary's approach to topics is how it never makes them central to the story but rather says this is how things are and just be a decent person. Though also note I'm a HUGE sucker for visual novels and so I might be a little biased, whenever sales come around this title is crazy cheap so nab it if you're interested!","January 8, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Magical Diary is a mix between a Visual Novel, a Role-Playing, a Dating and a Puzzle game. You play (or are) a female student in a Magic School. You can customise your player character pretty well, especially considering it is a Visual Novel, mostly. You can choose a general body type, hair type, hair colour, eye colour, skin colour, etcetera.\n\nYour days are partly spend studying a type of Magic (or activity) which you choose at the start of each week and specific events (influenced by choices and responses). On the weekend you have a variation of activities to pick from. This cycle basically repeats through out the game. Every few weeks there'll be a test, which consist of a first person puzzle you'll have to get through with the Magic (or skills) you've learned. In other words you're living through a normal school life... well, normal, except for the Magic, Demons, etcetera. This of course... includes dating! There's a few different candidates, both male and female to choose from: each with their own story and choices within that story. So there's replay value there if that's high on the priority list.\n\nIt took me roughly six hours to finish my first play-through. Second lasted about four.

Also the items you can buy at the Mall will be visibaly seen on the character. For example if you buy her a star wand your avatar will hold a starwand if equiped. That also gives a nice variety of appearances.\n\nOne Walkthrough takes about 6-7 hours which is quite the medium length of a visual Novel.\nIf you are planing on getting all achievements it takes about 12 hours as much as i have playtime (probably a bit less if you are english native speaking or just a faster reader, i might as well was a few minutes of those afk)\nWith all the achievements you have NOT finished all the routes but only 2-3 from the huge amount of routes possible.\n\nExtra achievements for all routes like in most dating sim novels would have been nice.. (for example "unlock the romantic ending of Ellen, Damien and so on) [in case a developer reads this: Could it be possible to create those achievements?    *holding a puppy next to the developers which looks with wide open and extremely cute eyes to the mod/dev*\n\n\nI realy enjoyed reading this Novel and do not regret getting it, although i got it in a humble bundle a while ago i would have payed full price for it if i hadn't already gotten it.

LLtQ is newer and probably a bit more polished, but MD is my favorite because of its superior depth and PC character customization options.\n\nThe premise is you're a female freshman student at a magical school in northeast USA.  The Harry Potter analogy is pretty close but I actually like this American/anime/fantasy influenced spin on it even more.  Most of the game is character interactions between PC character and her roommates, teachers, and other students with different story outcomes depending on your dialog choices.\n\nThere's also the character progression aspect that comes from managing which attributes to raise ('smart/strong/cute/weird' as well as 'white/black/red/green/blue' magics) with your limited class time while managing 'stress' meter levels.  Raising magical schools give you access to more spells which are used to pass period exams.  Raising 'cute'/'weird' alters how other characters react to you and unlocks new dialog options.\n\nThe periodic exams are essentially puzzle mini-games that are pretty fun/engaging and also provide a nice diversion psychological break that help keep the other game elements fresh for players.\n\nIf you make the right choices you can pursue romance path with one of several different characters, both male and female.  This was probably my single favorite aspect of the game, and the one that contributes most to its replay value, as the character interactions in the romances are very cute (I *was* a little sad that there seems to be no romance path for Pastel, however- Kappa).\n\nFrom HanakoGames company website 'We do not think of ourselves as just "games for girls", although we are definitely girl-friendly. Anyone who likes fantasy and adventure, anime games, or just cute stuff is more than welcome here.'\n\nI'm middle-aged male so I think they've succeeded in making their games have pretty broad appeal beyond just girls.  I have zero problems playing as a female PC character, which I know isn't the case for all males.\n\nMy only slight complaint about these games is that there can be a lot of trial and error involved to getting an outcome you're satisfied with (I knew right away which romance path I wanted to pursue) and in my opinion save/reloading or restarting when you mess up is not only unfun but also breaks the story immersion.\n\nI guess the idea is that a lot of the fun should come from this trial and error and letting the player try to guess/explore outcomes based on story clues.  For many players this is probably what happens, but personally it just ends up being more frustrating than fun.\n\nFor me best experience came when playing along with walkthrough from devs site[spikycaterpillar.com] which in addition to walkthrough gives some detailed explanations of game mechanics which are absent from in-game help.  This allowed me to steer the story exactly the way I wanted without the hassle of 'savescumming'.\n\nAny road, it's really good to know their are developers creating really innovative, high-quality experiences geared towards female gamers (and better still when their excellent design/writing gives them appeal beyond their primary audience such that I can enjoy them too).","March 12, 2015","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first I thought this was a Harry Potter rip-off (the magic, the Snape-like professor, the merits/point system), but this game had me pleasantly surprised. I'm now obsessed. So many storylines are going on at the same time, and it seems like everytime I start or load a new file I find several new events & endings. I love the magic exams- they are challenging and provide variety to the regular stat-building classes routine. I'm not wowed by the romantic options (the only character I liked turned into a crazy ♥♥♥ psycho, yet I can't hate the developer for making such a creative twist) but I would still recommend this to any otome game fan.

There are many paths through the story, and a subsequent playthrough is quick and reveals a surprising amout of new material when different options or a different love interest is chosen. The writing is well done and amusing, and the choices you make actually impact the game in significant ways.

Another issue I had was the choices. It felt very linier and it didn't seem like my decisions mattered at all. The dungeons are neat but usually over in about 2 minutes because they are so easy. A lot of the magic spells are the same as well which really made me sad one spell existed in 3 different trees but with a different name and that happened with quite a few of them.

Even though it is an otome game, it has enough silliness, and quirks that will appeal to any gender. Through learning magic(or not, if deciding to skip class), you can change how you approach the dungeons you face periodically in the story, leading to a new appeal through each playthrough. As for the routes, every character is very unique, and you may find yourself in twists you did not expect. While there are a select few with more to do than others, I personally found every route to have something worth playing, and added to...well, the magic of Magical Diary.\nFor those wanting a silly story, with the occasional plot twist, I definitely reccommend this game to you.

Even though it is an otome game, it has enough silliness, and quirks that will appeal to any gender. Through learning magic(or not, if deciding to skip class), you can change how you approach the dungeons you face periodically in the story, leading to a new appeal through each playthrough. As for the routes, every character is very unique, and you may find yourself in twists you did not expect. While there are a select few with more to do than others, I personally found every route to have something worth playing, and added to...well, the magic of Magical Diary.\nFor those wanting a silly story, with the occasional plot twist, I definitely reccommend this game to you. And especially to lovers of otome games.","June 20, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Anything from Mary Sue to Enrique Fluttershy is possible.\n\nThroughout the game you will be making choices that will affect the outcome of the game.

I won't spend a penny on this one." While the first was true - this game is utterly stupid - the second one was not, I bought the game and I - wonder, oh wonder! - do not regret.\n\nThis game is basicly a dating simulation. Even though there are dungeons and fighting, this part of the game is merely little and not the main focus. The main focus is dating someone, falling in love, having fun with him or her.\nYou have the choice of several dateable characters, as far as I can recognize them, there are three straight and two homosexual choices.\nStill you may ask: why did I buy it? To be honest, I had a lot of fun, since this game balances out being a parody, while not being too ironic, so you still take it serious.\nI did not expect having fun, I expected the money going to waste. But I was wrong.\n\nAlthough, if you want to buy it, I hope that you enjoy reading more than direclty playing.

It was a great learning tool. We would really like to see another Chapter in the series. Anything new really. This seemed to be "Horse Hall" is there "Snake", or "Butterfly" in the series? Is there one for male characters where you could be "Wolves" Falcons" or "Toads"?  This was an amazing game!  We would love to see more games by this maker, or even some just made in this style.","January 12, 2015","true","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A small single-man production company producing a VN with a long running time (one run is about seven hours) with dozens of choices, all which effect other choices, with dozens of ways to both fail and succeed that utterly change how the story plays out each time you go through. I've clocked at least eight ways the game can end so far, with a hundred smaller details mixed into those endings.\n\nExperience is marred by none of the characters having truly standout personalities, and a visual style that will be hit-or-miss for you.\n\nBut given the price, the one man production team, and the overall quality of the product its still a hit more than a miss. And one of the few true VN's with branching paths that English-only speakers can get their hands on.","July 31, 2012","true","21.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After classes start up though, the game gets really fun. Learning new spells and finding applications for them is fun. Mostly you will use them to get out of dungeons, which function as exams, but you will also be able to use many of them to unlock unique options in random events, which is an awesome touch. Speaking of random events, there are enough things that happen each week to make the game interesting, and a surprising amount of variety in the situations you can find yourself in. I didn't do a second playthrough for a long time, but it's worth it for some different endings. None of the endings are really "the good ending". They're all a bit open-ended, and all have something about them that you'll have to leave behind. The story is enjoyable; definitely interesting and unique enough to keep you engaged. I like to think that this takes place in some female-oriented alternate dimension of harry potter, what with the whole magical wizard school and professor Grabineer*cough*snape*cough*. But it has enough of its own story elements to set it apart from the universe that it drew much of its inspiration from. The main character is a little bit generic, but you're given enough of your own choices to project your own character onto her. My only real gripe is that you're character alludes to parents and a backstory at several points, but her parents are mostly left blank. Although I do have this theory that the school directors hypnotized them with magic to think that you just went off to boarding school... I mean, it really makes sense, and feels like it's hinted at a couple of times. I digress. The game is great to play with a friend for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, as well as for a couple of serious playthroughs alone. I think all of my friends have played at least halfway through this game when we got bored, and I've played it multiple times, so I feel I definitely got my money's worth.\n\nIn short, best game ever 10/10. Buy it or yur a ♥♥♥♥♥.","September 28, 2014","true","25.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While this game has a feel that it was made for younger and more feminine gamers (not sure if that was the developer's intention) it is a game worth looking at if you like visual novels with an unusual twist.\n\nWhat I didn't like:\nThe setting is a little too childish.\nSome of the story arcs rely a little too much on specific choices of class on specific days.\nAs a teenage girl you can romance the male teacher..? What in the..?\nNot enough variety in the endings.\nEnding is rather abrupt.\n\nWhat I did like:\nThe lack of pervy images. Too many games of this style rely on that.\nLots of potential for following on the story.\nThe dungeons are not complicated, but can be a challenge to succeed.\nWhat magic you learn affects the challenge dungeons and what solutions you can use.\nFive different romances (that I know of) along with several side stories means there is a surprising amount of replay value.\n\nOverall:\nVery refreshing to see a western-made game of this style that doesn't rely on pervy imagery. While there is some pervy stuff its handled subtly and in ways that doesn't feel like its there for the sake of it. The story and the various paths available are genuinely interesting and the actual gameplay of the dungeons is done well enough to enjoy but simply. I'd play a sequel if they did one!\n\nOverall: 7.5/10","May 13, 2015","true","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Almost all the exams almost require you to either know the layout of the map which is hidden until you reveal it or learn one of a few specific spells and realise how to use them.\nThis can make it very hard to not get expelled on your first playthrough.\n\nIf you think you can still enjoy it after reading these issues then you will probably like the game.

On top of the usual choice-conciquence system, there is an rpg style leveling system for several magical spell groups, and a rudimentary equipment system that makes changes to your character's image frame.\n\nGraphically, the game is mostly what one expects from visual novels. Static backgrounds of middling quality, and somewhat more animated frames for characters. The main character can be customized, and you can go shopping for equipment that further affects the visuals. The anime style artwork is unpolished, but its easy enough to get over. The music and sounds are fine. Of course, in visual novels the most important part of design is the story. In Magical Diary, the story is okay. Its nothing exceptional, but there are several branches available allowing for at least several unique playthroughs.\n\nTechnically, the game is fine. The RPG elements work well for the environment its in, the menus do the trick, and overall the system is simple enough to handle easily.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty okay. Its nothing exceptional, but if you enjoy a storytelling experience with a higher degree of interactivity than the usual visual novel, you will probably like Magical Diary.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please have a look at my other reviews.","January 2, 2014","true","15.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

In this game, you make your own choices and the game tailors itself around your past decisions as you play. While the romance choice characters are not all that special, I do think they could have integrated more boys your character's age into the game. But that's just because I wanted more variety that suits my needs. Anyways, it's a pretty cool visual novel that sorta plays like Harry Potter, so if you're into huting for love and studying magic, then this game is for you.","January 1, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/recommended/211340/","timbeon","Timber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/","122 products in account","A fun, well-written visual novel with RPG elements whose cutesy anime artwork and setup as an affectionate parody of self-insert Harry Potter fanfiction disguise its depth. There are 6 possible love interests, and each one has multiple possible endings instead of just the usual good/bad. It's not a very long game, but the sheer amount of ways scenes can play out and events you can trigger encourages multiple playthroughs. The writing is great and likes to play with your expectations of both visual novels and teen fantasy romance, and the main characters and many of the minor characters are all really fleshed out. The weakest part of the game is the RPG elements -gaining skill points in certain schools of magic and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles, which are pretty open-ended and have multiple different solutions- but the puzzles are interesting enough and offer an occasional change of pace. All-in-all, this is a game that I feel was created by someone loves visual novels and wants to see the genre become more than what it is, and really wants to see more girl-oriented games out there that aren't pieces of crap. If you like visual novels, lighthearted fantasy stories, romance games, or if you're still waiting for that Hogwarts letter, I recommend you look into this game.","July 12, 2013","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Conceptually interesting, but undercooked. I feel like it should've had an exam every two weeks or so to keep things interesting. It feels like a waste to have all these spells and only a few instances to use them. That being said, I beat the whole game only ever using Push Object, Teleport Other, Truesight and Detect Scent. More puzzles might have forced me to use other spells, which again, is my main problem with the game. As it is, I'd give it a recommend with a BUT. It is very short (I finished in three hours), but based on the achievements it seems there's a lot of stuff I didn't come across based on my choices. Still, I feel like they could have done a lot more with plot threads that I WAS a part of, and the game ended just as things were starting to get good in terms of character development. This game could've been twice as long and I think it would've been better off for it.\n\nSo, if the mechanics sound interesting and you don't mind replaying some content in order to see all the stuff then give it a whirl. The few puzzles there are were enjoyable, and I'd be interested to go back and play a different way to see how the solutions work out using other types of magic (I maxed blue and breezed through everything.

Set in a school where magic users learn the art of spell casting, it is pretty clear to see that the title gets its inspiration from the popular Harry Potter books. Players simulate the life of a freshman going through their first year at the prestigious Iris Academy where you’ll have to contend with strict teachers, managing your studies and attracting a date for the end of year prom. As a macho man, I’m clearly not the target audience for this game, but I decided to give it a go after enjoying Hanako Games’ 2012 offering Long Live the Queen. If you are interested in trying out either title they can be purchased from Valve’s Steam service or directly from Hanako’s website.\n\nGameplay wise Magical Diary feels like the adventure books some of you may have played during your youth. You’ll read some story until something noteworthy occurs. When a key event happens you’ll be asked to choose what to do from a list of multiple-choice answers. What response you select has an impact on the plot making it branch off in a different narrative path, which certainly adds replay value for anyone curious enough to explore all of the game’s content. Will you be a model student and ace your exams or will you skive classes and potentially risk expulsion? When it comes to dating will you try to court one of the school’s bachelors or do as I did and break the heart of a blue skinned senior by pursuing a lesbian relationship with my bookish roommate instead?\n\nAs a student of Iris Academy you’ll be expected to complete various exams, but these are nothing like the coursework or written tests you would find in a regular school. Examinations in Magical Diary consist of being teleported into a dungeon and using your spell-casting prowess to find a way out. In order to succeed you’ll be expected to solve brainteasers using the enchantments you learn in class. In one dungeon for example you can escape by destroying a wall that is obstructing the exit with a well-placed fireball. Whether you know how to cast a fireball or not however depends on if you have completed enough lessons in red magic (I wonder if Ryu from Street Fighter attended those classes.)\n\nThis all means that planning out your curriculum plays a big part in Magical Diary. At the start of each week you have to decide what types of magic you wish to learn. Blue magic focuses on transformations, green magic allows users to manipulate nature, white magic is used for communicating with spirits whilst pink magic makes you appreciate musicals and say the word fabulous in a camp voice (okay I made that last one up.) Don’t go overboard with the cramming though as stress can have a detrimental effect on your character. Thankfully it is possible to combat the effects of mental fatigue by unwinding at the mall on weekends.\n\nMuch like an examiner grading a student’s homework, the time has come for me to rate this game. My final score is four stars out of five as I enjoyed Magical Diary a little more than Long Live the Queen (which I awarded a three.) Visually speaking Long Live the Queen is the more polished of the two, but I enjoyed replaying Magical Diary more as it has a more fleshed out cast of characters. I also liked how your decisions have a greater impact on the plot as opposed to Long Live the Queen’s more linear storytelling. As far as visual novels go Magical Diary isn’t top of the class, but it’s a solid B student all the same. Strong writing, light romance elements and a story told through a girl’s perspective make this an ideal purchase for female players who may be frustrated that there aren’t enough games on the market catering to their tastes.\n\nOriginally published at http://theotakujudge.com/","January 25, 2015","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/recommended/211340/","timbeon","Timber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/","122 products in account","A fun, well-written visual novel with RPG elements whose cutesy anime artwork and setup as an affectionate parody of self-insert Harry Potter fanfiction disguise its depth. There are 6 possible love interests, and each one has multiple possible endings instead of just the usual good/bad. It's not a very long game, but the sheer amount of ways scenes can play out and events you can trigger encourages multiple playthroughs. The writing is great and likes to play with your expectations of both visual novels and teen fantasy romance, and the main characters and many of the minor characters are all really fleshed out. The weakest part of the game is the RPG elements -gaining skill points in certain schools of magic and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles, which are pretty open-ended and have multiple different solutions- but the puzzles are interesting enough and offer an occasional change of pace. All-in-all, this is a game that I feel was created by someone loves visual novels and wants to see the genre become more than what it is, and really wants to see more girl-oriented games out there that aren't pieces of crap. If you like visual novels, lighthearted fantasy stories, romance games, or if you're still waiting for that Hogwarts letter, I recommend you look into this game.","July 12, 2013","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the first thing you should know, if Visual Novels aren't your kinda thing, this isn't the game for you, if it is, then hop on board for this review train.\n\nThis game goes for the tried and tested formula of "Girl or boy transfers to new school. Romance or craziness ensues"\nThe school? A place of magic.\nThe romance? Well that depends.\nYou can date a changeling (yes, date the changeling), A middle aged professor, either of your two female room mates, their family, or several other individuals I didn't have the time to explore yet.\nOr if you're that kind of person, you can date none of them. I spent the time to avoid getting close with anyone because  I'm more of a thing with wings kinda girl I guess (Date the changeling~)\n\nGo through several different tests throughout the year that force you to use the magic you learned in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: Teleporting others, teleporting others, teleporting others, and asking to kiss people. Aside from one specific spell that is a tad overpowered... there is multiple solutions to every single test, and assuming you think critically, you will not fail any test so long as you keep up on your studies.\n\nI give this game a solid seal of approval from me: Came for the cards, stayed for the teleport other.

It's like someone re-made Harry Potter with a ton of anime troupes thrown in. It works well as a dating sim, but to be honest I didn't realise it had so much dating content until I looked at the wiki. The first play through my character was just a pretty normal student, with a small part of the story taken up by a love interest. Second play through I engaged with the romance options a bit more. The exam mini games are really fun and you can be really creative with spells you have learned. If I were to cirtasise the game at all, somtimes the out come of your actions aren't at all what you would expect (for example, I was given the option to ask my love interest why he had been ignoring me for 3 weeks, instead of phrasing it like that my character got really mad at them) and some of the relaltionships are a bit messed up and would be really unhealthy in real life, so if you want to pursue some romance options you have to take the out of line behavior with a pinch of salt.

That said, I really enjoy it.  There are a lot of different storylines to follow, depending on the choices you make in the game.  If you aren't interested in reading (because it IS a visual novel) and don't like choose-your-own-adventure style games, you won't enjoy this.\n\nFor those who do, it's an entertaining story about your character, a 16 year old girl who discovers she is magical and goes off to magic boarding school.  Yes, it's Harry Potter-esque, but it has a pretty rich history.  Five colors of magic, lots of rules and oaths...  I was really interested in the storyline.  There are multiple endings, depending on whether you make certain choices.  You can romance several characters, both male and female, or befriend them - each offering more pieces of the entire story.  You'll have to play through several times to find out what truly happens with various situations in the game.\n\nIt's not as deep as Hanako's other game (Long Live the Queen - which I also enjoy), but I loved the characters.

I completed the game in one sitting - getting together with the sumptious demon Damien. Its a nice middle ground of somewhat challenging but not riddiculously so - but every choice has an effect! I found the exams most difficult because you needed certain spells to be able to pass them, sure there's more than one way to pass but its hard to get your spell level high enough for the spells you need. I have now played it again, getting together with Virginia's prankster brother Donald who I actually think is a much better guy than Damien but Damien's storyline is much more unexpected and interesting.

If you've ever wanted to feel like Harry Potter, this is definitely the game for you. There are many interesting characters to befriend and some whom you can take the relationship a little farther. The magical spell you learn come in handy for many different situations, which is probably the best feature in this game. The school setting is mostly fantastic, as you get to plan your whole schoolyear and there are numerous fun school events. I also really dug my female character! It's hard sometimes to feel for someone of the opposite sex, but I was caught up in all her struggles and triumphs.\n\nI do have a couple gripes about this game. For one, there are only two teachers, so the school feels very empty in that regard. My biggest complaint is the ending or maybe just the lack of a central story. I was very entertained throughout the game, but when I got to the end, it didn't feel like I actually accomplished much. I got some good grades, I got a boyfriend, and I got some merits. But that was about it. I was hoping the merit system would lead to something, but it was barely used. When the school year ended, I was fully expecting to continue my skill learnging the next year and be able to do something great with them, but the game just ended. There just didn't seem to be much of a point to all I did that year. There is a sequel on the way, so maybe my complaints will be remedied when the story continues. Here's hoping it will.\n\nI really did enjoy the game for the most part so I'll give it\n\n8/10","July 17, 2014","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tests that you go through are held in dungeons and progressively get more challenging, but not so challenging that you would need outside help from a website to help you figure it out.

Magical Diary? Female protagonist? Visual novel? When am I gonna get time in my busy schedule of playing hardcore action rpgs to try this game out?\n\nWell one day I told myself to give every game in my library a shot for 10 mins. So I play the game. Why not make a cute girl while I'm at it? There is decent amount of character customization. I'm happy with my character and I start the game. Bleah,  this is a lot like Harry Potter, unoriginal much?...  - 10 min later - This game is a lot like Harry Potter, this is amazing!\n\nYou got your unique characters, magical holidays and traditions, spells to learn and use in challenges, secrets to unlock, you can follow your own path, the people you befriend help you later on, and the people you cross will remember you for it, balance your magical school work with occasions to make trouble. The story was amazing, cliche? Maybe. Fun and involving? Definitely. You can avoid interactions you do not want, of course there are unskipable events in the game, but I never felt I was being forced on a specific path at any point while playing. There are funny moments, romantic moments and tragic ones, my first ending was... unhappy to put it mildly, it made me stop playing so I can curl up on the bed and be drenched in sadness (I am a 24 year old male).\n\nMy only problems with this game are:\n- the lack of teachers in Iris Academy, there are 2 people... that's it! No nurse, no janitor, no groundskeeper, no porter, no lunch lady, no coach, just 2 teachers. One of them apparently is the headmistress/ janitor/ doctor/ night watchman/ school councilor AND teaches 3 classes, as far as I can tell said 3 classes happen at the same time.\n- the game is kinda pricey for it's length, buy it on a sale\n- because of the multiple endings there can be no direct sequel to this title, but there will be a another game with a parallel story in the same setting.\n\nTL;DR Great fantasy visual novel, its few problems don't get in the way of enjoying the game.","June 29, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Go to class, go study, go sleep or go to gym. Plenty of events show up where you can make additional decisions, some with quite interesting results. You decide which magic disciplines you will improve at, each having their own strengths. Some magic spells might be more useful than others for certain challenges you'll face.\n\nYou'll interact with the other students around school, where some try to be interesting or just mysterious. There's some highlights in the conversations, and some lines are loaded with sexual innuendo, especially when taken out of context. Which is, likely, very much so the intention of the author.\n\nSo far the game's amused me and it's easy to go play for a few hours nonstop just advancing the story and thinking of what your next step will be.

It is also a type of game where girls who like the idea of a well thought out plot and characters (despite how mary-sue and stereotypical they can be) is still fun to play.\n\nThe game gives you the impression that you get to play through all 3 years that the Academy offers to the students when really you only play the Freshman year. Also, you only have 3 possible people you can end up with dating wise in the storyline. As this can be a downside to the game, it is still fun to enjoy regardless. Also, you can only be a female in this game. You do not have the option to be a male.\n\nI personally like how depending how you play the game depends on what happens in the story as well as the exams that you do in the school's dungeons. The type of game where your decision affects what happens has always been a favourite of mine. When it comes to the dungeons, I like how I actually had to think about what I was doing and try and figure out what was the best option to pass the exam. Especially when it came to the exam where you had to go neck and neck with a fellow student to pass the exam. With that exam in particular, I would save the game before hand, and keep playing it until I won because it proved to be so challenging.\n\nAll in all, I really love the game and would love it if others gave it a try too.","January 27, 2013","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Magical Diary? Female protagonist? Visual novel? When am I gonna get time in my busy schedule of playing hardcore action rpgs to try this game out?\n\nWell one day I told myself to give every game in my library a shot for 10 mins. So I play the game. Why not make a cute girl while I'm at it? There is decent amount of character customization. I'm happy with my character and I start the game. Bleah,  this is a lot like Harry Potter, unoriginal much?...  - 10 min later - This game is a lot like Harry Potter, this is amazing!\n\nYou got your unique characters, magical holidays and traditions, spells to learn and use in challenges, secrets to unlock, you can follow your own path, the people you befriend help you later on, and the people you cross will remember you for it, balance your magical school work with occasions to make trouble. The story was amazing, cliche? Maybe. Fun and involving? Definitely. You can avoid interactions you do not want, of course there are unskipable events in the game, but I never felt I was being forced on a specific path at any point while playing. There are funny moments, romantic moments and tragic ones, my first ending was... unhappy to put it mildly, it made me stop playing so I can curl up on the bed and be drenched in sadness (I am a 24 year old male).\n\nMy only problems with this game are:\n- the lack of teachers in Iris Academy, there are 2 people... that's it! No nurse, no janitor, no groundskeeper, no porter, no lunch lady, no coach, just 2 teachers. One of them apparently is the headmistress/ janitor/ doctor/ night watchman/ school councilor AND teaches 3 classes, as far as I can tell said 3 classes happen at the same time.\n- the game is kinda pricey for it's length, buy it on a sale\n- because of the multiple endings there can be no direct sequel to this title, but there will be a another game with a parallel story in the same setting.\n\nTL;DR Great fantasy visual novel, its few problems don't get in the way of enjoying the game.","June 29, 2014","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are actually a lot of story permutations so there is a lot to see if you chase the different endings.  The most interesting part of the game might be the dungeon-crawler style magical tests that drop you off in a dungeon and call on you to use the spells you've learned in class to get out of the dungeon.  This is mostly puzzle-solving versus combat and it's a welcome change from the typical RPG.  I was happy with the way my first game turned out but a playthrough is only a couple of hours long so at $15, the price might be a bit steep unless you're the type that can replay visual novels multiple times.   Wait for a sale on this one.","May 18, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a game called Magical Diary.\nIs there a diary in the game? Yes. Is there magic? Yes. Is the diary a Magical Diary? ...no, actually. I guess the author needed a title and Magical Diary was just as generic as they could get.\nI mean, you can read the diary. Maybe it writes itself or something, but it doesn't do anything special aside from that, if it is the case. It just tells you what you already know. It's useful to see what happened if you haven't played the game in a while, for sure.\nBut yeah, despite the incredibly generic title, the also somewhat generic art style (you know, the type of art that middle-school girls and boys draw when they want to draw manga characters (actually, the settings aren't bad, just the character portraits, but there's like 10 settings in total...)) the story is actually pretty unique.\nIt doesn't really pander, it isn't light, there are routes that simply don't have a good end, no matter how hard you try, just because that's how they SHOULD be. It doesn't indulge a teenage girl's fantasy of going to a magical school (well, to some extent. It isn't a perfect world.)\nYou would expect "Magical Diary" to be some wet fantasy like Twilight, but it has its moments where little choices have a bigger impact.\n\nAlso, this isn't just a straight up visual novel. It IS a game, it DOES have puzzles, and while short, it can be a challenge.\nYou CAN lose. Heck, I survived, but I didn't feel like I had a "good" route, aside from being a fairly adept sorceress by the end.\n\nGet this game. If you like visual novels, get this game. If you like those old interactive stories that you rarely see anymore, get this game.\n\nIf you don't wanna spend 15 bucks or whatever it costs in your country, wait for a sale. I doubt you'll be disappointed if you've liked a VN before.","April 7, 2014","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was also pleasant to see a game universe that defaults to Spivak pronouns (!) and doesn't make a big deal about queer relations.","April 26, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can shape your own path, your own life. On my first playthrough I decided to let things unfold without really trying. I decided to trust my instincts and I thought the game was shallow, empty, predictive...\nOh how WRONG I was. I though for sure this game was "pretty little lady perfect love story" and I found myself in a pretty dire and serious situation. Just "being good girl" and "Acting with kindness and love" will actually kill you.\nOn my second playthough, I changed only one answer... and got a whole new story. As soon as you make a choice, including which classes to take or not to take, you unlock new possibilities... and lose some. In this game's world, a witch's word is taken literaly, seriously. If you ask something you will be forever bound by those words. I was unsure at first about this facet of the game. It was on my fourth playthrough that I finally realised the actual depth of the game.\n\nNot only can we shape our story, but we can also change the way the game plays. We can change the way every character sees us. We can change the game's world to its very core. And that is something I love. If you think this game is Linear, you simply did not try the other answers. Just so you know, there is 4 ways to unlock the "Soul nibble" (5 if you count the rescue scene) and over a dozen to remove it completly from the game. You have many choice, use them wisely... or do like me and mess everything up just for the giggles.\n\nLast word?

While I'd avoid longer games like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, Magical Diary is short enough that I can write off each decision as an aspect of my current playthrough rather than fretting over how it will affect my next umpteen hours.  The fact that the training schedule reminds me of Monster Rancher probably doesn't hurt either.  I might not have bothered with a pure visual novel, but this hybrid has convinced me that the genre is worth exploring.\n\nUnfortunately, the production values seem low.  While I'm guessing that a lack of animation is expected within the genre, I would have liked better-fitting accessory overlays and perhaps some more character frames.  There were also instances where environment descriptions seemed to conflict with the relatively bland pictures.  On the bright side, only the mismatched overlays really bothered me as my first character is stuck with glasses that don't fit in her yearbook picture.\n\nHonestly, it's an original English manga-styled choose-your-own-adventure book with middle school fantasy romance.

On the other hand after having finished the game twice, it seems that no matter what skills you choose to improve or how bad you do at the several “exams”, you can always finish the game, and it doesn’t change the story much.\n\nReplayability is compromised by having to re-read everything or almost everything, or risking missing some new original developments in the story when you’ve taken different decisions in the past. If you enable to option to fast-forward then the game will not stop on new text that you haven’t read in your previous playthrough.\n\nStill it was a nice experience the first time, so if you’re not afraid of reading relationships/magic stuff (the game, in retrospect, is more a visual novel than an RPG) and can get it on sale for cheap, then you could do worse than trying it.","January 10, 2014","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/recommended/211340/","timbeon","Timber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/","122 products in account","A fun, well-written visual novel with RPG elements whose cutesy anime artwork and setup as an affectionate parody of self-insert Harry Potter fanfiction disguise its depth. There are 6 possible love interests, and each one has multiple possible endings instead of just the usual good/bad. It's not a very long game, but the sheer amount of ways scenes can play out and events you can trigger encourages multiple playthroughs. The writing is great and likes to play with your expectations of both visual novels and teen fantasy romance, and the main characters and many of the minor characters are all really fleshed out. The weakest part of the game is the RPG elements -gaining skill points in certain schools of magic and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles, which are pretty open-ended and have multiple different solutions- but the puzzles are interesting enough and offer an occasional change of pace. All-in-all, this is a game that I feel was created by someone loves visual novels and wants to see the genre become more than what it is, and really wants to see more girl-oriented games out there that aren't pieces of crap. If you like visual novels, lighthearted fantasy stories, romance games, or if you're still waiting for that Hogwarts letter, I recommend you look into this game.","July 12, 2013","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Conceptually interesting, but undercooked. I feel like it should've had an exam every two weeks or so to keep things interesting. It feels like a waste to have all these spells and only a few instances to use them. That being said, I beat the whole game only ever using Push Object, Teleport Other, Truesight and Detect Scent. More puzzles might have forced me to use other spells, which again, is my main problem with the game. As it is, I'd give it a recommend with a BUT. It is very short (I finished in three hours), but based on the achievements it seems there's a lot of stuff I didn't come across based on my choices. Still, I feel like they could have done a lot more with plot threads that I WAS a part of, and the game ended just as things were starting to get good in terms of character development. This game could've been twice as long and I think it would've been better off for it.\n\nSo, if the mechanics sound interesting and you don't mind replaying some content in order to see all the stuff then give it a whirl. The few puzzles there are were enjoyable, and I'd be interested to go back and play a different way to see how the solutions work out using other types of magic (I maxed blue and breezed through everything.

It has tremendous replay value, due to numerous story paths. The game allows you to create a female main character, with few anime style options. It proceeds to drops you into a one year stint as a freshman student in a magical academy. During this time, you interact with various characters, almost all of which can become love interests (male and female alike). The characters are interesting and the romances are endearing.You learn spells and use them in highly limited capacity for very specific events. The most important events would be the exams. You can pass the exams with various spell combinations or simply decide to surrender and fail.\n\nI did enjoy this game for what it was. However, I do wish it had been longer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/recommended/211340/","timbeon","Timber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timbeon/","122 products in account","A fun, well-written visual novel with RPG elements whose cutesy anime artwork and setup as an affectionate parody of self-insert Harry Potter fanfiction disguise its depth. There are 6 possible love interests, and each one has multiple possible endings instead of just the usual good/bad. It's not a very long game, but the sheer amount of ways scenes can play out and events you can trigger encourages multiple playthroughs. The writing is great and likes to play with your expectations of both visual novels and teen fantasy romance, and the main characters and many of the minor characters are all really fleshed out. The weakest part of the game is the RPG elements -gaining skill points in certain schools of magic and using the spells you've learned to solve puzzles, which are pretty open-ended and have multiple different solutions- but the puzzles are interesting enough and offer an occasional change of pace. All-in-all, this is a game that I feel was created by someone loves visual novels and wants to see the genre become more than what it is, and really wants to see more girl-oriented games out there that aren't pieces of crap. If you like visual novels, lighthearted fantasy stories, romance games, or if you're still waiting for that Hogwarts letter, I recommend you look into this game.","July 12, 2013","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fortunately, it's also an oddity you don't get to see every day: a well-written dating sim with a serious focus on liberal social reform, alternative life styles, MAGIC!!!, and (strangely enough) American pride, topped off with a dash of bizarre dungeon crawl exploration and problem solving. While its originality, charming writing style, and replay value to get all the endings make it a distinct success, the dungeon exploration sections seem half-hearted and the game occasionally ends with a thud that makes you wonder where the next 3 years of high school are hiding.

With this sort of thing, story is key, and this one does a pretty good job with it. You play a young wizard (you have to play a lady, sorry), and work through your first semester, taking classes in the arcane, studying, and hanging out with your friends. And love interests. Nothing particularly raunchy gets to occur (you get to kiss your primary love interest), but you can freely chose to court men and women. After several weeks, you get chucked into an exam, where you use what ever spells you learned to try and pass. Failing enough will get you kicked out, but that's pretty hard, and the requirements for success are pretty free form. My biggest gripe is probably that you can't seek people out a lot of the time, or act on knowledge that the game doesn't remember that you know. Similiarly, the world is very engaging, but exploring it isn't always an option. For example, magic isn't allowed to mix with science. Why?

While I'd avoid longer games like Dragon Age or Mass Effect, Magical Diary is short enough that I can write off each decision as an aspect of my current playthrough rather than fretting over how it will affect my next umpteen hours.  The fact that the training schedule reminds me of Monster Rancher probably doesn't hurt either.  I might not have bothered with a pure visual novel, but this hybrid has convinced me that the genre is worth exploring.\n\nUnfortunately, the production values seem low.  While I'm guessing that a lack of animation is expected within the genre, I would have liked better-fitting accessory overlays and perhaps some more character frames.  There were also instances where environment descriptions seemed to conflict with the relatively bland pictures.  On the bright side, only the mismatched overlays really bothered me as my first character is stuck with glasses that don't fit in her yearbook picture.\n\nHonestly, it's an original English manga-styled choose-your-own-adventure book with middle school fantasy romance.

There are plenty of things I COULD list, from being a fan of the maker, to the cute artwork, to the by turns adorable, dark, intense and thought-provoking stories told in the form of romantic paths, the the simple quality of the game. Oh, wait, I just listed them. Oh well.\n\nMy point was, what I really love, even after so many playthroughs, and so much more experience now of RPG and VisNovel games than I had when I first played it, is how it walks the line of complexity. Most VisNovels give you simple text, with choices that affect outcome. Simple, enjoyable, easy to figure out. Other games also incorporate a skill system that affects the outcome just as much, and can be fiendishly difficult to figure out - do you have enough charm to be with this character, and if you don't, do you have enough energy to build on it without your character burning out or starving? The combinations can be endless - or at least so numerous that it takes a true devout to get through them all.\nMagical Diary, to me, is a perfect crossover. Because the magic system is complex, but straight-forward and, most importantly, it's in the game as a BONUS. Talk about replayability - when you're done with the romance routes and want to replay them, you can play around with your class shedule and skill levels to unlock some bonus content. And there's even a direct payoff to your skill building with the fun dungeons. The dungeon exam at the end of the terms might not change between playthroughs, but you, like the characters themselves, can have a lot of fun keeping your character from learning the spell for the obvious solution and really trying to think outside the box.\n\nIn short, whether you're in this for a cute, fun, deep VN, or a skill-builder with the occasional secret bonus that won't eat up weeks of your life or require a walkthrough, Magical Diary is something you should try out. I loved it when I first bought it and, unlike other VNs, I still love it now.","December 25, 2013","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is still deep and well-balanced enought to provide some challenge/interest on each playthrough.\n\nBut the real star here is the writing. The story, though short, has a surprising number of branches, each well-plotted and believable in the context of the story world, with some good reveals. Yes, it's genre writing, but the characters are well-drawn and the dialogue is solid – on par with or better than many popular comic series. Without spoiling anything, it also offers a pretty realistic portrayal of some kinds of problematic relationships teens can get into, in a way that is sensitive and not preachy (pretty hard to pull off, if you ask me).\n\nThe art style put me off a little, because I've come to associate it with ... well, bad writing, particularly for female characters. But once I got past that it really didn't bother me.\n\ntl;dr: it's a unique take on interactive narrative, with an unusual protagonist and a well-thought-out world.

This game could wear a new title and non-anime or non-cartooney graphics and suit it.  Similar in premise to Harry Potter, you are a Muggle-born at a school for wizards and witches, only unlike in Harry Potter you can actually flunk out.  Each week you pick out which classes you want to take and learn skills from them, then use those skills in random interactions, and then you can use your weekend to either destress or study more.  Alternatively, you can slack off during the week instead, or use a day to sleep in and reduce stress.  Your choices often have surprising consequences for a game with graphics that look like they was intended for younger audiences, and while the game does not have very appealing graphics the developers used what they had well.\n\nWhile you do get tons of spells (most of which useless) the game gives satisfying results when you have the right spell at the right time.  Most of the spells that you learn will never be used.  Also, If you go all-round in your classes it will result in a few missed dialogue opportunities, but likely you gain more than you lose.  If the game was any longer, or did not go by so fast, more of the spells could have been actually useful.  The characters were enjoyable and the storyline was filled with enough quirks that it merits a few playthroughs.  The soundtrack is decent enough, with one or two tracks I enjoyed listening to, but a couple of them were overplayed, although it might have been impossible to avoid considering the limited tracklist.\n\nSold my soul, worth the $5.  Not sure I would pay more than $7, I'd recommend trying to grab it during a sale.","June 30, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can shape your own path, your own life. On my first playthrough I decided to let things unfold without really trying. I decided to trust my instincts and I thought the game was shallow, empty, predictive...\nOh how WRONG I was. I though for sure this game was "pretty little lady perfect love story" and I found myself in a pretty dire and serious situation. Just "being good girl" and "Acting with kindness and love" will actually kill you.\nOn my second playthough, I changed only one answer... and got a whole new story. As soon as you make a choice, including which classes to take or not to take, you unlock new possibilities... and lose some. In this game's world, a witch's word is taken literaly, seriously. If you ask something you will be forever bound by those words. I was unsure at first about this facet of the game. It was on my fourth playthrough that I finally realised the actual depth of the game.\n\nNot only can we shape our story, but we can also change the way the game plays. We can change the way every character sees us. We can change the game's world to its very core. And that is something I love. If you think this game is Linear, you simply did not try the other answers. Just so you know, there is 4 ways to unlock the "Soul nibble" (5 if you count the rescue scene) and over a dozen to remove it completly from the game. You have many choice, use them wisely... or do like me and mess everything up just for the giggles.\n\nLast word?

I hate to write bad reviews but in truth this game really did disappoint me.  I got it for half off, have been waiting for it to go lower for awhile, but out of excitement spent the money on it anyways.  In my view it's not worth even that much money.\n\nI love visual novels.  I feel if you pay more for them though, and the art isn't that good, the choices better be.  In this one, the choices seem to be more meh.  The paths clearly set for the most part.  The addition of picking your classes and the test are just added in as a ooo you get something more to do, but in truth they just get in the ways in my eyes.  Especially during replays.\n\nAs for the replays themselves . . . I haven't completed my second.  I find myself sitting here thinking I would like to play a good visual novel, I'm sure I have one hidden in the list of games I still need to play.  Yet, with this wish to play one and knowing I still have replays to do on this current game I keep pushing it aside as if it is more trouble than it's worth to open it back up.\n\nThis is mostly my opinion though, and where I can't really say oh the art should be better, because I bought it knowing how the art looked.  I can say I am disappointed in the game over all.  Where are the feels?  This game's publisher has produced other good games, and I expect to be able to play many more.

I can honestly say it's probably the best dating simulator I've ever played, and that's because the 'dating' is not the focus of the game. It's a story (actually, multiple stories depending on your arc) and the romance is only a small part of it. The characters are interesting, the art is pleasant, and the music is quaint. Also, a massive plus is:\nTHE MAIN CHARACTER IS NOT A COMPLETE AND UTTER ANNOYING TWIT\n\nThat is my main complaint with most games like this, and this one manages to dodge the bullet.

If you're really curious, PLEASE buy the demo first, or else buy at a 90% sale, or just read Harry Potter. The story relies too heavily on the aforementioned novel series with none of the magic, and the characters who were based off of actual HP characters (e.g. Hermione, Snape, etc.) are very watered-down, very fanfic-y versions of those characters. There is even the concept of being Muggleborn ("Wildseed"), though so far (I've played till January of the school year) it hasn't really come into play except for one professor mentioning it.\n\nThe game is largely a visual novel: it involves a good amount of reading and some choice-making, which does impact your relationship with the characters. The only "gameplay" really is selecting your classes for the week and passing your midterm and final exams. There are 5 magic types (red, blue, green, black, white) but very little lore behind the magic, except for the occasional info-dumps which I had no patience for given the poor introduction to the magical background of the world. As you continue to take classes, you collect spells which you can use to pass your exams. As another reviewer said, it is NOT true that you don't have to study all of the magic types.\n\nThe player character's personality is pretty nice but given the "lack of magic" I feel from the general story, I'm finding it hard to even complete the game and get even /one/ of the endings.","January 23","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Haters beware.\n\nWhen I got this game, all I was expecting was a silly magic-themed rpg with schedule-based stat progression (you’ll see what I mean in game). After my first playthrough, it turns out there’s also a solid second half of the game in the form of adventure game-esque dungeon exams.\n\nBasically, you’re thrown into a small dungeon where you need to use the magic you’ve learned so far to solve a puzzle and escape. Each puzzle seems to encourage multiple approaches because of the huge number of utility spells you’ll have access to. Check the screenshot on the store page that has the spell list – the vast majority of them are more along the lines of “detect charm” and “transform stone” rather than fireball or lightning bolt, which usually means you can magical Mcgyver your way through each exam in multiple ways. This ends up being pretty important since how you develop your spell list is entirely up to you, and getting deep into one spell tree requires skimping on the others, so missing a key spell from a spell tree you’ve been neglecting isn’t a completely screwed situation if you can get creative with the other spells.\n\nI’d like to give an example of one of my recent exams for how open-ended it can be, but I’ll post it in the comments instead in case you don’t want any of the dungeon puzzles spoiled.\n\nAs for the actual writing and story bits (which honestly make up the majority of the game, I’m definitely always itching for more of the dungeons), while the dialogue isn’t Portal levels of consistently good comedy, the characters are at least fleshed out enough to be memorable and I can safely say at least one event in game made me feel like a piece of ♥♥♥♥ for making a poor decision, so I found myself pretty invested in the setting. Turns out giving a schoolfull of teenagers magic might not always be a good idea? Oh, and the default protagonist name is Mary Sue, so the game is fairly self aware about the setting being “Harry Potter, but now I get to go!”","August 18, 2013","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
