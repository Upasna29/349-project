If you liked Deus Ex and System Shock 2 you really can't go wrong with this one. Highly recommended!\n\nAs for what comes to this particular port, it's great. What it basically does is add up all the best mods like the mouselook and high resolution options and have it in a package where you only need to click "Play" and you're done. But the thing that really caught my attention was how they included the ICE Breaker Hint guide (Which i've read so many times as a kid i remember most of the stuff in it from my head. :D) along with other cool stuff like the soundtrack, strat guide and such.\n\nKeep in mind however, that this game was originally released in 1994 and as such isn't really up to snuff with the latest games in terms of graphics or control layouts. Still, if you played this game back in the day or just don't mind practicing a bit before getting into the experience it's easily worth the asking price.","October 22, 2015","true","10.7"," 161 of 185 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","161","185","5","5"

Wolfenstein, Doom, and Wing Commander were all greatness in their own right during this era, but this game brought it all together:\n1) Awesome atmosphere\n2) Intriguing story w/ one of the best villains of all time, SHODAN\n3) Horror RPG/FPS elements\n4) At the time of it's release, a revolutionary engine (crouch/lay/look up and down)\n5) Cyberspace!\n6) ...I give up, I can't properly give this game justice, find the original PCG articles online\n\nFor you "youngsters", you will have to get over the dated graphics. Trust me, the gameplay more than makes up for it and these days that's not very common. You will have to work for it though, namely because this game is over 20 years old, but also becomes games of this era didn't coddle gamers. No auto health regen, no hint bubbles (ok maybe a few, but you get the idea), etc... But if you make it through, you'll understand how much this game contributed to those that came after.\n\nAfter you beat this game, make sure you go pickup System Shock 2...another epic classic.\n\nLastly, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, someone please make System Shock 3!!!!!!!!!\n\nOh, almost forgot the obligatory "10/10 phrase" :rolleyes:\n\n10/10 would hack again!!","October 22, 2015","true","6.9"," 143 of 169 people (85%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","85","143","169","21","9"

That dying, old PC and this game, from some abandonware site. (Bought a mint condition boxed version years before but could never get it running)\n\nBare in mind I had played Systemshock 2 around it's launch in 1999, the golden era of PC, and that has gone on to be in my top 10 games.\n\nIt gets harder and harder to go back to SS1, at this point it's FAR, FAR beyond archaic, despite all the efforts to modernise the controls, up the resolution.\n\nBut I can 100% guarentee that if you give this game a few hours you will be in there, it puts the later shock games to shame even.  I kind of miss the older controls tbh, promoted a different style of play and a lot more caution, turning a corner was akin to landing a jet fighter.\n\nAll you need to know is that everything they continue to dumb down in shock games has it's origins here....everything. This is classic, PC gaming, that you could never find anywhere else. The type of game you need to "build" a man cave for, divorce your family for, Grow a beard playing. Get in a months supplies for.\n\n\n\nIt has the Audio logs, the scavenging for resources, the paranioa, the augs (plasmids later) and more, it has cyberspace.\nYou won't look at the other games in the same way again.\n","November 28, 2015","true","0.4"," 99 of 109 people (91%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","91","99","109","17","2"

Controls and interface will present something of an obstacle to new players, even with mouselook hack, but that is an obstacle well-worth overcoming. System Shock's storytelling is still engrossing, its mechanics still excellent and its level design is as elaborate as ever. Citadel Station is still a world of technological nightmare that is well worth exploring.\n\nAs many a other Looking Glass classic, this game is a window in a style of game design that is so radically different and in so many ways ahead of what we have today.  It will leave you impressed, but also depressed, as one can't help but ponder what kind of games we could have been playing today, with today's engines and budgets, if western game design followed the road that was paved by Looking Glass.","October 23, 2015","true","10.8"," 72 of 81 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","72","81","3","0"

Somehow I was able to become accustomed to the controls rather quickly, switching back and forth between free-look and the point-and-click modes became almost second nature. This definitely isn't a design element that should be put into modern games, but as a product of its time, it's great.\n\nThe main aspect that anyone going into this should be aware of is that you really need to listen/read the audio logs in the game. This is probably the first game I've played where they're absolutely critical to fluid progression. If you find you're stuck or lost, just go through your audio logs and you should be good to go. The info you need is there.\n\nFor a 20+ year old game this is fantastic. It boasts some of the best atmosphere, enemy design, and a great soundtrack.

Took me a few hours to get used to the control scheme, which is a slight gripe, however passed that what I found is an incredibly immersive experince. Player driven gameplay takes centre stage with an enpahsis on exploration and impecable trouble-shooting which for those who love to puzzel solve and try, try, try agiain with a different apprach will adore. Areas that you'll enter will inexplicably shut doors behind you without any way of getting out unless A, you figure out the wire puzzle which can and potentially take 10 or more minutes to solve (for me at least). Or B, truge forward and hope you'll have enough wit to make it to an elevator. Elevators are salvation to go heal / recharge on lower levels you've finished. That said this is one of many dilemas you'll encounter playing which incites tension not found in many games nowadays.\n\nSlight spoilers: Levels 7, 8, 9 are what I consider impecable in terms of gradual difficulty increase without being unfair or overly puninsing. 7 has a respawn station as with subsequent levels which are "earned" and enphasie that word because it not untill later in each level when you are finished the objective or explored the area you unlock, or you can miss it being you took the fast route. What makes 7 difficult is the use of high enemy respawns to wager having your own respawn station.  This followed by 8-9 has no respawn station which translates to more player conscientiousness of item / ammo consumption along cautious charater movement.\n\nThere SO much more I would love to talk about what this game gets right that so many games miss nowadays. A crucial game for any up and coming game programmer / designer. Not technically up modern standards in terms of graphics and UI. But once you put your disbelieve aside and dwelve into what exactly was compromised for what the disigners were trying to convey. System Shock stands out as truly a gem in the face of modern games for those who are up for the challange.","December 15, 2015","true","37.2"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","26","28","0","0"

Despite its age, System Shock is still an incredible game and worth a play, if for no other reason than to experience the great story.  FPS with a RPG element - heavier on the RPG than on the FPS.

This is nothing more than smoke and mirrors on Looking Glass Studio's part.\n\nSystem Shock was essentially designed around being Ultima Underworld in Space, and features one of the first examples of a 3D environment in a first person shooter. Unlike it's sequel, System Shock plays more like a first person shooter. It controls very awkwardly, and this surprisingly adds to the horror atmosphere. You move around the environments like you're drunk, and doing things like switching weapons, to reloading, to using your inventory is much harder than it needs to be. As a result combat is very tense for all the wrong reasons. This, and the techno soundtrack adds to the paranoid 2001 inspired atmosphere.\n\nThe world of System Shock is very abstract. Most of the geometry is very square, with grainy low-res textures that only very loosely portray what they're supposed to. It actually adds to the creepiness of this game. Everything feels off and nothing feels like it should. It was one of the first games to feature audio logs, which gives you a lot of incentives to explore due to the great voice acting. The storytelling to System Shock is actually pretty good and it's a shame it was so held back by it's technology.\n\nSystem Shock is a horror game that scares you for all the reasons it shouldn't. I personally see it as very awkward compared to it's sequel (and it's very strange praising System Shock 2 for being less awkward compared to something else). I generally only recommend it to people who are interested in very old games like myself, or people who are overly curious and want to be punished. Much like other games from the same time period like Bioforge, it's full of very big ideas but was held back by the technology of it's time. And we wouldn't see System Shock's full potential until 5 years later with it's sequel.","November 3, 2015","true","0.9"," 31 of 40 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","31","40","5","3"

You can see how it inspired Bioshock and dozens of other newer games. It's a lot of fun to play through and still feels fresh in a bunch of ways.\n\nDefinitely worth picking up for only $10.

As an FPS, it's pretty slow, and somewhat punishing.  There's a resurrection mechanic, that you need to enable per floor (those that have one), that make it easier... if you can activate it.  The cyber stages are a complete mess.  And the ending, both fight and actual victory, are totally not worth the effort....\n\nBut the game is rich in setting and story.  For as old as it is, there is a remarkable level of interactivity, and detail.  The Enhanced version even includes some revamped controls, with the option (not in-game, sadly, it requires editing a config file on your hard drive) for the original controls.  And some slightly updated resolutions (not a full battery, but better than the original).  Just be prepared.  If you're expecting your average 90's shooter, you're going to be a bit disappointed.  But if you're here expecting some clever survival horror, decent puzzles, and peicing together how to get out alive, as well as how to potentially save humanity, then you're in the right place.","April 24","true","3.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","1"

A younger me would have probably made copious amounts of hand written notes and maps to help me find my way through the game.\n\nBut System Shock is still one of the most inventive, atmospheric and well written games I've had the good fortune to play, and being able to play it with a more modern control setup was a bonus (and the only way I'd ever been able to play).\n\nI'm looking forward to the remake.

Despite gaining critical acclaim, it remained somewhat unpopular among gamers of that time, and in the end the sales weren't sufficient to cover the budget. The reasons for this included high minimal/recommended system specifications, people dismissing it as a Doom clone(which would be really silly nowadays), and the complexity of the gameplay. Too bad, because this game was really special and innovative. For years this game still remained obscure, because the uneditable control scheme was hard to get used to, and making the game run on modern systems, with DOSBox or not, was difficult. Until now, the franchise has been in legal limbo, because the rights to the IP, assets and games themselves were split between multiple unrelated companies, one of which, crazily enough, was an insurance company rather than a gaming one. Thankfully, Night Dive Studios sorted out this situation and acquired the complete rights to the System Shock series. Because of this, you can buy the aforementioned game on both GOG and Steam.\n\nThe Enhanced Edition of System Shock contains all the updates and tweaks to make the game run flawlessly on modern systems without ruining the original experience. The game now runs natively on Windows, and the controls can be configured to whatever you wish(via editing the config file rather than in-game, but still), the primary change in controls is that you can use your mouse to look around and press a button to move the cursor around the screen, similarly to System Shock 2. The game runs in a proper framerate, and you can change the resolution on the fly without crashing the game(the availible ones may seem too small, but if they can fill your screen, that's fine). The music now uses software-generated GeneralMIDI, if you wish to choose a different sounding one, you need to use drivers like VirtualMIDI or BASSMIDI. The installation folder of the game contains extra goodies, which include the soundtrack, some images, a trailer, strategy guides and the manual. Buying the Enhanced Edition allows you to download System Shock Classic, which is the original game without any changes, configured to run in DOSBox.\n\nNow, let's talk about the game itself. The plot involves a hacker hacking into the TriOptimum database to find information about a space station called "Citadel". Sadly, while he is doing so, his actions are being discovered, so a couple of TriOptimum security guards abduct him and take him to the aforementioned station. There, the TriOp VP Edward Diego proposes the hacker that if he will remove SHODAN's, the station's main AI, ethical constraints and will give him Level 1 access to her, he will not punish the hacker for hacking into the database and reward him with a neuro-cyberspace-interface. The hacker agrees and does as instructed. Afterwards, he is taken to the hospital level, where he is put in a 6-month coma, while aforementioned implant is grafted onto him. Once he wakes up, he find out that something is not right...\n\nThe gameplay is something really extraordinary when compared to other games of its era. Even though the game was released only about 6 moths after the original Doom, it included many features that wouldn't be widely used in games until many years later. At the beginning of the game, you will have an option to name your character and choose a difficulty level. Unlike in other games, you can alter the difficulty of each gameplay aspect separately. If you are a newcomer, it would be a bad idea to turn Plot and Cyberspace all the way up to 3, save them for a second playthrough, some experience of the game would be necessary to survive there. What's worth mentioning, that if you turn the difficulty all the way down to 0 in each category, your experience with the game would be something similar to developer cheats mode, or perhaps a game suitable for babies.\n\nWhat you need to know is that this game combines FPP view with a point-&-click style gameplay. You can pick up items and drag them to your inventory, you can interact with items that are or are not in the center of your point of view. The interface, after playing around with it, should be rather self explanatory, you can turn on Online Help in the options(or via Alt+H) to get hints on how to use it. The defualt control scheme for this edition may not be as nice as what you've been using in other games, but it still is a major improvement over the original version. E toggles mouselook on/off, Q swithces to the next weapon, Shift+Q switches to the previous weapon, WASD keys move your character, Z and C make your character lean left or right, X makes the player not lean anymore, R, F and V keys change your elevation, from standing upright to crouching to laying on the ground, Shift activates sprint, Space makes you jump, Left mouse button interacts with things and selects things in your inventory, Right mouse button activates your weapon or picks up an item from you inventory keys 1-0 activate particular hardware implants, F1-F10 activate particular interface displays, F1-F5 for the left side of the screen, and F6-F10 for the right one. You may want to read the manual to know some things beforehand, such as what each grenade is supposed to be doing. However, most of the time the game describes what each item is meant to be doing and how it works.\n\nThe combat works fine. As you progress throughout the game, you encounter stronger enemies and gain better equipment. However, some weapons may be of no use to you, they work fine for the most part though. The puzzles are nice and challenging, or at least until we start talking about the ones where you need to place wires. These are like the hardest thing in the game. Thankfully for some, the extras folder contains a guide with solutions to them. This game has an emphasis on plot, so you will be searching logs and other data to solve your objectives. Sometimes the game may be kind of cryptic in terms of what are you supposed to be doing, it isn't much of an issue, as via exploring the game you will learn a lot about your objectives and enviroments. The atmosphere is quite good, you will feel suspension, fear, and possibly even empathy.\n\nThe level design is really nice, quite reminiscent of what oldschool FPSes are known for. The levels are mazelike and contain some cleverly hidden secrets. What some people may not like though are silent snipers in some later levels, who shoot at you without you knwoing where they are or what hit you(they are not very powerful though). The more you play the game, the better you will be at beating it more efficiently.\n\nThe engine the game runs on, being the same one that powerd the Ultima Underworld duology, does a fairly good job. While the level geometery may be kind of blocky, the engine allows for many features not seen in other games like polygonal objects, room over room, software rendered transclucency, physics simulation and more. The graphics, after all these years, still look quite good, the textures are pleasant and the sprites are a joy to look at. The music is really nice, it is both catchy and thrilling. Sound effects are pretty good too, and so is the voice acting. If you are annoyed that the audiologs do not match the written logs, you can install this[www.systemshock.org]. There is nothing wrong with doing so.\n\nIn other words, System Shock is an amazing game, that even though it was obscure, it brought innovation to its genre and was a precursor to many games that came out later. After over two decades it is still higly enjoyable, memorable, challenging and gripping. I totally recommend you to play it.","November 22, 2015","true","11.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

The successor from 1999 may be more popular, have better graphics and more interesting level design but in every other aspect I think the first game is better. To put the story in a nutshell, you basically are fighting your way through a huge space station to defeat a AI that's gone berserk. SHODAN, the mischievous villain AI, of course tries everything to stop you from doing that...\n\nUnlike the sequel there are no RPG skillsets or the annoying need to repair guns after every few shots. This game is rather a classic FPS in a pseudo Open World environment plastered with enemies and some puzzles. At some points you even have to hack your way through some kind of Cyberspace, which kinda looks like taken straight off a TRON movie.\n\nIt's notably mindblowing how many years System Shock was ahead of its time - and let me remind you of the fact that the first Doom was released only one year before! The attachable "Hardware" power-ups like the 360° head camera or the shield were indeed revolutionary for a first person shooter from that era! At some points I even dare to say that it even is more innovative than the highly-praised sequel!\n\nThe only downside are quite much the controls, which feel quite awkward if you only are familiar with modern FPS control layouts. But to be fair you pretty much get the hang of them and after a few hours all problems are forgotten. It's also worth mentioning that the free mouselook option from the Enhanced Edition makes things considerably easier!\n\nThe Good:\n+ Great level design\n+ Immersive atmosphere\n+ Many guns and power-ups\n+ Great story and narrating\n+ Epic fights and enemies\n\nThe Bad:\n- Controls (but it gets better after a while)\n- The music may get a bit annoying at some points\n- Basically only resolutions up to 1024x786\n\nThe Ugly:\n-- Why on earth did this game not sell so well back then??\n\nWhy are you still reading reviews and waiting? Get this game immediately and experience one of the brightest jewels in PC gaming!\n\n10/10","November 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/410710/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","System Shock is a game you seldom hear about. Most people are familiar with it's sequel, System Shock 2, and the follow-up series that it spawned, Bioshock. The games are hybrid first-person shooter RPGs. While that doesn't sound so crazy in the modern gaming climate, 1994 hadn't seen anything quite like this game.\n\nThe major problem with the original release was the control scheme. Instead of opting to lock aiming to one plane (like in Doom), Looking Glass Studios tried their hand at full 3D aiming. It was facilitated (originally) without mouse control. To say that the game is an exercise in frustration wouldn't be giving enough credit to how maddening the experience could be.\n\nThankfully, System Shock: Enhanced Edition (courtesy of NightDive Studios) fixes any real complaints you may have had with the original release. I suppose the textures are still a bit low-resolution and the game isn't remade more so than ported, but sometimes it's just plain wrong to tinker with classics.\n\nThe story is fairly non-existent, obviously due to the developers putting more effort into gameplay than anything else. You take the role of a nameless hacker who is caught trying to steal data from the TriOptimum corporation. Instead of locking him away, they give him a chance to redeem his actions. An AI of theirs has gone rogue on a space station and they are looking to reprogram it.\n\nAfter doing that, your character is given a neural implant as a reward. He is then put in a 6-month statis period for recovery. Upon waking up, it turns out that the rogue AI, named SHODAN, is back from the dead. The space station is in shambles and there are mutants and cyborgs running amuck.\n\nIt's not so much what the story is about, but more so how it's told. This was the first game to have audio logs play over your actions. The voice acting isn't grade A, but it does a great job of selling how desolate the space station truly is. SHODAN's voice, though, deserves a lot of praise.\n\nI rarely get scared in games, but just listening to hear is enough to drive you mad. The way her voice lags, stutters, speeds up, warps out of clarity and remains in a monotone is just creepy. She is also written with a decent sense of humor (albeit a very dark one).\n\nThen comes the gameplay. In 1994, there was literally nothing like this. Shooters hadn't begun to tackle aiming in a 3D space. While that obviously caused a lot of headache due to poor controls, this enhanced edition adds mouse support. With the press of a single button, you can aim and look around as if the game were made today.\n\nThis port retains a lot of what made the original so unique, however. You will be required to unlock mouse look and click on items. Reloading requires you to unlock mouse look, double click on the ammo button and then click it again. This is definitely a game that requires patience.\n\nThat patience will have to extend to the combat and puzzles, as well. The AI is hardly good, but a few of the enemies are of the hit-scan variety. They tend to have perfect accuracy and it can be quite ridiculous to try and figure out where the hell you are taking damage from. It doesn't help that they don't seem to suffer from ammo limitations, while you are required to reload your clips manually.\n\nThen there are the puzzles. The game thankfully has individual difficulty sliders for each part of gameplay, so one can opt to turn the puzzles off entirely. With them on, the game resembles Doom with a more open-ended approach. You will be looking for keys, splicing wires together and twisting nodes to access different parts of the space station.\n\nIt's just that, being the game was made in 1994, a lot of the puzzles can be obtuse. It doesn't help that the game has absolutely no hand holding, so you often will be walking around for hours with no idea of what to do next. The e-mail logs you get with your objectives are descriptive enough, but it would be nice to have a main objective screen.\n\nThe game is 22 years old, though. Walkthroughs are plentiful and the game isn't so massive that you would be entirely lost. It's impressive to see such an old game have level design this large. Not every room feels intricate or realistic, but being trapped on a space station with 10 levels within the confines of the DOS OS is just amazing.\n\nIt's like a marriage between Doom and any modern role playing game. It feels sprawling, epic and spooky. When everything clicks, you truly do believe you are lost in an impossible situation. The music does ruin the mood a bit, but it is also excellent.\n\nIt would be pointless to comment on the graphics with regards to modern expectations. NightDive Studios are doing a full HD remake of this game, so playing this will mostly be for people who have a fondness for old-school games. It's gameplay certainly doesn't feel old, but the game looks it's age.\n\nI often love sprite based games, so I wasn't disappointed. I'm more impressed with how the architecture was constructed or the art design behind specific enemies. Everything is detailed enough to not look confusing or blurry, so that is a huge plus. There is also some excellent use of color and a lot of sci-fi feeling locations.\n\nAs for whether you should get this, I say yes. The price is cheap and often becomes ludicrous on sale. It's not a short game and it will give you some perspective on how far FPS games have come. That is still feels like a brand new game (despite some antiquated design choices) is a testament to how ahead of it's time System Shock truly was.\n\nThe sequel is still much better, but the first chapter isn't one to be missed.\n\n9/10","May 7","true","11.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

And it's still fun to play too, replayed the game not that long ago :-)\n\nAll the first person games I've played before this were pretty much mindless "kill everything" games. Well, you kill everything here too, but you explore too. You can go back and forth between the levels on the space station and walk around pretty much as you please. And for once the place felt "real", it wasn't just a maze where you look for a blue key to go next, it kinda made sense (even if it can be a little maze-like at times). And you had a fairly large inventory to keep track of too.\n\nBut the big draw was the antagonist SHODAN. You meet her right away as she greet and welcome you to the Citadel station. I had never experienced that in a game before, the atagonist was pretty much someone you met at the end of the last dungeon/castle/whatever before you killed him. But not here, she followed you with the cameras and sent you e-mails, mocked you as you failed, and got angry as you foiled her plans.

It's really just as good, if not better, in my opinion. This Enhanced Edition on Steam comes with the standard floppy and CD releases of System Shock 1, as well, so don't worry: If you don't want HD graphics or modified controls in a classic DOS game, you don't have to deal with that stuff at all. A lot of new gamers are s-h-i-t-t-y at video games, so they need mouselook or whatever. If you think you're not terrible at games, the normal, classic controls are just fine. They just take an hour or so to get totally used to, since they are unusual.\n\nAnyway, this game is great.\n\nI recommend playing on the hardest difficulty, since there are machines you have to find and enable on each sector of the space station that are essentially regeneration chambers, things that people who've played System Shock 2 first will easily recognize. Thing is, dying and respawning (with low health) in one of these costs you nothing at all, so you should definitely choose the timed-gameplay setting in the difficulty options as well, where a 7-hour time limit  (part of the story) is imposed on the game. This makes it so the "revive in a room with no consequences" mechanic does have a consequence other than "get annoyed that I have to walk back to some other room". Personally, I just avoided the regeneration things altogether.\n\nBesides that, the game has a great atmosphere, and it has all the complex movements that System Shock 2 had, and more. You can lean, crouch, go prone, jump, sprint, and climb up ledges. You can lean while crouching or going prone, as well. If you play on my recommended difficulty setting, the game is less of a "sprint around hallways and hit guys with shotguns with my wrench before they hit me" type of game like System Shock 2, and more of a Rainbow Six in Space type of game. This is because you really need to lean around corners and go prone or crouch while shooting to avoid getting killed in like two seconds. It's also because there are plenty of grenades/mines that you have at your disposal that explode on impact or just very quickly, so you usually want to throw them around corners and get out of the way fast.\n\nThere are no PSI powers like in System Shock 2, but you will find new implants for your "Military-grade Neuro-Interface" that'll do stuff like let you run fast, or fly vertically. These and other implants have multiple hardware upgrades that you will (or not) find throughout the game.\n\nSpeaking of PSI, there is no PSI meter by your health, but instead, an electric energy meter. The implants you gain and all energy weapons will use this shared power source, which can be recharged with battery items or static power-stations.\n\nYour interface lets you jack into computers to access cyberspace, which is probably the most 90s thing you'll ever see in a videogame. I'd explain it here, but it's honestly so much more amazing when you play the game and go "OH GOD WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON"\n\nThe story is awesome. The story is explained in the intro cinematic, which I will post a link to here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ITiEm6W5EM\n\n\nSo yeah. System Shock is the apex predator of cyberpunk videogames. It's complex and difficult, so any fans of old-school gameplay should love it.","October 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","17","25","2","0"

If you have played Bioshock, System Shock has similar gameplay, but with a space theme and much more in-depth controls and features, at least in my opinion. Although, in comparison, Bioshock is a dumbed-down and modernized version of this game with an underwater theme. System Shock has an interace that can be hard to get used to and has some pretty challenging hacking puzzles, but, to me, that adds to the game as I like figuring things out. Once you are used to the control scheme and interface, it is one of the most intense FPS/RPG games you will ever play with a awesome storyline.\n\nIn System Shock, you play as a hacker that gets caught hacking. For your crimes, you are taken to a ship called Citadel Station to develop an Artifical Intelligence, called SHODAN. In return for your hard work, your record is wiped clean and you get a computer interface surgically implemented into your body. Your surgury takes 6 months to heal so you are crotgenetically put to sleep. After 6 months, you awake to find out SHODAN, the AI you developed, became so powerful and advanced it thinks it is god and tries to wipe out the human race with an army of robots, cyborgs, and mutants. You're job is simple, destroy SHODAN before it takes over Earth.\n\nI have not played System Shock 1 before, and once I did, this instantly became one of my favorite games because of how different it is in the controls, interface, and gameplay compared to most shooters of this genre. If this game at all interests you, do yourself a favor and pick this up! You will not be disappointed. System Shock 2 is a great game also.

The atmosphere of being on an abandoned space station that's actively trying to kill you is almost flawlessly executed.\n\nThe game mechanics also encourage a more realistic style of play. You don't run through the station, guns blazing, killing every living thing on sight; rather, you pick your actions more carefully. Turning a corner? Stop. Crouch. Lean. Ready your weapon for a potential hostile. You manage and treasure your ammo, often resorting to the good ol' pipe in early stages of the game to thwack mutants in the head.\n\nThough the music may not be fitting for a horror atmosphere, it is still plenty enjoyable to listen to. Really helps sink in that cyberpunk/futuristic feel. (And for people who say the music isn't scary enough- have a listen to Level 03 Maitenance's soundtrack and tell me that isn't ♥♥♥♥-your-pants suspenseful.\n\nThe user interface and controls may be a bit awkward at first, but you'll get used to it in time. It helps add to the element of horror when you're fumbling to reload your gun as a Cyborg Drone approaches you, or a stray mutant catches you off-guard while you loot the spoils of a recent victory.\n\nLevel design can also be maze-like at times, but the auto-map, along with the ability to leave messages at any specific point of the level, can help alleviate that issue. Again, the maze-like layout of the levels can also really drive home that feeling of stumbling through corridors, trying to reach the elevator but ending up lost in the depths of Citadel Station.\n\n\nAll in all, the flaws of this game are what make it great. The crouch/leaning system is also something I miss dearly in first person games. And I haven't even gotten to the excellency of the game's plot, along with its main villan: SHODAN. $9.99 for a game this immersive and atmospheric is practically theft at this point.","March 21","true","5.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It is probably best described as a Cyberpunk Action Adventure with Survival Horror Elements.\n\nIn System Shock you play as a hacker who got caught while hacking the network of the TriOptimum megacorporation. Luckily for him he gets the chance to have this crime forgiven if he performs a job for the high ranking TriOptimum executive Edward Diego. The hacker is told to meet Diego at TriOptimum’s own Citadel Station and give him level one access to SHODAN (Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network), the highly sophisticated AI that controls most of Citadel Station. To achieve this goal the hacker is forced to remove several control mechanisms but he manages to give Diego complete control over SHODAN and thereby Citadel. As promised the hacker is not persecuted any further and he even receives a special reward: a military grade cyber-interface. After the operation he has to spend six months in cold sleep on Citadel Station to recover. When he wakes up however, the station looks deserted. There are blood splats and broken equipment all over the place and the stations security systems treat the hacker as an enemy. It is quite obvious that SHODAN has gone rogue.\n\nSystem Shock is played in a first person perspective and shares a lot of similarities with the Ultima Underworld games. The game world is a 3D environment while the enemies are represented by sprites. Thinking how badly early, low-polygon NPC models age that is probably a godsend. In the original System Shock you had to use your mouse to click on the corresponding part of the interface in order to move and turn. Also, you had to click and drag a slider to look up or down. Luckily the Enhanced Edition added mouse look. “Why wasn’t there even mouse look in the first place?” I hear you ask? Well, System Shock’s HUD is full of things to click on (That and mouse look was extremely uncommon when System Shock came out.) You manage your weapons, your general inventory, your data reader and your hardware directly from the HUD. This also means that the game does not pause just because you are looting a crate or are managing your inventory. With the addition of mouse look you can press the E key to toggle between free look mode and interaction mode. With that, System Shock 1 controls pretty much in the same way as System Shock 2.\n\nThere is a plethora of weapons to find, ranging from rather weak weapons like a lead pipe, a dart pistol and a regular pistol to very effective ones like a laser rapier, a magnum and rail gun and the fully-automatic Skorpion gun (By the way, that is German for scorpion, who would have guessed?). While there are a maximum number of weapons you can carry at a given time there is no limit to the number of grenades and drugs you can have with you. There are various types of grenades like frag, gas, EMP, or earthshaker as well as drugs, ranging from healing over time to stamina boost, melee damage boost and bullet-time. As with the weapons there is only space in your main inventory for a set number of items. Items that go into your main inventory are for example medikits, batteries to replenish your health and energy and logic probes which can be used once to solve a puzzle automatically.\n\nThere are two resources: health and energy. You need energy to fire energy weapons as well as to use most of your hardware. At the beginning you do not have much hardware to choose from but additional pieces can be found and upgraded later. There are several pieces of hardware to collect, for example a headlight, an energy shield or jet boosters that allow for limited flight. While some of your hardware does not require energy most will drain it to a certain degree while in use. You can replenish your energy by either using a battery or preferably charging up at one of the Citadel’s energy stations.\n\nWhile you will be in the physical world for a majority of the game System Shock has some cyberspace segments. At certain points you are able to jack in at an access point and enter cyberspace. While you are jacked in you are floating through a series of rooms with walls that are composed variously colored grids. You main goal is to flip certain switches in order to make progress in the physical world. You will also be fighting of defense programs and collect upgrades for your cyberspace.\n\nOther than that you will also need to solve puzzles in the physical world. Most of the time these are logic puzzles. If you solve them you can unlock doors, disable force fields and re-enable deactivated bridges.\n\nSystem Shock is not a game that holds your hand at all. For the most part you have to piece together what you need to do from the information you get from audio logs (Yes, this was the first game to use audio logs.) You are immediately thrown into the action and have a lot of freedom in where you want to go and what you want to do. For some players this might be off-putting but the game gives you everything you need if you take the time to figure things out. On most decks there is a restoration unit that will automatically bring you back to life once you have activated it. This might sound as if it makes the game far too easy but the enemies deal high amounts of damage and you will feel the tension when you are on a floor where you have not found the restoration unit yet.\n\nThe thing System Shock does best in my opinion is the sense of progression it gives to the player. Each floor has to be conquered. You will be unlocking doors, activating lights, bridges and elevators, destroying security cameras and re-activating restoration units. All of this contributes to a great sense of progression when you slowly make a floor yours. All of that is taken away though when you get to a floor where you have not been yet. When I played System Shock back in the 90’s it scared the hell out of me. It does not scare me like that anymore but it is still a pretty tense experience. Even in places where you have been before you cannot feel completely safe since the enemies have a nasty habit for respawning. Also, SHODAN is always there breathing down you neck. Unlike most other games in System Shock the final boss is always there watching, sending you threats and sending their troops against you.\n\nSystem Shock is an old game and it shows. However, the thing that held it back most was its antiquated control scheme that was not up to snuff by today’s standards. With that solved it holds up pretty well, even today. Newcomers might at first be irritated by its lack of hand-holding and its vast, sometimes maze-like levels. But if you get into the game you are up for a tense atmospheric ride that you will not forget.\n\nMore reviews here","November 21, 2015","true","21.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

To an extent, it's hard to blame them, as the game hasn't aged nearly as gracefully as its sequel - the UI that takes up a majority of the screen is pretty daunting at first, and the tutorial screen that almost entirely buries the screen in arrows pointing at every little dial and doodad on the screen at once doesn't do much to encourage new players. It's easier to get used to than it initially appears, though, and it's helped out by the inclusion of mouse aiming in the Enhanced Edition. Aside from the mouse aiming, not much has changed aside from a slight increase in resolution, so it might take a little time getting used to switching between the mouse aim mode and the environment interaction mode (where you use a cursor to interact with things and pick up items, as well as manage your various UI elements), but once you get past that initial barrier System Shock 1 is a lot of fun. System Shock 1 is clunky, and it's not as good as its sequel, but it's worth trying if you want to see how the Shock series began.","December 28, 2015","true","17.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

I found it on a list of 'best pc games of all time', and decided to give it a whirl. At first glance, I said to myself, "Oh, horrible 1994 graphics." However, after playing it for 15 minutes, I became addicted. Something about this game drives you forward. Of course, it would take me forever to beat it without the help of a guide. I'm sure a lot of old timers would flip out about that, "Oh, you used a guide? Blurr de burp de burr! Noob!". However, I didn't intend on dedicating a ton of time to this oldass game. That being said, the gameplay is amazing. It's actually slightly scary when a cyborg pops up and you didn't expect it to be there. Before playing it, I thought the gameplay would be similar to the original 'Doom' or 'Wolfenstein 3d', but this game is in a class all on it's own. It truly blows those games out of the water. Looking forward to the remake that is supposed to come out in 2017. I might buy a new pc, just to play it. Until then, I intend on playing System Shock 2, and hope that it is everything the first one was. I hope this review is helpful to anyone who is skeptical about getting this game.

That's it. I would end the review here, but... you'd need to know why it's so great.\n\nFirst of all, I've gotta say that the composers at Looking Glass (especially Eric Brosius) did a great job with the soundtrack. While most of the MIDI-techno music may not fit the atmosphere of the game (excluding level 3), it's still awesome, and it's a joy to listen to.\nAnother reason for why it's so good is the constant feeling of isolation and dread. You're on your own, helpless, in a vast space station with no survivors. All that's remaining is you, a corrupt A.I. (that now runs the whole ship), murderous cyborgs and mutants.\nI'm also in love with the element of no hand-holding, in the game. With barely any help or guidance, that encourages you to explore and take a look around the Citadel station, while looking for ways to solve various puzzles. Certain 'solutions' can be found in audio logs scattered around the station that may contain important info or clues to solving them; like (For example) deactivating the laser that SHODAN is going to use to destroy Earth.\n\nNow, despite the praise I'm giving to this game, there is one small issue. It's the labyrinthine level design. It can be really confusing at times, but with the trusty automap and 'nav-markers', this problem is alleviated. So... you won't get lost or lose your way around the endless corridors and cramped hallways of the Station, that often.\n\nAnd a word of advice for newbies: if this is your first time playing SS1, I'll have to warn you, it's quite a punishing and challenging experience, even on normal difficulty settings!\nThe clunky interface, mechanics and controls may also be frustrating for a newcomer, but give it a little while and you'll eventually get used to it.\nOh, and the hacking minigames were cool, albeit frustrating.\n\n(One more thing I should mention (that's so great about the 1st System Shock) is SHODAN. She's memorable, creepy and she pretty much steals the show, with her chilling and phenomenal voice acting. SHODAN is my favourite villain and A.I. in gaming <3)","April 26","true","22.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/410710/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","System Shock is a FPS and RPG mix made by Looking Glass studios and published back then by Origin in 1994. And when I said RPG what I meant is real-time dungeons crawlers. Not to mentioning that Looking Glass made Ultima Underworld before that. And this time they wanted to make it so all elements are incorporated together instead of "there is exploration sub-game, NPC conversation sub-game and Roll/Dice combat sub-game". Anyway, they made this nice cyberpunk piece of awesome.\n\nThere were two versions of a game: floppy and CD. Yes, Classic version that comes with both. And music is probably played like it comes out from some soundcard, it's nice and not like General MIDI. There is almost no reason to use floppy version. CD version added 3 more mini-games that you can find in cyberspace, some detention cells in Level 8 that are just, well, cells, and voice acting. Which is awesome. SHODAN villian AI wouldn't be same without that voice.\nIt's a shame however that voices actually rephase the whole text they were supposed to follow, so it may get annoying to listen to it while reading text. But I heard that community produced a patch that changes text to be same as what voice actors say.\n\nAnd the game would have stayed obscure but Night Dive managed to get the rights on System Shock out of the legal limbo, releasing Enhanced Edition in 2015. All yay Night Dive.\nThe only shame is that they didn't have the source so they could do only so much with reverse engineering. But they still made it run natively on newest Windows, increased available resolutions and improved controls. Though sadly it only uses General MIDI music. Also, because they couldn't change game itself too much then if you want to change controls then you will have to configurate it in the cfg file of a game's directory.\nOh, and comes with nice bonus goodies. Shame that soundtrack is same as General Midi.\n\nAs for bugs, well, I think that game crashed on me two times in the beggining, when I was alt-tabbing around and was figuring things out. There also was graphical glitch on full map rarely appearing and interface sometimes looks ugly in enhanced version with random lines, like on puzzle meters. Probably something to do with resolution.\nMost annoyingly, music in Cyberspace is bugged. It randomly dissapears after a while, until you leave the cyberspace. It even was nasty with final cyberspace level. If the music doesn't glitch out, then it may keep playing even on top of ending's own track.\n\nOriginal game had a very scary interface that looked like Looking Glass tried hard to make it feel like stereotypical future complex interfaces while controlling like they belived that computer mouse will replace keyboard someday.\n\nThankfully, we have enhanced version. For getting used to controls here is a kickstarter: Press E to switch between mouselook and mouse-free one. Then poke around with left mouse click, left double-clicks and right clicks. Then check Reference Card in game's folder to check on Enhanced's keybinds. Then after more playing around and having fun you can check manual, ignoring the outdated keybinds. People are more smart than usually given credit for, you will figure it all out.\nAt the end, you should get used to pressing F1-F10 and 1-10 number buttons to toogle hardwares and change screens. Gotta be able to activate shield with single button. And since there is no reload button for your weapon, organise your weapon order so you can switch to your backups with Q button.\n\nAnyway, the plot of this game is fun. Pre-story is that you are a hacker who got cautch for trying to look inside the TriOptimus's protected data regarding space Citadel. After that they carry you into Citadel itself where Diego offers you a deal for unknown reason: if you remove ethical constraints SHODAN AI system and give it Level 1 access then they will free you of charges and even give neural implant. You did as was asked. And now you are taking a deep sweet 6-month long sleep so your brain will get used to the implant.\nOnce you wake up you will very quickly realize that you unleashed the beast.\n\nThe main strenght of this game is how it combines the skill-based action with the story elements. You got around 10 levels of Cidatel which are complex mazes and you will often have to backtrack. But you see, it's the kind of game that actually tries hard not to feel like it holds your hand. And it succeedes. Your main source of information will be logs of the dead people. By analysing them you will find not only story, but you will be able to solve puzzles to progress. And not just code for nearby locked like in more famous Doom 3. And it's not limited to codes either!\nThough sometimes it lacks some smaaaaall additional hints. At least I don't expect people to figure Reactor mission in some while. But no worries, it has enough info to analyse, it's not Monkey Island logic.\n\nEven better the plot that is delivered through this is excellent. And most importantly the SHODAN AI is the kind of villian that is pretty much always present. Through logs you find out what she is up to and how you can possibly stop her. With every your effort pretty much focused on giving this villian blows that you know matter, even possibly knowing what else she can pull off.\n\nAnd look, you can write messages on the map. Any game that tries to be intellegent and allows leaving notes is rated highly in my book. Love this feature.\nUntil I couldn't leave any more messages due to hitting global limit and had to backtrack to remove them on some levels. Oh well. At least also has automaping.\n\nThat was the best part of a game and what you should look toward. Everything else is less amazing, but mostly solid.\n\nYou "level up" by finding new weapons and hardware to use, with game throwing tougher enemies at you. It doesn't feel as much on survival as I expected, if you pick everything then you will not ever run out of ammo, for example. Not as much as of horror as I thought. Or none at all, action MIDI music doesn't help. Though it does have some ambient sometimes.\n\nAnd some levels aren't excited either. Mostly the mazes parts that feel like mazes. Mazey mazes. You know, 90 degree turns and generic enviroments. Didn't like Level 7 at all, felt like one. Even worse is that some enemies actively respawn on some levels. And when they do, they often are quite aggresive and annoying. Like Level 3. I would have understood if they did it to populate level when player wasn't there, but not flood him while he is still in the level. Physics for jumping is weird too.\n\nAlso, you can activate restoration chambers for infinite lifes on the level. We were casuals before modern gamers, yo.\n\nCombat is mostly solid. As in it doesn't hold up to any Doom-school game. But that's not the point of a game and it gets away due to this. Not much of difference in weapons when it comes to combat itself. Most enemies are hitscan. But not brutal at least, with fair reaction and hitstunning. At least game varies it up by giving you melee super-weapon in early-mid game. Powered with Berserk it's a complete beast. And it's fun to just beat enemies who got too close. Or had back turned.\n\nCyberspace also playes pre-Descent. And it kinda sucks. As in, you can't strafe, you can't turn while keeping same direction of movement, you can just fly forward and shoot forward. But oh well, absolutely no Cyberspace is mandatory and game gives Pulsar V8 at start of final Cyberspace so you don't have to worry about grabbing items or destroying. Still fancy for it's time. Shame about gimmicky final boss though.\n\nOverall, while lacking in FPS qualities, it's awesome game for exploration and feeling rewarding due to lack of hand-holding in this seemingly complex game, while on practise being simpler than it appears. Still doesn't give you right to be all elitist gamer though, silly. Now go and ruin SHODAN's masterplan!

System Shock 1 is a game that will quickly draw you in. Ok, so the controls are a little clunky, but the enhanced edition addresses the worst of those issues. It's the story, gameplay and balance that drew me back to this game.\nI just played a runthrough to see how far I could get without saving. I died alone and scared in the dark as my sight patch failed when a cyborg was in the room on the second floor. Taking risks will likely get you killed.\n\nI digress. This game might not appeal to everyone, especially gamers that demand easy to use interfaces and precise control, but it does offer a strong and distinct challenge.

I booted up the 1st game to try it out, and I was immedietly hooked. You play as a hacker that woke up from a 6 month sleep on Citadel Station in space. The controls are weird at first, but once you master them you can easily travel through Citadel. You explore the different floors of the station trying to survive the endless waves of mutants, robots, cyborgs, and the evil AI Shodan that constantly tries to kill you and mankind with your limited resources. I prefer using my melee weapons and using little ammo and other resouces to survive then running and gunning through the game. You can run and gun, but it feels rewarding to stealthily use weaker weapons on enemies to save the powerful ones on tougher enemies.  As you make your way through the station stopping Shodan's plans of taking over mankind, you learn the backstory of many crew members of Citadel Station that fell to Shodan through data logs. The logs also serve as small hints and directions of what you must do. You must use your head to solve simple wiring puzzles and later find the right items and codes to advance. Some puzzles however, require specific and clever solutions that can be hard to solve without a guide. Even though I enjoyed finding the solutions to these puzzles, I had to use a guide for harder puzzles that were not properly explained. I normally don't like using guides but it would have taken me hours to find the obscure answers. You also travel to cyberspace to unlock things. Cyberspace has akward controls, but they work in its environment. The music in this game is also great. It fits every envirnment you travel to. Even though this is a horror game, it wasn't really scarry, but that didnt stop me from enjoying it. I love this game and I highly recommend it, but at times guides are needed for puzzels that were not really explained. If you like games that don't hold your hand with a challenge, than you will love System Shock. Everyone should at least give this game a try, but don't be afraid to use a guide if you get stuck. I give System Shock Enhanced Edition an 8/10 rating, with its unique controls, story, and gameplay.","June 2","true","24.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

All in all it's amazing and I HIGHLY reccomend it to any Classic fps fan.\n\nThe things I could see turn many people down is the massive complexity of the interface, the somewhat clunky controls (this steam version has the mouselook so it makes it MUCH MUCH MUUUUCHH better than the original controls, but it's still somewhat clunky) and the fact that this game does not hold your hand at all. You're never given objectives, you have to explore throughout the ship and read the audio logs to figure out how to unlock doors, disabling systems to progress to higher levels, ect. It's a very long and challenging game.\n\nAgain, overall I would say give this one a go.\nif you're STILL wondering if you should get this (for whatever reason) go look up some youtube videos of the gameplay or go watch LGR's video review of this game, he gives a perfect view on this game.\n\n10/10 would hack again ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)","February 13","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In rough comparison, the DOS version of System Shock requires DOSBox, or even MS-DOS in order to play it, but System Shock: Enhanced Edition has its said requirements utterly removed, and you are free to play without the DOS systems to do it.\n\nThe Negatives\n\nBecause the game is rather fun to play, there's a certain amount of flaws that I'd rather want to point out.\n\nI. Certain levels are rather semi-cryptic, and it always takes some time to know what to do, or else look up walkthrough videos or internet pages every time.\n\nFor example, the Enviro-Suit is locked inside Greg MacLeod's office, and you need to guess the keypad combination. I don't know how the player really needs to get the code from, just guess it! The code is 838. That shouldn't be necessary though. Who thought that this is a good idea? That's possibly the dumbest idea for a keypad puzzle ever. To be doubled, certain levels are mazes, which is considered to be the worst part of the game.\n\nII. Another striking example is the Reactor room where you first encounter the Security-2 and Flier-Bots. Once you've entered, you will quickly realize that the room is highly irradiated, and you need to upgrade your Enviro-Suit to resist the Radiation Poisoning, use Detoxication Stimulants and eventually you'll run out, or use cheats, which is not considered to be recommended, no matter how much you find it necessary. Now, you DO have a reviving machine or whatever it is, to help you, but you will always have to run to the reactor room every time you've been revived.\n\nThe Postive\n\nI. The in-game's functions, also known as controls, are rather strange, and takes some time to get used to, but once you've managed to get the hang of it, its epic. If you are feeling uncomfortable about the controls during combat, you can press e to enter shoot mode, also known as crosshair mode.\n\nII. The enemies and bosses are rather unique and interesting, especially the Cyborg Assassins, Cyborg Elite Guards, Virus Mutants, Cyborg Enforcers, and the Inviso-Mutants. In System Shock 2 however, the enemies from System Shock are no longer present, except for the Cyborg Assassins. I'd love to see all the enemies from System Shock to return in the third sequel as a retro throwback to the first System Shock game.\n\nIII. The music is rather hype-inducing, combined with synthesizers, technological ambiences, and much more. In consequence, the music is rather good to listen to.\n\nIV. From System Shock 1 to 2, the storyline is rather fantastic and unique, and the game does a great job in thrilling gamers, especially on how it brings the said games to life. I wont be writing the whole plot of the game here since its long, but you can look online and read for yourself, which is what I don't recommend due to spoilers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNeedless to say, System Shock is one of the best games ever made to make its way onto Steam as I've wished, but ingame, it only has a couple of negatives that are easily sprouting out like pond weeds, and they will smack your face repeatedly over and over and over again.\n\nFor those who are reading this review, its your optional choice, go play this game; and it will give you a retro throwback.

Very few games can capture the atmosphere and dispair this game can, and the only downfall, if I were pressed, would be the graphical engine could use a desparate upgrade. The sounds and music work quite well with the style, and i only regret that I can't use my old DOS computer to record better playback tracks, since Windows can't hold a candle to the good ol' AWE32 card. The enhanced edition helps a bit though to make the engine a bit more friendly, between mouselook and better movement controls, the game is now less taxing on the wrist than the original CDROM version.

Very few games can capture the atmosphere and dispair this game can, and the only downfall, if I were pressed, would be the graphical engine could use a desparate upgrade. The sounds and music work quite well with the style, and i only regret that I can't use my old DOS computer to record better playback tracks, since Windows can't hold a candle to the good ol' AWE32 card. The enhanced edition helps a bit though to make the engine a bit more friendly, between mouselook and better movement controls, the game is now less taxing on the wrist than the original CDROM version. Add to that the bonus content, and owning another copy of this fantastic classic became an instant no-brainer!","January 7","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In rough comparison, the DOS version of System Shock requires DOSBox, or even MS-DOS in order to play it, but System Shock: Enhanced Edition has its said requirements utterly removed, and you are free to play without the DOS systems to do it.\n\nThe Negatives\n\nBecause the game is rather fun to play, there's a certain amount of flaws that I'd rather want to point out.\n\nI. Certain levels are rather semi-cryptic, and it always takes some time to know what to do, or else look up walkthrough videos or internet pages every time.\n\nFor example, the Enviro-Suit is locked inside Greg MacLeod's office, and you need to guess the keypad combination. I don't know how the player really needs to get the code from, just guess it! The code is 838. That shouldn't be necessary though. Who thought that this is a good idea? That's possibly the dumbest idea for a keypad puzzle ever. To be doubled, certain levels are mazes, which is considered to be the worst part of the game.\n\nII. Another striking example is the Reactor room where you first encounter the Security-2 and Flier-Bots. Once you've entered, you will quickly realize that the room is highly irradiated, and you need to upgrade your Enviro-Suit to resist the Radiation Poisoning, use Detoxication Stimulants and eventually you'll run out, or use cheats, which is not considered to be recommended, no matter how much you find it necessary. Now, you DO have a reviving machine or whatever it is, to help you, but you will always have to run to the reactor room every time you've been revived.\n\nThe Postive\n\nI. The in-game's functions, also known as controls, are rather strange, and takes some time to get used to, but once you've managed to get the hang of it, its epic. If you are feeling uncomfortable about the controls during combat, you can press e to enter shoot mode, also known as crosshair mode.\n\nII. The enemies and bosses are rather unique and interesting, especially the Cyborg Assassins, Cyborg Elite Guards, Virus Mutants, Cyborg Enforcers, and the Inviso-Mutants. In System Shock 2 however, the enemies from System Shock are no longer present, except for the Cyborg Assassins. I'd love to see all the enemies from System Shock to return in the third sequel as a retro throwback to the first System Shock game.\n\nIII. The music is rather hype-inducing, combined with synthesizers, technological ambiences, and much more. In consequence, the music is rather good to listen to.\n\nIV. From System Shock 1 to 2, the storyline is rather fantastic and unique, and the game does a great job in thrilling gamers, especially on how it brings the said games to life. I wont be writing the whole plot of the game here since its long, but you can look online and read for yourself, which is what I don't recommend due to spoilers.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nNeedless to say, System Shock is one of the best games ever made to make its way onto Steam as I've wished, but ingame, it only has a couple of negatives that are easily sprouting out like pond weeds, and they will smack your face repeatedly over and over and over again.\n\nFor those who are reading this review, its your optional choice, go play this game; and it will give you a retro throwback. Enjoy.","January 31","true","102.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all it's amazing and I HIGHLY reccomend it to any Classic fps fan.\n\nThe things I could see turn many people down is the massive complexity of the interface, the somewhat clunky controls (this steam version has the mouselook so it makes it MUCH MUCH MUUUUCHH better than the original controls, but it's still somewhat clunky) and the fact that this game does not hold your hand at all. You're never given objectives, you have to explore throughout the ship and read the audio logs to figure out how to unlock doors, disabling systems to progress to higher levels, ect. It's a very long and challenging game.\n\nAgain, overall I would say give this one a go.\nif you're STILL wondering if you should get this (for whatever reason) go look up some youtube videos of the gameplay or go watch LGR's video review of this game, he gives a perfect view on this game.\n\n10/10 would hack again ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)","February 13","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nobody talks about System Shock.\n\nWhy? Well, probably because the game is old. It's got a 'complex' (clunky) user interface, its hard in the way only old school games are, it doesn't tell you what to do or how to do it. And for most, this is frustrating, and they stop playing.\n\nBut for some, this is what we really want from our games. A game that demands we search out and discover for ourselves. A game with an interface complex enough to let us interact with the world how we want to. And, even more so than its sequel, a game that truly was ahead of its time.\n\nProvided you can get over the doom-like graphics, there's an incredible experience here. One that's eerie, and scary, and tense, but also comical and cliche at times. The storytelling is immersive, and the atmosphere and space station totally sell the setting. It's adorably 90's cyberpunk in everything from the 'pew pew lasers' sound effects, to the admittedly awkward but totally awesome cyberspace segments, to your character himself, the 'Hacker'.\n\nSystem Shock is not a game for everyone. I admit that freely. It's clunky, ugly, and flawed. But I loved it, and if you're like me, you'll probably love it too.","May 30","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The initial section you begin in is quite boring, uses the same wall textures and you don't see the whole picture yet. But after exploring for a while, I started appreciating how they rendered the various sections of this huge space station in a rather convincing way and let you explore it with a lot more freedom than you're used to in modern shooters. Also: no dumb quest markers! You might get by just by exploring and picking stuff up, but if you don't actually listen to the audio logs you'll probably end up lost.\n\nYou also start picking up an interesting variety of equipment early on; enemies deal a lot of damage so it's more about using the right tool at the right time, you can't stand there and shoot at them. Some enemies are slow turning and you can actually melee them to death if you approach them from the back.\n\nThe game still has a lot of flaws though:\n- In-game help doesn't display the correct controls, for instance Tab would be supposed to switch weapons but it's Q. Oh and BTW you can't switch weapons with the number keys, which I find infuriating.\n- The movement is really too annoying, it gives you the impression of being stuck every time you try to strafe and go forward/backward at the same time.\n- Picking up loot is incredibly tedious, every other corpse has one or two tiny boosters to manually double-click and drag to your inventory, and you have to also turn mouselook off/on to perform this task.\n- The music is sometimes silly, which goes against the sinister atmosphere.\n- The graphics of beam weapons you fire can appear to hit a wall but still hit enemies, I still have a hard time figuring out if I can hit an enemy even if a small part of him sticks out.\n\nThe story is so far rather run-of-the-mill, several games notably the famous Portal have taken inspiration from this game for their evil AI, so that part doesn't impress.\n\nOverall so far my opinion is positive but only slightly, it could improve depending on how the game evolves. 6/10","December 4, 2015","true","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You'd think something claiming to be an "Enhanced" edition would at least let you reconfigure controls. It doesn't. The controls were the #1 problem with SS and these people can't even bother to fix it in the "enhanced" edition. Sure, you can select from 3 different control layouts (original, left handed, and enhanced) which is about 50% better than the original controls, but you're stuck using the controls that the devs want you to (you can edit the cfg file to change SOME of the controls, if you can figure it out, which is why I say upgraded to 1998: it looks like a less self explanitory Quake cfg file). And you're completely screwed with mouselook if you use mouselook properly (What the COD kiddies call "inverted".  You're tilting a f-ing camera, push forward to tilt down! What's wrong with you people?)\n\nOtherwise, the interface is as clunky as ever.

I respect its age, but in this case unfortunately, the controls were too bad to handle. Even if it controlled well and had the graphics it has now, I would love it. I have heard that this is a marvelous and that makes me pumped for the remake that is being done right now. Unless you want to struggle through bad controls, I would not reccomend this game.\n\nPros:\nRetro\nSupposedly great game when it came out\n\nCons:\nCONTROLS!\n\nWait for the remake. Check out some videos of it and you will get super pumped. I know that I am excited. I rate this game an unplayable/10.\n\n\n###### Please disregard this review for now. At the time of writing, I didn't know how to change camera controls. As soon as I play this game longer, I will rewrite my review.","May 3","false","0.2"," 3 of 22 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","3","22","0","5"
