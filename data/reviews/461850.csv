"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sv4r0g/recommended/461850/","sv4r0g","Kozmo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sv4r0g/","1556 products in account","Short IntroI don't like puzzles much, and i chose to give this game a try because i wanted to see if someone like me can have fun with it.\nThe result? You sure can!\nAlso, for those that aren't familiar with my reviews, i am mostly reviewing the technical aspects of a game, as i believe that pretty much everything else is subjective.\n\nAbrix the Robot is a cute puzzle game where each level you have to move containers and make your way through the exit.\n\nSome aspects of the game overallThe levels in the game are organized by difficulty (Five categories of difficulties), and you want to know the best part? You can create your own, or download more from the Steam Workshop\nThe Workshop integration is very important as the game will never get boring this way.\nI tested the level editor myself a bit, and i played with it for 20-30 minutes. My verdict? It is damn easy to use and everything is just point and click!\n\nGameplaySo, you kept hearing and kept hearing about the basic idea, now it's time to get more into it!\n\nThe containers you have to move to finish the level are of multiple types, you can destroy two of them of the same type by pushing them, you can already imagine how this can be tricky.\nSometimes you get to use some nice lasers to aid you into destroying containers that you can't really move.\nSometimes to clear up the arena a bit you have to use either a beautiful six pack of dynamite either a fireball, both are fun to use! (Dynamite bringing more joy, while the fireball is more useful as it can destroy multiple containers)\n\nIt can be painful, it can be easy, and the most important, it can be However you want!, due to the Level Editor mentioned before.\nThe controls might seem just a bit weird, but it's not the controls themselves but the isometric style of the game can make them seem so.\nIn my opinion, the game being isometric is what makes it a good puzzle game, but i will leave everyone else have their own opinion on this since personal taste can be easily applied in this case.\n\nAnother thing i liked is that you 'move' the arena itself on the screen, and maybe i am a bit too fastidious but i would like if you could also rotate/zoom it.\n\nAs someone that isn't much of a puzzler, i can safely say i had fun in this game and probably you'll have some too!\n\nMusicI didn't enjoy the music in the game much, not that it is bad, but because it is too generic and too casual, and sometimes it can be repetitive a bit.\nThat being said, the music is very far from 'bad'.\n\nProsLevel Editor and Workshop, which can bring basically infinite fun if this game gets under your skin!\nAddicting and entertaining for all ages\nCute robot!\nConsThe music is a bit too generic, but not bad!\nIt can get you a bit dizzy at first because of the isometric aspect (To be honest, i won't count this as a 'con', because all games can be a bit weird at first. I just felt this part was too 'empty')\nYou can kill the poor bloody cute robot if you fall into the water!\nJokes and fun aside, this is a game i'd recommend for all ages, whether you are a puzzle enthusiast or not. Except few small and unharmful glitches, i never had any game-breaking bug or a crash.\nIt's an underrated game that i hope will raise in popularity!\n\nI give this game a solid 80/100","May 20","true","4.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/461850/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Abrix the robot is a cute and enjoyable isometric puzzle game with Steam Workshop where you must help Abrix escape from various rooms that gradually increase in difficulty.\n\nYou start as Abrix who is a robot who seems to get himself trapped an awful lot, and you must escape each room using your own wits and sometimes a few bonus power-ups to help you.\nThe game starts rather easy, each room has an exit that you must navigate to but you'll find various things blocking you along the way. The main thing Abrix will encounter are boxes of various colours and these can be pushed around and destroyed by pushing them into another box of the same colour which sounds pretty simple right? Well it's not, trust me. Each level must be completed within a time limit as Abrix will fall to pieces if you fail.\n\nBoxes aren't your only challenge in Abrix the Robot, you'll also encounter crates and barrels which can only be moved around or destroyed using a laser, fireball, bomb or dynamite. Running out of time isn't the only danger you'll find, some levels also have Lava which will destroy Abrix if he steps into it (but also any boxes, barrels or crates) and water which can only be crossed using a bridge (bridges will collapse if used too many times). There are various power-ups to help you through certain levels including an undo which will reverse your last move, a save which saves the state of the current room and you may revert to it once, a fireball which destroys everything in its path (even the exit so be careful), dynamite which will destroy a single crate/box barrel and a few more. These not only add an extra difficulty to some levels but they make you think a lot more than you would; sometimes a power-up will seem useful only to find out you actually need it for something else.\n\nThe levels are split into difficulty rooms and each difficulty room contains around 10 levels. Once a level is completed you'll be given a score based on the time it took you, how many steps you took, how many power-ups you collected and used, the amount of blocks destroyed and coins you collected. You can revisit a level at any time once you've completed it to try and better your score and doing so will give you more EXP. EXP is spent unlocking new levels so it's better to try and get as much EXP on the lower levels as you can to allow you to skip the harder ones if you're truly stuck.\nThere is also the editor which will allow you to create your own level that you can share with others via Steam Workshop. The editor is easy to use and I created my own little easy chamber in ten minutes which was fun and it was my first ever upload to the Steam Workshop. It wasn't long before I found myself thinking up another level and creating it thought this one was a little harder and took maybe 20 minutes, but once again the editor was very easy to use.(You can check my second chamber out here). Being able to create and download new levels is a huge plus and adds tons of re-playability even though the game already has loads of content already that I haven't even completed. It also allows you to play some easier custom levels when you get stuck so you don't feel like you constantly have to repeat hard levels you aren't understanding.\n\nAbrix isn't for the easily annoyed though, as the levels are very challenging and do require thought and planning ahead. There is no undo button besides the power-ups that are found rarely and some mistakes will require you to start over. Though this frustrated me at first I very quickly realised I needed to take a moment and actually analyse each level before just rushing into what seemed obvious. Since levels are locked one by one using EXP you don't have to worry because if you really are stuck you should have enough EXP after a few levels to skip one and come back at a later date.\n\nThe only thing I find a little off-putting about Abrix is the isometric design of the game but this is 100% personal taste. With puzzle games that require accuracy I find an isometric layout makes me misclick a lot more than I'd want and due to the fact that one misclick can make you restart and entire stage I found myself restarting a few times when I started playing. There are also some hidden walls which are much much harder to see because of this, but once I got used to it it wasn't much of a problem. I has a small issue with the explosion animation killing me after it looked like it was over but after a post asking the devs about this they explained the last frame is almost invisible but they are changing it in the next updated (within a week) which is fantastic and shows dedication to the game from the developer.\n\nOverall Abrix the Robot is a fantastic little puzzle game with a charming soundtrack and plenty of levels to keep you busy. Though lacking in story the puzzles more than make up for it and with Steam Workshop to create and play others creations you'll find yourself with hours of enjoyment.","May 10","true","8.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","1"

I not as patient as I would like to be but sometimes I like to play puzzle games and try to get over that lack of patience.\n\nThis is an "enjoyable" isometric game, but if you like this kind of games I'm sure you'll love it.\n\nAbrix the Robot game is really tricky game. Here you are a tiny robot, wich reminded me as Rosie from the Jetsons, you have to make de clean up! All rooms are full of boxes and you have to move them to pass and get to the exit. But those boxes will get into a maze once you start to pass the levels. And if you think the beginners are difficult, just check the hard ones!\n\n\nGameplay\n\nFirst, the controls are simple but as being an isometric game maybe you'll suffer a little at the beginning about how to move the robot, but you'll get it fast.\n\nThis game is organized by five levels of difficulty. Most are full of lava, laser beams and things you'll suffer a lot. I promise. I couldn't reach those levels but I love to watch Abrix the Robot  teaser trailer  and dream about playing the hardest ones.\n\nAs I said before, you use the robot moving the boxes and containers to reach the exit. The problem is not all of them are the same and think well how you would use the boxes, maybe you can pass destroying them but maybe you'll gonna need some of them to reach other boxes and then the exit. I had to restart the level several times because I destroyed the items.  Take your time but not a lot, there's a clock and you have  a countdown against you. So, be quick!\n\nSome of the exit gates are closed, and there is a key to open them so get the key first ad then go to the exit.\n\nAlso, there are extra items you can collect when you are playing a level and use them , like bonus time, going backwards,  floppy disks that save the room status, and other interesting ones.\n\nNot all containers could be moved so if you get a laser beam, use it! It's a consumable item, don't forget that.\n\nDynamite is an extra item too, and you'll remember the famous Bomberman. Just try not to get so close to the explosion or you will be exterminated.\n\nDo yu like to have workshop items? Well, here you have the chance of creating your own levels! There's a level editor that allows you to create the most complicated levels and share with the Abrix the Robot community. It's quite simple to use and you gonna love it.\n\nOf course, I cannot forget the music! The game has a great music with some "retro" style. And about graphics, you know isometric style. You gonna like it.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAll levels are difficult from my "lack of patience" viewpoint but just get some time and you'll pass them. It's a good game to gain mind agility, or that's my excuse to play these games after all. I really recommend it, I'm sure you will enjoy this great game!","May 25","true","4.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

If you have some free time and don't know what to play, you can play one or two levels from this game. There is always a challenge here, the puzzles are not easy. But that's good, I'm bored puzzle games that are to be beaten in 15 minutes.\nAnd I love the achievements, most of them are indicating progress often and you know how far are you from finishing it.\nGraphics is also ok, a little old-looking but that's not a problem in such game.\nThis a Yes from me.","April 30","true","73.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

But be careful, you may destroy the exit in the process!\n\nThe good:\n-Given that the game seems quite simple on first view, I was happily surprised by, even, the easy levels, each adding something new, be it a mechanic or obstacle.\n-It is a lot harder than it seems. I had to restart quite many levels because of a miscalculation that I would not need a certain block. It put my brain to work a lot more times than I expected, given that I have played a fair share of puzzle games.\n-It has a great difficulty increase curve! I 've played all easy and most of the medium puzzles but for the sake of this review I had try hard ones and I was not disappointed! And there is also extreme difficulty!\n-Easygoing and hardcore! By this I mean that you can play a puzzle now and another in two days or whenever, the mechanics are fairly simple and can be easily be remembered by the time you get into the level. Hardcore because each level has a time limit and score points. By finishing a level you earn Exp depending of your performance, there are certain bonuses here, like 'no undo' or 'more than 50% of initial time left', Exp are used to unlock other levels. I had to replay a level quite many times to improve my performance and get some bonuses so I could at least gain more Exp than the levels unlock cost!\n-It supports steam workshop! And while at the moment the game is relatively new, there are already some jewels made by users!\n\n\nThe bad:\n-For me this game has only 1 issue. The explosion animations feel wrong. When you explode something the boom happens (normally:p) and then you have to wait for the smoke to clear in order to move in the cleared spot. However the last frame of the explosion feels misleading and given the timed nature of the game, I died quite many times while I thought it was safe to proceed.\n\n\nThe ugly:\n(By ugly I mention stuff that are either weird, don't directly affect gameplay or can be get used to)\n-If you play on windowed mode, any resolution besides the native, will result in main menu buttons going partially off screen.\n-The isometric grid may confuse people, each grid title is a box that you can move into, essentially it is the space a box covers, but each of these grids, has an unneeded smaller grid in it. It is the 'art' used for the floor and can get your movement messed up.\n-No controller support. Given its simple controls, it would benefit greatly by adding this feature.","May 8","true","11.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"
