I would like to see the developer add at least steam workshop with a map editor so the community can create custom maps, later on add randomized maps, multiplayer and so on. But would I recommend the game? I would, it costs less than a burger and you have a small game that will keep you busy for some time and besides you would support the develop to develop the game further or if not create a better version.","March 5","true","0.6"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","26","39","0","0"
