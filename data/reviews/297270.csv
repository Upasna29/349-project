Today they released the Full Release.  Honestly, i am shocked... This is not a complete game, or at least not worth anywhere near the price they are asking.  I have only played about 20 minutes because i still encounter game breaking bugs.  The devs in the forums listed all these ideas they had for the game... then just released without them and said "if the game sells, we would like to add this stuff in updates".  That is just not how you conduct yourself.  Isn't that why you were in EA to begin with, to get money to make your game? Instead no one bought it, so its just a big F.U. to the people who did?  Simply put, this game isn't even worth the 50% off its on sale for right now.\n\n(update 5/28) 4 months later.... a new update.  Complete with game breaking bugs.. STILL.  It pains me to be so rude to a couple guys in a garage trying to live out a dream, but honestly, they are just really not doing their job,  there is just no way around it.  There is zero reason to buy Exodus Wars as of now, and clearly, thats the way it is going to stay.\n\n(update) Furthermore, here is another  quote from the developer...\n\n"We had to leave much of the Exodus Wars universe and its units out of scope for the Release version of Fractured Empire. We very much hope we have the chance to bring more of those units, along with the relevant mechanics (e.g. artillery) into the game, but with the limited budget we had, we needed to draw the line somewhere as to which units we could include in the initial scope"\n\nFirst off, since when is "Release" a version? Sure, after release should be patches, balancing fixes, ya know , all the normal post-release things. You do not make a 1/4 of the game then release it lol\n\nI orignally felt kind of bad about this review.  The big red thumbs down as your first review with an 80% helpful rating tends to be a nail in the coffin for many steam indie games.  However, after reading the comments from devs in forums, seeing the lack of progression, constantly seeing devs refer to their budget as a crutch for making a terrible game, i no longer feel bad.","January 30, 2015","false","0.3"," 114 of 137 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","114","137","5","2"

This game could turn into something very interesting given the addition of multiplayer.  10 missions and skirmish isn't going to keep my interest very long at all.  Especially given that the forces are a couple types of infantry, and light/med/heavy tanks.  All missions are "hold objective zone".  Let me put it this way, I've won the first three games I've played in 4 turns, because I rush the flags and sit on them.\n\nWave this one off, and circle back when they've finished the content.

The two factions available are effectively elite imperial guard troops plus their tank and super heavy tank support, vs Penal Legion imperial Guard with Titan Legions / Knight Titan support.\n\nFor those not familiar with Games Workshop games, its basically the Total War series battles, but turn based where each side takes it in turns to move one set of troops. One side has huge tanks and men in armour, one side has big robots and poorly armed conscripts.\n\nThe Good:\n\nIt’s a genuine recreation of table-top mechanics, with morale, % to hit, armour, turns, army deployment, objectives, overwatch, cover. No stupid ultra detailed rules that can plague tabletop rules and require extensive learning - things do what you expect them to..\nBuild your own army, based on their points costs (price to buy) etc.\nIntuitive simple mechanics\nBalanced factions and units.\nScale – this is war between armies and massive war machines, not squads.\nResponsive dev team – they are active of the forums and have implemented feedback from the community in the alpha tests.\nThe maps and infantry look good.\nPerforms well on low-end pc\n\nThe Bad: (written when game in early access alphs testing phase)\n\nBugs. Mostly visual rather than game-breaking, e.g. unit facing the wrong way.\nLimited number of unit types per side. - 4 different units on one side, 6 on the other.\nOnly two factions - both are human. i think there are aliens in the IP, dont know if they will make it into the game\nNo online multiplayer - but it is planned\nNo army painter (first world problems)\nThe vehicle models are presumably placeholders and need to be upgraded to the same level as the infantry models.\n\nOverall\n\nThe core feel of table top warfare is clearly there, the graphics wont set the world alight but they are up to Total war standard and its a strategy game afterall. It just needs more units, multiplayer, and some bug crunching which we will hopefully get over the next few months, and then we’ve got a great game,","October 3, 2014","true","10.8"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","30","37","0","1"

It has the potential to be a great version of a tabletop battle game. It is set in the future, and the battles take place on various worlds. You control an army, built up of various infantry and mechanised units. The different units have different points values, and each battle you have a set number of points to make up your army from. Just like a tabletop battle game, and this game is a PC version of the tabletop battle game Exodus wars.The game lets you see the results of all the dice rolls, which is great for a fan of tabletop battle games.

The AI will stubbornly keep half of it's force on the other side of the map whilst you decimate the other half with your whole army. It also fails to identify threats and will spend time shooting at weak unthreatening units whilst your powerful units are decimating theirs.\n\nUnfortunately there is a lot to like about this game but because singleplayer is the only option and the AI is so predictable it fails to deliver what it could. However if the AI Improves and/or a multiplayer and coop gamemode was released. I'd recommend this game in a moment.\n\n\nPro's:\nThe game seems relatively well balanced.\nThere is lots of room for expansion.\nThe mechanics behind the game are interesting whilst not too complex.\n\nCons:\nNo multiplayer gameplay.\nUnintelligent AI.\n\nAwareness:\nThe UI is not bad but can be quirky.\nThe graphics and animations in the game are quite basic so if graphics are very important to you, you may be disappointed.","February 17, 2015","false","3.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The gameplay took some getting used to however in that your units will first have to pass a roll check before they move to where you want them to go.  The sound effects and animations are very basic right now and clicking/moving "formations" can be trivial at times.  The number of unit types available are also pretty limited at present and the game has a tendency to "break" on me halfway through a match.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/macroeido/recommended/297270/","macroeido","MacroEido","http://steamcommunity.com/id/macroeido/","255 products in account","What is it?\n\nExodus Wars: Fractured empire is a turn based strategy game.  The ambitious result of taking an established tabletop and miniature ruleset and optimising it for electronic gameplay.  Tabletop players, of which I only identify as a casual player, tend to be a very rules focused bunch and it is clear that the Membraine team have exposed their tabletop gaming roots by their faithful implementation of the Exodus Wars rules and units.  This results in an easy to pick up, hard to master, strategy game with a few twists.\n\nHow does it play?\n\nThe game focuses on formations, rather than individual units, requiring you to activate an move them across the battlefield with reasonably tight constraints on movement and actions.  Victory is also primairly determined by controlling locations on the field, as opposed to destroying or defeating your opponent.  As a result this places a much greater emphasis on positioning and placement of your formations rather than straight out combat.\n\nGames are also limited to four turns, and can be even shorter if you control the victory locations.  While I understand this is primarily a tabletop constraint, where each turn can take several minutes to measure and move all your formations.  As this is all handled automatically by EW:FE the battles are sometimes over just as I'm getting set up.  That being said, I've found it a great game to pick up for a quick battle when I have a few moments to spare.\n\nThe emphasis on victory positions vs straight out combat is another positive shift from the tactical gameplay of other computer strategy games to the deep strategic gameplay of the tabletop rules.  You're almost forced to consider formation placement and control of the victory points.  Spend too much time focusing on destroying enemy formations and they'll win by capturing the battlefield.\n\nWhat about controls?\n\nThere is a simple mouse point and click interface for most formations and actions with mouse-overs for detailed formation stats.  Membraine have done a pretty good job of showing formation feedback and status and the overall victory status of the battlefield. It is accessible and simple to use, however I do miss some of the more advanced UI elements like radial command menus and right click context menus from other titles.\n\nIt looks a bit complex!\n\nWhile initially intimidating, EW:FE does a good job of trying to bring you up to speed with the core rules the game is based on.  Most of the well established strategy precepts of infantry and armor and their relative effectiveness against different unit types is present in the detailed unit statistics, if not extensively explained.  Fortunately a few skirmish matches and experimentation during play sored out what did what pretty quickly.\n\nHow does it look and run.\n\nI understand the game is based on Unity and so it runs and looks good on my platform.  The units, when zoomed in, are beautifully modelled and detailed but are an almost missed detail considering you spend most of your time zoomed out looking at the whole battlefileld.  The battlefields are well textured and detailed with cover and concealment, but I do find myself wishing for more diversity; a ruined cityscape, enemy fortification or capturing a starbase.  Hopefully Membraine will consider this for any expansions or updates in the future.\n\nAny downsides?\n\nOne aspect I wasn't used to was that each formation has a chance of not "activating" or not following your orders. In most computer strategy games you click on a unit, give it orders and off it goes.  While initially surprising and frustrating, it is another tactical element of the tabletop game which a player needs to be aware of, that formations may be unable or unwilling to execute your orders. Once you understand it, the activation rule becomes another layer in the overall  strategic outcome.\n\nFinal thoughts.\n\nOverall, Membraine have done a highly faithful and realistic conversion of the Exodus Wars tabletop game and ruleset, but they have also taken the opportunity to streamline the command system and interface for rapid gameplay.  This improves upon some of the slower tabletop elements like measuring, dice rolling and referring to manuals to compare unti stats and combat outcomes.  This, in my opinion, provdes the best of both worlds; solid rules and gameplay simplified and accessible gameplay interface.\n\nI am interested in where the developers go from there.  Expansion campaings, additional units and battlefields, more sophisticated victory conditions, perhaps even online multiplayer.  Well done guys...\n\n","February 1, 2015","true","15.3"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

Together with the games other unusual rules,  it feels like it's more faithful to the challenges a real battle field commander would face, and it gives you a unique wargaming experience.\n* At least for the parts of the game that are well polished,  the production values seem outstandingly good for an indie developer.\n*  No significant bugs at all  (At least not for me, Im on Win 8.1)\n* Nice music and good ingame sounds (could do with more variation though)\n\nNeutral:\n* The UI is ok but far from excellent.  Took me about an hour to learn the controls, unlike say Armageddon 4000 where I was up and running in 3 mins.

The only bright side is that the development team learned some lessions when making this, which means either they will make a better game or stop making games all together","February 5","false","0.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
