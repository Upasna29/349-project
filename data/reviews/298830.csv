"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/recommended/298830/","Submarine_Argument","Submarine_Argument","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/","397 products in account","Millennium 3 is the 3rd installment of the 5 part Millennium series.  Yes, that means you should probably start with the first one.  That being said, each part is different.  The main character remains the star but the story stays fresh with a blend of characters from the first two along with some new recruits.  You can import your save game from 1 to 2 to 3 etc. and you get to keep your gear so that makes the series more rewarding.\n\nThe plot in M3 is quite enjoyable.  The level design is nice and includes some big dungeons.  So far, I found the characters in 3 the most interesting.  There is also a lot of humor in the game with funny dialogue between characters.  The main difference between 3 and the first 2 is that M3 uses a lot more side scrolling maps.  At first, I found it a bit strange but you get used to it and it adds some visual variety and some fun jumping adventures for Marine.  Otherwise, the plot is building up to the tourney at the end.\n\nThe game has a lot of achievements that are fun to get.  If you are an achievement hunter, play the series on hard mode.  It's not too bad (I typically do not play games on hard mode) and you'll get a lot of extra achievements for it.\nIf you're on the fence about this game, keep in mind that on Adorlea's official site you can play a demo of the full game that lets you play the actual game for 1 hour.   I would recommend that you start with Millennium 1 however.  You can play each game as a stand-alone, but it will be harder and the plot / characters won't be as meaningful.\n\nOverall, Millennium 3 is a very fun third part of a great rpg series.  Aldorlea's RPGs remind me of SNES rpgs, which I consider the golden age of RPGs. (Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy III, Earthbound, etc.)   If you enjoy character driven rpgs with some humor, you can't go wrong with the Millennium series.\n\n","March 15, 2015","true","23.0"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

The fights in the main part of the game are more about tactics than raw statistics of your characters. Every enemy in the main part of the game has a specific weakness that you need to target to be able to do any meaningful damage and all the different negative states you are capable of inflicting feel useful as they can enable you to fight opponnets that you should not be fighting yet. The only enemies the different states don't work against well are the extra bosses specifically the animal kings bt those ae meant to be had to beat even on much highelvels.\nThe game uses a bit of rpg maker rtp sprites, but I don't think that is bad as frankly a lot of them are good. The overall atmosphere of the game is well made, different locales feel different and especially the underground portions make you feel like you are underground.\n(this part is extremely subjective) There are some fun mechanics in the game connected to some of the characters but I will not speak of those as that could spoil the game. (this part is extremely subjective)\nOverall the game is enjoyable and plays quiet well.","September 6, 2014","true","11.2"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","19","27","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynadiad/recommended/298830/","ladynadiad","ladynadiad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ladynadiad/","967 products in account","So now we're at the third game of the series and after the events of the second game, Marine is now left without her very very useful fairy companion and only has five out of thirteen warriors and not much time left along with not many places left to explore.\n\nThe third game picks up where the 2nd left off.  Also, this time you get to keep the characters you recruited in the second game for the whole adventure.  You'll also be able to pick up Hirado for part of the game and Karine until the ending.\n\nOne thing that is different in this game is a good chunk of the dungeons are more side scrolling and you jump from place to place.  There are still dungeons that are the more traditional top down view as well.\n\nOverall, this game has a much more solid story and more interesting characters than the second game had and one of the better endings.  This is a lot more solidly recommended than the second game was and overall the 3rd and 5th games are probably the best in the whole series, with the 4th being close behind.  This is definitely where the series starts to shine.\n\nOverall pros:\n+The side scrolling perspective is pretty neat and changing things up makes things more interesting\n+Definitely a lot more customization is possible here and there are multiple solid parties to have.\n+The lack of Jeanne for the game actually does make it more challenging and you have to change up your tactics.\n+A very good plot for this game to add to the overarching one.\n\nNeutral points: (Stuff that may be good to some and not so good to others)\n&The banter between Jack and James.  It can be considered funny to some, but may be grating to others.\n&For a large chunk of this game it seems like Marine is being distracted from her quest to help Jack and Salome and it's repeatng the same issues as the second game had.  It actually ended up being to her benefit, but we won't find out why until the beginning of the fourth game.\n\nOverall cons:\n-If you are importing, the cap to imported characters is even more annoying in this game.  The biggest annoyance was having to spend a good amount of time to get Abu back his Cure KO ability.  That does give this game a slower start than the second had.\n-If you are a completionist, this game has some very annoying missables.\n-There's a really annoying bug that randomly unequips the Eternity Trident from Salome late in the game and it can happen at very frustrating points.  Make sure to check after every battle to ensure she's still got it equipped because if she goes back to human form, you have to rest to get her back to mermaid form.\n\nAlso a note on this game's official guide as well.  The guide for this game is the worst of the series.  It's worth getting on sale because it does have some useful tips and the maps are great to have.  However, expect to also have to look elsewhere for quests and secret rooms since those aren't all detailed in the guide.  Also, the guide posted on Steam is a great supplement to help with 100%ing the game.\n\nSo overall, very solid entry and after playing this one I can see why the series is so well regarded and very much recommended.","July 16, 2015","true","19.4"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","2"

Thus I'll just write something about the differences:\n\nThe game is "darker" the previous ones. Places like dark underground mines certainly feels more atmospheric than anything in Millennium 1 or 2. I definitively loved it. More of the maps are now also made for jumping and the vertical movement, i.e. they are different from the "classical" 2 maps. And trust me, some of the jumping passages are totally crazy and highly enjoyable.\nSince the time for Marine gets shorter, the story and pace feels more pressing. You get some new characters, and especially two of them are hilarious.\n\nOther than that, the length is similar, battles are maybe a little bit harder, and you get another "batch" of quests, animal kings and secret rooms. Once again, my verdict is a sound recommended.","August 31, 2014","true","2.0"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","2"

And with all the achievements available, it almost seems like a new experience.\nThe game itself continues to get better with each installment in the series, and this one features beautiful, fantastic artwork, some new mechanics, lots of side quests, and more characters that are more developed. Yes, the series just gets better and better.\n\nThe game is quite long with so much to do that it could seem a bit daunting, but I assure you it is not. The story is so well written that everything comes together beautifully, and, of course, will leave you waiting for the next installment.\n\nThere are elements that expand Marine's ongoing character development that fit perfectly into the telling of the tale, and many surprises in the story itself.\n\nIt's a gorgeous game with extremely high production value, well written  by the makers of some of the very best rpgs out there of which this series is a prime and completely recommended example. At this price, you can't find better value for the money spent, and I would urge anyone to give this one a go ---- in fact, I would say to start with the first one and play them all!!\n\n","August 31, 2014","true","0.2"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","17","31","0","0"

K.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973230221/","3588 products in account","Part 3 of 5. CARE SPOILERS!!!!!! This time you travel with a big group to the north east, the orc area and the forbidden zone. This time you can play with merline and later you get for a short an old face in a secret room (if you dont miss him) Hirado is back and how should it be, he understands very well with Abu. You have again very nice levels a higher path, a coast, a cave, a pit, orc fort and after that you met 2 old face again Jack and James (the girls greatest nightmares) and after that you find a very sympathic mermaid and last but not least you get an old face again. Karine is back and how should it be, Abu and Karine likes both too. So with a great little army we go trough the 3rd swamp that is absolutly different from the other 2 before and then we get a another ancient temple that is different from the 2 other before, too. The finish means a soul dessert and the castle.\n\nSo its again 40 quests, this time no teddy, some are the same like game too (poxed, cure, missable) and other quests in quests again, 13 are to defeat the epic design and some very hard animal kings (yeah this time 5 more then in 1 and 2). Really nice challenges, some are really frustrating even with best set up of the best weapon from 3 games but with the right strategy, items and levels possible to defeat, i really love this 13 bosses + the story line bosses. The secret rooms are again really nice designed like 2 or better i find (not all). There is many things everywhere to find and so much missable if you dont search every wall piece for piece, sure you dont need them but they are most helpful.\n\nThe normal enemy design is most time nice like flying sharks and many others, sure you miss some others and at the end of the enemys are really tough again but so many characters you will get the best set up. The story about a werwolf, mermaid and a great final battle. It has a bit of Oz (Robot, Lion and a beautiful water scarecrow (Joke). I enjoy it and happy to be able to start part 4 today. I hope you have your fun too and enjoy it and support this game. The developer is great you should play the first 3 parts and before i forget the last quests of the lost L. there a few hints to other games like take me higher quest,  3 stars of destiny and maybe even more.\n\nSo take care at the start you can miss 3 secret rooms, dont blow the orc fort, be careful in the castle with secret rooms and animal kings and enjoy it. The little weak points. There could be a bit more levels, shops, enemys (to much bee types but there would be so much more possible animals rhinos, elefants, hippos, squirrels and co.) but only little critic points. I miss the wallpapers again and the guide miss a secret room, quest guide but the quality is fine you see levels, enemy weaknesses and a straight guide in combination with a online guide you are well prepared (only hidden items you need find yourself sherlock :) I enjoy this game even you must really take care at the quests in quests every time very well i give this game 9.6 of 10 points for all who love or will love 2 D RPG games, test it and i hope you enjoy it. Look a lets play/ review and decide yourself but give it a chance to becharm you.
