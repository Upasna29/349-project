In exchange you get a bridge that is really yours. A bridge that could probably stand in reality as well. Other bridge builders compared to this are more like making a sketch of a bridge and some invisible engineers do the rest of the work. Here it is more of the real task of basic building.","October 19, 2015","true","24.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

It provides you with a variety of tools which allows you to build good bridges. The graphics are not next-gen but this still doesn't affect the gameplay, after all it is mostly about the physics which is done very well.\n\nPros:\n\n- Good physics engine; needed for a game like this.\n- The vehicle is easy to drive, and provides an interior and exterior view.\n- The tutorials are detailed and teach about the game easily.\n\nCons:\n\n- The camera can sometimes be awkward, but easily can get used to it.\n- The graphics can be improved, but again, that is not the point of the game.\n\nOverall, I feel this is a very good game. There are regular updates, keeping the game fun and playable. Would recommend.","May 25, 2015","true","3.4"," 13 of 31 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","13","31","0","0"

The player has to learn how to operate, but more help you can't expect.\nIt also seems to get updated on a regular basis, which means that the developer(s) still actively working on it.\nOverall, I find the implementation of a Bridge game well done, other than the usual sandbox games where you only have colored cubes available.\nI'll probably spend a couple of hours, mainly because it gets quite tricky in the advanced levels.","April 16, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","9","27","2","0"
