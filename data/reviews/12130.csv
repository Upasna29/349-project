He said that he really wanted the game. So, I went and bought the Wii version of it for him. I gave the game to him and watched him play. I was astonished at how good the graphics were and how kid-friendly the game is. I was so proud of him when he acted out the murders of multiple people on the screen. My favorite was when he wrapped the telephone wire around one of the character's neck and choke him to death. After he was done with the game, I tried it out and loved it. The thrill of a kill is amazing. I am recommending to every parent here to buy Manhunt 2 for their children.

Manhunt has brought me many moments of terror and countless adrenaline rushes, and it would probably still do that if I were to play it today. Despite how controversial the game is because of it's content, it's not any worse than most of the games that kids are still currently playing.

He finds this out from a voice over the intercom. The voice (Brian Cox) is that of the "director" and he next tells our antihero to put in an earpiece so that all future communications are quiet. The game being played is "the most dangerous" one and if he survives the night, he will supposedly be let free. The catch is that the "director" is filming everything, not only for his own sadistic pleasure but to create snuff films to sell to his elite customers. And what snuff films they are! He directs you on what to do so that his productions turn out to be top quality, as well as gets rather excited himself for each successful murder. As you creep about the prepared areas, you find various gang members who are getting paid to hunt you down. Of course, you turn the tables on them. Using a plethora of weaponry such as plastic bags, shards of glass, bats, and crowbars (and much more, plus guns in later levels), you sneak up on a thug and kill them. Brutally. In fact, each weapon has three levels of mayhem, depending on how long you can hold down the button while tracking them. After releasing the button, the screen turns into a home video-type view and you watch the execution unfold. A bat at level three has you choke the guy until he unconsciously falls to his knees, then you crack him full swing in the head, realistically spraying skull, brain, and blood against a wall. A glass shard allows you to stab your prey directly in the face several timesblood splatters on the screen. You get the idea. All this carnage actually relies on stealth and quietude, which makes the game all the more disturbingly somber. The graphics, sound, and music are all quite fitting. Anyway, I'm not much of a gamer anymore but I still may occasionally pick up a game if it catches my eye. Manhunt is a pretty cool game despite a plot dealing with sadistic voyeurism and its overall graphic and disturbing nature. In fact, that's what makes it interesting to play.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSound: 9/10\nChallenge: 9/10\nOverall: 8.8/10\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\n+ Great dark atmosphere designed to evoke claustrophobia and paranoia\n+ Great use of lighting and the 'dark spots' blend in neatly with their surroundings\n+ Looks great artistically as well as technically.\n+ Cleverly crafted minimalist soundtrack that sets just the right mood of eeriness\n+ Great darkly humorous dialogue from nearly all the non-playable characters in the game\n+ Nicely implemented, stealthy trial-and-error gameplay that requires brains\n- During certain levels, particularly shootouts, the difficulty feels unnecessarily tweaked\n- HUD is quite minimal, and the "Hardcore" difficulty in the game features no HUD at all..\n- Despite its sheer depth, the game is extremely linear.\n________________________________________________\nHow to run Manhunt on Windows Vista, XP, 7, 8, 8.1, 10\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=232805014\n_______________________________________________\n"You are a Big Ugly Alice...

Manhunt is a brutal stealth game that heavily relies on the player to execute their enemies by sneaking up from behind. At the time, the game's premise and tone were unique for being quite depressing and brooding, causing massive controversies that continued with the release of its sequel, Manhunt 2. Yet inside of Manhunt's nihilist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t was a solid stealth/action game that directly engages and intimidates you. The only massive problem with Manhunt is its age, with its primitive cover and shooting mechanics, yet they are easy to adapt to after playing for a while. Even if you're not interested in Manhunt's gameplay, it's perfectly acceptable to own it as a piece of history, when video games were significantly pushing the envelope on the portrayal of violence. Whether you like it or not, Manhunt is one of the most important games of the last decade, and owning a copy is highly recommended.","June 1, 2015","true","11.8"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

So first let me say there are multiple things that need to be fixed before this game is playable. Things such as resolution, won't run on Windows 7, & there is this pesky gate right in the beginning that refuses to open even though it is suppose to for you to advance in the game. All those things can be fixed with this guide, which I found in the steam guides section right HERE\n\nNow for the game itself. Developed by Rockstar, Manhunt was released in 2003 in between GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas. However due to it's level by level design instead of open worlds. I feel they were able to focus more on character/level design as personally I feel this game looks far superior to San Andreas graphic wise.\n\nTo start of your name is James Earl Cash you've just been put on death row with lethal injection as your form of execution. You've just been given a sedative instead of getting killed and there is man called the "Director" speaking to you through an ear piece. He tells you he wants to make the ULTIMATE snuff film with you as his star and that you're going to kill for him because he has your family captive.... This is just the opening sequence and then it goes from there.\n\nThe game plays like a stealth. Except with brutal house hold items to dispatch your enemies. You start of with very basic instruments such as plastic bags, wire, and glass shards. But as you progress through the game your arsenal get's stronger going to bats, machetes, hand guns, and then at last full blown assault rifles.\n\nEven though a few years old now. Manhunt still holds its position as most controversial Rockstar game. Being that you are violently killing and recording people for the purpose of one man's amusement. Game-play is still solid providing me with a nice little challenge at more than a few spots. I highly recommend this classic that they have decided to upload onto steam for our gaming pleasure.","January 11","true","15.4"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

Johnny Cash is a sick ♥♥♥♥ who is sentenced to death for murdering some people or something. Of course Johnny had great reasons (4 teh lulz) to kill the people. Shortly after receiving his not-so-lethal injection, Cash wakes up and finds out that the executioners pumped anabolic steroids into him so that he may have extreme rage bursts later on in the game.\n\nA creepy old fat ♥♥♥♥ named Starkweather yells at him through a loudspeaker to put in an earpiece so he can continue to hear Starky's annoying nagging throughout the whole ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Starkweather explains that he is an underground snuff movie director who wants Cash to execute people in the most gruesome ways possible for an AO rated film he's planning to post on HeavyR.com for other sick ♥♥♥♥s to jerk off to. The game features an eye straining grain filter which you will most likely turn off in the first few minutes of playing and a John Carpenter-esque sountrack to enhance the feeling of a gritty and shocking IRL snuff movie. After the player has been hiding in shadows like a ♥♥♥♥♥ for a few decades and suffocated over 9000 gang members with a plastic bag, the player will have to fight the Manbearpig and take his chainsaw. Finally, the player goes into Starkweather's office, slices his guts up, and makes his head explode.\n\nThe End.\n\nWhat a beautiful story, 9/10\n\n\nMANHUNT 2 deals with a more psychopathic storyline. You play as a scientist named Daniel Lamberton who's most likely the biggest wimp in the world until he volunteers for a sick scientific experiment which in addition to a not-so nice side effect of amnesia consists of implanting some batshit insane serial killer's (Named Leonardo Kasperton) personality into him via a personality chip & psycho-therapy (Gee, what a wonderful idea) which then leads him to killing his wife for the lulz.\n\nThroughout the game, Daniel tries to find out who he really was before the killing. He finds out that he was a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ and realized that killing his wife was a blessing.  Depending on the which ending the player considers the canon one, Daniel either wakes up at some random road in middle of nowhere at San Fierro or gets mind ♥♥♥♥♥ by Leo who then takes over his mind forever.\n\nThe storyline and the plot does not really make any sense at all, but the gruesome murders that occur throughout the game make it so that the story does not matter to an average player.\n\nAfter playing Manhunt 2 for 10 hours straight i thought i was a sociopathic serial killer named Leo.\n\n11/10\nWould murder again","January 4","true","36.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","82","14","17","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984765152/recommended/12130/","76561197984765152","Dr.Faceless Malevolence","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984765152/","69 products in account","Despite the fact that for me the pc version is broken, I managed to get the game on the psn, the only difference between the ps2 and pc version is that the ps2 has clunky controls that take some getting used to, the controls on the pc version are fine, the lighting is better on the ps2 version, though on the pc everything is sharper and has higher texture quality.\n\nThe story is that you play as a death row inmate called James earl cash, who was meant to be executed but it turns out it was only a sedative and a man only heard through an ear piece called “The director” has gotten the city overrun by gangs of criminals and forces you to participate in a snuff film.\n\nManhunt is a third person stealth game where most of the time you go from point A to B or have to complete a certain objective. The stealth mechanics are that you hide in shadows to avoid being seen which you will know when it’s dark enough by a contact sensitive icon of Cash will turn blue. The only time an enemy will know where you are hiding is if they see you going into a shadow or if they bump into you. Sound is also another huge part of the stealth: if you run, bump into something, slam doors open, or fire a gun, that will create some noise and the amount of noise is determined by how large the red circle is on the radar. One way to lure enemies out of their spots is to use a lure object being either a brick, a glass bottle or a decapitated head, or by hitting a wall. When an enemy hears you they will start searching for you, if you wait long enough they will give up and go back to their spots or patrolling as normal, if they see you they will attempt to kill you. There are two types of combat in this game: melee, and fire fights, for melee combat you have quicker attacks and heavier and you can block though the melee combat is tricky and difficult since you aren’t a close combat power house and the enemies will call the rest and group up on you and you will most likely be beaten to death, so melee combat is best to be avoided and its only worth doing it if you have a good enough melee weapon and it’s a loan enemy and you have no other choice. Gunplay in this game is half cover based and the other half is using tactics such as the old round the corner murder cue trick, you get a fairly small range of weapons in this game being, pistols (revolvers, locks, and desert eagles) submachineguns (an Uzi) assault rifles (an m16) shotguns (sawn off and a spas 12) and a sniper rifle. Most of the time you will be aiming for headshots though body shots are good if you have a shotgun or a machinegun. Even though you have combat the main focus is using stealth by sneaking up on enemies and murdering them with any kind of sports equipment, kitchen appliance, garden tool and sometimes objects such as plastic bags, glass shards, and barbed wire. There are three levels of brutality with the stealth kills which you increase by holding the attack button down when behind an enemy. The three levels are: white, yellow, and red. White is meant to be quick and clean, yellow is meant to be more violent, and red is meant to be the most violent you can do. The violence in this game is quite realistic, they have realistic sounds for beating, stabbing, slashing, blood spurting, skull cracking, and the choking and cries of pain from the enemies. It isn’t that bad or uncomfortable to watch (Manhunt 2 is way worse) but that’s coming from someone with a lot of experience with video game violence, I’ve played the worst of the worst.\n\nThis is also a very difficult game and the difficulty increases with each new gang and set of enemies you will come across in the next few chapters; the AI becomes smarter, they search for you longer, they start getting better at working in groups, they get better at melee combat, they are more accurate shots in gunfights they will have quicker reactions in gunfights and they are better equipped.\n\nThis is also a horror game, it uses horror in a somewhat unique way since this game is highly grounded in reality (there are no super natural elements) the environments are unsettling in terms of how close to real life they are in terms of how rough it is, they are fairly creepy, there are a lot of disturbing sights such as ripped and torn body parts, hanging bodies, body parts used as decoration, and just gore lying around. This game also has an extremely dark, grisly, and gritty atmosphere which is aided massively by the music. I just love the atmosphere in this game, the only game which I can think of that has a similarly dark, gritty and grisly atmosphere is condemned criminal origins. And the last mission which I won’t spoil.\n\nThere aren’t really any outright problems with this game, one chapter near the beginning can get a bit boring due to the fact that you usually only have one melee weapon and you’ll see the same kill animations over and over and that the environment in that section is the most dullest in the game (it’s a junk yard).  This is also a very unappealing game and the violence, tone, and subject matter can be a huge off putter depending on what kind of person you are, and you might end up in an argument arguing whether this game is completely sick and should be banned worldwide!!\n\nThe one thing this game will be most remembered for is the controversy: this game created tons of controversy because people thought it was so violent and gory and the fact that you use everyday objects and in this country (the UK) the game was blamed for inspiring a murder, this case remained controversial for years after even though the Police at the investigation clearly stated that it was a drug related robbery and not the game and it was the victim who owned the game. Now the only thing that is gory in this game are decapitations and cranial explosions. Many people around the world think this is the most violent game ever made, it's far from that, even for the time this is nothing when it comes to how violent a game could be, this came out in 2003, the same year postal 2 came out which is quite possibly the most violent game to date and the previous year soldier of fortune 2 came out which is quite possibly the most realistically violent and one of the goriest games to date.\n\nThis is a great game in my opinion and you should try it if you’re not the kind of person who protests “BAN THIS SICK FILTH!!!”","November 2, 2014","true","18.8"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

Just for those that say it can't play on WIN7 it does. It has to do with the time this game was patched and it broke it. I however searched out a fix and have been playing it for quite some time. If anyones interested I'd be more than happy to shoot you the replacement .exe file to get yours working in hopes that it might change your rating. Now to the point\n\nThe game is pretty much straightforward. Your character James earle Cash,set to be executed for his crimes,but  instead of being exectuted he finds himself tossed into a deadly game of cat and mouse with various gangs,spread over various landsapes of their territory. The goal is simple Kill the gang in the most gruesome ways possible to ensure your survival.Pay back you Mysterious benefactor one body at a time.\n\nThe controls still handle well even today when you have to consider this was during the same era as GTAIII and that game had some pretty wonky controls.You think that they would just leave that in for a stealth game,but they manage to work the controls in pretty fluid for a stealth and murder game\nThe Executions are still pretty fun to pull off\nThe game is pretty forigiving even if you're spotted\n\nbut yeah if anyone needs that .Exe to fix their game then shoot me a line.More than happy to get your copies running\n","December 12, 2014","true","1.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","2"

The dark story and its setting will keep you engaged as you face off against staggering odds and do whatever it takes to survive.  A gang of skinheads, an asylum full of raving lunatics, and a company of ruthless merceneries are only a few of the organization that are gearing up to end your life.\n\nFortunately, there are a few advantages that you have over the competition.  Shadows help to even the odds by allowing your to hide from your far better equipped enemies and get the jump on them when they turn their backs.  There are also a variety of weapons, many of them improvised, just waiting for you to get your hands on them,  These can be used for several vicious stealth executions each that include such gems as shards of glass into the eyes, decapitating someone with a garrote wire by sawing off their head, and the end of a crowbar smashed through a skull.  There's a reason there was such an uproar when this game was released.\n\nI highly recommend this game to fans of stealth games as the mechanics are absolutely brilliant.  The horror crowd might also want to get in on this because of the sheer brutality of what you can do to your enemies.  However, those of the squeemish variety might want to stay far away from this.\n\nThe game does work on more modern versions of Windows, by the way.

Takes some tooling with and you might have to configure it by scratch like I had to.\n\nThis is a brutal game, not as brutal as Manhunt 2 uncut but pretty damn close. If it had todays graphics, religious soccer moms and politicians would be in even a bigger up roar. Due to its graphics, its not terribly gorey but the concept of type of murders you can do is absolutely brutal, even listening to the sounds of the people you are killing with your eyes closed is disturbing at times. This game isn't for everyone, it's brutal, unforgiving, and very cold. Not afraid to overstep boundries and for that I applaud Rockstar for making this game. It's a very short game, but those few hours are packed with vicious bloody murder. Sadly outside pressures from people outraged by the series stalled it and it's banned in many countries. Hopefully in the future there will be more creative freedom, allowing them to continue the series.","June 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It came out two gens ago, on the PS2. I had never played it until it was 2 and a half dollars because of the Summer Sale. I just have one thing to say. BUY IT NOW.\n\nIn this game you hunt men, the title explains it. What it doesn't say though is that game is a stealth-action game, with thriller elements that almost make it a horror title also. This game is grim and dark. But for a game with dated graphics and toe to toe combat system, this game is great.\n\nThis game is all about killing the bad guys, and if you want a good score, killing the bad guys as brutally as you can. You have melee weapons such as crowbars, baseball bats, machetes, hammers, etc. You also have ranged weapons such as nail guns, shotguns, pistols, SMGs, assault rifles, and yes, a sniper rifle so you can feel like an assassin. This game has a LARGE arsenal of weapons. You just need to find them and equip them.\n\nThe game feels great for an older game. You don't need a good PC to play it (trust me, my laptop sucks), and it just feels great. The atmosphere is very dark and intimidating. The enemies are intimidating. This whole damn game is intimidating. The brutal kills you can pull off are extremely violent, so I'd recommend not looking if you are squeemish. If you like violent kills like I do, then this game is great.\n\nThe game is really difficult. If you play a lot of stealth games it is probably easier for you, but I found this game to be hard. Now don't worry, it isn't as hard as Dark Souls, but believe me this game is a challenge. I have found myself getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off multiple times because an enemy turned around at the wrong moment and noticed me preparing to execute him. But you can start off from the last save point and see if you can kill him correctly that time. The good thing is even though I got mad at this game, once I got a kill, the kills are so violently satisfying that it wipes away all your anger with the satisfaction of slaughtering you enemies unexpectedly.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend this game. You'll have to replace the exe. file and download a patcher for it, but it isn't hard and it is totally worth it. Just buy it. And did I mention the violent executions? Seriously, they're metal as ♥♥♥♥.","June 25, 2014","true","10.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game's primary point is in stealth, and it works.\nCash (the main character) can use "Stealth mode" to quiet his footsteps and stalk the enemy with convincing animations. He can also hide in dark places, rendering him invisible to his foes.\nThe executions are gory and satisfying, which follows as sometimes the set-ups for these moves are the trickiest part. Cash can also hit the walls with his fists or weapons to draw enemies away from their posts and cause them to become more vulnerate.\nThe storytelling is effective, and the voicework is good.

If you do not already know, this game was surrounded by tons of controversy, this is the singular game your soccer mom does not want you to play. If you do not know the story behind the controversy, grab a drink and get comfortable, because this is a long and interesting story. When the game was first released, nobody really paid much attention to the game, critics gave it mixed reviews and the game almost fell into the category of overlooked. But of course this did not happen, on July 28th 2004 14 year old Stefan Pakeerah had been brutally murdered by his best friend Warren Leblanc. Now, when something like this happens, we as humans go through what I call a “moral panic”, meaning when we have been wronged in some way it is so much easier for us to find a boogie-man to pin all of our problems on, so that way we don’t have to take responsibility for these tragic actions. And in this case Leblanc’s parents had their own moral panic and rather take responsibility for not noticing their kids dwindling mental stability, they found their sons copy of Manhunt, a perfect boogie-man to go to court with. Fortunately the 50 million pound (or 81,156,500 dollar) lawsuit was dropped, however the controversy never went away and has since then followed Rockstar Studios to this day.\n\nNow on to the game itself. The gameplay is very violent, and you will be murdering in systematic and unique ways. Honestly, in my opinion, it’s really not that bad. There are so many other violent and brutal games out there that make this game look like Super Smash Bros. in comparison. It is a stealth based game so you will learn to work on baiting your enemies into a trap where you will slowly pick them off 1 by 1, engaging head-on will get you absolutely nowhere. The AI can be a bit frustrating with their dead on aiming and their ninja reflexes, but bear in mind this is a very old game and the AI is very simplistic by our standards. Don’t let that be a turn off, the plotline mysterious and ominous.\nOverall I would highly recommend this game to anybody who is looking for a fun and plot oriented action game. This game really did not deserve all the controversy it received and I think it’s a real jewel that has slowly faded out of the spotlight.","September 12, 2014","true","17.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Manhunt's game structure is based straight off a cat and mouse game where running is most of the time your only option to survive. And if the hunters don't murder you, you murder them. Oh and during the whole process you're being recorded and monitored for entertaiment by a deluded director who saves you from your own execution in prison.\n\nThe praised concept regarding this game is simple. Kill, run, or die. It's like the SAW movies only with all the traps being replaced with uneducated, disturbed, bad-mouthed criminals bribed to murder you in any way possible. And this game made   headlines due to how realistically players dispatched the enemies set to hunt them. The execution style killings you commit with each weapon, which by the way have 3 different stages each, are brutal and very detailed. Manhunt was one of those rare titles where its M rated content was not generated by violent interaction with monsters or creatures but purely between human characters.\n\nIf you're a fan of stealth, violent, suspenseful games, Manhunt is a must-play and one controversial gem you shouldn't miss.\n\n10/10\n\n","August 23, 2014","true","21.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Anyway, onto the game.\n\nPROS:\n\nThe Story: The story was actually quite well, it was simple yet it was so well done, basically you are James Earl Cash, a man who was sent to deathrow but got a 2nd chance, and now you have to play in some kind of "Snuff film" Where your director gets off on seeing you murder people, but halfway through he just turns into a a$$hole which makes you want to kill him.\n\nSoundtrack: The soundtrack for this game is actually pretty good, it's got the whole disturbing feel to it and it has some really cool beats as well, fits the game quite well if you ask me.\n\nFighting style: The fighting style in this game is really good actually, although it can be annoying at times, the whole point of this game is stealth, but unlike Thief, in this game you HAVE to kill to advance, and the killing is very brutal.\n\nStealth/killing: The way this works is that there are 4 types of items, the Green, the blue, the red, and the yellow, the green weapons are disposed of on use but they are pure silent, the blue items are not consumed on use but make noise, the red does the most damage but also makes noise, and the yellow is basically a "Lure" You throw whatever it is at a person or wall to make attention, can be useful for drawing people away if need be.\n\nHiding: If you get caught you have to run around and try to find another hiding spot, cause taking on 2-3 goons at once is not a good idea, you will most likely die from it, if you are in view of the enemy when you run into a hiding spot he will know you are there, so you have to run a good distance away or around corners.\n\nSound: Another big point of this game is sound, sound is used to lure enemies over or away from you, hence the "Lure" weapons, but the biggest problem I have is Gravel in this game, walking normally you make no sound for anyone, you just walk and you are fine, but when you walk on gravel it creates noise which enemies can hear.\n\nStealth Kills: When you get a weapon to stealth kill a gurad, there are 3 ways, the white, the yellow, and the red, white is softest, yellow is brutal, and red is gruesome, although some of the lower ones from Gruesome actually seem worse than the gruesome one itself.\n\nLots of weapons: There are a lot of weapons around to use for different killing styles, like little scythes, knifes, hatchets, etc.  And each one can be more disturbing than the last.\n\nDifferent gangs: Each gang is different, and they have their own little details about them, the Innocentz are psychoes, the Smileys are psychoes with the disturbing masks and voices, etc.\n\nCONS:\n\nSound: The point of sound is to get enemies towards you or away from you, but seriously half the game is a Smack-a-wall simulator, cause that's all you really need to do to get them over to you, except when guns get introduced.\n\nGuns: Yeah guns are nice but the game goes from stealth to a gun game after like 3-4 levels, it's not bad but it kind of kills the way the game was when you started, and instead of finding a bat or something strong it's now, "Gotta find a damn gun!"\n\nBuggy game: There is a fix for win7 users as well as some other bug fixes around, but there is a bug with the sound in the game somtimes, on the mission "White Trash" when there is a guy in this trailer on the toilet, the sound just repeats even AFTER the cutscene ended, there is a fix for it though, just kill yourself, or make him kill you and you should be good, that's what I did.\n\nAI: Some of the AI in this game is weird, like I snuck up on a guy and he looked in the shadows, then when he was done he turned around and I was at his side, yet he still didn't see me somehow.\n\nWHAT I THINK: This game is weird at first and it can seem a little gruesome at times, but after you kill a few guys with some weapons the creepiest thing happens, you actually start to have fun with it, this game basically turns you into a murder because you start to ENJOY killing everyone.\n\nThis game is definitely worth it the way it sits, and it's also worth it on a sale, there are fixes for stuff, just check the FIRST review on the store page, or go into the discussions section.\n\nIt gets a good 9/10, was one of the few games that is still fun to me, even to this very day years and years later.","March 17, 2014","true","34.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whether it be Jack Thompson going up in arms about killing multiple people with a press of a button, or Hilary Clinton getting her dirty panties in a twist about the scandalous Hot Coffee mod in San Andreas: Rockstar loves to make games that shock people, and nowhere is that more prominent than this sometimes overlooked classic: Manhunt.\n\nThe story is that you're playing a bad, bad, baaaad boy named James Earl Cash who was supposed to be executed for the extreme crime of an elaborate plot device, the serum that he was supposed to be injected with was switched out; only putting him to sleep for some time. If he wants to get out of this city, he's going to have to listen to Starkwheather, a director of a snuff film that James is unknowingly taking place in.\n\nThe graphics are pretty dated, as you'd imagine. The gameplay is your standard stealth gameplay at first, you hide in the shadows like a gothic homosexual and sneak up on people; executing them with bags, rope, bats, clubs, or whatever is around. The main reason this was given so much controversy is that you have control on how gruesome you want the executions to be. To simply suffocating someone with a blue Wal-Mart bag to painting the walls with someone's brains using a baseball bat. When you're not training on how to become your friendly neighborhood serial killer, you'll be taking place in some good ol' fashioned cover-based shooting. A nice touch.\n\nThe main thing I love about this game is the art and sound direction. The whole game is filmed like an imported snuff film, such as intense camera static during executions, to gloomy film grain in the normal camera. I also love the soundtrack because it's synth-y, ambient, dark-wavey tones are reminiscent to that of John Carpenter (The Thing, Halloween, Christine, They Live).\n\nIf you're looking for a game to shock someone (or your parents) then this game is for you.\n\n4 out of smiley, deranged McLovin's out of 5","November 6, 2013","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know I do have like 10 minutes played on it so far, But I have seen gameplays, and also I remember playing it on PS2 years and years ago. This game caused a LOT of controversy about the whole "violence" and what not this game may feature. But in my opinion, its the players fault if he/she thinks that the games make him/her do the actions in the game in real life.\n\nI give this game a good 6.5/10.\n\n\nWhy not a 9-10/10?\n\nWindows 7 & 8 will not run this game at all, it will, but will randomly crash every 5 minutes.\n\n\n","November 28, 2013","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I ran the game fine on Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit with minor issues. Occassionally I experienced minor bugs such as certain parts of audio continuously looping until I either died, saved and quit, or progressed through the level, very minor graphical glitches such as a small white trail when moving the character, and if you have more than monitor your mouse tends to move over to the next one; I downloaded cursor lock to prevent this.\n\nOverall it's a good game with a great atomsphere and if you can overlook the few glitches I've detailed it's definitely worth picking up and playing.","July 17, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/recommended/12130/","0skulock","Oskulock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/0skulock/","987 products in account","Ever heard of Manhunt?\n\nYeah, that game where you go around and kill people with knives, glass shards, plastic bags and so on. Because i sure have, and it's amazing!\n\nWhen Manhunt was released in 2003, it was quite possibly the most violent game at that point. You play as an death row inmate who has been saved by a snuff movie maker Starkweather and given a "New chance" by transporting him into Carcer City, an abandoned town filled with cameras and generic slasher movie villains that are all trying to slaughter you with a variety of ways.\nThe premise most likely makes it sound like a really stupid game about just killing people, but oh how wrong can one be. Manhunt is an extremely intelligent stealth action experience that rivals most of the games of that time.\n\nGameplay of Manhunt is similar to the original Splinter Cell, you hide in shadows and take out unsuspecting foes by takedowns before they are able to see you. This works really well and incorporates a sound system, so the enemies might hear you if you go running around too fast, a feat that not all stealth games even to this day get right.\n\nGraphics wise, the game was released back in 2003 and was a bit outdated even then. So dont go in expecting anything eye popping, the game supports resolutions natively up to 1080p but will stretch the image somewhat. There is a fix to this problem in the guides section and will also allow you to modify the FOV and so on.\nAlso, the store page states that the game does not support Windows Vista or 7, this is true. But again, it can be easily fixed with a fanmade modification.\n\nI think i should also clarify about the violence a bit more, yes, this game is EXTREMELY violent. If you cant stomach films like SAW or Hostel then dont even bother with this one. There are decapitations, heads blown off, limbs dismembered, bowels cut, faces knived, people getting choked to death, hands getting cut off with a chainsaw and... Yeah, i think you got the idea.\n\nAll in all, Manhunt is one of those games that dont really have anything else to compare them to. It is a once in an lifetime experience and if you have the nerves for it, i would highly recommend grabbing it.","May 7, 2014","true","24.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsan26/recommended/12130/","mrsan26","Butthurt Tennis Coach","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrsan26/","75 products in account","Manhunt is a dark yet fun stealth game. You play as a death row inmate that has been given a second chance at life. After waking up after being "executed" you find yourself taking orders from someone known as the "Director". The Director explains to you how you must take out (violently kill) gangmembers and other scum to escape and be a free man. The executions you perform on enemies is recorded by the Director to make a snuff film. You are given many weapon types (mainly consisting of typical household objects) to murder your enemies and objects that you can use to lure them to you. Stalking your enemies with your weapon raised will allow you to perform more brutal and grusome executions. Aside from killing enemies, you must be able to hide aswell. Dark corners and shadows are your main way of hiding but you must also be careful to be quiet as certain types of ground may make noise (such as gravel or broken brick piles).\n\nMy experience so far has been great but there are some technical issues that I must mention to anyone who plans on buying this game.\nWhile Manhunt is a great game, Rockstar seems to have a hit or miss reputation when it comes to their PC ports. Sadly, Manhunt is a miss and is plagued with some issues. Manhunt is currently (and likely always will be) unsupported on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. Along with that, the game has been reported to frequently crash and many users encounter a bug during the tutorial that disallows a gate to open and, thus, prevents further progress. There is a patch that can be downloaded and installed into the game but it failed to work for me. Other users were luckier, however. Running the game in compatibility mode didn't work for me either. The solution that fixed my problem was downloading and older version of the Manhunt.exe file and replacing it with the current one Steam gives you (reports have said that the .exe given by Steam is bugged).\n\nI do recommend this game but only if you are willing to go through the work to fix it and get it running.","January 2, 2015","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Or so everyone thought. You wake up being filmed by some guy who makes snuff films and gives you a "Second Chance". You have to make your way through a crazy/gang infested city and you have to make your way through to the end or something, I've never gotten that far."\n*Spoiler ended*\n\nI've played this game before on non-steam, and it's pretty creepy if your in the right atmosphere. The brutal violence is why manhunt 2 isn't available on steam, or anywhere I think.\n\nThis game is sort of like splinter cell and Hotline Miami rolled into one. Actually, now that I think of it, it's almost exactly like hotline miami.\n\nThe movement is great, if you've played GTA Vice City, it's the same deal. The game is essentially being "filimed" as you go through, so there is a fuzzy filter which you can disable. -- THE EXECUTIONS ARE UN-CENSORED -- which means you'll be able to see Cash dig a crowbar into buddy's head. It's great.\n\nThere is a sort of puzzle aspect to the game, you need to figure out which one of the goons you need to kill first, how to maneuver around them ie staying in the shadows and how to lure them. It's pretty easy to lure and hide from the guys, but it's still worth it.\n\nI paid like 3 bucks for this title and I don't think I'll ever regret it.\n\nTL:DR - Great game, highly atmospheric. Kind of easy once you know what to do but still worth the price of 2.99. I'd have no problem paying like 5 bucks for it. Any more would be a bit much though considering it's dated. Very similar to Splinter Cell and Hotline Miami put together. Buy it, it's good.

The game is not bad once you can patch the game breaking gate bug, but it is definitely not good either. The shooting is fairly weak, both in design and execution. Guns are not accurate or powerful and left me feeling handicapped especially when the AI in this game is amazingly good. Whether in a shoot ou or hand to hand be prepared to lose the fight, over and over.\n\nThe main selling point for this game, I think, was the Melee executions, they are fun to do and offer plenty of gore. Having said that setting them up is a pain and towards the end of the game you will never get a chance to do it as melee becomes obsolete.\n\nThe story of this game is not deep but it does the job, I was compelled to see what happened in the end and I guess that’s what counts.\n\nOver all I would not recommend playing this but I do feel accomplished for beating it. If you are up for a frigging pain in the butt challenge and some retro slasher action this may well be up your street.\n\nHave fun? ^_^","May 1, 2014","false","9.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

The mahatmas of India, who are beings beyond the mind, state unequivocally that the purpose of human existence is to love, and even people in the world who are considered to be at the extreme end of the cruellest still themselves do not want to suffer and do not want others to hurt them.\n\nIf the designers at Rockstar Games would attempt to sneer at the above by stating that criticising a game for lacking a healthy moral outlook is merely hollow sanctimonious preaching rather than an attempt to make the world a kinder place, then perhaps they should look inside and ask themselves what good is given to humanity buy this product? Violence in games is one thing and certainly can be stimulating and exciting. Yet, in a wargame even though one is killing, at least there is some justification for it in that whichever side you are on the soldier feels he is killing at least to right a wrong and therefore for a good purpose. However, this game revels in and celebrates killing purely for its own sake with the sole intention of inflicting pain also for its own sake. This attitude is neither healthy nor helpful for people to imbibe.\n\nIn addition, putting aside these fundamentally important questions, simply as a game, Manhunt is not just morally bankrupt but also poverty-stricken in terms of gameplay. Although the environments of dark streets and back alleys are atmospheric and immersive both visually and aurually, everything is made far too easy and the player is treated like a child and led by the hand, albeit simply to perform acts of killing which, although certainly distasteful, are largely bereft of any skill, and fundamentally vacuous and dull.\n\nI read much of the press about this game for many years before I played it and now, having done so, although I can agree with the moral viewpoint taken by magazines such as the brilliant PC Gamer, I find it surprising that Manhunt's entirely uninspiring game-play managed to still get it a reasonably high review score. Well, erm, as you can see, dear reader, it certainly doesn't get high score from me.","November 30, 2015","false","0.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

I wish I could like it for pc, but it doesn't play right. There are alot of glitches and there is NO controller support for this game at all on the pc.  I can live with playing without a controller, but the lack of Rockstar games support for this or just a fix to play this is unacceptable. Rockstar knows about these glitches and has not/will not fix them.  I suspect this is because the game is violent, but they prob are just too lazy / greedy to fix this. (Didn't stop them from takin my money though.) The so called support referres to player made mods and fixes, which do not work either. At least for me running win 7, 8. or 10.  I would request a refund, but I got my copy from a site that donates a part of the sale to charity so I'm gonna just keep it so the charity gets their share. Something good comes out of this mess.\nGlitches include:\nA gate that does not open preventing gameplay\nAi that is broken and just stands there\nNo 360/ or any controller support\nNo official patches or support of any kind from Rockstar games.\nFan made fixes that are akward to install and just don't work.\nBottom line: Don't buy this game at all unless it's the ps2 disk version to be played on a ps2 console.","September 28, 2015","false","1.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","1"

You know those parts of some games where it suddenly decides it wants to be a stealth game, and it makes you play with poorly cobbled together stealth mechanics for a little while and even if you're a big fan of stealth games it's hard to enjoy it because the mechanics are so poorly designed? Manhunt is like that, except that they forgot to make the rest of the game that's actually fun. It's an extremely simple, basic stealth game where almost every environment is a bland, featureless alleyway or concrete building, and lacks any sort of story beyond what's in the steam description. Along the way you have to deal with other gameplay favorites such as two escort missions and a section where if you get spotted 4 times, the episode fails. It's a game where the only reason to play it is the violence, but even that is pretty tame by today's standards - I could see it being edgy enough to be a decent gimmick in 2003, but in 2015 after you've seen the first two or three strong executions you'll probably just wish they had a skip key so that you wouldn't have to watch any more, since they have barely any variety and aren't particularly graphic. It's just overall an extremely boring game, and I can't recommend it to anyone for even $10 unless you played it back then and are just desperate to relive your 2003 days.","June 28, 2015","false","7.5"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","1"
