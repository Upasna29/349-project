Beyond Mickey Rourke's hilarious voice acting, this game is linear, poorly programmed, and very shallow. Now, that's not to say that it's not at least an enjoyable experience, but you need to know what you're getting into before you buy it, for hopefully a price below $10.\n\nI beat the game in under 3 hours, and that was with me being killed many times in certain levels. The enemies are extremely repetetive, and pose no challenge unless they gang up on you. ♥♥♥♥ (protagonist) moves around like a tank. The "stealth" aspect of this game is laughably broken. You can run up to every enemy, making as much noise as you want and kill them with a prompt that appears on the screen. The sound broke for me towards the end, which ruined the ending cutscenes. Grenades rarely ever work in this game, they're pitiful. The grenade launcher is also a piece of garbage and may kill you more often than save you. Weapon selection is extremely limited. The levels design is boring and, again, very linear.\n\nWith all this in mind, this is a game that is so bad it's good. I would recommend this game if you play it with a bunch of friends just to laugh at how stupid it is. Mickey Rourke's voice acting ensures a few good laughs.\n\n"SUCK MY BALLS, MY HAIRY F*CKING BIG BALLS, WRAP THEM AROUND YOUR F*CKING MOUTH" - real line in this game spoken by ♥♥♥♥ Marcinko (voiced by Mickey Rourke)","February 21, 2015","true","5.0"," 119 of 147 people (81%) found this review helpful 59 people found this review funny","81","119","147","59","3"

If you want a game with the word awful wriiten all over it, than look no further than this pile of s**t! Words cannot describe the laughter and noise me and my buds made while playing this game. It can be beaten in a single sitting, so during those 90 minutes, we had more fun than any other serious highly rated AAA shooter out in the market.

I've played supposedly better games that turned out to be less fun, precisely because they didn't have moments of absolutely wonderful stupidity.\n\nThe best part of the game is the ending credits theme, just look it up on youtube.

It's kind of fun for a bit, and the guns all handle well. As for a rating of "Reccommended to buy", I'd only recommend when it goes on another crazy sale, and mainly to hear the crazy dialog through the game.

It's just a bunch of missions and thats it (well, the missions are related, but a "found these papers, going to the location mentioned in these papers to stop the enemies!" doesn't really count as a story to me...).\nMoving to the graphics, they are very bad,  I mean, i've seen PS2 and older PC games from like 2005 or 06 that look better than this ♥♥♥♥!\nGoing to the gameplay: There is a cover system! Rarity in FPS's these days, but it's over simplistic and it feels clunky as hell! I hoped it would be like Rainbow Six:Vegas 2 which was fine, perhaps even good...but nope! Rogue Warrior has you stick to cover pressing one button and thats it.\nGunplay is horrendous, the guns feel absolutely terrible, and you might want to just stick to your silenced pistol and the melee moves, oh yeah! This game has a "press E to win" prompt btw and if you're skilled enough, you can go through 90% of the whole game just by getting up close and personal to the enemies and pressing E (you are not vulnerable during the animation, which is even easier!) the other 10% is just dull sniping the rest of the unreachable enemies with the knife. Don't get me wrong, the melee "cutscenes" aren't bad, teh animation are quite good, but after the 3rd one, it gets repetitive and stupid.\nMoving to Multiplayer! It completely sucks! It's over simplistic, just kill and thats it! Very old school styled (pick up the weapons you find on the ground or hidden places, there aren't classes or anything like that, like i said, very simplistic and boring), you don't gain experience nor anything, you dont get rewarded for doing good or punished for sucking and that makes it kind of...boring after 10 minutes. Also, noone is playing the Multiplayer of this game, it only has 850 game Hub contributions, so...yeah...it's THAT popular...\nWith sucky multiplayer, bad graphicss, dull and exhausting gameplay and a 3 hour long campaign (no joke!) Rogue Warrior just deserves a 1/10, miserable disappointment. And Rebellion that does great games! I got it for 2,49 € and it still feels overpriced! BTW, the game reeks of a pretty bad console port! Don't buy this, please! Save your 2€ and go buy a sandwich, it lasts longer than this game!","June 30, 2013","false","8.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","0"

People are comparing this game to ones such as Big Rigs and that's almost unforgivable.\n\nStory is pretty typical military nonsense with a super tough protaganist (decently voiced by Mickey Rourke with some laughably hilarious dialogue) breaking onto an enemy base and basically shoot, put bombs on missles and that's the whole game. Sounds repetitive right? If it weren't for the decent kill scenes (sneaking up to enemies and pressing E) and the surprisingly fun gunplay this game wouldn't be even remotely as fun.\n\nThe unlimited ammo for the silenced pistol was actually a decent touch that added a little bit to the game overall. (It did only take me an hour and a half to beat the campaign though which is pretty lackluster) and of course multiplayer is dead.\n\nAll in all, cheesy shooter that'll make you laugh and keep you entertained for an hour or two. Worth 10 bucks? For me, I was relatively satisfied so I'm gonna go with yes. However if you don't like to laugh at mediocre games, wait for a sale to try this out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/22310/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","THE DOWNLOW:\nRogue Warrior is an old-skool corridor shooter with limited cover mechanics and minor stealth elements.  Your objective is to one-man Rambo; an eight mission campaign, set in the Peoples Republic of North Korea.  Choose to kill by stealth but be seen and its time for gun-toting action.  The campaign is single-player but it has a multi-player arena style deathmatch with a few maps.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n+ Simple gameplay. Other than picking up weapons/ammo, there is little to interact with.\n+ Fast-paced action.\n+ Cheesy voice-over from Mickey Rouke.  Some great one-liners.  Sounds like it was made while sitting on the crapper!\n+ Who doesnt like taking on PRK enemies!? ^^\n+ The music is old-skool tacky, gradually getting boom-tastic at the end.  Perfect for this game!\n+ Nice range of achievements which are fairly fast to gain.\n+ On sale its very cheap.\n\nTHE BAD:\n- Its very short.  Too short!\n- Cliche backstory.  But who doesnt like them right!?\n- Scripted levels are purely linear.\n- Rudimentary graphics give it a minimalistic ambience.  Well its an old game.\n- Mostly similar enemies that just carry different firearms.\n- Enemies attack in waves but even on Elite difficulty numbers are very low.\n- Some MP achievements require other players.  At least four.  This is a problem to get them even if there are a few die-hards on the discussion boards.\n- Very limited replayability.  Everything is virtually the same the second time around.\n- No matter what weapons you pick up in the previous chapter, they are reset at the start of the next one.\n\n\nAND THE ORDINARY:\n* Gameplay is fairly one-dimensional apart from minor stealth and cover mechanics.\n* A.I is adequate but nothing to write home about.\n* Short 8 mission campaign.\n* 3 difficulty levels.  Just go to elite.  Its really not that difficult!\n* Lite in-game story-driven cutscenes.\n* Arena based PvP multiplayer. If youre into that sort of thing.  Unfortunately all but dead.\n* Carry 2 weapons but can choose from 13 different weapons (pistols, shotguns, SMGs, assault rifle, sniper rifle, LMG and a grenade-launcer.  Unfortunately none are realistically modelled or very satisfying to use.\n* Decent K/M controls.  Unbidden tendency for weapon-switching to occur with mouse-wheel.\n* You will need to complete the game three times; once at each difficulty to get 100%.\n\nVERDICT:\nRogue Warrior is frankly terrible!  Its a mediocre FPS.  Ultimately limited by its age its levels are designed to be completely linear.  Gameplay decisions mostly fall as to whether to kill with silent takedowns or alert enemies and blast them with whatever weapons you have to hand.  However Its enjoyable in a minimalistic kind of way.  Just dont expect anything like a modern-day shooter or a AAA title and you may find enough to saite your appetite.  It will appeal to fans of brainless, easy to beat FPS.\n\nDefinitely one of the 'Its so bad, its good!'  One to miss unless you love old-skool beer and pretzel-style shooters or if you are a sucker for punishment!\n\n\nEDIT:\n- After spending 4hrs trying to get 8 ppl to connect to a single host I can tell you this game has the worst MP facility of any PC game I have ever played and should be avoided at all cost, just for that alone.  I still recommend the game but only for a cheesy SP experience, dont bother thinking about the MP achievements.  They are nigh on impossible to get because you cant even get 4 ppl to consistently connect in a 2v2 game.  Abysmal.","April 30","true","37.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

That said however I did play and complete it and although not the worst game I ever played it was OK.  Just a plain simple run n gun with no plot, bad graphics and a very short campaign.  Game was completed in around 5 hours.  The voice acting of the main charater (Demo ♥♥♥♥) is done by Mickey Rourke and it is by far the funniest voice acting I have ever heard.  I think this game has a world record for the f bomb and other combinations of filfth.  You can YouTube the ending credits of this game and you will get an idea - they made a rap song out of it.  Though I am sounding critical this game was just alright to kill an afternoon and that was about it.  I just think it was not as bad as other people have suggested and critics have written about it.

Except this time the protagonists are fighting foreign communists instead of domestic terrorists. They nail the superficial aspects of the style while forgetting to include any substance. That's Rogue Warrior.\n\nIt's a brash, simple, and pointedly racist FPS with little that's notable about it other than the repetitive and profane one-liners voiced by Mickey Rourke. He is by far the best choice possible to pull this off, but how they convinced him to take the job I have no idea. Maybe he didn't see the script ahead of time. Or maybe that's where all the budget went.\n\nThe strangest thing to me is that the game claims to be "character-driven" in its description while actually being the farthest thing from it. There's more character development in an alphabet book.\n\nYou've only got a couple of tired weapons to choose from and a couple of dumb enemies to fight. So gameplay-wise it's even below par for standard FPS fare. Throw in an awkward cover system that forces you into third-person mode and that's all you need to know about the mechanics.\n\nThe game is also terribly short. My first playthrough on the highest difficulty was just north of three hours. My second run on normal was just about an hour and a half. And my final go on easy was under an hour. There's just not much to this game in any dimension.\n\nAnd yet...there might be a place for it in your library. A fast, not-challenging run through of an FPS you've never played before can be a fun experience. It can scratch a certain kind of itch. If you've already beaten every Call of Duty and Battlefield there is then there might not be many other places you could look than Rogue Warrior. But it's not fundamentally good.

The books, including an autobiography, and several spinoff fiction books. The autobiography calls him a "death defying" soldier, who was in the United States's SEAL Team Six, an incredibly impressive feat.\n\nGame Summary:\nIn this game, you control a profanity-spewing ♥♥♥♥ (as the game wants him to be called) Marcinko, murder hordes of communists in hilarious and over-the-top ways. You have to blow a lot of stuff up, including submarines and missles (yes, that is the entire plot). This game takes itself too seriously (like most modern shooters, Battlefield and Call of Duty to name a few), and seems like it tries too hard to earn it's M rating. Many times per mission, Marcinko spouts profanity; including every couple of hallways, every time he is hit, or just every like he says in general. The takedown cutscenes try to be brutal, but fail. The game has glitches, such as all enemies knowing where you are and enemies being able to shoot through cover, and all glitches work against you. There is one glitch where, sometimes, your guns will have no recoil while in cover, but that was all I could find. This game is incredibly short, with two hours of main campaign time. This game has lots of achievments, but sadly you cannot get them all due to some needing multiplayer (which no one plays). This game is actually tremendously funny, mostly because of lines like, "The wind was so cold, it could freeze the balls off a f**king polar bear" and "F**k! F**k you, you f**king ametuer peices of s**t" and most of all, "Suck my balls, my giant, hairy, big f**king balls, wrap 'em around your neck you c**k-sucking motherf**kers!"\n\nI apologize for that.\n\nUpsides:\nThis game is one of the funniest you will play in a long time.\nMarcinko's dialouge keeps the "flow of gameplay" consistant.\nThis game has a good soundtrack.\nThe game is surprisingly fun.\nAverage shooter.\nStealth kind of works a bit.\nHas a cover system that would be fantastic if improved on.\nGood mix of FPS and TPS (First Person and Third Person)\nHas the best end credits theme of all time, no joke.\n\nDownsides:\nGame is incredibly glitchy.\nGame has ways of killing you out of nowhere.\nSome of Marcinko's lines make you cringe. (Such as, "Fondle my hairy nuts")\nGame is WAY too short, it feels like a Call of duty: Modern Warfare DLC.\nCover system breaks a bit.\nRandom difficulty spikes. (One minute you kill twenty enemies, no problem.

It is a bad game, but it makes for two-three hours of intense laughter. I reccomend this game to those who want a more casual shooter that supplies fun in short bursts.\n\nPrice Tag: $10.00\nWhat it is Worth: $3.00\nWhat I Paid: $5.00\nWhat I Would Pay: $5.00\n","November 29, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is in no way a stealth game even though they say "Stealth is always a good option" and the enemies have a 6th sense saying "Hm i feel a pressence. Must sound alarm!" making stealth completely useless. This game has very little good story telling other then Russians are the bad guys, go mess them up. They give the main character a flat personality even though they try to make him sound like the funny bond guy mixed with a bad mouthed sailor. The gameplay is so straight forward as i said stealth isnt even needed in missions. Any mission you get caught even if you didnt get caught in the first place. For example. A mission has you infiltrate a building. You infiltrate and i did this stealthy, not raising an alarm. Then half way through i get a bunch of enemies and alarms saying "Intruder!" So i blast through a massive wave of guys to the end. Next mission, same thing. Next mission? SAME THING. I dont reccomend this game because its just a shooter. Not a stealth game.","January 23","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game ought to serve as a crash course on how not to design and execute a game. A literal crash course because I beat it in less than two hours. I would've beaten it faster if I didn't die because of so much random ♥♥♥♥ exploding all over the place.\nLet me go over all the key points that every game developer should take note of in this game, and look not to do:\n\n\n\n- It took me less than two hours to beat it. Seriously.\n\n- There was no option to adjust resolution or lighting quality. In fact, there's exactly four options on the video menu.\n\n- Thank god they allowed me to turn off the motion blur, because it's so ♥♥♥♥ing intense that it makes me nauseous just thinking about it, and I'm usually a fan of motion blur in games.\n\n- There's no vsync whatsoever, and the game has screen tears like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥\n\n- The lighting quality is so inconsistent that it makes my head hurt. Some areas are completely unlit and others are really well lit.\n\n- The fire effects look pretty similar to a 90's FPS. They look atrocious.\n\n- There's grenade indicators in this game, but you're the only person that can throw grenades (WTF)\n\n- There's no subtitles. Which as I point out later, is both a good thing and a bad thing.\n\n- There's no other option besides English to play this game in.\n\n- Let's talk about controls...for starters, you can't even access half the controls without using a controller, as the scroll menu can't be scrolled down using either the mouse or the keyboard..you'll need a controller to even do that.\n\n- During the game, I was told to "pull back on the left stick in order to move away from cover" when I was using mouse and keyboard.\n\n- The horizontal and vertical sensitivity for the mouse aren't consistent. The vertical sensitivity is about half as sensitive as the horizontal sensitivity, if not less.\n\n- The horizontal and forward/backward movement isn't consistent either. Once again, you move almost 2x as fast when moving sideways or backwards (?!) than you do moving forwards. Wat.\n\n- Iron sights are bound to the space bar by default, and the grenade key is bound to the right mouse button. Did anyone bother to play this game on PC? Seriously..\n\n- There's only two weapons in the game, yet there's three different binds to switch weapons, all of which do the same thing. The hell?\n\n- Speaking of weapons, there's a grand total of 8 of them in the actual game, and NPCs only ever use and drop 3 of them. Every weapon is obtainable in every mission.\n\n- There's a huge amount of ammo in the game, so don't worry about running out of it.\n\n- Can one-hit-kill everything by walking up to it and pressing F.\n\n- NPCs are completely bugged, their AI is totally ♥♥♥♥ed up beyond belief.\n\n- Voice acting quality is legitimately terrible, everyone sounds like they're talking through a cardboard tube. I had to turn voice volume all the way up because I couldn't hear a damn thing that anyone was saying.\n\n- Lip sync is really really off\n\n- The volume and sensitivity options are annoying to use. Instead of being like circles or vertical bars, they're slanted boxes which makes it easy to confuse two options as being the same thing. However, if you count the number of bars filled/empty, you'll quickly realize that this isn't they aren't the same at all.\n\n- The main character is ♥♥♥♥ing irritating with all his god damn mother♥♥♥♥ing swearing about stupid ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because he's a ♥♥♥♥ing American, bro, and that's how ♥♥♥♥ing Americans ought to speak, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I had one hell of a ♥♥♥♥ing time shooting at fire extinguishers and having the main character ♥♥♥♥ing yell "YOU MOTHER♥♥♥♥ING COMMIE SON OF A ♥♥♥♥♥". Who do those ♥♥♥♥ing Red fire extinguishers think they are?\n\n- No buildup at all to the last mission, just feels like you're doing yet another mission. THE END.\n\n- There's three types of enemies in this game: Asian Commies, Russian Commies, and Russian Commies wearing helmets\n\n- Each mission: kill a few guys stealthily, suddenly you can't kill everyone stealthily so you have to go loud, and then you plant bombs on things and win. That's every single mission in a nutshell.\n\n- In the opening segment of the game, the player character rants about his team being complete badasses/hardasses. After the next loading screen, they all die in the stupidest way possible.\n\n- There's only one or two music tracks used in the entire game. You will quickly get irritated by listening to it.\n\n- There's so much random ♥♥♥♥ that blows up, you'll never have any clue how you actually die. There will usually be an explosion offscreen and then "DED."\n\n- There's no health or damage indicators, only a very very minor change in screen color when you're about to die. You'll have to squint often to see how much health you have.\n\n\nSeriously. Nobody wanted this game, nobody asked for this game, and I can't imagine what the hell was going on at Rebellion when this game was being made. Did people just smoke a joint, play Duke Nukem and say "yeah, let's do this!" That's seriously what it looks like.\n\nPS: Bethesda, stop shoveling ♥♥♥♥ games like these into Quakecon bundles.

I saw Rogue Warrior, and couldn't pass it up!  I had some great times with this game on Xbox 360, and now I can do it all over again with a superior version! The PC version runs great, controls with a Keyboard/Mouse, and has native xbox 360 controller support if you want it. Options are minimal, but still much better than console.\n\nHow is it? Here's an example: Once I was doing nothing more than walking down a hallway in an empty building, with no enemy in sight. My character started talking about his balls in a manner that seemed to be instucting someone on how to pleasure them with... extreme dedication and vulgarity. It was the most random thing that ever happened me in a game. It was hilarious, I was actually in tears laughing. Then I found some dudes and stabbed them many times. There was much death and fun. Rinse and repeat, mix it up a little with guns and such.\n\nIf you are like me and have a special place for the (excuse the cliche') "So bad it's good" type of game, then Rogue Warrior is the golded turd you have been waiting for! You will be wading up to your knees in stealth violence, all while hearing the most insane & horrible, yet perfect voice over a game has ever had,\n\nBuy this game, or you hate yourself, and so does Richard Marcinko, and he will come and murder you with his balls.","September 18, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design is poor, the story is absurd, and the main character uses four letter words at the rate of one every two seconds. The main character comes across as so disagreeable you find yourself running him into a fire fight just to get him killed. Not a good way to make the player associate with their game character.\n\nThe level design is bad and the graphics are poor for even 2009. The enemy AI is brain-dead. Perhaps the strangest game play element is the stealth move. You can sneak up on an opponent and use the stelth move to kill them. However, you can also (if you run fast enough) rush an enemy firing their weapon in your face, use the stelth move, and kill them with a knife. I have gone through entire levels just rushing enemies with my knife and never firing a shot. Apparently, when running in stealth mode  you are immune from bullet damage.\n\nPlaying more than ten minutes of this game (and you can "beat" the game in less than two hours), requires a strong stomach.\n\nThe only bright spot is that I can use this game in my Game Design class as a bad example of how not to do an FPS game.\n\n","September 7, 2015","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's also the best weapon in the whole fuc-king game.\n- You can offer this game as a gift to all the people you hate.\n- If Rogue warrior was a movie, it would be a lot worse than The shawshank redemption but A LOT BETTER than the 2015 Fantastic Four film.\n\nCons:\n- Game is too short and not worth the price; should be less than 5 $\n- Choice of weapons is limited.\n- Plot is incoherent, while missions are ridiculously too simple.\n- Trailer looks better.\n- Can cause many symptoms to people who won't like the game...\n- Can mess your life.\n- You may need a bottle of Pepto-Bismol to ease possible stomaches (may be caused by laughing or by disgust)\n- I don't understand people who complained about the graphics.

So turn your brain off and kill some pencil-dicked commie ♥♥♥♥s and laugh while Marsinko makes colorful remarks. 10/10 would play a retirement home sequel.","November 28, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It only runs at 50hz on the 1080p setting for some reason and the default key bindings are like no game released in the past decade (spacebar for iron sights?). Yet, it's amazingly hilarious.\n\nIt's like they knew it had nothing going for it so they had Richard Marcinko curse into a microphone for 30 minutes straight and then used every single second of it somewhere in the game. This fits 'so bad it's good' in my books, and on sale it costs about as much as renting a Steven Seagal VHS from Blockbuster.","November 23, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rogue Warrior is a fun, quick shooter game with a foul mouthed soldier that takes place in the mid 80's behind north korean borders. The plan was to meet up with an informant regarding missles being developed and the plan goes sour from the get go. Mickey Rourke is a great voice actor coming up with hilarious foul mouthed sayings, that will keep you laughing for a while.\n\nI read and saw some videos of people experiencing glitches and problems, but I had none of them tbh. Game runs well and plays well. Took me around 2 hours to beat this game, that is how short it truly is, but don't let that deter you from buying the game, its one hell of a good time.","December 2, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like it for the mechanics of the game. I have gotten all achievements with only 21h of playing(of course I needed some friends to help me with Multiplayer achievements). But enough of me.\n\nI will do some pros and cons for the game\n\nPROS\n-The game is done fairly good. The graphics are stunning for my PC\n-The game is based like a shoot-out, kill everyone!\n-Singleplayer is fun to play. In singleplayer you have 8-10 guns(dont remember)\n-If you will ever buy the game and play it, you will have a free DLC to learn new swears\n-You have lots of cover if you need it\n-Cool cut-scenes of Kill Moves and Finishing Moves\n-The game for me never had any bugs or glitches(that is really good!)\n\nCONS\n-Community is almost dead\n-For multiplayer achievements you need 4-6 players(they are hard to come by)\n\n10/10 for me, I like new swears I have learned from the game!\nI recommend this game for someone that likes ordinary FPS games!\n\nIt only matters your personal experience!

It's also the best weapon in the whole fuc-king game.\n- You can offer this game as a gift to all the people you hate.\n- If Rogue warrior was a movie, it would be a lot worse than The shawshank redemption but A LOT BETTER than the 2015 Fantastic Four film.\n\nCons:\n- Game is too short and not worth the price; should be less than 5 $\n- Choice of weapons is limited.\n- Plot is incoherent, while missions are ridiculously too simple.\n- Trailer looks better.\n- Can cause many symptoms to people who won't like the game...\n- Can mess your life.\n- You may need a bottle of Pepto-Bismol to ease possible stomaches (may be caused by laughing or by disgust)\n- I don't understand people who complained about the graphics. If they want to play a bad game with ugly graphics, they should try E.T. the extraterrestrial for Atari.","September 22, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
