Its basicly a "find the hidden objects" game with some puzzles that mostly involve "finding hidden objects".  The graphics suck, pictures of objects have just been stuck onto a background picture and everything looks out of place, like a jumble of pictures cut from a magazine thrown into a pile.  The story also does not work, you are finding objects in order to preserve the musuems collection... yet most of the objects you are locating are cigarete lighters, sunglasses, wallets and ID cards... then in the 'puzzle' rooms you feed old copper coins (that are aparantly attracted to magnets) into a vending machine and use an ancient sword to break a concrete pillar so it topples and smashes its way through a wall.... So much for preserving the collection, also what are you doing with all this stuff??? you dont have a bag visible in any of the cut scenes.  You also locate a CB radio and pull the batteries out of it to power a torch... then you immediatly use it to talk to somebody???  So to sum up, bad graphics that make most objects unfindable and a bad plot that cant justify 90% of the things you have to do in order to progress.","April 29, 2014","false","0.8"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","40","51","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazzmyob/recommended/298020/","kazzmyob","kazz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kazzmyob/","422 products in account","A good hidden object game makes you look and stare and search and eventually click on a hint and then you look and think how could I have possibly missed that? This game does not do that.\n\nFirstly it is incedibly low res. It then compounds this by using really awful pictures of the things you have to find, occasionally misspelling them, sometimes hiding them behind bits of the UI so there is no possible way you can find them and of course when you finally give in and click that hint button you'll end up staring at some grainy blur going really? I was meant to identify that as... something??\n\nThere is some initial urgency in the storyline as you have been separated from your daughter but this is soon leached out of the game by it offering you the chance to amble back through rooms you've already been through recovering more objects.\n\nIt does keep track of your accuracy rate and offer percentage completion as you work your way through the game, and some of the "escape the room" type puzzles are semi engaging. The problem really is that there are better games out there. Even if you see it in a bundle or with a massive discount... just don't. Really, I have seldom met a hidden object game this annoying or frustrating and for all the wrong reasons.","May 17, 2014","false","14.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

The artwork may be decent, but it does not excuse the poor overall quality of the game.\nThe plot is weak and makes no sense most of the time (You're a mother trying to get to her child in a room that seems to be on the other side of the planet and you take your time to save "artefacts" that make no sense: glasses, a floppy disk, a stamp - worth like $1.7k?, and other nonsensical junk that, in a real situation, would just encumber you in your quest).\nThe voice acting is decent-ish, but the sound levels vary far too much.\nThe mechanics are boring and borderline idiotic, but may be suitable for a child of about 5, since it's just a matter of "find X in pile of junk and use on item Y" with no actual challenge to it.\nIt's clearly a case of "Let's publish a 6-year-old game on Steam so we can milk some more money from it" (if you'll research it, you'll find that it is available on multiple platforms, including Wii and mobile, on iTunes, and it is also available as a flash game).\nDefinitely a game you should avoid.

There are lots of small cutscenes and the voice acting is well done.\n\nBut all of this is ruined by one thing: the graphics are terrible. The rooms are overcrowded, and combined with the low resolution and the dial-in era level of JPEG compression it’s impossible to recognise anything. It’s a shame, but I had to resort to a rapid clicker program to pass most of the scenes.\nStill, if you don’t mind the bad visuals, the game is worth it for the storyline, which is continued in the superior sequel, Adventure Chronicles.","December 2, 2014","true","11.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

What the game has going for it is that it's pretty long to complete. There's side rooms you can do and different styles of hidden object games to play.\n\nWhat sucks is that the pictures are all super low resolution and are just poorly put together. I got stuck in one spot, clicked hint, and the item I needed to click on was actually behind the menu button on the HUD so I couldn't click it (or see it) and I had to cancel out of the game and restart so that it would give me a different set of things to find.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty dismal and the story is just okay. But the main draw of HOGs is the actual hidden objects, and this just doesn't do that well at all.","March 11, 2015","false","6.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If the actual hidden object/ puzzle gameplay may or may not be  fun i can't actually tell.  The problem with the game is that its extremely dated, tho the store page says it was from 2008, but it just feels like 15 years older. That wouldnt be much of a problem but since the game runs in 800x600 or 640X480, the visual quality is so obstructive that its nearly unplayable. In fullscreen mode all the stuff looks blurred and pixelated, i's practicly impossible to read the text boxes. The fonts have no hinting and the interpolation just messes the whole text up. (I would link a screenshot but this games doesnt support steam overlay)\nThe objects are hard to see for that same matter...i could let this go by as extra challenge tho...still sub par.\nWhen in windowed mode (the only graphics option in the menu) the game is at its native resolution and theres no scaling option, this means that on a normal hd monitor that window is freakin small, good luck reading the text or finding the objects now.\nI assume these hidden object games kinda appeal to casual gamers like your average Mom and Pop type, however with these interface and readability issues that game certainly disqualifies itself.\nIt's a poor rerelase/ port or whatever, they  should at least include some scaling option and probably try to work improving the lousy resolution.\n\nI'd definetly NOT recommend this game, not even to fans of the genre.","April 30, 2014","false","0.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"
