"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chris_Ramos/recommended/250420/","Chris_Ramos","SirAzazel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chris_Ramos/","37 products in account","Overall review and problem.\nThis game was good for 1 year. Things went horribly downhill. I am a very experienced player, i've built some of the most epic buildings in the game, i am a very known player, my name is Chris_Ramos.  I joined the day 19/10/2014.\n\nOwner of 10 towns, proud maker of Russian themed cities, glitch blocker and an absolute fighter for opinions. What do i mean with that? I don't want anyone to get repressed for sharing it's own opinion, like it happend to me.\n\nSome months ago couple of friends got banned for their own reasons. The developer (Sim9) not having enough fun he banned some of his old players to see if that made him feel better. ♥♥♥♥ move, he split the community in half.\n\n\nGame Forums\nThey weren't dead before this enraged developer banned everyone asking "Why did my friends get banned??".\nAny kind of protest was completly removed with the thread itself.\n\nNow just 11 year old kids trying to become moderators of this game wander in the forums flipping the ♥♥♥♥ over when someone posts a noob question or a simple swear. REPORT REPORT REPORT!!\n\n\nHermit & Kyro\nHere is where things go to ♥♥♥♥. They both were game moderators, one posted a funny meme about the infamous "Mini-mods", moderators wanna-be.\n\nSim9, the enraged developer, got so angry that someone posted a meme he PERMANENTLY BANNED THIS MODERATOR.\n\nAt this point you are asking "Who the ♥♥♥♥ is Kyro then?" A retired mod of course! Mememaster, dank overlord of belair. After he noticed this lil' kiddo banned his friend for posting memes, he got ♥♥♥♥ing angry you bet.\nHe went in-game and had a little discussion.\n\nAfter that he got an obvious ban. After this, it shocked me that the dev didn't even care about it. For 2 years those moderators been supporting this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ community based game. Around only 4 players i trust. That includes my best friends.\n\n\nWhy do i hate this "Sim9"?\nAfter i was complaining that he should be on a better mood when checking forums he ♥♥♥♥ fury all over the chat.\nI told him to learn to take jokes, welcome to the internet.\n\nHe Hard-muted me, he permanently banned me on IRC, and he disabled my posting in the forums. (I am currently banned on those 3 medias).\n\nWho were you even?\nTranslator of the game, also beta tester of March Of Industry, 9bitMMO (his ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3D game) and i was going to be a moderator. Rejected this, never become a mod, you get tied to follow this ♥♥♥♥'s rules.\n\n(I also was friend with all the legends, etc.)\n\nWhat is bad about the game?\nBesides the 10 year old kids griefing all the wilderness, ♥♥♥♥ing up the chat and begging to be citizens, the game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible, looks like the engine this was made with is called "Royalty Free Engine". You can't build over 120 Z-Axis because the game bugs. The tutorial makes you clueless about anything, the humour is a piece of ♥♥♥♥. The character model is amazingly detailed (approx. 8 pixels), also that the "Sandbox" is a whole new feature in this unique game, you must pay for every single block, and the game itself doesn't tell you how to grind gold, you have to ask someone to tell you to go to "/tele Megazoo", which was made by a rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who loves being the developer's pet.\n\n\nWhat about the "Frequently Updated!" feature?\nLook, hun. It's 13/2/2016 and since december of 2014 we don't get an update with something actually useful.\nThe only updates are about "GAME IS GETTING H4XD UPDATE UR PESSWORD!!!!11ELEVEN", how come it not been hacked before? This game is broke, you get stuck in the floor if you have lag, and the dev aknowledged that you can no-clip through walls if you are buggy enough.\n\n\nIs it worth a try?\nNo. Unless you want high volume cancerigenous fail of dubstep music that loop over and over, newbies that can't use chat or explain themselves properly everywhere and experienced players leaving you aside, ignoring you or just trying to scam you, don't try this crap unless you want to give it a nice rub in the negative reviews section.\n\n\nYou have over 2000 hours on record.\nI used to like the game. Very much, my love knew no bounds for this. Too sad the dev was a ♥♥♥♥ when everything was going uphill. Thinking he can just shut me up to prevent noobs knowing the truth behind this, do you really think you can stop me, Robby? Ban me, i dare you. But first i take my translation back, and the $50 i gave you. Oh! because in this game you have to pay to have cool ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nF2P? P2W?\nMostly Pay to Enjoy. You can't buy cool ♥♥♥♥ unless you buy plat items for unfair prices.\nTo have a real town you must pay 10 Dollars. Is it worth it? NO. because it's a 9 region place, you have to expand it at least 5 times to have a decent place. Which expands go from 10p to 60p, around $200 to get a decent town.\nWHICH NOBODY WILL JOIN, BECAUSE THE GAME IS DEAD! YAY!\n\n\nGame is dead?\nKill confirmed, amirite. 10-20 players online in this "MMO", lol, what a joke right?\n\n\nWhy MMO?\nDev thought this was going to be a cool idea. Don't ask me, ask him, if you don't get banned while asking, too.\n\n3D game? you named that before, you don't fool me, ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nYes! 3D feature, isn't that ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic? you need to pay $30 to get it! It's basically the same game, same server.\nBut glitchy as ♥♥♥♥ (more than the original, even.)\n\nEDIT: Region.\nYes, there are 16x16 regions in this game, which you need at least 5p (5 Dollars) to expand 500 blocks of the region, this means you have a very limited space to build amazing ♥♥♥♥. You either have to be rich to get to make something cool and you must delete all blocks that you are not able to see to save some space. This of course could ♥♥♥♥ up your experience, making 3D art is a bad idea.\n\nAnd if you bought those expensive piece of ♥♥♥♥ blocks you still have to buy more if you want to make your building large. Because regions are small as ♥♥♥♥. 15p to max out the region limit which is at least 10 Dollars or more. With that money just buy any kind of game that is not this crap.\n\nEdit 2 was removed since it was unecessary, just showed off some pics of how many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ buildings are considered "Building sensations" to the game. Few cement houses with broken roof, resumed.\n\nEDIT 3: The end\nI got permanently banned the day 20/4/2016, the reason was a poorly made tactic directed to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me. He deleted my latest post and wanted an agressive message from me to have an excuse to ban me without breaking his own rules. But he did break his rules by deleting a post that was harmless, friendly. He got the agressive message from me but, it wasn't THAT agressive, all i said was that he should be disappointed at himself for doing such unproffesional thing and i called his moderator team Gestapo, that was the mostly offensive thing i have said to him besides all these insults in the review. How can you stop a 40 year old virgin from getting his revenge in his own rules? you can't, overall if he doesn't know how to react to internet.","February 12","false","124.8"," 504 of 549 people (92%) found this review helpful 105 people found this review funny","92","504","549","105","27"

And it takes a lot of it.  This may be a good game to try if there are some major changes made, however i would not waste my time or money on it until then.\n\nThe best thing, however is the developers sense of humor. However MOST of the game is player built and MOST people do not share the same humor or intelligence. There are a LOT of misspelled words in the player built areas. Sometimes i could not even guess the meaning!  The leveling up is very repetitive, at some point you will discover you cannot do some things in the game without real money (to buy Platinum).  The player driven quests were the most unique feature, however, many of them are broken or too long or boring to be interesting. The most time i spent in game was trying to complete two player driven quests only to have no way to finish them.\nHomes people build are mostly empty, and you can only explore so many towns with nothing to really do in them. And you are unable to interact with most items. So no world exploring there , either.","December 17, 2013","false","4.4"," 573 of 692 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","573","692","0","11"

First and foremost, there are way too many microtransactions (AKA in-app purchases). To build something, you need to buy every single block with coins. To gather enough of them, you have two options; either keep playing and get them (which takes forever) or buy them with real money. So, by that aspect, you may feel kinda scammed, like I did.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, it is really difficult to build. You'll have a hard time trying to place a block over another. Try it for your own, you'll see. Sometimes, the block hiding system doesn't work, thus making it impossible to play inside a room.\n\nBut wait, there are positives; as I mentioned beforehand, I liked the concept, even though it's not new. There is also a fully functional anti-grief system, which I admire, as there is no such thing in Minecraft or Terraria (yet).","November 8, 2014","false","0.9"," 319 of 383 people (83%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","83","319","383","18","3"

Remember seeing similar phenomenon in MC freebuild servers. Very few builder-type core players may create something that's actually worth looking at, but majority of builders aren't so talented or got better things to do that the landscape ends up being filled with featureless assortment of random ugly structures. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that builders often end up losing interest rather quickly and abandon their pet project to go somewhere else and start anew, leaving behind ugly husks of their former obsessions which only serves as roadblocks to newcomers trying to explore the world. And I mean UGLY. Can't even tore them down and they're littered with spikes which results in instant death for your newly created character. Really hope there were options for these abandoned structures to self-destruct and morph into forest or something.\n\nI've no idea how some reviewers say "tutorials were fun as hell", but I dunno, different taste I guess. Starter dungeon is a joke. Rectangular cage with mobs that spawn all over the place and they won't even fight back properly. Having said that, fighting is a joke. Lag is crazy and you only have one weapon to "fight" moving around in 2D plain; go figure. NPC interaction is a joke. No storyline, no dialogue, no interaction worth caring. Had you ever played any other modern MMOs you'll know beyond doubt this "game" calling itself MMO is a joke. Quests are irrelevant, NPC jokes are equally terrible and quite frankly feels like the writers are insulting you for wasting your time playing this game. This game would've been good in the last century, but the year is 2015 and it is clearly out of time.\n\nMusic is pretty good though.\n","January 27, 2015","false","1.3"," 377 of 480 people (79%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","79","377","480","61","13"

A 100% player built world with combat and an infinite world? Sounds great, right?\n\nThe way it's executed, however, isn't as great.\n\nBefore I say anything else, I do /NOT/ believe that you need good graphics to make a good game. That being said, this games graphics are one of the major issues with this game. The majority of the tutorial is telling you what you're even looking at, for example how to distinguish an overpass from the floor below. I think this game would be MUCH better if it had depth. the way it is constructed makes it difficult to tell where you are in comparison to anything. When you go under something, it dissapears, but that leads to even more confusion when trying to navigate through someones building. Furthurmore, when attenpting to build, you must puild from north to south unless using slabs. Attempting to do otherwise causes you to place the block on top of the previously placed one. Trying to build roofs or multi-story buildings is a pain, and the game doesn't tell you how to place blocks in the air without building up untill after you've placed 30 blocks. This wouldn't be an issue, except for the fact that you need gold to buy blocks. In order to get gold, you need to kill enemies, which is a good concept, but as with the rest of the game, is poorly done. The combat in this game consists of either jabbing a super-close ranged sword at the enemy, or using a pixel pistol to shoot the foes down. Aiming properly is difficult, and even if you use the swords, combat is extremely bland and difficult.\n\nThere are so many things wrong with this game, the few things it does right are not enough to counter them. Like I said before, the concept is great, but I do not recommend this game.","December 30, 2013","false","0.9"," 131 of 154 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","131","154","0","5"

I discovered that building things is PAINFULLY difficult. Also, this is NOT LIKE MINECRAFT in terms of building a world. You have to buy the blocks, with either in game money or real life money. Actually you can buy anything with real life money because this game doesn't even hide the fact that they simply want all your money and could care less about the game.

Ran the beginning dungeons to get XP to build more. So far, enjoying the game.\n\nHours 4-14: Running dungeons are pretty stupid. All of them are player made and all look the same. Learned the best way to make a town is to grind gold in a very Destiny "Loot Cave" method. Basically just click a wall thousands and thousands of time to loot gold. Game itself has become boring, but kept playing to unlock more items and finish my town.\n\nHours 15-16: Finished my town {which is the only enjoyment I really got out of this game}. Decided to explore neighboring towns to only find a wasteland of unfinished and random buildings. Its like an entire world of builders just vanished from a plague... of bordom. At this point, I feel like I wasted hours playing this game... Should have played MineCraft...\n\nFor a game that has been out for a year. This game is VERY lacking. Its supposed to be an MMO, but with a level cap of 5, that doesnt allow much progress besides building a town with very little crafting matierals. If this game had more pieces to build with and better dungeons, this game would be a lot better. DEVS need to go into the world and start deleted abandoned creations, because at this point, its just random crap everywhere and doesnt feel like a player created world...\n\nThis game has potential and there seems to be a few people who love this game... I, just like so many others, find this game to be very boring and a poor sandbox builder...\n\nWould i recommend? Maybe... Some people really love it, but as a whole, this game sucks. If they added more content and the players actually made dungeons worth playing, I would give a higher score.\n\n4/10","February 3, 2015","false","16.3"," 108 of 134 people (81%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","81","108","134","15","0"

That's why i only played 2.5 hours. Ok, now the reasons.\n\n8BitMMO is a fully player built world, that's a bad idea because there will be a bunch of players leaving blocks everywhere that serve no purpose. The game also has a town system, but whats the point if I can't move my house? I worked hard on it, I don't want to abandon it. Plus I spent in-game coins on it, YES I had to spend my gold on those blocks. And it would be annoying to clean it all up. Also, the building system is bad. I have to go into my inventory, select the item, click the box to drop it, and that's it. Why can't I just select the block I currently have, and place it, like in games like Minecraft. Also, the game is shallow, there are only 3 npcs that give you quests. I would like more npc quests to be added, like in other mmos, so I don't have to run around doing horrible player quests, (more on that later). Also, i'm at level 3, I keep completing quests, and i'm not level 4 yet.  I'm still in the first 5 levels, what the heck i should be leveling up faster. Also there's this place that looks fun that I need to be level 4 though. You know why i'm not level 4? Because of the bad player quests.\n\nThe players make horribly lazy quests, a lot of the time, they don't put me where the quest is, they give me directions that don't seem to work, and I get lost. Also once, I got a quest where I had to collect keys, and the only keys I found belonged to someone else. Thanks whoever made that quest. I even got a quest to visit a gold/xp farm. Does the developer even monitor this game? What doesn't help is that I progress slowly, and I keep getting the quests I don't want over and over again.  I never get anything new. I would actually like basic quests, that don't force me, TO FIND WHERE THEY ARE LOCATED! Sorry, had to release my anger. Anyways, these are basically the only quests I have seen other than tutorial quests, i'm not kidding.\n\nThe shop is also bad, they have a very small selection. Also, this is the only place to get blocks. Why can't I find them in places, and gather them them for free? And do they expect to me to pay real money to build a town? It should just be an expensive in-game money price. I know they need money, but if they want my money, they need to get more items in the shop people would actually pay for. Even dungeon items cost real money. Isn't that the main selling point of the game!? Its like if you had to buy the building aspect in Minecraft!\n\nSome nitpicks about the game, is the block system. If I try to put a block, between 2x2 wall, the block I placed does not go on the ground, it goes in-between the two top blocks. It makes building a hassle and wastes the player's time. Also, there are only 3 enemies I have seen in the regular world. I know the game is a work in progress, but there should have been more enemies. Some major things are that the game is grindy. It takes FOREVER to level up. I haven't gotten to see what that dimension I found is like. Also I don't see a friends list anywhere. Is an MMO supposed to be social? Then where is the friends list!?\n\nOverall, the game is right now in a bad state. With problems everywhere, a bad shop, bad player quests, and some other things, this is the WORST MMO EVER! The developer/developers need to get help, or this game will not prevail. This is a game that right now, has a terrible alpha. The only positive is that it's free. Thank goodness I didn't have to pay money for this piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI give it a 2/10 HORRIBLE. This is Qwerty, signing out.\n\nAlso if this was made by one developer, he needs a bigger team.","January 9, 2014","false","2.5"," 72 of 88 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","72","88","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatonion/recommended/250420/","thegreatonion","Onion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatonion/","6 products in account","Several months ago, I wrote a review for this game and said that I have not abandoned my willingness to change this game for future players.\n\nNow I have.\n\nIn the past, I talked about the various changes this game could use because I cared enough to believe this game can be improved. I truly thought there was hope for improvement. With no omission of detail, I will describe all the injustices of this game I have endured and eventually, what led to my eventual retirement.\n\nI am a well known player, and I have received more recomendations for modship than any single player in the history of this game. As of this review, it has been about a year since the developer displayed any intentions of enlisting new moderators.\n\nI built a tutorial for this game to remake the current one. The current tutorial cannot be considered, in any shape or form, a tutorial. It teaches basic controls, but it omitted the single most important components of a mandatory tutorial. It omitted instructions on how to build, how to obtain gold, and how to use the shop.  Most players are turned away in utter confusion for the game's mechanics. Despite spending well over 40 dollars of premium currency on construction of a new tutorial, the developer declined before I even showed him what I made.\n\nI reconstructed the spawning area for players. The current one is vestigial other than a mild utility of teleport links to two mandatory dungeons; the rest lead to dead cities and abandoned PVP arenas. This too, was declined without a second thought.\n\nI reported two major exploits regarding 9bitmmo. One allows unlimited gold farming and the other allows no-clipping through walls at will. The first was fixed within the day I reported it, and the second has yet to be fixed. The developer has no intention of fixing the second exploit stating simply, "people can already no-clip through more nefarious means". To this day, no-clipping through walls in 9bitmmo leaves all areas open to theft and quest exploitation.\n\nI created this game's first and only Megabuild, a castle that spanned the size of a 6X expanded town. The premium currency spent in its construction approaches well over 500 dollars. The most publicity it received was a visit by the developer and publicity on Facebook, twitter, and the sidebar for about two weeks. No monetary compensation was rewarded for its construction, and a teleport pad was never added to the spawn area for players to visit this place.\n\nI contributed 400 dollars in donations towards the Novemberbit fundraiser event, amounting to 1000 dollars under my name. The only prize for donating this exorbant amount is a custom item created and implemented under the name of the donator. Ever since the creations of items for the zealous donators of the game, no other items have been added.\n\nWhat made me quit this game eventually is the ignorance of the developer to sympathize with the players of this game that truly want to make it better for others. If there is criticism to be heard, it falls on deaf ears. It has been over a year since a new building block as added to the game and almost mockingly, the developer still hovers over the forums and regulates posts that criticize the declining state of the game.\n\nChris_Ramos is correct in his review when stating the incident where two game moderators were banned. It is also true he wrote the Spanish translation for the entire game and for compensation, the developer gave him ONE DOLLAR. Even the head moderator of the game was not granted a response when he sent an email asking for an explanation behind the lack of updates.\n\nThe reason he does not improve the game is not because of a lack of time or budget, it is due to his obstinate and outright refusal to do so. What the developer has committed, and is continuing to commit, is no longer within the moral realm of right or wrong. There are players who have donated thousands of dollars to this game and are taken completely for granted, their doubts met with only trivial responses as they ponder the future of the game. It is no longer a morally questionable demeanor, it an ethical crime. Because nothing categorically imperative in his actions can be considered correct; his actions indicate only a betrayal of the players' loyalty and zeal in favor of a personal agenda. In the past I would ask players to play the game before forming a judgment, and to approach it with an open mind. But with the way the game currently is now, it has no future. Not for as long as the players' loyalties are met with an utter betrayal of expectations.","February 28","false","684.1"," 54 of 61 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","54","61","2","7"

Just straight up frustrating.\n\nThe construction is unwieldy as all heck. First, you have to buy all materials from the shop (I'll get to the cost later). Then it becomes a fight with the camera angle to even build a decent house with a roof. Let me tell you, a "slightly" top down view is NOT a good angle for anything construction related. There are even cases where the walls completely block certain tiles, not only making it feel like you're building blindfolded, but also forcing you to deconstruct everything just to build whatever it was the walls were blocking.\n\nThe combat... Oh the combat. Unless you're ranged, it's almost impossible to battle without getting hit. Normally this would be fine, damage is inevitable, but considering how few hitpoints you get, the damage adds up. Ultimately, you'll be finding yourself dying and going back to the beginning of the world. Even as ranged, there's also the case of extreme respawn times, so be prepared to get shell-shocked.\n\nSpeaking of worlds, quests are pretty much your only option to even hope of getting decent money and EXP. It takes an EXTREME amount of gold to get enough to build anything past a small house. So unless you like running at cheap enemies, you'll have to do quests. Again, this would normally be fine, but after the initial quests, every quest you get is randomized, and I mean RANDOMIZED. It takes no account what level you are or anything. With some quests taking place in worlds locked behind level requirements, this is a major problem. This is countered with the ability to talk to the quest giver for a different quest, but the number of awful quests to cycle through is astounding. From continuous pixel-perfect gauntlets given to beginners, to ultra vague scavenger hunts, it's like there was no effort put into filtering the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n\nFinally, the cost. Like I said before, every block in the game costs coins, heck, even entering certain doors cost coins. I'm talking about an extravigant number of coins. With the small, convoluted shop menu, it's almost impossible to find what exactly you want. Pair that with the cost of everything, good luck trying to build something actually worth looking at. They're practically making you pay to get anything good, and even good's a strong word.\n\nThis game has no soul. It feels like something thrown together and then presented as an enchanting ground breaking indie game. It doesn't even try to hide the amount of cynicism it throws at you. Even what few NPCs are shown are extremely cynical. Jokes are fine, but having sarcastic remarks the only things NPCs say to you in an already soulless husk of a game just spits in your face. I'm sorry.","September 24, 2014","false","1.8"," 85 of 111 people (77%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","77","85","111","10","0"

I know this is only because there's only two servers.\nAfter that, I walked into a random room and instantly began seeing potty mouths and spammers. Most MMOs have these, but it's very annoying.\nEverything else went fine, the first 2 dungeons were interesting, but then I ran into a problem. I had been getting the same two player quests that were both broken/glitched, and could not be finished, thus I spent 30 minutes trying to get to level 3, farming gold for blocks. It would of been nicer to be able to choose which quest you get.\nBasicly, if you want to make your place public, you must pay money for it, which is fine, but it's simply something I wouldnt pay money for yet. Maybe give the option to pay a lot of gold for a small town, where only a few people can enter at a time, otherwise the place you build is basicly your private home, which is something I dont usually care to do. Strip this feature away and it becomes a pointless, spam-filled, glitched building system, MMO.\nThe servers are laggy, and full of undesirables. In a couple of months these things might be changed, but as far as I can tell, it's definitely not worthy of being played just yet.

Even if your satisfied never using premium blocks it will still take forever to build something cool after spamming the spacebar for longer.Quests need more tools and quest incentives should be premium currency. The inflation can't be fixed at this point (I assume)\n\nThe long version\n\nOn the off chance that anyone actually reads this or finds this helpful, this is what the game is.First i want to start off by saying i don't know why i play this game anymore. If your thinking "hmmm sandbox mmo might be interesting" it's hardly either of those things, or if your thinking "if the players make the world its probably filled with spammed blocks" and thats absolutely true, but aside from that and the drama between some (lets say) long time players here is whats wrong.\n\nThe "quest" system\n\nI figured i'd start with the most obvious and most ignored part of the game. See the quest system is where most of the games problems begin. basically theres only 6 levels and your limited by the type of quest you can create because of the tools you have at your disposal. Most quests are Mazes,find the keys in the maze, get through the maze with invisible spikes,parkour with blocks you can't tell the height of(unless your in 9bit 3d mode which costs 30$),all of the above, or my personal favorite no quest at all.Once you get to level 6 theres no incentive because you gain a measly 50 gold and no exp.\n\nFarming or zoo\n\nthe previous issue extends into this.see zoo's or gold farms are places where you can stab downward through a wall by spamming spacebar to gain gold from spawners. Naturally this broke the economy and inflated prices because now gold is too easy to get and now theres no incentive to do quests other than leveling to 6. To be clearer, the shop item never changed price, but there are items that can only be bought with premium currency. so platinum shops were created where people would sell platinum items for gold. Those were the prices that inflated. but the fact that you have to pay for regular blocks in the first place means if you want to build something cool you better have A)a town or a lot of space in the wilderness to do it B) be extremely patient or pay up the wazoo.\n\nPossible solutions\n\nquests\n\nWhile it's a long way from fixing or making the game worth playing in any way, my suggestion would be to make it so that rewardblocks give off platinum sure you can't get a reward block twice, but it's premium currency anyway so it would help players be able to get items they want by completing quests and while i realize that this is not a complete solution it's the best i can come up with. That being said players need more tools to create decent quests like npc's that can be interacted with maybe they give you items (That aren't keys) that can be put into a quest item inventory even that would be a start.\n\nfarming and inflation\n\nI would say there is one, but unfortunately there isn't.\nit all started from a bug that allowed you to stab downward through a wall thats never been fixed.\nThat's all that needed to be done to fix it, yet it's come to the point where certain people would be very reluctant to change their prices if this problem was fixed. they don't need your gold they are selling it to you out of "courtesy."\n\nyou know a certain someone even got touchy when i asked him why /tele awesome place was worth 1,000,000 gold i get that your paying for a title (because it's apparently the default suggestion for a telepad name) but even then i doubt even the minority of the players who can afford it would buy it.\n\nMy final thoughts\n\nThis game could have had so much potential but there are things wrong beyond what i have listed (because the other steam reviews cover them) and this game was really only held together by the  now long dead community. There are over 884,000 registered players and only about 20 will be playing at any given time at maximum. I don't want to dislike this game, but it's a shame that i do.\n\nCongrats intrepid explorer!\n\nif you got through the grammatical errors, my long rant, and the fact that my final thought wasn't final then you deserve a word of advice. If you decide to play this game and you see me in chat acting like a child although im almost technically and adult and spamming spacebar for the gold cycle instead of doing my biology homework or hanging out with my non-existant friends...\n\nSay hello.","April 17","false","408.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","94","17","18","6","0"

I have played well over 1,000 hours of this game total combined with Steam and the Standalone version. With that said, lets get started! Oi! Also. I am working on making this review better. Mainly because this review right now seems one sided. Till it is updated. Please don't take the review as "completed"\n\nTl;dr or something    This will some up the review if you would rather not read a giant thing of words. The only reason I don't recommend this game is because of recent events in-game. The main Dev went insane and banned two mods. Then everyone freaked out and a lot of stuff went down hill from there.\n\nBuilding    Argh, the building in this game is...weird, different, clunky, any word like those can describe the building in 8BitMMO. The angle that you play at contributes a HUGE part in how you build. At the angle you play at you have to build the back of your building first,them the sides, then the front. If not done in this order, your building will not turn out right. To combat this, you would have to buy the "DLC" called 9BitMMO. It is just a 3D viewer for the game that costs  35 dollars!  this is outrageous just for a 3D viewer for the game! Other than those flaws, if you are able to become an expert builder and learn all the tricks, you are then able to build some  insane  stuff!\n\nPVP    The PVP in this game is rather bland and boring with only 3 swords,  that are just recolored versions of each other that only do a little more damage  a pistol, a laser rifle, a hammer, and thats it. Being really good at PVP in the game is rather boring, being consider 2nd best my self; you can take it from me. Other than the weapons you can also heal your self in battle with chicken, steak, and a few other items.\n\nCommunity    Ok, this is where I become split at where I should recommend this game or not. The community in the game is actually pretty ok! There are some friendly faces out there that can really brighten up your day! But then you have the rare trolls that come in and either start insulting people or just being cringe-worthy.\n\nRules and Moderators    The rules in this game are...ok? You aren't allowed to really swear besides being able to say "Damnit" and you are not able to spam either but that rule is normal. The moderators are also ok as well, from my experiences they are always fair and never take one side of the situation just because someone is their friend. They also never mute/hard-mute people when they don't deserve it  99% of the time.\n\nHuge Pros and Cons  CONS\nDev who almost never listens to the community and starts going on a muting spree if you ask one simple question.\nAlmost no active community at this point\nTo build anything good you need to buy it with Platinum (Currency bought with real money) PROS\nGold is rather easy to get if you are an active player at farms.\nA lot of the players and mods are willing to help you if you have trouble.\nPlat items are able to be bought with in game gold, though a lot I might add.\nEnding Note(s)    In conclusion, 8BitMMO is an "meh" game with it's flaws, but until the Dev can get his **** together, this will stay negative.","February 28","false","418.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","3"

I started out enjoying it, but then I realized that I wasn't. The community is, mostly, the Roblox people but even worse. Trying to figure out where something is, where you're putting something, where you're going, and why you can't move hurts your eyes. Whenever you walk under something, it immediately goes invisible. When you walk through an actual person's structure, it flashes like strobe lights. Even more so, when you try to build in this abomination of a game, the fixed camera angle and no FOV fish-eye causes you to put things in the wrong place. The dynamics of building are repetitive and time consuming, not to mention that you run out of materials and you have to grind for hours to get more, or perform a microtransaction. Not to mention, anything put somewhere by a different person cannot be changed. Everybody's low-tier items clutter the ground of the wilderness, and as you walk over them the camera jerks up and back down once you've walked off. It hurts your head after a while, and they're EVERYWHERE. The community, again, is terrible. There is one other way to get money for materials. Player-made quests. What this means, is, you go in their headache castle, walk past traps with no possible way to recognize, see coming, or prevent, and get 1 unit from a currency dispenser at the end. The screenshots are the least cluttered thing in the entire game. Anything else looks like a preschooler's noodle art that they covered in glitter, then tried to flush down a toilet. The dragon that you saw when you clicked on the link to the game? If you tried creating that, you'd spend over $100 and 5 hours. If you do play this game, I did warn you. It sounds good, but it was executed worse than Napoleon's invasion of Russia.","November 16, 2014","false","2.8"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","29","46","7","1"

It at first was really fun, I enjoyed getting better gear, messing around with my pocket universe, and exploring the map. It slowly gets... kind of dull after a while though.\n\nCombat\nThe enemies in this game are all the exact same, except they look different and have different stats. They will try to run at you, and hit you after 5 seconds. Needless to say, they are very easy to kill. PVP is pretty engaging at first, but gets old really quickly. You have 4 types of weapons that each work differently, and considering there is only one developer, this isn't that bad. The issue is the weapons themselves. There are three swords, exactly the same except in damage. There is a gun, that shoots little friendliness pellets at people, and it controls alright. The laser is pretty weird, you charge it for a few seconds, and it shoots a straight line. People actually have made good use of this in pvp, but it seems extermely easy to dodge. Lastly is the hammer, doing a massive area damage, but taking a while to charge. Each of these weapons can be specialized to do well in pvp, and people have become really good at pvp in this game. Regardless, it does get dull quickly, however it is worth trying out.\nCommunity\nThe community is actually pretty helpful, when I played this game, I actually learned a lot from other people. The only issue is that for an MMO, there is pretty much nobody. 5-10 people are usually online at a time, which is pretty small considering a huge part of the game is Towns. It would be a much, much better game if it were more active. Because of recent events I have heard of (and not participated in, and as such will not talk about), and the game not really being updated, I doubt this will happen easily. The community that is there is fine, though.\nBuilding\nIronically, this is probably the worst aspect of the game. Well, second worst. The mechanics are not that bad, it just takes getting used to. The issue is often, unless you are an expert and know what your doing, it won't turn look very good. This wouldn't be that bad if more materials were available, but microtransactions make it worse.\nMicrotransactions\nI get it, I honestly get it. There has to be a way for servers to keep running, so microtransactions are used. Honestly though, when I get a game, I want all the features available (minus DLC, that's different). It's a bit like PVE, and PVE2. Plants vs Zombies costs some money, but it gives all the features immediately. Plants vs Zombies 2, on the other hand, is free. However, there are many micotransactions. I would rather just pay the $5. Not only do items cost money, though this is forgivable considering items aren't necessarilly needed, and they are obtainable through mystery boxes, but towns and pocket universes need money. Towns need money to make, and money to expand. Pocket Universes need money to expand. Even dungeons, a large gimmick of this game, need money to make. The good news is it's easy to get some items via players, and there are shops that sell them. The bad news is they are really expensive.\nStyle\nThe style of this game is actually not that bad. It doesn't look really good, but it's alright. The music is really on your taste, however. I personally don't mind it, but I can easily see people turn off the game after 5 minutes from it. It's essentially 8-bit dubstep. Ironically, it is one of the only aspects of the game that doesn't get old after a while.\nFinal Verdict\n8-bit mmo, dispite it's flaws, is a fun game. It is a nice little game to pop in every now and then, mess around with, and leave. It isn't by any means horrible, but it isn't a masterpiece either. It's pretty fun for the first 10-20 hours, but then gets dull, depending on your taste. That being said, you should try it out, and if it isn't your style, forget about it. Because of the numerous flaws, and it being boring after a short while, I'm going to have to give it a 5/10. See if you like it, but if it doesn't look like your cup of tea, skip it.","April 30","false","9.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I am a rather popular player and I have seen alot of things come and go in this. I joined around about june in 2014.\n\n| What it's all about |\n\n8bitmmo is game is an 8bit styled mmo, the game is in third person mode and follows your character around, which is pretty much a square with legs, arms, and a square head. To accompany the retro look it heavily features chiptune while you're playing the game (for all you nostalgia nerds out there!).\n\nIn 8bitmmo, it is a very social game as the game revolves around a chat. With this chat, players wouldn't be able to communicate with each other. As the title says, you can literally build anything you want, from dragons to space ships, to pixel art and pirate ships, you can really do it all in 8bitmmo. You can even build quests for players, these quests are always built in towns in which give you your own personal area to build in.\n\n| Pros |\n\n- There is a postive and a thriving community who are all very welcoming.\n\n- The game has recently been released as an alpha and may be updated frequently.\n\n- You can build anything you want, as long as it's not innapropriate.\n\n- It's relatively easy to obatin gold, there is a farming cycle which lasts for 45 minutes and within that time, players can gain 2000 gold.\n\n- There is a market for premium items in which some players are willing to commit to keep the economy alive in the game.\n\n- You can have alot of fun in this mmo.\n\n| Cons |\n\n- The developer is not active.\n\n- Only a handful of players really stick around for a while, many players come and go.\n\n- The vast majority of new players are mainly 3 year olds who spam the chat all day long, it's extremely irritating.\n\n- This game calls itself an "mmo" yet there are only around 10 - 20 players online everyday, if you're lucky, this might be extended to 30 players.\n\n| Over all view |\n\nPersonally, this is my favourite game and I do enjoy it. However, the game needs to be frequently updated and as a consiquence, many players aren't satisfied about the games slow development. Although the developer calls the game an alpha, in my eyes it's still a beta. It is still very basic and needs much more time and effort into the game. However, the community are very enthusiastic about new players and they are genuinly awesome people.\n\n| Rating |\n\nOverall, I'd rate 8bitmmo 8.5/10","January 3","true","738.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

One cannot find a proper and public place to build. The world is not infinite, and that being said, theres random bits and pieces of debris lying around from some long-vanished player. Combat is bland, even given the early access there is only a minimal variety of enemies and weapons. It also gives access to powerful weapons very early in the game, and enemy spawns are quite very visible, making even the newbliest noob an easy way to farm for gold and exp. Building is also a pain, as it is confusing and blocks tend to overlap and behave in an odd way. The biggest problem I had was the "roofing" system. Ceilings that are placed overhead vanish and reappear suddenly, leading to a flashing and annoying ceiling over your characters head.\n\nTL;DR:\n1. Crappy Combat\n2. Crappy Building System\n3.

The graphics are pretty shoddy and look kinda off when you move, but they work (for the most part, anyway, determining what layer a block is on is tricky and overhangs just vanish when you're under them). The music is honestly quite enjoyable, but nothing fantastic.\n\nGameplay is simple, but effective: both combat and building have little to them but still satisfied me nonetheless. The menus do their job, but aren't special and don't really look pretty. The NPCs have nice designs (and the ones that speak are often humorous) but enemy AI is incredibly simple and similar.\n\nI can't really comment on the MMO aspect, as I prefer playing solo. But for an MMO, I enjoyed my time alone, which is generally a good sign. I've heard complaints of being only playable if you shovel money into it, but I honestly didn't feel that way at all. Overall, the game is lacking. However, there are three factors that stop me from not reccomending this:\n\n1) The game is in early access. The biggest problems I have with this game (namely, the artwork and the simplicity) can be very easily fixed with future updates.\n\n2) There's just a certain...CHARM the game has. With it's designs and it's dialogue and it's style...there's just something about this game that I love, even if it isn't that great on closer examination.\n\n3) The game is free. There is really nothing stopping you from at least trying it out and making a decision.\n\nTL;DR: The game is simple and somewhat lazy, but charming and free.","October 7, 2014","true","5.6"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","28","52","5","0"

At first, this game looked amazing, fun, and well put together. But that's just in the trailor. The truth is,  when you actually begin to play the game, you notice a lot that went wrong. First, it's incredibly hard to figure out how to play. The tutorial doesn't tell you much at all about what you're supposed to do, or how to get started. Second, the block layouts are all very 'chunky' and hard to work with. You can barely tell where blocks actually are, what level they're at, or where a wall is.\nThis game has a camera view very similar to old 8 bit games, but the view genuinely sucks. You can't even see the sides of blocks so even with the different layers, this game doesn't even have a 3d feel to it. Other than that, the character art is awful, battles don't make much sense, and I couldn't even figure out just by playing the game if there's an inventory system.\nIn general, I would rate 8bitMMO 3/10. I just couldn't see a good side to the game.","July 16, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebatman727/recommended/250420/","thebatman727","KANE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebatman727/","150 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n8BitMMO, created by Robby Zinchak aka RobbyZ is a old school styled Free Roam Rpg. 8BitMMO is a game that takes inspiration from many games such as Minecraft, Legend of Zelda, and even Mario. In 8BitMMO you start off waking up in a man's house who is completely aware that he is in a video game by breaking the 4th wall. He sends you off to complete quests in order to just get you out of his house, he references that he has done this multiple times and that strangers waking up in his house has become a common problem for him. This snarky dialogue made me enjoy my first 10 minutes of the game, as it reminded me of dialogue coming from games like Saints Row. I love it when games make fun of the fact that it is a game. Unfortunately after the tutorial this dialogue seemed to cease and enjoyment of my gameplay experience began to decrease more and more. The combat in 8BitMMO is simple enough to play with one hand, with occasionaly reaching for your mouse. Only having the WASD keys for movement and the space bar for attacking made hunting quests and fighting off enemies a bore after the tutorial. There is also another element that makes 8BitMMO a little more entertaining; the ability to build. You are able to build a houses and environments like a top down Minecraft or Terraria. The building can become tedious with blocks stacking not the way you want them to and having a lack of tools to do anything truly spectacular. Although I didnt enjoy this feature, I did see many interesting and cool user created homes and even areas that put the building and combat to good use. The music is probably what I enjoyed most from 8BitMMO, it had beats that went along with the art direction and it had the convenient feature to skip the current song as if i was using Pandora radio. The game does have a leveling system like most other MMO's that encourage you to rank up in order to get certain items or get to certain areas. I have to completely honest and say that I didnt have a great time with 8BitMMO. It is free on Steam and does offer microtransactions, BUT doesnt flash them around begging for money. The game might be fun with a few friends looking to make your own quests and adventures but playing alone is just plain boring.\n\nOverall:\n\n8BitMMO has a lot of great ideas that just dont work out yet. After sometime and update the game can be great. The music fits in with the world perfectly and the combat is a little bland. In my opinion I would like to see RobbyZ create either more content for this game or make more games with the same amount of snark and wit that the tutorial of this game had. I loved the original dialogue and was set to play a game that knew how to make fun of its self but instead, I got a bland and lifeless world that could and should be improved dramatically. And could be alot of fun if your bored with nothing new to play or if you find a group to play with.(Roleplaying could be fun in this game)\n\nVerdict:\n\n7.0\n\nWorth a try.(hey its free!)","June 28, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The concept is great, but the game sucks. I might say that since it's still in Early Access there might be something to it in the future, but no. This game is the product of 12 YEARS OF WORK. 12 YEARS. That is not a typo, the developer has spent 12 years working on this thing that is in such a sorry state. I would be impressed of the product because there's almost only one person working on it, but after 12 years this game sits as if it was a project someone could have made on DigiPen's ProjectFun developing engine. The graphics are terrbile, and not just because it's 8-Bit. Now let me just say great games don't have to have the most real graphics ever, but this game makes you confused about wether the obect in front of you is a wall, door, passageway, the ground, or the ceiling.\n\nIf this had been worked on for a couple months to a year, i would say it has potential and could be something awesome someday, but after 12 years, there's no hope for a better product.

Instead I got a cheap and unfun game with poor hit detection, lots of lag and a rather aggressive player base. The gameplay, while simplistic, doesn't always function the way you want it to, concepts of the game aren't explained well in it's tutorials, and there is no way that I could find of telling when I was getting hit, so I ended up dying when it appeared I was doing really well. The graphics are more akin to a late-era Atari 2600 game as opposed to an 8-bit console, which sort of ruins the entire 8-bit feel. I guess some of the music is catchy, though some of it is also not so good, so it's rather hit-and-miss.\n\nI did not spend that much time with the game, but the time I did spend was enough to convince me that this game is not for me, and most likely not a game that was well made.

This game has little bit of everthing for  everytype of player. If your the type on gamer who plays to slay, then your enjoy the completely player built dugeons. If you like to set a mark on the virtual world, then constuct an house, buy a town stone, gather citizens, and be the mayor.\nWhat makes this game great is the freedom. In other games, if you spend REAL money on the game, you can squish every other player, and no one really gets along, but in this game regular players and players with money mix, and work together. For example, people who spend money get speical money called plat, where they can buy exclusive building supplies, but people who dont have money to spare on an 8 bit free video game can still get that exclusive gear. this game is completely player built, most people think that means levels and stuff, but people devolped game modes within the game, and an money conversiony thingy ( 1 plat= 1000 g the devolpers didnt diside that, the players did)\nOne of may favorite parts of the game is the socialness. Once you get playing you become popular withen the game, and people respect you. people give oppinions on eachothers ideas, they share, donate money, and some towns have a government system started, which is pretty cool.\nSo if your looking for a game that you create games within that game this is the one for you.

This game isn't focused on any age group- fun for everyone! The deaths aren't taken too hard, and the possibilities are ENDLESS. Once you start playining, you're "sucked into the 8-bit world." Everyone on the chat is extremely friendly, and never, ever, curse. Kill monsters, build houses, stack your community, you just can't stop. This game isn't very hard to pick up, but is hard to put down. One of my favorite parts of the game is when you spawn in RobbyZ's house, as a homo "hero." I found this hilarious. I would freak out if homeless guys claiming to be heroes just started appearing in my house. Everything you could want in this game. Respect. Passion. And even the great feeling you get of slaughtering Lawyercats. 8-Bit MMO is by far the coolest game I've picked up in a while.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/recommended/250420/","dreadjester","DreaddJester","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/","321 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you can enjoy some old school graphics, like sandbox games like Minecraft and MMORPG games then there's a good chance you'll find something to enjoy in 8BitMMO.  Unfortunately the game is not without it's issues but keep in mind this is an Early Access Game and in time some of those glaring issues will be ironed out.\n\nLets start with the good however.  First off this game will run on nearly any computer that's still up and running out there.  It's simple grapics style is a solid plus and you can feel confident inviting your friends to join with you no matter what kind of computer they have.  Secondly the game is free-to-play so you really have no excuse as to why you aren't at least trying this game out.  As an added bonus they currently are using what I consider one of the best free to play models out there.  There is nothing in this game, other than some cosmetic hats, that you can't get without spending money.  Other than the time things take to do your experience in this game will be no different whether you spend money or not.\n\nSo what is the gameplay like??  Well it's in part a roleplaying game.  Combat is currently limited to a small variety of mostly hand held swords that get better as you level and it is very basic but somehow enjoyable.  There are quests you can follow to recieve a nice reward in the end and different monsters to beat up.  Story wise, it's "not-so-serious" gameplay with a lot of witty humor and references to other movies, games, and so forth.  The other part of the game is very sandbox style.  Most of the world can be built up by the players which really gives you a chance to make your mark on the world, including designing dungeons and such for others to adventure in.  You buy the building blocks, monster spawners, and other building materials using in game money, which can be earned by killing monsters and completing quests, or bought with real money.  Other than a handful of hats that is the only thing that real money can buy for you.  Yes your gear is also bought with in game money however it is currently very limited and cheap enough to afford with just monster killing and questing money.  Even building materials are fairly cheap, though it will take some time saving up coins to build anything massive if your not willing to spend real money.\n\nSo what about the ugly side of the game.  Well first off the servers don't seem to currently be able to handle the load right now.  Granted there were what looked like hundreds of people playing, but I did experience quite a bit of lag that was worse in the more populated areas.  Secondly it is not at all or in any way pretty when it comes to graphics.  In some instances it can be hard to understand where you're supposed to go.  Some of this is players not being used to the building tools and thereby not building their structures in the most presentable way but some of it is simply the limitations of the graphics engine.  As far as audio goes, the sounds are extremely limited.  Start up some tunes of your own before you start the game.\n\nOverall this is certainly a game you can and should at least try out.  While there's still a lot of things that can be ironed out there's a huge potential for this game to be massivly fun.  If you can put up with a few hiccups and bumps in the road I belive you'll find this a very enjoyable game.  It's certainly one that I will be playing from time to time and keeping an eye on.","December 30, 2013","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

When i switched to the beta world to see if it was less populated, but I found that my gear did not carry over and i had to start the tutoial all over agin.

This game isn't focused on any age group- fun for everyone! The deaths aren't taken too hard, and the possibilities are ENDLESS. Once you start playining, you're "sucked into the 8-bit world." Everyone on the chat is extremely friendly, and never, ever, curse. Kill monsters, build houses, stack your community, you just can't stop. This game isn't very hard to pick up, but is hard to put down. One of my favorite parts of the game is when you spawn in RobbyZ's house, as a homo "hero." I found this hilarious. I would freak out if homeless guys claiming to be heroes just started appearing in my house. Everything you could want in this game. Respect. Passion. And even the great feeling you get of slaughtering Lawyercats. 8-Bit MMO is by far the coolest game I've picked up in a while. You should get this game.","December 15, 2013","true","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/recommended/250420/","dreadjester","DreaddJester","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/","321 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you can enjoy some old school graphics, like sandbox games like Minecraft and MMORPG games then there's a good chance you'll find something to enjoy in 8BitMMO.  Unfortunately the game is not without it's issues but keep in mind this is an Early Access Game and in time some of those glaring issues will be ironed out.\n\nLets start with the good however.  First off this game will run on nearly any computer that's still up and running out there.  It's simple grapics style is a solid plus and you can feel confident inviting your friends to join with you no matter what kind of computer they have.  Secondly the game is free-to-play so you really have no excuse as to why you aren't at least trying this game out.  As an added bonus they currently are using what I consider one of the best free to play models out there.  There is nothing in this game, other than some cosmetic hats, that you can't get without spending money.  Other than the time things take to do your experience in this game will be no different whether you spend money or not.\n\nSo what is the gameplay like??  Well it's in part a roleplaying game.  Combat is currently limited to a small variety of mostly hand held swords that get better as you level and it is very basic but somehow enjoyable.  There are quests you can follow to recieve a nice reward in the end and different monsters to beat up.  Story wise, it's "not-so-serious" gameplay with a lot of witty humor and references to other movies, games, and so forth.  The other part of the game is very sandbox style.  Most of the world can be built up by the players which really gives you a chance to make your mark on the world, including designing dungeons and such for others to adventure in.  You buy the building blocks, monster spawners, and other building materials using in game money, which can be earned by killing monsters and completing quests, or bought with real money.  Other than a handful of hats that is the only thing that real money can buy for you.  Yes your gear is also bought with in game money however it is currently very limited and cheap enough to afford with just monster killing and questing money.  Even building materials are fairly cheap, though it will take some time saving up coins to build anything massive if your not willing to spend real money.\n\nSo what about the ugly side of the game.  Well first off the servers don't seem to currently be able to handle the load right now.  Granted there were what looked like hundreds of people playing, but I did experience quite a bit of lag that was worse in the more populated areas.  Secondly it is not at all or in any way pretty when it comes to graphics.  In some instances it can be hard to understand where you're supposed to go.  Some of this is players not being used to the building tools and thereby not building their structures in the most presentable way but some of it is simply the limitations of the graphics engine.  As far as audio goes, the sounds are extremely limited.  Start up some tunes of your own before you start the game.\n\nOverall this is certainly a game you can and should at least try out.  While there's still a lot of things that can be ironed out there's a huge potential for this game to be massivly fun.  If you can put up with a few hiccups and bumps in the road I belive you'll find this a very enjoyable game.  It's certainly one that I will be playing from time to time and keeping an eye on.","December 30, 2013","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I started out on the main world and went through the tutorial (Which took a bit of time) and then went out to find a place to build. Ill say this, the world is so populated that it is very VERY hard to find a place to build that wasnt covered in debris from previous players. When i switched to the beta world to see if it was less populated, but I found that my gear did not carry over and i had to start the tutoial all over agin. I just stopped there and decided this game wasnt worth it. Even when i was doing missions in the main world, It wasnt really that fun.

At certain times it can be very boring, depending on what players are online. It is a friendly game, except when people scam, spam, or curse. Be forewarned this happens quite frequently. When people buy plat or plat items, they either sell them or use them. Plat item selling is very common, so it is uncommon for people to buy plat. There are also items called mystery boxes, so you can buy plat items only with gold. There is so much you can do on this game! it depends entirely on what you want to do. If you like making pixel art, there are many blocks that provide colors to do so. One player (Sage) made realistic looking people using only blocks he/she could buy in-game. If you like being a popular and admired player, you can give or sell plat items.

He wandered around and built a house. Then he discovered that he could become a potato. So, he lept at the opportunity. The lad enjoyed being a potato and hopped around happily. Until one day the lad met a man with an eyepatch and fancy suit. He said to the man "Hi there I have mixed feelings about you. You are wearing an eyepatch. That makes me distrust you, but you are also wearing a fancy suit. Despite that the fact that I cannot figure out why it is so fancy, it makes me trust you."\n"Well my lad no reason to fear me for I am a mayor. Follow me to my city and I will grant you citizenship and a free plot of land."\nThe lad happily followed the man to his city until they arrived there.\n"Here is my city lad. Go in and make yourself at home."\n"But sir it is a cave."\n"Oh my silly boy. It is an underground city. See?"\nHe said as he walked into the cave.

This game isn't focused on any age group- fun for everyone! The deaths aren't taken too hard, and the possibilities are ENDLESS. Once you start playining, you're "sucked into the 8-bit world." Everyone on the chat is extremely friendly, and never, ever, curse. Kill monsters, build houses, stack your community, you just can't stop. This game isn't very hard to pick up, but is hard to put down. One of my favorite parts of the game is when you spawn in RobbyZ's house, as a homo "hero." I found this hilarious. I would freak out if homeless guys claiming to be heroes just started appearing in my house. Everything you could want in this game. Respect. Passion. And even the great feeling you get of slaughtering Lawyercats. 8-Bit MMO is by far the coolest game I've picked up in a while. You should get this game.","December 15, 2013","true","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/recommended/250420/","dreadjester","DreaddJester","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dreadjester/","321 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIf you can enjoy some old school graphics, like sandbox games like Minecraft and MMORPG games then there's a good chance you'll find something to enjoy in 8BitMMO.  Unfortunately the game is not without it's issues but keep in mind this is an Early Access Game and in time some of those glaring issues will be ironed out.\n\nLets start with the good however.  First off this game will run on nearly any computer that's still up and running out there.  It's simple grapics style is a solid plus and you can feel confident inviting your friends to join with you no matter what kind of computer they have.  Secondly the game is free-to-play so you really have no excuse as to why you aren't at least trying this game out.  As an added bonus they currently are using what I consider one of the best free to play models out there.  There is nothing in this game, other than some cosmetic hats, that you can't get without spending money.  Other than the time things take to do your experience in this game will be no different whether you spend money or not.\n\nSo what is the gameplay like??  Well it's in part a roleplaying game.  Combat is currently limited to a small variety of mostly hand held swords that get better as you level and it is very basic but somehow enjoyable.  There are quests you can follow to recieve a nice reward in the end and different monsters to beat up.  Story wise, it's "not-so-serious" gameplay with a lot of witty humor and references to other movies, games, and so forth.  The other part of the game is very sandbox style.  Most of the world can be built up by the players which really gives you a chance to make your mark on the world, including designing dungeons and such for others to adventure in.  You buy the building blocks, monster spawners, and other building materials using in game money, which can be earned by killing monsters and completing quests, or bought with real money.  Other than a handful of hats that is the only thing that real money can buy for you.  Yes your gear is also bought with in game money however it is currently very limited and cheap enough to afford with just monster killing and questing money.  Even building materials are fairly cheap, though it will take some time saving up coins to build anything massive if your not willing to spend real money.\n\nSo what about the ugly side of the game.  Well first off the servers don't seem to currently be able to handle the load right now.  Granted there were what looked like hundreds of people playing, but I did experience quite a bit of lag that was worse in the more populated areas.  Secondly it is not at all or in any way pretty when it comes to graphics.  In some instances it can be hard to understand where you're supposed to go.  Some of this is players not being used to the building tools and thereby not building their structures in the most presentable way but some of it is simply the limitations of the graphics engine.  As far as audio goes, the sounds are extremely limited.  Start up some tunes of your own before you start the game.\n\nOverall this is certainly a game you can and should at least try out.  While there's still a lot of things that can be ironed out there's a huge potential for this game to be massivly fun.  If you can put up with a few hiccups and bumps in the road I belive you'll find this a very enjoyable game.  It's certainly one that I will be playing from time to time and keeping an eye on.","December 30, 2013","true","4.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The idea is very appealing on paper, but just something about the execution the turned me off completely. I'm not one to nitpick over graphics but this isn't really an 8-bit game. In fact there's an inconsistency when it comes to graphics altogether. Menus are one thing, the world is another, some of the sprites something else, and the inventory is it's own thing. It seems like each of the components were made individually and then thrown together with glue and duct tape. This game seems to lack an overall harmony.\n\nOn the bright side it's in early access beta so a lot can change in the coming months. For the time being though... meh. I'll wait a bit before turning it on again.\n\nI will however give this game a point of kudos for having a quirky personality.

(Like the game says, 100% player built) One more thing that would help is fixing the rendering stuffs because sometimes, The wall's line would not render properly.","February 9, 2014","true","15.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't know of many games like it. It reminds me of Realm of the Mad God. It is half "hack n' slash" and half "sandbox". Its pretty good, but it does get boring if you don't like grinding (like myself), although there isn't much of it, which is good. The building is a bit wonky, so I tend to avoid it and just explore. I know its still in Early Access, so maybe they'll fix it. Haven't seen to much "pay-to-win", although there isn't much to win. I've put about an hour in so far, and killed some Hipsters, Business Cats, and The Escapist.  There are some quests, and those are pretty cool. The sort-of cool thing is that when you finished the quests that came with the game, you get to do some player quests. Some are "get through the dungeon", some are "find the reward in my city", and some are "here's your reward, you're good at doing nothing". I prefer the latter two (I suck at fighting in games). Overall, its an O.K. game for what it is right now. I suggest you try it, and if you don't like it wait a bit and then come back. Its a pretty small file size too, so that helps. If the current game were the finished product, I would give it 7.5/10.","March 30, 2014","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In 8BitMMO you start off waking up in a man's house who is completely aware that he is in a video game by breaking the 4th wall. He sends you off to complete quests in order to just get you out of his house, he references that he has done this multiple times and that strangers waking up in his house has become a common problem for him. This snarky dialogue made me enjoy my first 10 minutes of the game, as it reminded me of dialogue coming from games like Saints Row. I love it when games make fun of the fact that it is a game. Unfortunately after the tutorial this dialogue seemed to cease and enjoyment of my gameplay experience began to decrease more and more. The combat in 8BitMMO is simple enough to play with one hand, with occasionaly reaching for your mouse. Only having the WASD keys for movement and the space bar for attacking made hunting quests and fighting off enemies a bore after the tutorial. There is also another element that makes 8BitMMO a little more entertaining; the ability to build. You are able to build a houses and environments like a top down Minecraft or Terraria. The building can become tedious with blocks stacking not the way you want them to and having a lack of tools to do anything truly spectacular. Although I didnt enjoy this feature, I did see many interesting and cool user created homes and even areas that put the building and combat to good use. The music is probably what I enjoyed most from 8BitMMO, it had beats that went along with the art direction and it had the convenient feature to skip the current song as if i was using Pandora radio. The game does have a leveling system like most other MMO's that encourage you to rank up in order to get certain items or get to certain areas. I have to completely honest and say that I didnt have a great time with 8BitMMO. It is free on Steam and does offer microtransactions, BUT doesnt flash them around begging for money. The game might be fun with a few friends looking to make your own quests and adventures but playing alone is just plain boring.\n\nOverall:\n\n8BitMMO has a lot of great ideas that just dont work out yet. After sometime and update the game can be great. The music fits in with the world perfectly and the combat is a little bland. In my opinion I would like to see RobbyZ create either more content for this game or make more games with the same amount of snark and wit that the tutorial of this game had. I loved the original dialogue and was set to play a game that knew how to make fun of its self but instead, I got a bland and lifeless world that could and should be improved dramatically. And could be alot of fun if your bored with nothing new to play or if you find a group to play with.(Roleplaying could be fun in this game)","February 13, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I like to think of it as Minecraft-meets-Legend of Zelda-meets-8 Bit graphics. You can build a town, dungeon, PvP arena, or anything you like! The world is entirely player built (even creator Sim9 has to follow the rules of establishing a town). Players can also create their own quests. In a way, the game is like a Wiki, it depends almost entirely upon its users. And the game is still in Beta, so it can only go up from here!

The way this game is set up is a bit strange and can be confusing at first, I do say this game has potential, but the developers need to stop banning people for saying small things like "This game is boring" "I dont enjoy this game" And on the forums when one lists bugs and ideas to fix those, you are banned for trying to help them improve their game.

At certain times it can be very boring, depending on what players are online. It is a friendly game, except when people scam, spam, or curse. Be forewarned this happens quite frequently. When people buy plat or plat items, they either sell them or use them. Plat item selling is very common, so it is uncommon for people to buy plat. There are also items called mystery boxes, so you can buy plat items only with gold. There is so much you can do on this game! it depends entirely on what you want to do. If you like making pixel art, there are many blocks that provide colors to do so. One player (Sage) made realistic looking people using only blocks he/she could buy in-game. If you like being a popular and admired player, you can give or sell plat items. In total 8bitMMO is one of the best games i have ever encountered.","May 15, 2015","true","442.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

This was an 8bit MMO that features building stuff and I honestly didn't know what to think.\n\nAfter playing the slow and annoying tutorial and dealing with the no so good controls, I decided to talk to the people in chat and got invited to visit some guys mansion/castle/whatever that 8bit thing was and I was kinda surprised that someone could finish something that big on that game. My brain hurt after 20 minutes, this guy must of spent atleast several hours completing his 8bit fortress of headaches.\n\nThe dialogue is also bland and features no depth to what your doing, it felt like I was jumping into a poorly built 90's game.\n\nI recommend not touching this and just skip over to another free MMO on steam, like Neverwinter or CoS.\n\nUnless you have the patience of a saint and really love confusing gameplay, then take a stab at it.\n\nAwful controls, really annoying tutorial and a general feeling of overwhelming boredom shot this down long before it took flight.\n\nPersonal Rating: 1/5","April 28, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Anyone who has ever coded anything will notice that the developer has most likely thrown his entire life and soul into this (which he has). This game has come so far, and has so much more potential. The community is friendly, and very helpful. Mods are on nearly 24/7, you can message the developer directly on IRC for quick replies. If you want an RPG then don't go here. This is a social, sandbox game. Everything you can do you can do without buying anything with real money. The MOST you have to do in the form of extra payment is buy premium items from other players with gold. Every single thing in this game is player built, and most of them are absolutely amazing.

However the enemies do tend to get a bit repetitive but still challenging in a way, I enjoy it very much but its really up to you about how you feel about it when it comes to what your looking for in gameplay. If you want a casual building game with some fighting but not quite minecraft than this may be for you! If your looking for a action packed battle game with flaming demonic wolves than i suggest you keep searching.

I would, and have, recommended this game to others. The community is nice, kind and friendly, and the odd "bad" (inconsiderate?) player is easily dealt with by the multiple game moderators. It's free! Seriously, it's amazing that something this awesome is Free to Play. Some people (I won't lie - me included) don't like the graphics but the Texture Packs made by the community for the community add a really unique feel to the game. Even if a construction looks "bad", most players are considerate and try find as much good points about the build as possible. The developer, Robby Zinchak (Sim9), is really involved with the game and its community, not like some other games (minecraft?). It's a construction sandbox! Personally, I absolutely love construction sandboxes, and one were you can suggest something and it's likely it'll be added? Even better! You can suggest things through either the forums or in the suggestion box and Robby will read it and, possibly, add it in. The moderators are all friendly and I don't have an issue with even 1 of them. You can chat relaxed with the community and it's so laid back it's unbelievable.\n\nI would DEFINITELY recommend this game to as many people as I possibly can.","August 3, 2014","true","441.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","18"

It's pretty nice.\n\nIt's clearly not for everyone.  The graphics are rudimentary but functional, and the gameplay is quite simplistic.  Still, there is a certain community cohesion and simplicity that will appeal to other players.\n\nThis is clearly a nitch game, but if it's your nitch you will certainly enjoy it.  Your best bet is to try it for free, and see if you like it.   Worst case you lose the few hours you spent learning the game mechanics, and even then observant players who don't like the game will gain insite into the nitch title which may help them understand certain general game and community mechanics that were done right in this game, as well as where the title is lacking which makes it only appeal to a nitch group.\n\nOh yeah, and there's some achievements for you achievement ♥♥♥♥♥s out there. :D","December 1, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

These graphics ARE the worst i have seen in my ENTIRE life. As I played the beggining all it told me was how to build and fight and the things you SHOULD know like: opening things, walking, the list goes on. It didnt tell me how to make a town, or how to join one which it really should tell you. Dont waste your time with this unless you dont mind giving up a game after 30 minutes or you are an insane sandboxer or young child. It is free to play and thats the only reason people download this game. I think they either need to remake the graphics of the game, or just beef the gameplay up a bit.

Just try again later in the day.\nPrimary is usually a thriving and bustling server with a very good ammount of players for you to meet and socialize with.\nThe moderators do their job to keep an eye on chat, and are also extremely friendly.\nAt first glance, PVP seems bland... But if you try out the weapons and strive to get better, I guarantee you will love it a whole lot more. There are endless possibilities for this game.

However, that wall yeah lets leave that in your way.\n\nAlso, What on earth do the devs do in this? Seems like every quest is playermade except for the first 3 maybe? That's great and all but every player quest is either "Oh her move to there get free gold and give donations plox!", "Hey every wall you can't see through may or may not have a trap and by the way watch out for random lasers.", or the worst of them all "Oh hey here is some free gold, donation box is here and there's a free no risk exp/gold farms all over."\n\nI mean 3 npcs you start talking to make it seem like oh hey this might be a great game, humor is alright and all. Oh wait that's pretty much all the stuff the devs have done as far as content. Everything else is done by players and their quests are tossed into a RNG pool from 1 npc.

First and foremost, there are way too many microtransactions (AKA in-app purchases). To build something, you need to buy every single block with coins. To gather enough of them, you have two options; either keep playing and get them (which takes forever) or buy them with real money. So, by that aspect, you may feel kinda scammed, like I did.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, it is really difficult to build. You'll have a hard time trying to place a block over another. Try it for your own, you'll see. Sometimes, the block hiding system doesn't work, thus making it impossible to play inside a room.\n\nBut wait, there are positives; as I mentioned beforehand, I liked the concept, even though it's not new. There is also a fully functional anti-grief system, which I admire, as there is no such thing in Minecraft or Terraria (yet).\n","January 31, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The 100% player built world is no lie. Most of the achivements are hilarious. This is the one game i have in my steam library with over 13 hours.  The only problem i have is the microtransactions. Plat swamps the shop. But at least you can turn into a potato. Most of the building blocks don't cost much, and getting money is easy. You can create enemy spawners and get money from that, along with other things.The trading option is great, along with creating towns with townstones.The 8-bit style is well made. The chosen music for the game fits with the style perfectly. The griefing control in the game is well-made, so people aren't running around taking blocks from your build randomly.

The game has you kill "hipsters" for some reason. Or "lobbycats" i guess lobbyist cats? And by far the worst part of this game is the perspective. It is so confusing and impossible to navigate. I have had multiple instances where a wall was the exact same texture and placement of the floor, for no reason. It trys to be funny but just falls on it's face and you can't tell where you have to go. The only redeeming quality of this game is the soundtrack, which is phenominal.

And it wasn't bad at all. First of all I would like to talk about the sound since had my headphones and some sounds were a pain to my ears and had to mute it.\n\nI found the tutorial simple but explains the basics of the game, altough when I moved to the main world I lost the interest in the game. There are two quests to make. The one that teaches you how to build is simple and helpfull but the only thing you have to do is to put blocks and remove them. After a while trying to build something I found myself putting the blocks randomly just to finish the quest. After doing the final quest I tought I would get something but didn't get any item like I was expecting.\n\nAltough, to me, the main "problem" the other group of questions where they teach you how to kill. You only recive player's quests on lvl 3 so I have to kill the same monsters over and over and over again. The lag was a major problem, I died a lot because of it.\nAfter reaching lvl 3 I got teleported to a town to find a treasure and had no idea what it looked like. This was horrible. The game gave me a clue, teached me how to see my coordinates and made me looking for it. After a long search (without a mini map or somethig) I finally found it. After this one I had to do the same but I found the town much bigger and after searching and searching without a clue beside the coordinates (or at least I couldn't find it) I saw the same houses and gave up.\n\n\nI didn't find the game bad at all since I love 8-bit games and the TARDIs got my attention, altough I found the game repetitive and with some lack of challange. Maybe there is more stuff to do but after the "initial boom" of the game I lost the interest. I just don't recomend it since I got tired of it really fast but like I said, I liked the idea of the game and the graphics but in the end I just found a poorly executed game.","December 26, 2013","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Literately your only other resort is to hope and pray someone will give you a platinum item for being such a good friend or farming Mobs for a week straight, drink all the coffee in your house, sit up all day and all night so you won't be banned, and sell that 150K+ gold for idk 15+ platinum? (I don't envy the trade system nor do I want to see it) This game has the, let me rephrase that, THIS GAME 'HAD' THE POTENTIAL TO DO GOOD! This was made in 13 YEARS! I mean CMON, I don't even touch SPIKES, I DIE!, I can't scoot OVER FAR ENOUGH ONTO A BLOCK TO GET PAST THE SPIKES, THIS GAME IS A DEATHTRAP OF RAGE! Literately, I Don't even Rage at games, and this one throws me off my record for "Person that Rages the Least Award" I mean cmon bro, Step up your game, add more platinum to the money packages and lastly, put in more optimizations as well as, SELECTIVE QUESTING, I don't like being repettitively asked to do the same quest over and over when I CANT do it because there are SPIKES, LASERS, AND GAME REVIEWERS EVERYWHERE.

I'd build my own dungeon but I have to shell out far too much real money to get something even going. I recommend it simply because it is free to play and very interesting (it really is a fun idea) but be warned there are microtrasactions to get to the meat of the game and right now there is very little content to play around with.","December 17, 2013","true","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Its sometimes laggy, depending on where you live (only 2 servers in the USA). I have now played it for 30 minutes, and it got boring pretty quick. It has a nice and funny community, but you need to get in the game for a while to actually get into in to a town, get some friends to build things with and that kind of stuff. So, ill try again when its a little bit more "game-like" because, personally, I would not YET get this game out.","February 7, 2014","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
