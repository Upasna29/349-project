I think I'll start by telling about something that happened earlier today while I was playing a multiplayer match, an experience that quite well describes several of the qualities of this game. It was quite late into the game, about 30-40 min in and everyone had grown quite powerful. My Armored Command Unit, your most important unit that you use to build your whole army and whose death means you're out of the game in most cases, was under heavy attack from a swarm of Gunships and a Heavy Artillery Installation firing away from the other side of the map. I managed to bring my fighter planes in to take care of the enemy Gunships but the ACU was really low on health, another devastating artillery shell was incomming and if it hit I would be out of the game. The shell was going straight for it's target, I was going to lose. But I did not, straight above the ACU the shell hit an unfortunate fighter passing above and destroyed it. An artillery shell from the other side of the map hit a ridiculously small and fast moving fighter plane, I could hardly believe my eyes.\n\nThere is an unbelievable attention to detail in this game, every projectile is calculated individually which adds great tactical depth. Good micro and smart use of the lay of the land can have a significant effect on the outcome of a skirmish as shots might miss,  impact hills, rocks or units they where not intended for. This combined with the games truly epic scale brings one of the game's few minor drawbacks, seven years after release even the fastest computers have to slow down when literally thousands of futuristic aircraft clash.\n\nThe scale is another thing worth mentioning, the size of the maps range from quite small 5x5km maps to the enomous 81x81km battlefields that it take several minutes for even the fastest units to cross. So no matter if you want to wage war for hours against 7 opponents or if you're interested in intense StarCraft styled matches Forged Alliance will provide.\nThere is also a great variety of units, from small land scouts that take seconds to build to colossal experimental units that could take hours for a single engineer to construct but are able to singlehandly defeat huge armies. The balance between units is good, all four factions are viable and almost all units fill some role during some part of the game without any unit standing out as particularly overpowered which is quite impressive as there are hundreds of them.\n\nTo summarize, this game is a polished gem. The gameplay, both single- and multiplayer, is great, the design is amazing, the sands of time hardly seem to affect the game at all and the replay value is close to infinite. I'm a huge fan of real-time strategy games and I honestly believe that Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the apex of the genre.","December 3, 2013","true","551.3"," 504 of 517 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","504","517","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaidusrecon/recommended/9420/","zaidusrecon","ZaidusRecon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zaidusrecon/","131 products in account","YES  I  DO  RECOMMEND  THIS  GAME.\n\nOne of the most under-appreciated games of all time.\n\nMediocre campaign generally speaking, but containing the BEST real-time strategy gameplay... ever.\n\nWhen you have learned how to play it properly (50+ hours at least), you realise that this game does real-time strategy better than any other RTS in the world. An RTS should allow the player to use all the systems he has at his disposal, and use those systems -and his excellent knowledge and wisdom- to make TOOLS in which he uses to complete the objective. Let me explain.\n\nIn other RTS games, you get resources, you put those resources into aggressive units, and you attack the enemy.\n\nIn Supreme Commander, you have a basic start, and then the rest is completely up to you. There are many resources: Mass, Energy, Time, "Build Power", "Micro", but it is completely open so that you can choose exactly what to do with your resources, to execute some strange and excellent strategy that YOU created just now on the spot. You have so many units available to you to use in new ways. These units are not limited to merely 'aggression'. The magnificent unit diversity allows for all sorts of strategic applications. And not just units, but buildings too.\n\nYou could send an engineer out right into enemy territory, get it to build a Stealth Generator, construct a Tactical Missile battery, and snipe the enemy commander. This is a logical combination of only THREE units, and none of them the typical 'go and shoot stuff' aggressive units you find in other RTS games. You could teleport a Support Command Unit into the heart of the enemy turtle base and destroy the Strategic Missile Defense in his three seconds of life so that your nuclear missile can do its job. You could send a decoy squadron of Interceptors along one flank of the enemy's base so that your transport drop of an army can get past his horde of Air Superiority Fighters and do damage to the base. You could choose to put your resources into Mass Extractor upgrades and engineers, so that your engineers can focus their build power on speeding up the upgrades one by one, and so run away with exponential increase economy. Actually, that last one is done by all good players anyway. But you can do it as much as you like. There are endless combinations.\n\nThe situation is never 'I have x resources, I can put them into y firepower' it is 'I have x spare engineers - I can put some on reclaim and use those bonus resources from reclaim to go into ecenomic upgrades', and 'I have x spare resources that are being wasted sitting in my storage instead of being aggressive units that could get me more ground and Mass Extractors or shields that could give me better hold of what territory I have already claimed', etc.. Your Mass resources can take the form of strong and heavy turrets. Your Energy resources can take the form of air scouts.\n\nBut they do not have to stay in those forms. In SupCom you can reclaim those resources by dismantling structures and units through your build power. This unlocks massive intuition, adaptation, and freedom - aspects that encourage strategy. It feels right in an RTS that you can switch up your techniques so easily. You cannot go back to the cold dark RTS games where dumping resources into the wrong form dooms you.\n\nReclaim is certainly not the only thing in SupCom that makes it so outstanding. It gets everything right. It is the combination of unit variety, resource conversion, scale, and control that makes up so great strategic freedom. I cannot put into words how perfectly this game gets strategy. Everyone needs to enjoy the satisfaction of having such freedom of strategy.\n\nAdmittedly, it is quite a learning curve for the first few hours, and then you think you've got it, but then you find you got the basics, and you need to build complexity on those basics so you can unlock more learning curve. It's hard to do, but you can expect so much from such freedom. And if you can't grasp it, just play it simple: get the economy right, and turtle. Lots of players do this. They pick a map with one thin line or gap so that the two teams can hold the line or gap against the other team while everyone gets a superpowered economy and shoves firepower into the middle. Not much strategy, but enough to satisfy many.\n\nShort story is, grand scale of war, control of your forces, freedom of strategy...\n\nBEST RTS EVER. Get it. Or at least watch some casts by Gyle on YouTube. Be warned, many of them are epic, that means potentially hours long, and yes, skirmishes do last that long because this game is epic. And then get Forged Alliance Forever - the community lobby, which I could write another entire review for.\n\nEDIT(S): *Clears throat* I may have *cough* done a bit of a *cough* typo somewhere... Also, I may have been too harsh on the campaign previously.","October 8, 2014","true","32.9"," 272 of 278 people (98%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","98","272","278","11","0"

I'll go into why shortly.\n\nSupreme Commander: Forged Alliance is, by far, the best SupCom game around. In fact, it is one of the best, if not THE best stratergy game around. It has just about everything you can imagine it it, ranging from tiny robotic units the size of houses to huge megabots that'd dwarf entire cities.\n\nThe game is very different from other stratergy games, which for some can be it's downfall, whilst others just an incentive to play. It plays on a huge scale. Or on a small scale, varying from map to map. If you have a good processor (which I sadly do not), you can have massive battles consisting of thousands of units - and oh my, such battles are always glorious.\n\nMaps also vary in size, some being a few kilometers squared, whilst others are much, much bigger (forgive me, but I can't actually pull the max map size out of my brain at this moment for some reason).\n\nThe game has and supports naval, air and land warfare. It has and supports stealth based warfare as well as 'conventional' warfare, fought between huge armies. It has end-game weaponry that can be disabled via options or left enabled at will, such as nuclear weaponry, heavy artillery, certain experimentals such as experimental artillery - so you've got a turtle against you and that stuff is enabled? No problem! Turn them into the wastes of the Fallout series.\n\nI cannot stress how good this game is. It truely is a masterpiece, and though graphically dated, you really won't notice the graphics half the time because you won't exactly be zoomed in close, or the sheer amount of units moving around will distract you from the low resolution and lowish poly models.\n\nBut with the age of the game comes performance issues. You really need a good processor to handle this game with lots of players - 1v1 with 2000 units active at one time is generally not an issue (at least with people with processors like mine, and AMD FX 4100), but larger battles consisting of 2-6 players will result in slowdowns so the user with the weakest processor may catch up.\n\nOverall I recommend this game. I really, really recommend this game. If you like RTS games - get it.\n\n*NOTE*\n\nThis game is heavily multiplayer orientated. You can play via steam through skirmish modes and campain, but there are issues (or so I've been told) with multiplayer within the game after purchase. AFAIK you need to use applications like hamachi to play.\n\nSo most people will use FAF - Forged Alliance Forever. FAF is a lobby system that allows downloading of custom maps and a large selection of mods on the fly, without fafing with applications like hamachi which have potential security issues.\n\nThe game is awesome on multiplayer. There are many different ways to play this game - I myself and those I play with play this game at an extremely slow pace, with games ranging from thirty minutes to many hours in length. This is unusual, but fun and perfectly playable. You can literally play it how *you* want to play it, given that you play with others with the same view.\n\nOr you can go competitive - competitive games are fast, quick and require quick thinking. Or you can play something in between - whatever suits your needs or tastes.","May 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 144 of 148 people (97%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","97","144","148","8","3"

The game even today can be pure eyecandy.\n\nThe true joy though is in multiplayer, i will not go into further detail here...just buy it, its dirtcheap for what it offers, and try it out yourself. And oh, do not forget to install the community-driven multiplayer-lobby.

You look into the distance and see the largest mass of armored vehicles you've ever seen.  Mobile artillery blasts away at your fortifications as the once-distant column of tanks wheels about and comes to engage the new-found threat.  Turrets on the edge of the compound blast away at the enemy as shells rain down from a distance.

Massively underplayed and underrated, many RTS (Real Time Strategy) purists regard Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander Forged Alliance as the best RTS games ever. Instead of focusing on unit tactics and micro-managing (Games like Starcraft 2), it instead focuses on the decisions you make and how well you can create a base and army. Utilizing a phenomenal and balanced Tech system, experimental units can turn an exciting game into an epic game, with massive assualt bots crushing armies with ease and submersible aircraft carriers controlling the waters and skies. Forged Alliance is truly my favorite RTS of all time, because it feels like an actual RTS instead of an RTT (Real Time Tactics). I highly recommend to people who are looking for an RTS with a massive scale, or just any RTS lover.","August 28, 2014","true","190.7"," 72 of 75 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","72","75","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitorian/recommended/9420/","gitorian","Gitorian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gitorian/","107 products in account","This is a significant upgrade to the SupCom engine, making everything appear much more polished and smoother, especially with fog of war. Along with balance changes and new units, it's like a whole new game, rather than an expansion. My favorite part of this game is how it offers a mesmerising view of a futuristic battlefield. How it allows you to zoom up, watch individual parts of an unit move and fire true projectiles. That might not seem to be not that special, but the level of amusement I get when I see projectiles hit things they're not supposed to hit is goofy high. I can spend hours zoomed in just to watch the animations of units, even small things like energy storage growing taller as more energy is stored, and how engineers tilt their wheels to float on the water. I wish every game had strategic zoom like this game, with such polished visuals.\n\nThe user interface is still rather basic, but much improved over the original, giving you much more space to see the battlefield. It requires 3rd party add-ons (UI mods) to allow things such as keybind remapping, to display health bars all the time, managing templates easier, and upgrade helpers. I highly recommend at least getting GAZ_UI (I used version 6.1). I had to adjust my build order with the changes that took place, such as starting with a factory first. It wasn't until FA that I seriously started to look at deciphering all the + and - numbers on everything, and learning how to balance energy income with mass income, depending on what I wanted to build. A lot of reading tooltips, looking at unit stats in the unit database web page, and a bit of math helped me out, which is akin to doing spreadsheets.\n\nThis game seems to love Intel processors, or those with great "single-thread" performance. Playing on a laptop or AMD CPU will result in some slow-mo action before the end. Even if you have a good CPU, playing in a game with another with a slow CPU can make it agonizingly slow for you, especially if you're used to it being faster. The game doesn't run smoothly at full speed if there's someone else in your game with a poor or unreliable connection as well. I felt like I couldn't play big 8 player games with air battles and 1000 unit cap, until I got my PC upgraded (from AMD X3 720 to i2600k).\n\nThe gameplay itself is a handful. It's a challenge to multi-task. The objective is simple, to destroy the enemy commander, but achieving it is another story. You should manage to progress your economy, never settling with a certain amount as "enough", and considering how there's 3 tech levels of it and the hugeness of how maps are, you quickly find out how difficult it is to keep track of anything spread out. Staying compact will allow you to progress through tech at a manageable pace, but this is not an ideal way to achieve victory. Until you get used to things, to the point they become subconscious actions, your strategies will be extremely limited. I resorted to gambling with basic strategies, such as building up dozens of tanks, outnumbering the enemy, and using an upgraded commander to spearhead the assault, looking to surround the enemy commander. At first it was successful, but as maps get bigger and enemy teams get more members, this becomes less effective. Using a dozen tech 2 bombers or gunships to just simply fly in and bomb the enemy commander was a gamble that was easily countered by a shield and a few flak units. Once I got the hang of quickly upgrade my mass, I tried getting out an experimental as quickly as possible, but this strat could be beaten by a zerg rush. Sneaking a T3 commander with a transport as soon as possible was a huge gamble, but seemingly was the only strat that worked if I could land it where I wanted, without endless practice in other parts of the game.\n\nMultiplayer is still barely alive. I was able to register my product serial on Steam to play there, but a competing 3rd party lobby seems to be sucking players away with its advertising. If you choose to play multiplayer on that other lobby, "FAF", I hope you have thick skin and have great luck! I'd describe it as being an active volcano. Be extra cautious and watch out for eruptions. Go in with low expectations, else you may be disappointed, as their advertisements are clearly biased. They lose as many users as they get new ones, due to how toxic and unwelcoming they can be to some, especially those who go in expecting too much. Stick it out and endure the frustration and you'll be able to play one of the most noteworthy RTS games with some actual players.\n\nAfter playing this, I haven't found another RTS that has impressed me enough. SupCom2 was okay for a short while, fixing some issues I had with Forged Alliance, but was not close to being a FA killer, since it just didn't have the same scale and felt cheapened overall, such as with the cheesy sound effects (ex. commander explosion) and Aeon unit names that sounded cheap and unoriginal. I can't wait for a real update to SC:FA.","February 17, 2015","true","33.5"," 63 of 67 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","63","67","4","0"

Firstly, I will go over the base story, which is told during the opening cutscene. (You're totally free to skip the story part too, if you want to. Just scroll right down a bit, I will mark it off with a few ----)\n\nBasically, the Human race made a galactic empire through the use of teleportation (quantum gate) technology. A golden age was present, but predictably it came to an end.\n\nIt started with the unification of a Human brain with an AI, creating the "symbionts". With their superior ai-assisted intelligence, these symbionts were used all over the empire, though they were rather poorly treated. The symbionts' original creator, or father, (Dr. Gustaf Brackman) was just like the symbionts rather unsatisfied with this situation, and soon demands of independence were given out by the symbionts. The Earth empire responded with a "loyalty program" which pacified the symbionts who got it. Dr. Brackman fled from this and created "the Cybran nation" which had the goal to free their now enslaved brothers.\n\nA time after, Human colonists discovered an alien race - the Seraphim - on a remote world. The Seraphim had a religion called "The Way" which they were quick to introduce to the settlers. Still, Humanity's innant xenophobia led to attacks on, and subsequent destruction of, the aliens which had been found. But by then The Way had already gotten a foothold; the Aeon Illuminate formed from the Seraphim remnants and set their goal to spread their new religion to everyone else.\n\nWith both these threats now in existence, the Earth Empire soon fell into pieces, destroying the earlier order in the galaxy. The United Earth Federation, UEF, rose in its place; having a goal to re-unite the galaxy and restore order no matter the cost.\n\nThe infinite war raged for a thousand years; warfare technologies were developed to great power and for a long time it seemed like it would continue for infinity. Until the conflict reached its end.\n\nThe UEF fell into pieces, but by then their new "ultimate weapon" called "Black Sun" had already been more or less completed. At the conflict's final battle, Black Sun was fired, and to this day it is still unknown which faction pressed the button. Whichever faction fired it, it managed to do its job. With the UEF planning to use it similarily to the "Death Star" which most are probably aware of, the Cybran planning to use it for shutting down the gate network, and the Aeon's plan being to use it for spreading The Way to all Humans. Whichever one would be used, the conflict would've ended, with the firing faction victorious. Somewhere within the chaos, the Princess of the Aeon was lost - who knows if she survived.\n\nHowever, things did not go as planned. Black Sun was powerful enough to not only do the very thing it had just done, but as a side-effect the very fabric of reality was ripped apart. Through the inter-dimensional "ripple" in the universal fabric, the Seraphim came and invaded the Humans' universe. All three factions were pushed back, and nothing was made better by the fact that QAI, Dr. Brackman's personal AI assistant of his own creation, launched a series of crippling strikes against the Cybran forces, leaving them practically unable to fight. To make matters worse, most of the Aeon Illuminate sided with the alien invaders, leaving the UEF remnants, the poorly-armed cybrans and a few Aeon resistance fighters as the only defence against the invading forces; collectively naming themselves the "Coalition".\n\nThe defenders were pushed back; the Seraphim taking control of a lot of planets in a very short time. A while later, with a Seraphim attack on the Coalition command HQ, our game begins.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nOkay, with the background story told (unless you skipped that part, heh), the next part will be the gameplay itself.\n\nFirstly: It is highly recommended that you get the original Supreme Commander too, since despite the fact that this is an independent DLC to the base game, to my knowledge you will NOT be able to play the UEF, Cybran or Aeon in, say, multiplayer, unless you have the base game too.\n\nNow, as previously stated, this is an RTS. It is not, however, a game very similar to, say, Starcraft II. This is heavily based on macro-management, with micro-management being relatively rare. Indeed, this is a game of vast scale compared to many micro-management RTSs of today, seeing as your average army can range from a single unit to several hundreds, sometimes almost a thousand.\n\nIt is a very deep game, so if you're looking for something which you get good at in a matter of a few hours without much experience before in this type of game, go ahead and walk back out of this page. This game is deeper than its sucessor, Supreme Commander 2, so if you have played that and found it too complicated, this is not for you.\n\nSo, each game, you start with a single unit, the Armored Command Unit, or ACU. This unit can act not only as a powerful combat unit, but also as an Engineer capable of building additional structures. You would usually get a factory going, which you would in turn tell to build engineers, tier 1. Then you would be using those engineers to build a larger base, upgrade your factory to higher tiers (max at Tier 3, where only the "Experimental" technologies, which are immensely powerful but also immensely expensive, can be found.)\n\nThe goal of each match is, by default (though this can be changed in all but campaign), to destroy your Enemy's ACU whilst preventing your own from blowing up. To do this, the typical macro-RTS model is more or less followed, with you having to balance your economy, build a base and construct a powerful enough army of either Air, Ground, Naval or a combo to break through your enemy and win the game. The economy is rather hard to balance for the beginner, seeing as the typical "crash" often leaves you with too few resources for you to be able to re-stabilise your economy, slowing all you do to a crawl. Since buildings do not require a certain ammount of resources to start building, your economy can quickly become overloaded with the constant drainage caused by building too much at the same time.\n\nThe Economy is based around two vital resources, Energy and Mass. Each one has their own resource buildings, and some buildings require one to make the other. Energy is usually the resource which finds itself mostly being drained constantly, seeing as not only mass extractors but also shielding and pretty much all production, even some units' attacks, requiring it. Mass, on the other hand, is only required for construction and repairs, yet it is commonly the resource which runs out. Mass sites, the only places where mass extractors can be built, are often valuable targets, especially on smaller maps.\n\nIt is worth noting that different factions have different technologies and playstyles.\n\nNow, before I go too deep and create an essay, I believe I should round this off.\n\nBasically: A great macro-management RTS; its greatest flaw being a steep learning curve which can take a while to master. I recommend that new players play some of the original Supreme Commander's campaign, and also run a few rounds against the AI on said game. The base game's AI is extremely turtleable on Easy - makes a great "target practice" shooting dummy which won't horribly murder you when you make a small error.\n\nMy Rating:\n9.5 / 10","September 27, 2014","true","350.2"," 53 of 54 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","53","54","0","4"

I owned the game for nearly 3 months before actually playing playing it. (You know how it is.) Never heard of Supreme Commander or the series and passed it off as a generic knock off from Command and Conquer. WOW I WAS WRONG. SC and SC: FA are 2 of the most underrated RTS games I have ever had the privledge of playing. The progressive scaling of units and map size where hundreds of units engage in epic land, air, and sea warfare is something very few RTS games get right. NIce blend between theoretical technology and pre existing war machines with armaments that can be found in armed forces around the world.  But what impresses me the most is how smooth the games run, even when 2000 units are "in play." The interface is very polished and easy to navigate. Simply scorlling the mouse wheel immediately zooms into full view of the map where units are displayed by icons instead of smaller models, allowing for fluid macro play even when your 3 bases are scattered across the map. Has all the elements that one would want in an RTS which include but are not limited to:\n\n4 playable factions. All with their own unique flavor and yet are still balanced.\n4 Tier(s) of technology and units that are EPIC when engaged in combat.\nA challenging campaign with 8 missions that can last between 1 and 5 hours. (5 if you're like me and enjoy building more automated base defenses.\nIncredibly fluid gameplay that is challenging and rewarding.\nAnd finally it is quality mental exercise when you've got 10 macro'd unit groups and several dozen unit production buildings gaurding your commander against endless waves of enemy units that often have an unfair advantage.\n\nIf you're a true pc game elitist and you enjoy games of strategy that are aesethically pleasing then definitely grab SC and SC: FA next time you get a chance.\n\nPS - could care less about any grammar or spelling oversights. (Its a steam review that no one will read anyways.)\nPSS - Do not buy Supreme commander 2 unless you are a HUGE fan of the serious. Square Enix produced the 2nd installment and completely re modeled all of the units and maps and turned it into shallow, brightly colored, and insignificant shells of their former counter parts.","November 8, 2014","true","177.7"," 38 of 38 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","38","38","2","2"

Surprisingly for better or worse not what I expected this game to be. It appears to have far more appeal, its very simple to grasp and start playing and there is not as much in terms of tactics. Until you find the hold shift-click combo.\nOh boy.\nI can't think of any RTS that allows you to direct your troops in this much detail. Screw formations and all that I was expecting, you can lay out how the tanks will take over the bay, all while laying out how the airplanes will circle the enemy base, drop precise strikes and return, and have ships patrol the area. Some of my patrol routes, scouting and attack patterns got so complex and so beautiful to look at it's pure joy. Very useful, very intuitive, don't underestimate that tool!\n\nAlso, the map is awesome. Yeah for once an RTS got the map right, you zoom in and out of your view, and if you zoom out far enough, units and buildings become points, like on a map, and it all becomes a large, interactive, tactical playground. I can't stress how useful and pleasant this is and how seamlessly the normal view and the tactical view blend together.\n\nI see no reason why not to recommend this game, at the price it is very much worth it and it is accessible to newbies to the genre and long time RTS players alike.","June 7, 2014","true","40.1"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","48","54","0","0"

I've played Supcom/Forged alliance since 2008 off and on and spent most of my time on the 1v1 ladder. This review which reflect that time and SupCom's merits as a competitive RTS. I won't touch on campaign (Good but not great) nor the story (just there to get you to the next mission) in any great detail.\n\nSupreme Commander is a game whose origins can be drawn to Total Annihilation and it from the Command and Conquer school of thinking more than the Blizzard school. Units exist outside of the movement speed/attack rate/damage mold that has served those games so well over the years. Total Annihilation's contributions to the genre were twofold: Its scale both in map and unit sizes was unparalleled. Its units also existed in three dimensions. Aircraft didn't hover, rather they made bombing runs, or engaged in dogfights, or VtoL craft swayed back and forth as they unleashed their payload. Long range artillery countered any turtle tactics forcing them out of the comfort zone and the sound design supported the entire package. I dare say that none of those who fell in love to TA have forgotten the first time they heard a Big Bertha fire.\n\nSupreme Commander is the natural evolution of that game but in a bigger and more user friendly package. All of the aforementioned features still exist. Units have weight as they turn and massive units don't feel like smaller ones except they are scaled to be larger. If you have an experimental (a very expensive endgame unit) plan its trajectory carefully because you won't be turning on a dime to get it out of danger.\n\nThe in Forged Alliance is simple, unobtrusive, and effective. The hotkey system leaves a lot of be desired and is quite clumsy but there are mods to fix that into something more elegant if that is you inclination. Individual buildings can be upgraded as can your ACU, which acts as the King and Queen in chess melded into one units. Absurdly powerful but also the victory condition.\n\nPerhaps SupCom's greatest innovation is its strategic zoom. One can use to to go from looking at the rivets in a tank to a satellite image of the entire map in a flick of the mousewheel. It cannot be understated the effect this has on gameplay. You can see more, plan more, and execute more complex strategies because of this feature alone.\n\nOn release this game was far too demanding for most computers and limited its install base. Now I would say almost any decent machine can run in without much issue. It is worth noting that the initial multiplayer client, GPGnet, was discontinued several years ago. What remains are steam's matchmaking infrastructure, which is about as bare-bones as it gets, and the community built client Forged Alliance Forever ( which can be found here: http://www.faforever.com/ ). I strongly recommend FAF as it is still undergoing balance patches, the client is still be developed, and the greater portion of the game's user base resides there.\n\nThis was a long and rambling review that is mostly clouded by nostalgia and a love for what I believe is the most strategic RTS on the market.\n\nTLDR: Recommended","November 27, 2013","true","0.5"," 49 of 57 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","49","57","0","3"

Then there's also the option of building so many nuclear launch facilities that you can overwhelm your enemy's missile defense systems and drown them in nuclear fire (for reference, nukes in this game are just about the hardest to obtain in any game i've found, but they're also the most visually spectacular and you actually have cause to fear them)\n\nThere is a good variety of options for the skirmish mode, you can put yourself in a cagefight with a trio of AI opponents that cheat just for added difficulty, you can customise some major gamemode settings such as completely disallowing certain units or tech-levels, or you can increase the rate at which everyone gathers resources to speed the game up a bit.\n\nThe graphics are very nice, especially considering the number if units you will have running around the map at any given time. the textures don't look that great if you were to zoom all the way in, but if you do that you'll zoom out again to find that OH GOD THE CYBRAN HAD A BUNCH OF STEALTHED MONKEYLORDS OUTSIDE MY BASE AND THEY'RE TRAMPLING MY REACTORS!\n\nHowever, the place this game really outshines anything else i've played is its interface. you can customise so easily what the map shows you in terms of the range of your anti-air, anti ground, indirect fire, etc, your sonar, radar, omnisensor ranges... it offers you so much information but if you're finding it overwhelming you can just switch it all of with about two clicks.\nUnit control is so good in this game, in terms of automation. you can very reasonably set up a factory to produce infinite of a set of units, have air transports pick them up from your base, and airdrop into a different part of the map with no input from the player. this makes managing hundreds (or, with mods, thousands) of units so much eaiser, leaving you to direct your army, navy and airforce, and watch the explosions.","December 30, 2014","true","142.6"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","37","40","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ltkillpuppy/recommended/9420/","ltkillpuppy","LtKillPuppy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ltkillpuppy/","351 products in account","As far as I am concerned, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is the best RTS game, ever.  Originally Cavedog Entertainment created a game called Total Annihilation.  At the time it was considered the best RTS game, ever.  Chris Taylor later left Cavedog to form his own studio and worked on a spiritual successor to his best-selling TA game.\n\nIt's hard to describe to today's generation what SupCom was like when it first came out.  It was the first triple-A title that really utilized dual-core (and above) systems;  In an era where you had to force most games to run on a single CPU lest they crash, SupCom adored it, loved it, reveled in it.  It would drive the top-end system into the ground with its rich, lush graphics and absolutely enormous battles.\n\nIt's also the first game that I can recall which specifically had built-in support for multi-display.  One monitor could show you the ground fight, and on the second monitor you could either have a different camera view or a scaled-up map view.\n\nThere are too many things to list which were innovated in this game.  Here's a by-no-means exhaustive list:\n\n* First game to really show what multi-core computers could do with gigantic 1000+ unit battles.\n\n* First pure simulation grand scale RTS, with no RPG-like dice rolls.  If a mega-gun launches a projectile at you, you can dodge it if your unit is fast enough and you are good enough at microing.  Every missile and bullet is simulated when it leaves the barrel.  This made the game a micro-lover's dream.\n\n* First game to support multi-monitor, allowing you to configure each display as you want.\n\n* First use of a wide-scale camera.  You could zoom all the way out to 30k altitude and view the battle as a series of stategic icons, or zoom all the way in and watch each individual shell land on the enemy.\n\n* First use of "zoom at where I'm looking" smart camera.  Seriously, I wish more people would utilize this mechanic.  In most RTS games you had to keep your hands on the keyboard at all times despite the game being 90% mouse driven, just so you could move the camera around.  But in SupCom, they made it so when the camera zooms in, it focuses on the point where your cursor is situated.  This makes for an incredibly smooth playing experience, where you feel like you have total control over your view of the battle field.\n\n* First RTS where indirect fire is a critical aspect of gameplay.  Most units can actually launch projectiles or shells at least 10% further range or so outside of their radar detection range.  Other units which had wider radar detection ranges could be coupled with indirect-fire units to maximize your effectiveness.  Early scout units were always useful because of this.  SupCom was never a case of "build unit X until you win" sort of game, against competent players you had to have a mix.\n\n* Innovative resource system inherited from TA which leads to very intense economy management.  Instead of buying units for a fixed cost from a fixed pool of "money," you deal with resources in a producing/consumed sliding scale.  This meant that build order was the king, particularly at the beginning of the game, and you had to be careful with how you spent your resources.  Your factories would never refuse to build a unit if your resource production level was low;  They would just take more and more time.  Conversely, if you over-produced but didn't consume enough, you were likely wasting materials and giving an advantage of the enemy who might not be so frugal.  Because of this, each match is a constant tweaking of your economy.  You had both mass (used for building) and energy (used for powering things) to keep track of.\n\n* Wreckage.  Yeah, it's there just to look cool, but it also contains mass which can be reclaimed.  Build a mega-unit and send it to the enemy base and -- oh no, it dies!  Now, not only did you lose your chance, but you've just given the enemy a huge economy boost.  You really had to think about sending in the heavies, as it was possible to give aid to the enemy just by your failures alone.\n\n* Stealth mechanic which allowed you to coordinate sneak attacks and all kinds of fun assassin-style missions against the opponent.  One of the three factions is geared towards stealth play.  (Cybrans forever!)\n\n* AMAZING control over what your factories and units can do.  Want to have a master factory and 6 others which mirror what it does?  Doable!  Want to have a certain factory to exit a unit and then have it automatically patrol a particular route?  Doable!  Want to edit patrol paths once they are defined?  No problem!  Smart engineer units which automatically assist or reclaim wreckage?  Ayup!\n\n* Adjacency economy boosting system.  Factories placed near power sources get a reduction in their power consumption.  But they also get mass-cost reductions when placed near mass sources.  This meant you were always search for the most optimal building configuration to maximize your economy, usually altered by the terrain.\n\n* Upgradable commander unit.  SupCom had a single powerful hero unit which could be upgraded via research to give it extra abilities.  Most of these abilities were mutually exclusive, so you had to think about what approach you would take.\n\n* Pretty decent single-player campaign that's entertaining and fun to replay as different factions.  It's no Starcraft in that regard but I think it's held up fairly well.\n\n* (Sadly no longer applicable.)  Very active eSports community, with frequent and entertaining matches.  Game supports a built-in replay mechanism which allows you to watch matches with ease.\n\n* Tons of really awesome mods which expanded the life of the game, such as Sorian AI (which fixed the fairly braindead default AI) and Black Ops (adds a ton of new units).\n\n* SupCom:FA adds to the already excellent SupCom by introducing a new single player campaign, new experimental units, all new maps, and a new faction (which admittedly, was kinda broken and way overpowered until the bugs were patched out).\n\n\nSeriously, this game was amazing.

Large scale battles with thousands of units under the command of 2-8 players (12 on some custom made maps). Many maps ranging from 5 square kilometers, all the way up to 81 square kilometers - just shy of 50 square miles! - and yes, they really do feel that large.\n\nPros:\n\nThis game is tons of fun whether you're playing alone or with family and friends\nPlaying alone is great; playing with friends is pure awesomeness.\n\nVery high attention to even some of the smallest details.\nThere are tons of moving parts. If you go up close, you can see all the tank treads spinning, as well as multiple parts of legs making coreographed motions to create movement.\n\nIf a unit has more than one weapon, each weapon will by physically present on the unit, and each projectile will appear different.\n\nIf there is a unit that has a passive ability, for example shielding, or radar jamming, you will see that there is a physical part on the unit that creates this effect. What's better is that it will even resemble the actual building structures that use the same effects, to a certain degree.\n\nOne of my favorite examples of the above is the Cyrbran Tech 2 Tactical Missile Defense structure and the Cybran Tech 3 Siege Assault Bot. The T3 Bot has it's own personal Tactical Missile Defense system, and looking at the left shoulder will show a similar structure on it (in this case a shpere on a pillar). It even functions by shooting a small red laser at Tactical Missiles, returning them to sender!\n\nTruly massive scale battles.\nUp to 8 teams with up to 1,000 units/structures per team, or up to 8,000 in one game, all at the same time. This unit cap can be increased to 2,000 per team and 16,000 in one game with the Lobby Enhancement Mod. Further more, custom made maps can also increase the number of players to a maximum of 12, making the maximum unit/structure count go to a whopping 24,000!\n\n4 factions with similar yet unique units and buildings\nMany units, while similar to one another, can vary so wildyl in combat that they can serve completely different purposes.\n\nOne example is the UEF and Cybran battleships. The UEF  battleship's main armaments consist of 3 turrets with 3 cannons per turret. It fires all three cannons per turret at the same time, dealing massive damage. The Cybran battleship's main armaments consist of 2 turrets with 3 cannons per turret. However, it fires only one cannon per turret, resulting in much lower damage, in exchange for much higher rate of fire.\n\nStrong community and many mods\nThere is still quite a big following playing this game even today. You can find this community on the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) servers. If I'm not mistaken, downloading the Forged Alliance Forever app will also give you the Sourian AI mod as well as the Lobby Enhancement Mod. Personally, I wouldn't skip these two mods for this game, especially the AI mod if you like to play against computers.\n\nOne of my absolute favorite features of FAF is the ability to play the campaign in co-op mode with friends. There are pletny of games being played every day from many players with ranging skill levels. You'll find tournaments and just for fun games alike. You'll also find a nice hand full of custom made maps you can download directly from the Vault in the FAF app.\n\nCons:\n\nThe unit movement can get a little annoying at times\nSometimes they'll get stuck or confused trying to walk around one another, and it can be frustrating, though I find this generally not to be much of an issue.\n\nThe campaign is just okay.\nYou are never forced to try harder to win; you can simply just test yourself on how fast you can do it. You can simply take your time to build up your army before advancing to the next checkpoint.\n\nPlaying co-op completely changes the experience for me. I guess I just like playing with friends and family.\n\nThis game is highly CPU intensive.\nOlder and lower tier CPUs simply cannot handle this game on it's maximum scale. Towards the end of matches, and especially longer ones against the computers, you will notice massive slow down in game play. The Sourian AI mod, while also more fun due to being more of a challenge, alleiviates a lot of this issue when compared to standar AI that was programmed into the game. The standard computers tend to build tons, and tons of units and leave them at the base for long periods of time, resulting in less fun, and more CPU usage which results in slower gameplay.\n\nFor example, an older rig I used with an AMD FX-6300 played the game just fine with 7 standard AIs, up until the end of the game where it was practically grinding to a halt. It was unplayably slow; roughly 3-4 real time seconds per game second. Now I'm using an Intel i7 4790k with the 7 Sourian AIs and I can easily play games well past the 2 hour mark with 0 slow down, with some head room to spare.\n\nAll in all, this game is an absolute blast to play! One of my favorite games that I own.","December 20, 2015","true","360.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

A new campaign, new units and maps make this one fun RTS game. For those who have never played SC, it's basically a spiritual successor to Total Annihilation, an RTS where you can make large numbers of units to decimate enemy armies. But SC takes that further by adding larger maps and unit caps and experimental units (larger units that are more expensive, but can turn the tide of battle if used properly).

Is RTS Genius. Every RTS should be judged by this game. This is probably, In my opinion (And many others) The BEST RTS game ever made. I am not saying this lightly. Take word from a person who loves strategy and is a die hard fan for it. Where to start, Well I should go over the races first. This game takes a bit step upward from other RTS genres out there and includes, not 2, or 3, but 4 unique factions. You have the UEF, Aeon, Cybran, And My favorite. The Seraphim. Each race has a very unique backstory, and the lore is fantastic. But to simplify the factions for you. UEF are your standard Humans. Cybrans are  a cyborg like race. Aeons are an humaniod alien race. And the lizard-like Seraphims are trying to destroy all of them. But lore is not the only thing that it offers. A fantastic gameplay that makes you feel like a commander. You can zoom out to a satelite veiw, and see the whole battlefield, Which is usefull since the maps in this game, can range from 10km to 80km. So the maps are a site to see. Each race has their own set of unique units. Ranging from light assualt walkers, all the way up to a towering expiremental bomber, that drops mini-nukes. The unique aspect of this game that i find the most fun. Is that you are in an ACU. And you are in the battlefield. You can customize your ACU to fit your strategies, Ranging from Defense to offense. Your ACU is also equiped with a engineering suite, which allows you to build structures as well. I could go on about this game. But words alone cannot describe how awesome this game is. I STRONGLY recommend this game to all strategy lovers out there. This is worth every penny, but be sure to get the original supreme commander along with it, since you will not be able to play as UEF, Aeon, or Cybran in multiplayer. however you can in skirmish.","May 25, 2014","true","56.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The strategic depth and scale of the battles that take place are breath taking. Although GPG is dead, the FA saga lives on in FAF which is a community dedicated to FA.

Forged Alliance I never bothered with- but now that I've started it it seems to just add a new campaign and 20 or so units.\n\nPROS\n- An AI that actually (OMG) focuses on economies and defenses!\n- So many units, C&C can eat its hat(s)\n- Great modding community\n- Hours and hours of play vs Normal AI (C&C Hardcore is easier than them)- racked up about 9 hrs in one single game.\n- MASSIVE maps. Let's just say a massive artillery piece can't get half of one.\n- ACTIVE physics. Fire that nuke at the wrong time? Air force is gettin' halved, baby.\n- BIIGGGGGG economy requirements. You can't plop a Tiberium refinery and be done. You need to fight to secure Mass from enemies, and you need a ♥♥♥♥ ton of Energy.\n- AIs send lots of scouts at you, and engineers to remote locales to secure Mass- even sending bomber squadrons on sorties into your territory to take out a Mass collecter, then sending an engineer to rebuild it in their name\nCONS\n- AIs focus on air.. But that may have something to do with me building lots and lots of gunships.\n- AI defenses too good- you'll need several hundred units to break through\n- AIs build massive armies... and then don't do a damn thing with them\n- SO MUCH MASS REQUIREMENT. I have over 15 T3s, and it doesn't make enough to build troops and a single building at once.\n- Interface sucks compared to original SupCom.","March 6","true","11.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Supreme Commander is in one word: MASSIVE. You can set a cap of 8000 units on the battlefield, so if you have a 1v1, each player can have 4000 units. FOUR-F******-THOUSAND. At 8 players (teams don't have to be fair) each player has a thousand troops. I have seen people compare this game to Starcraft with 200 units at the max per player. Some people like the extreme tactics that game has, this game has them too, except on a bigger scale. Let me show you a quick comparison\n\nAirdrops:\nStarcaft: Drop 16 marines in 2 medivacs.\nSupreme Commader: Drop 20 units in 1 transport.\nArmies\nStarcraft: A marine/marauder deathball slaughtering zerglings or a zealot rush\nSupreme Commander: A 300 strong army supported by experimentals holds off the main force, as battleships and carriers support the army, then on the over side of the map 5 nuclear subs nuke the enemy base as an airdrop composed of 150 units flanks the main force. (And that is on a 1000 units per team)\nNukes: (I know that it's only a lesser part of Starcraft, but it is quite big in the end game of Supreme Commander)\nStarcraft: A Nuke won't destroy the main base building, it's mainly for clearing armies or finishing off bases\nSupreme Commander: When you usually send nukes, you send 5 or more. Depending on nuke defences the attack might fail but when it hits, it hits. A nuke will wipe a base.\nDefence\nStarcraft: SC is about the offensive and manuevering, you defend to hold the army off as a bigger force flanks.\nSupreme Commander: If you have ever played Halo Reach, on the desert mission where you need to destroy the AA towers, at the end there is a massive Spire. Imagine that but around the spire there is about 50 gatling guns and AA turrets. Also (most games don't have this) you CAN build WALLS. (I know it's amazing)\n\nWhile I personally like this feature of this game, some peope disagree. There are NO hard counters. (Well yes, the tech 2  UEF flak turret tank will easily  wipe out tech 2 planes and even take on tech 3 planes. And yes, the experimentals are basically hard counters for everything they can target, and the air vs air planes will SLAUGHTER EVERYONE WHO FLIES.) But mostly a tech 3 robot will not have an advantage over a tech 3 tank or vise verca.  And although all the factions look different and have different units, they are mostly the same. The main differences are: some factions unlock different units earlier. eg the Aeon unlock have a tech 1 attack boat. And the experimentals; each faction has 3 or 4 different experimental units.  The graphics are not Starcraft level, but they are still REALLY good.\n\nI would reccomend getting Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance and "Forged Alliance Forever".A free community hub for SC: Forged Alliance, it includes "The Vault" from where you can download custom maps and mods (All free). And it is only place for online play. The campaign is really solid and stands on its feet, but the main focus is on multiplayer.\n\nThere really is no game to compare this to. It is a RTS, it is not a 4X RTS. Yet it's more than a normal RTS. I would call it a quarter of its way to a 4X RTS. The game is really easy to get into, but it's a lot like Starcraft where you need to spend time playing it to get good. On a last note: you play other games to feel like you command an army or a small force. You play this game to feel like you command you command EVERYTHING. Much like the Emperor in 40K. Remember to get Forged Alliance Forever. Also don't get Supreme Commander 2, it sucks\n\nAlso UEF for the win.","August 17, 2014","true","72.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If its ground, navel or air. Thats your job to find out what each does. This is my top most FAVOURITE game!! I recommand this game 1000%!!\n\nLand:\nYou got you T1 units. Light tanks, light artillery, anti air and scout. Basic units with light armour light damge. Good units to harras someone with in the early game;)\nYou then have your T2 units. Meduim tanks/Walkers, missle launchers, shields and stealth troops. Great Units to over take a bunch of T1 and destroy base.\nYou got you T3 Units. Heavy tanks, mortor units and some ant air as well. Amzing troops for taking out just about anything. Even experimentals:0\nYou then got you experimentals. Got you Monkey Lord which is in the second picture, your Fat Boy which is also in the second picture in the back and much more ranging to air and artillery. Some dangerous and far range and some at close range. Dont want to get near these guy.\n\nAir:\nYou got your T1 units. Interceptors, bombers, light gunships, scouts and transports. Great units to take control of the sky, for the beggining of course.\nGot your T2 units. Gunships, fighter/bomber, suicides and transports. Great units to deny any ground attack coming your way.\nYou have your T3 units. Heavy gunships, Heavy bombers that are super deadly, and your fighter. Greaet troops to secure your air control and MURDER and enemy base.\nThen you got your Experimentals. Deadly from the sky but has weak armour. One run from the Serephim bomber and your a goner. Got your saucers and your heavy, HEAVY gunship.\n\nNavel:\nYou got your T1 Units. Frigates, Submarines, and anti air. Great units to take conrtol of the water and Tech up.\nYou got Your T2.

You got your 2 resources that are the most important thing in the game beside your commander. Let me repeat that, you got your 2 resources that are the most important thing in the game beside your commander!! You have your mass and energy. More you got, the faster you can build and tech up for better troops and structures. If you are low, might want to fix that because your enemy will take advantage of that.\n\nCommander:\nMost important thing in the game. Your commander(Which is you) dies, its game over.

Supreme commander focuses on ALL aspects of war; naval, air, land, radar, transports, defense turrets, resource production and managment, adaptation, vetranacity, nukes, nuke submarines (ftw), even shields and anti nukes not to mention the experimental units (extreme game changers). This game takes strategy to a whole new level with different factions and different units. The game itself wven gives you a menu to mod it, and the mods for this game are outstanding. But this is definatley a game for more experienced players, for those who are new or just getting into these games i would suggest supreme commander 2. the second game is...simpler...its known as a shadow of its former self but the gameplay is easier to understand and control but all the while ruining the game with the experimental factories.","May 21, 2014","true","401.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Now, i appreciate the work and effort people put into producing good games, and i understand the importance of screen resolution. The graphics in this game are not like, next gen or anything, but they are good. (taking into consideration that this game was made in 2008)\n\nSupreme Commander: Forged Alliance is a great RTS game that offers an experience like no other. The battles take place on a huge scale with maps ranging from 5km x 5km to 81km x 81km. The sheer size might sound pretty cool, but then you get into more small scale. Base building in this game mixes micro and multitasking with managing multiple bases at a time. Nearly everything in this game is upgradeable in some way, so you have to manage whats upgrading while managing unit production and income. You have to remember to upgrade your ACU so you get the benefits from it, all while remembering to build defenses and intel bases. Base building in this game is also really awe inspiring. Different buildings get buffs from other buildings, such as the energy generator, energy storage, and mass fabricator. These all affect each other in some beneficial way, stressing the need for a good base lay out heavily. The fact that nukes and artillery shells can hit a plane in flight also amazes me.\n\nThis game offers some really awesome experiences and has a real need for a good strategy. Base building gets more and more complex when you're trying to get the most efficient base, and upgrades add more depth and variety to the game. If you're looking for a good, fun, and over all enjoyable game, you're looking at it right now.","March 12","true","31.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This is one of my favorite games.  I am currently playing it on my third computer.  It is the spiritual successor of Total Annihilation and very well done.  Well worth the money as it will end up costing you mere pennies per hour.\n\nLike all RTS games you start with a few basic units, usually just your commander.  You then build factories, resource gathering, and military.  You then Explore, expand exploit and exterminate.  In supreme commander you have 4 tiers of units T1 to T3 and then experimental units, which are very expensive and take a long time to build, but are essentially game enders.  Each of the 4 races has its own unique units, strengths and weakenesses.  The experimentals also fill fairly specific roles, making enemy engineer capture a significant boost to your combat power.  It has been out long enough now that the units are all pretty well balanced.\n\nIf you are a fan of RTS games, I highly recommend this one.\n\n","May 27","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is something to say when someone asks you how good Forged Alliance is. The base multiplayer seems to no longer work properly, but coupled with the Forged Alliance Forever mod, you will find that there are still many people playing.  Thus  most of your time will probably be spent in the non Steam multiplayer.\n\nForged Alliance is   a lot "harder" than Supreme Commander 2, and it takes a lot more to learn how to play Forged Alliance well than it does in Supcom 2.  There is a much larger focus on upgrades and micromanagement in Forged Alliance than there is in Supreme Commander 2. This leads to there being much slower longer lasting games than in Supreme Commander 2, where games feel very speedy in comparison.\n\nOver all I would definitely reccomend Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance to the more hard core RTS fans, because it is a pretty good RTS. However its age shows in many places and it does require a third party lobby to get any real enjoyment out of your multiplayer experience.","July 15, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

There's so much content, way more strategies you can use because of this. More maps, buildings, units etc. make this game a must buy for any RTS fan.\n\nThe price might seem a bit much for something as old as this, but there's just so much stuff it's justified, but you could wait for a sale if you're not sure ;)","November 21, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Quite a name,innit? This is a large scale Real Time Strategy (RTS) game. How large scale? How does 81,000 by 81,000 meters grab you? 81 kilometers,in either direction from any given corner. THAT is how huge the maps can get. On a planetary surface. Yes,planetary. Supreme Commander,also known as SupCom,is science fiction. The unit cap can go right up to one thousand units per player,in an eight player game. The gameplay focuses on the bigger picture,rather than micromanaging a small group,and the economy is infinite,in a dain vs draw system. The final feather in the hat is that the game was made for modding. The game has an active modding community,so you can tweak the game to your heart's content when you get bored!\n\nThe game has it's flaws,as all games do. But,for me,they might as well not exist.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/secret4life/recommended/9420/","secret4life","The Secret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/secret4life/","558 products in account","Oh dang. In the list of my favorite strategy games this is second. This here is a game of epic proportions. 1000 unit cap? With buildings included, yes. Large maps? Largest one is 81x81km, so yes. Economy? In the form of mass and energy, yes.\n\nA little bit in detail. So, economy is truly fantastic. You build mass extractors on mass deposits and energy generators generally on land. Energy generators (obviously) produce energy. Mass extractors use energy and produce mass. Really basic, but, what makes this economy system great, is that you can use more energy and mass than what you produce. This will start draining your mass and energy storage. If your energy and mass storages go negative, all your building will happen a lot slower. You can build storages near extractors and generators. This will increase not only only storage space, but also production of said generator/extractor. You can also upgrade your mass extractors to get more mass production.\n\nIn the beginning of every game, you only start out with your ACU (Armored Command Unit). He can build only the basic base structures and defenses until upgraded. ACU can be upgraded all the way to build tech 3 and experimentals.\n\nThere are 4 techs. Tech 1-3 and experimental tech. You start out in tech one, and later upgrade your facilities to produce advanced engineers and advanced units. Then there are experimental units. These units need to be produced on the field like buildings (some experimentals are buildings). Experimentals are mostly HUGE units with loads of firepower. In example, Monkeylord. This spiderbot has AA missiles, torpedoes, personal cloaking and a huge laser put on it. This laser can sweep an entire army in one swoop. Each faction has their own experimentals.\n\nThere are 4 factions and they all play a little differend. While other is good in aerial combat, other will be more efficient in naval combat. All factions have their own units and experimentals.\n\nIf you're conserned about multiplayer and GP.Net (which was GPG official multiplayer client(?)) that was shutdown a while ago, there is an alternative. You can go to Forged Alliance Forever[www.faforever.com] and join their community. They have their own launcher and everything.\n\nSo, I do definately recommend this game to everyone interested in massive scale strategy games. If you're new to the series, don't pick up the Supreme Commander 2. While a good game on its own, it can't stand up to Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, or even to Supreme Commander. Well worth the price they are asking for it.","February 13, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is exactly that way. Although it doesn't have many pictures or even a video to introduce itself, it's a fantastic game that adds the extra nation of the Seraphim into the playable category. As one of it's popular tags suggests, this game is very underrated and is a suprisingly fun game. It ranges from the ground, to the sea, and to the air all the while containing massive mechanical deathbots capable of mass destruction and many a big boom. Forged Alliance also comes with a vast number of mods which can add a lot to the gameplay and are a great way to spice up the game a bit if your starting to get tired of it.

The game came from the creators frustration on modern RTS games and felt they were tactical and not stratigic. So they solved this by increasing the scale and having an incredible phyics engine that even calculates each shot so planes could get hit by artillary in theory. Another prodominate feature was having extrmely large "experemental" units and a flow econemy.Major issues were the extreme power needed and the fact that turtling was overpowerd.\n\nForged Allaince then came with wonderful fixes in the term of new units, and making turtling for the most part unviable. To this day if you play on large multiplayer maps, you can still have prossesing power issues despit the fact it came out almost 7 years ago.\n\nThen came the abortion that is Supreme Commander 2. It destroyed the tech trees and took away the flow econemy that made supreme commander unique. When it took away the flow econemy , experemental units had to become cheaper to be usuable and as a result arn't the entire army killers they were in all the prevous games. Combined with many other poor desitions have left many players dissapointed. Combined with very very poor multiplayer support most players flocked to Forged Allaince Forever which are servers and a lobby for Forged Allaince run by a community. They have made significant changes to SupCom2 but for all intents and purposes is a dead player base.\n\nThis game relies on you loving the massive scale of the war and for people who want stragegy games without the rock paper scisor style contering being the most important factor and rather have importance on flanks and cleaver drops while creating forward bases and intelegence. Forged Allaince Forever is still being updated to this day and has a still GROWING community. I highly recomend that anyone who buys this to get Forged Alliance Forever too(Its free).","June 27, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the list of my favorite strategy games this is second. This here is a game of epic proportions. 1000 unit cap? With buildings included, yes. Large maps? Largest one is 81x81km, so yes. Economy? In the form of mass and energy, yes.\n\nA little bit in detail. So, economy is truly fantastic. You build mass extractors on mass deposits and energy generators generally on land. Energy generators (obviously) produce energy. Mass extractors use energy and produce mass. Really basic, but, what makes this economy system great, is that you can use more energy and mass than what you produce. This will start draining your mass and energy storage. If your energy and mass storages go negative, all your building will happen a lot slower. You can build storages near extractors and generators. This will increase not only only storage space, but also production of said generator/extractor. You can also upgrade your mass extractors to get more mass production.\n\nIn the beginning of every game, you only start out with your ACU (Armored Command Unit). He can build only the basic base structures and defenses until upgraded. ACU can be upgraded all the way to build tech 3 and experimentals.\n\nThere are 4 techs. Tech 1-3 and experimental tech. You start out in tech one, and later upgrade your facilities to produce advanced engineers and advanced units. Then there are experimental units. These units need to be produced on the field like buildings (some experimentals are buildings). Experimentals are mostly HUGE units with loads of firepower. In example, Monkeylord. This spiderbot has AA missiles, torpedoes, personal cloaking and a huge laser put on it. This laser can sweep an entire army in one swoop. Each faction has their own experimentals.\n\nThere are 4 factions and they all play a little differend. While other is good in aerial combat, other will be more efficient in naval combat. All factions have their own units and experimentals.\n\nIf you're conserned about multiplayer and GP.Net (which was GPG official multiplayer client(?)) that was shutdown a while ago, there is an alternative. You can go to Forged Alliance Forever[www.faforever.com] and join their community. They have their own launcher and everything.\n\nSo, I do definately recommend this game to everyone interested in massive scale strategy games. If you're new to the series, don't pick up the Supreme Commander 2. While a good game on its own, it can't stand up to Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, or even to Supreme Commander. Well worth the price they are asking for it.","February 13, 2014","true","28.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A soul succesor to Total Annahilation fans should recongnize the single Commander unit that constructs and attacks.\n\nGraphics & Sound:\nThe game is great on the eyes although this game was released in 2007 the graphics have aged phenomenally. You will need a beefy rig to run it on the highest setting and even at the lowest settings it still looks great. There are some issues with the engineers (construction units) getting lost between buildings.\nThe game's sound is pretty good but not the greatest. Miniguns sound like sharp and crisp, artillery have an umph to them, and blasters have a laser feel to them. Some sound effects go on loop or are just lounder than other ones around it. One big gripe is that you will not know where something is being attacked when it is off screen you will only hear explosions and projectiles; no marker showing where. The music on the other hand is pretty good music. It amps up when your are battling or under attack and then goes peaceful when it is calm.\n\nGameplay:\nNow to the nitty gritty of the game, the gameplay. Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance is your typical RTS. The 4 factions (UEF, Cybran, Aeon, and the new Seraphim) feel uniquely different but still fall back on the basics of base building. You start with you commander known as an Armored Command Unit (ACU) that can create a base within minutes. There are to harvestable resources in the game, energy and mass. Energy is collected by building generators; while mass is only collected on limited mass points on the maps. Maps come in different sizes and climates. They range from 5km x 5km jungles to 81km x 81km tundras. The smallest maps are great for rush and harrassment tactics. On the flip side the larger maps are focused on artillery and other later game weapons. Speaking of weapons there are tons defense and offense tactics; from point defense to tactical missles to artillery and to the biggest and most expensive the Nuke. Each factions has 3 Tech levels that are upgraded through factories and your ACU. Each tech brings new units and new buildings that pack a bigger punch than the last. In addition to the 3 different tech levels each factions gain a hand full of experimental units that take a lot of resources to build but reck havoc on enemy units once they are completed.\n\nVerdict:\nAn amazing RTS that deserves more love than it has. I recommend picking it up with a couple of friends. There are endless possibilities that you can play each game and with actually people can be very challenging.\n\n8/10","May 19, 2013","true","65.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't get much more full scale than this. Each player commanding a thousand units is a common occurrence, as is an entire map scarred by artillery and nuclear bombs. Destructive environments, submersible tank-factories, beautiful graphics even for 6 years old, and a very solid if simple campaign make this game one of the best possible $15 buys in the RTS world at this time, please do yourself the favour of getting it.\n\n\n\nAnd now, Forged Alliance:\n\nForged Alliance truly expands the Supreme Commander experience if the word was ever properly defined. Bringing new units, maps, a fresh new campaign and that campaign centering around a completely new playable race, Forged Alliance is also one of the best possible buys of the genre, particularly the gold edition with both games, for a very reasonable $20.\n\nOh yea, and not only are there some awesome modders still very much active, but at the time of this review, the multiplayer servers are still on.

All that I would ask for is a little bit of handholding at the start of the mission to get you going. I'm going to reccomend this game to people who already know what they're doing with this series. If you don't, try it at your own risk.","October 26, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Other than that the game is great. Lately there's been alot of complaints that the launcher is crashing and the game stops working. It's true, and I know that because it happened to my friend. There is still no fix for it because the games old and they stopped patching bugs like that, it's still is a great game and I definately recommend it to all strategy lovers. For example each player can have up to one-thousand units on the map at the same time. Therefore reasulting in alot of lag unless you have a newer gaming computer. How the lag occurs is when there's eight people in a single match and everyone has nearly a thousand units. Overall I rate this game a 9/10 because of the launcher failure...THUMBS UP!!!","March 23, 2014","true","408.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tech levels where weaponry gets more powerful, and expensive.  Land, Air, and Naval units to attack your enemies from all sides.  Being able to que up units and have them set to go to points and attack, patrol, or be air-lifted to places on the map, this game simply does it all for an RTS.  Gorgeous graphics, awesome effects, and a great sound score round it out.  If you are a fan of the RTS genre, this is simply a MUST HAVE/PLAY!\n\nThe only flaw I can find with the game is that once you have four players with around ~750 units each, the game has to slow down to continue to keep things smooth.

It has tons of content, a good campaign and its easy to learn. There is one single design problem though that puts me off. There are ram limitations in the game engine which means that if you play with 4 ai bots or more your game will slow down to slow motion in late game. This happens because the engine cant use all the memory of your computer.\n\nThe game is still worth a shot though as it is a unique strategic experience that you wont find in mosto ther strategy games. I personally love it even though it has ram limitations. Good graphics, fantastic gameplay, good unit variation, every faction is different gameplay wise and the music is fine.

This game is ambitious, and sets out to accomplish alot. The only thing really holding this game back from greatness is the blandness in play style of the races. I will explain\n\nGraphically, this game is very appealing, because of its size, scope, and style. It feels like real war, visually, and the mapping possibilities are endless. The maps are a little nondescript sometimes, and the models aren't exactly high poly, but the trade off for size of the battlefield is well worth it.\n\nThe Orchestral themes are nice, but a little short. It feels like they have about 5 tracks of music for the whole game. The sound effects are just right, but nothing special\n\nGameplay is what really makes this game a winner. The size, scale, variety of tactics and unit types make this game amazing to play, you just have to experience it for yourself, it's awesome.However, barring aesthetic differences, the races play almost identically. I think more could have been done to make their play styles distinctive. That is really this games one failing. It is still very much worth an RTS fans money.\n\nUPDATE:\nThe forged alliance expansion adds a fourth faction: aliens. It's pretty much awesome.","December 31, 2013","true","13.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This adds another faction as well as tweaks in the gameplay and mechanics that allow for more play time and more interesting strategy styles. The game itself may seem standard for RTS games but that is more a strength than a weakness. Some more modern RTS games (talking to you Supreme Commander 2) can create a more simplified experience and cause the game to easily become stale and dull, whereas this game follows in line with classics like Age of Empires and even Command and Conquer with a larger unit management and a fun/ever changing atmosphere sure to entertain any RTS fans.\nIf your looking for online play, this game has lost a large fraction in its community in the years and it may prove difficult to find other players online. There is a community online called Supreme Commander Forged Alliance Forever where people looking to play online and continue the life blood of the game gather, so check them out for the best way to find other players online.\nAll in all, this game is fun and fresh for new-time players, and entertaining at least to veterans.

The game will give you the ability to ferry units, back and forth. You can set a rally point for your factories on the rally beacon, and have the transports continously transport reinforcements to the front, allowing you to re-allocate your attention to something else. Along with being able to have an efficient transportation system, and basically less of a headache to transport armies to the front.\n\nYou'll also will be enjoying the beautiful destruction the game will provide for you, the AI will pump out armies usually the same order, but will combine all three forces of air, land, and naval. This may result you in pulling your hair out and getting frustrated as your small patrols are no match for the endless swarms of the Hard AI. However, the AI is very easy to beat once getting  the hang of the game, and pumping out your own swarms, or building experimentals and tier 3 units to combat the AI's late game units. Which can easily change the tide of battle into your favor, and keep your interests on the map secured.\n\nIf you don't think land units are your most viable option at the moment, as you need them somewhere else but need to hold a position. Don't be afraid to send a few engineers to set up breastworks and turrets, along with artillery to back them up and your troops. Devastating fire power can also be not delivered via barrel, but through your air squadrons carrying nuclear ordnance to the enemy's main factories, or his commander himself.\n\nNonetheless, there is ALOT more the game has for you to utilize, and it will give you an enjoyable experience of the RTS genre, and again explosions.","December 16, 2014","true","74.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

SC added features that (at the time) no other RTS had, like the megamap. Now, if your game doesn't have a megamap, don't bother to come to school - the other kids will just laugh and push your face into the dirt. Looking at you, Ashes.\n\nShields are also a favorite of mine. In TA and other RTSes, when your defenses repel the infidels, they take damage that must be repaired. With shields, as long as the bubble stays up, the shield will regenerate over a relatively short period, and the defenses will keep on keepin' on. There are mods that add super bubbles (shields) that can stop practically anything, which leads to some "battle of Hoth" instances where ground forces must be sent in to take out the shield generator (if you sprint units inside the shield, they can attack things within) before the long-range bombardment destroys everything else.\n\nIt is super fun.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, though. The one overriding issue, apart from the developer being dead and no official multiplayer list servers, is performance. The game was developed in a time where dual-core PCs were a new thing, and was quite revolutionary in its multithreaded design. The simulation and the rendering pipeline are broken out to two threads, and this helps the game run fast on multicore systems.\n\nUnfortunately, the sim thread could really use being broken down into multiple threads itself. Mid to late game, even though the FPS will still be 100+, units will act slow. They move slow, react slow, missles and cannon shots will move slower. This is the sim thread being overwhelmed by the 2000+ units running about. Since the dev is gone, this will never be fixed, and that's a damn shame since the game is practically the perfect RTS otherwise.\n\nRegardless, buy this and enjoy! Actually runs really well on my I7-4770k throughout a match and is as much fun now as then!","January 7","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game is extremely large yet runs exceptionally fast and doesnt usually give anyone I know or me lag spikes really ever.  First off I think the fact that there are some 100-200 buildings in this game and about 100-125 units  and about 20-30 maps you never get bored. The game has this unexplainable aspect of true awesome about it. To tell the truth the story isnt very good or engaging and it get's boring after a short while but playing with others and solo without the story is really fun! The Gameplay is without a doubt the highlight of this game. If you are on the fence about this game dont be! Just get it you will NOT regret it like EVER!\n\nSo overall 11/10 for the game  and if that's not enough IGN rated it at 8.6 if you know IGN that is saying A LOT!","March 14, 2015","true","44.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was totally great (Still have the CD-ROM sitting around the house somewhere). FA was great as well, retaining the good old original three factions and incorporating a new one. Another great thing that Supreme Commander 1 and Forged Alliance does is immersive storytelling, great multiplayer as well as good graphics for a game that is almost nearing 4 or so years old.  the strategy is so much more macro intensive compared to other RTS games (like StarCraft for example). And the experimentals just make this game a whole lot more fun to play. Anyways, i think Gas Powered Games and THQ really made a masterpiece here!

In this game, you might send your troops in blind suicide mission to harass the enemy only to get some precious seconds to manage your economy/constructions.\n\nA good commander will have to:\n- Control key strategic points;\n- Pick the right types of constructs for the right type of the enemy's defenses/incoming attack waves;\n- Know when to strike & when to dig in and focus on technology;\n- Manage Land, Air, Naval (+submersible) units;\n- Utilise Intel (scout, radar, optical vision, radar stealth, even optical stealth);\n- Utilise strategic weapons such as artillery support for those turtle types.","October 12, 2013","true","14.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The first game was good, lacking in some areas (economy), but those issues were well adressed in this expansion. Sup Com 2 completely dumbed down EVERYTHING to do with economy, shifting the focus away from being a tactical smartass to being someone that wins by producing the most units in a given time. The campaign is very fun to play, especially co-op done through FAF, which is supported by Steam. All around great game for strategy enthusiasts, I highly recommend it.","January 2, 2014","true","76.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Forged Alliance is the best. There are SOME balance issues I guess but that can be debated.... like these super mega bad-♥♥♥ units called experimentals can just rip though a player's base more often then not. The balance is the massive cost of resources and length of time to produce one.\n\nBut there are a lot of units. ALl of which can be used in different tactical senarios. For instance, the lowest tired and weakest assult bots can be easily defeated but in a swarm of them air lifted down they can swarm-fire gound and air defenses if done right. Higher tierd units cost more and take longer to produce but 3 tech III bomber jets can do a great deal of crippeling damage if your tactics are sound... moreso then a swarm of gunships.\n\nThere is a degree of rock-paper-siscors to the RTS element but there are other factors as well. Tactics, player skill and even terrain play bigger roles then this group of units vs that group. You can zoom out to look at a 5km map and see all your units as small icons or zoom down to look at the legs of one of your smaller units. Tilt the camera around to actually SEE the terrain layout. Putting artillary units behind a small hill can protect them from tanks, for example... well, if the tanks don't flank the hill.\n\nThere's a campaign but its ot that good. Fights and maps are fun but playing solo against AI is more fun to me then solo campaign. I owned this for years before I activated it on my steam account I have maybe 300 hours in it? So this is my go-to game when I wanna create an army or robots to blow up other robots. And there's nukes too.\n\n4/5 ...there is a player run client called FAF, or Forged Alliance Forever, that people use to play matches. Some game mod mods are also there as well as a very realistic hand coded AI by fans called Sorian AI. The AI sent me an IM saying "I have a present for you..." once before it launched a nuke at me. I give FAF 5/5 but you need a beefy modern PC to handle it well.","July 4, 2014","true","75.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Best rts ever, i can't like any other rts because simply to put it, they are not as large scale. You can send an army to a enemy base or send over a colossus sized tank, spider, spinning saucer, and more to completly crush the enemy. every second is super important. When your commander sets down for example, and if you don't focus on building an army and sending it before you can be hit, your score on the top right of your screen will show you are lower than most others. The game is just. beautiful to put it. And there are 4 factions, the aeon, the uef, the cybran, and the seraphim. Each with a unique build design and a unique way to play. Cybran get a experimental spider named Monkeylord which deals 2k damage per second, and the average comm has 12k. The uef for example get a tank called a fatboy. Its a mobile base which has powerful main cannons, which deal 200 damage a shot. Weak anti air, 2 repair pads for air forces, and can build units. Please consider buying this game, check out forged alliance forever and on youtube check out gyle. The community is as activeas can be since this game origionally came out in 2007. There are also huge mods avalible to download from moddb and such to add even more, but be careful please. Every mod you activate in the lobby, builds up ram. The program can only hold 2 gigs and with certain programs can use about 2.3gigs of ram. (Large Adress Aware for me) but please keep this game going.","August 30, 2015","true","16.0"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","29","2","7","5","0"

Sea units are just like tanks and will try and shell things that are out of sight.\n\nThe commander and anyother building unit can build/capture at range however they like to drive right up to your blueprint or enemy structure before attempting to build or capture, sometimes circling the object until they have found a direction they prefer to face.  Build time is important and building quick is important so any seconds you can save is great but when your commander or engineers fuss about getting into position its very frustrating.\n\nSuper units are a great thing to build the hardship of your labours, of getting a good economy going to support building such a massive thing, the satisfaction of being able to survive this long to have built such a device and of corse the joy when it is finally complete and the sense of power that runs through you sends a chill up your spine....... but its short lived.  Super units are just as dumb as everything else in your arsenal if not worse i built a monkey lord from the cybran team and sent him off on his merry down the map just as the enemy team (aion) sent up their sacred assualt bot, now the monkey lord has a sweeping red laser which has a greater range than the laser on the assault bot so i though yeeeessss this should not be a problem and promptly told him to attack their assault bot only for him to walk straight by the bot whilst targeting tech 1 tanks of his own choosing stop when he had walked past it out of range of his laser and turn to try and correct this, obviously this was to late cause as soon as he got in range the assault bot had hit him with his laser during the pass and exploded as he stopped then the assault bot promptly cleaned up my base.\n\nObviosly this game has been out a while so this review comes late but its just a warning to any people looking at getting this for the first time be prepared to be frustrated beyond belief at controlling one of the dumbest AI's ever in a strategy game, i cant be bothered to even try and defend this.","April 10, 2015","false","81.4"," 22 of 95 people (23%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","23","22","95","5","8"

I went through dozens of potential fixes and eventually had to literally re-code one of the game files in order to get the thing to work. I probably wouldn't let that tint my overall review of the game if I found it more interesting. This game is like the blunt hammer approach to RTS games where you just hurl units at your opponent until they die and that's pretty much all there is to it. There's no research tree or diplomacy or any of that, it feels like the mechanics are straight out of an RTS game from a decade ago, which I guess a lot of people probably like, but I don't find particularly interesting. I've played a few games with friends and they last about an hour and feel extremely unsatifying. Granted, I was always at the lowest end of the totem pole in terms of score and whatnot, but just nothing really felt engaging about this game. There's not a lot of information given about each of the untis and such and some of the descriptions are vague and unhelpful. The resource section of the game feels like it has potential, but is mostly just an annoyance. There's only two resources in the game and it acts like it is a finely tuned machine where you have to be precise about energy consumption and mass use, but it doesn't give an easy way to monitor these things and keep the balance you need, so more often times than not, my time was spent in the high negatives or high positives and just guessing what units I could build or upgrade without tanking my economy. I will probably play some more with friends, but overall I see zero reason to play this game instead of Age of Empires II, a game where everything is laid out for you and gives you an easy way to manage and monitor your resources and units. As a general rule, I grade all RTS games in comparison to AoE2 and if the game can't beat out a game THAT old, I'm not really interested.","September 21, 2015","false","7.1"," 6 of 64 people (9%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","9","6","64","3","6"

For example C&C, Red Alert, Starcarft, Age of Empires, Dark Colony - games with very strong atmosphere for me. You are very close to ground. You can see trees, ground, hear birds etc. You found smth new on every map. You need to be atentive to buildings, landscape etc, you need explore. Losing 1 unit can be important. Rules of game can change seriously\n\nIn SupCom you usually work on very high level. Units like an icon. It's cool several games, but I don't have emotionaly wish or dream to play SupCom.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1234fgh/recommended/9420/","1234fgh","Kriegmasta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1234fgh/","18 products in account","Way back when, I chose the dawn of war games over SupCom. Those DoW games got me into the corresponding tabletop hobby, and I couldnt be happier with the people I've met and all the friends I've made from just buying one little game.\n\nA couple days ago, I spotted this on steam and decided to give it a try, see what I would have gotten had I chose this game instead.\n\nBefore I go on, let me explain that I have always loved RTS games. DoW, AoE, Stronghold, C&C, etc. So when I saw this game and the massively positive reviews for it, I bought it straight away! It looked awesome, whole armies crushing your enemies underfoot, whats not to like?\n\nThe game worked for me,   only one crash while I was in the tutorial. So no problem there.\n\nThe problem was, well, the mechanics. I am used to a minimap, when I play againest my competitive friends, the minimap is needed for survival. The tutorial pointed out pretty quick that my screen IS my minimap. Great.\n\nNot only did I keep forgetting about it, its also extremely awkward to use. I kept playing without using it, making it seem to me that I was alone, when in fact there was a huge battle going on around me, and I couldnt see it.\n\nSecondly, there is a STEEP learning curve. The Controls take way too long to learn and master. I consider myself atleast competent when it comes to RTS's, I can normally figure out the controls in a game or two.\n\nWith this game? Well, you may notice that I only have TWO hours played on it, and also that I've returned it.\n\nWell, thats because these games take HOURS to play. You can't bang out one game in a hour. Heck no. You have to be willing to SIT THERE and WAIT. Wait for your eco to boost up, wait for your buildings to build, wait for your units to be created.\n\nEach unit has around a 7-10 second timer. Even the weak units. Yes it has a HUGE pop cap of up to 1000, which is awesome. But for one thing.\n\nI can't get any resources. The game wont give you ANYTHING starting out, and resources come in at a TRICKLE. For my first skirmish game after the tutorial, I tried setting it on huge resources or whatever, and it does not have any. You are stuck with the regular resources, which let me tell you, are gone faster then ice placed in the middle of the sahara desert.\n\n\nI had to use CHEATS. CHEATS. To explore the mechanics of the game more fully.\n\nI am not one of those people who can sit down for 4-5 hours on ONE game.  This game is for you if you like slow paced afternoon-length games. If you cant invest the time and effort it takes to play this game, dont buy it.\n\n\nI spent two hours with this game. Only played ONE game. And I couldnt even finish it because it got boring using the cheats since it took to long trying to play the game with normal resources and setup.\n\n\nPoor economy, poor unit build time, confusing map interface,  extremely long length game battles without the resources to easily get said long games off the ground effectively, this is a MASSIVE dissapointment to me.\n\n\nBuy if your a HARDCORE RTS player who can spend hours in ONE GAME.\n\nIf you like RTS' but dont want to invest hours in a single match, or are new to the genre on a whole, or just a casual gamer, SKIP.\n\n\nWhen I think of the people who might like this game, I think of a old man in his mid 70s.  It requires ALOT of patience. Kudos to anyone who can sit through it, I sure as h*ll cant.\n\n\nIts like you build a beautiful mansion, but then don't install plumbing or power, and only use one room out of the whole mansion.\n\n\nDissapointed, gave it a chance, glad I chose DoW. Skip if you like anything thats not snail-paced.","June 11, 2015","false","2.0"," 9 of 89 people (10%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","10","9","89","5","28"

They range from 80km by 80km to 5km by 5km. Unit limits are adjustible but can go up to 1000 without mods\n\nCombat types\nForms of direct combat range from space with satelites (but only ground fire with them), land combat, naval combat (including subermrines) and air combat. commanders are also capable of teleporting to destinations.\n\nMods etc\nThe game comes with some mods built in that you can turn on or off as you please. On top of this there is a strong modding community which has made many types of mods and mappacks for the game\n\nServers\nThe game has three online platforms to play on GPG been the original (they have run out of money and no longer exist) steam has a platform to play off and hosts the game as it was meant to be, FAF also are a player supported platform that is the largest in use with players across world using it (it is not all originall).\n\nOverall\nA very fun game with a strong player community (enough so that they have set up a player supported platform through donations to play on).\nA good story if you play and an amazing story if you read it","December 31, 2012","true","692.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mechanics are impeccable, gameplay is tight, and the single-player doesn't disappoint too much. The concept of focused engineering and streaming economies is very cool, and I put many, many hours into this game.\n\nBe warned that there is a learning curve if you have played other RTS games before, but the tutorial section does a good job of explaining the basics. The single-player campaign is a very good way to learn the basics, as the deck isn't really stacked that badly against the users. That said, you can amp up the challenge in Skirmish matches by picking AI templates that can cheat (which is also an amazing feature)\n\nIt being 2014, the graphics now look a little dated (especially textures) but it still remains one of the best-looking RTS games of its time, and still manages to look pretty good. The user interface manages to be very comprehensive out of the box, but can be made more minimal if needed. The UI also presents more features (visibility, command, etc) than I have seen in other RTS franchises. I am seriously never going back to Starcraft!\n\nThe downside to all these features is the complexity (and the learning curve mentioned above) but those are all quite easily manageable. There is a very helpful WIki for those looking to really plan out their games. I'll finish by saying that if you like traditional RTS games, you'll be in for an awakening!","December 19, 2014","true","132.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of the typical "build resource building near resource and wait for units to bring in resources" it's more like "build resource building (mass extracter on mass areas and energy generators anywhere) and get instant satisfation".\n\nAlso how it manages resources... You can build things when you have no resources in storage... It'll just be A LOT slower... :)\n\nYou can also put more engineers to what ever you're building to help speed up the process... Wish all RTS games would do this... :P\n\nThis game has spoiled me as well... Instead of relying on the mini map for aerial view, just scroll all the way out... Love that... I think it's super intuitive...\n\nOh! And you can dodge missiles!!! :P\n\nOne thing I didn't like is the ai is so-so. Some ai are really easy to beat, others are impossible (so far... I have room for improvement... :P), and still others are hard at first but then you destroy enough units and it's like they quit! Super annoying(mind you, this is without a mod)...\n\nWould I recomend this game? Heck yeah!!!!

Afterwards however, you will find that the game is immersive and allows for multiple playing styles. You can defeat your enemies with a variety of weapons and each nation varies enough for you to pick a favorite. Battles are amazing. Downsides: Steep learning curve, often takes about 10 minutes to get your economy in motion, multiplayer usually has around one battle going on at a time.\n9.5/10 Was on sale for $1 but now its not so your call.","December 21, 2014","true","35.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead of the typical "build resource building near resource and wait for units to bring in resources" it's more like "build resource building (mass extracter on mass areas and energy generators anywhere) and get instant satisfation".\n\nAlso how it manages resources... You can build things when you have no resources in storage... It'll just be A LOT slower... :)\n\nYou can also put more engineers to what ever you're building to help speed up the process... Wish all RTS games would do this... :P\n\nThis game has spoiled me as well... Instead of relying on the mini map for aerial view, just scroll all the way out... Love that... I think it's super intuitive...\n\nOh! And you can dodge missiles!!! :P\n\nOne thing I didn't like is the ai is so-so. Some ai are really easy to beat, others are impossible (so far... I have room for improvement... :P), and still others are hard at first but then you destroy enough units and it's like they quit! Super annoying(mind you, this is without a mod)...\n\nWould I recomend this game? Heck yeah!!!!

The mechanics are impeccable, gameplay is tight, and the single-player doesn't disappoint too much. The concept of focused engineering and streaming economies is very cool, and I put many, many hours into this game.\n\nBe warned that there is a learning curve if you have played other RTS games before, but the tutorial section does a good job of explaining the basics. The single-player campaign is a very good way to learn the basics, as the deck isn't really stacked that badly against the users. That said, you can amp up the challenge in Skirmish matches by picking AI templates that can cheat (which is also an amazing feature)\n\nIt being 2014, the graphics now look a little dated (especially textures) but it still remains one of the best-looking RTS games of its time, and still manages to look pretty good. The user interface manages to be very comprehensive out of the box, but can be made more minimal if needed. The UI also presents more features (visibility, command, etc) than I have seen in other RTS franchises. I am seriously never going back to Starcraft!\n\nThe downside to all these features is the complexity (and the learning curve mentioned above) but those are all quite easily manageable. There is a very helpful WIki for those looking to really plan out their games.

Heck, this game has more explosions than a Michael Bay film. The four, when I say four I really mean 3+1, tech levels in this game need to be brought out at pinpoint moments in the game, if not, you'll just lose since your enemy has more T1 Light Assault Bots than you even though you have five T2 tanks. The best part about this is that everything has been moved to the community since GPG basically died off after SupCom 2. Forged Alliance Forever is the greatest community driven project I have ever seen in my entire life. Mods after mods after mods and a matchmaking system that ACTUALLY WORKS.\nSummary of Forged Alliance Forever: Tired of playing ranked matches and losing every single time? Find a lobby with a huge load of mods (or create your own) and fight people in massive wars with stupid, stupid amounts of resources. Tired of THAT? Play the original Forged Alliance Campaign with the same mods! Heck, Forged Alliance Forever even includes the original SupCom campaign (You have to own SupCom 1 first obviously) but with the same improvements, unit additions, improvements and mods that are run and can be run on Forged Alliance forever.\n\nFinal Verdict: This has been my most favourite Real-Time-Strategy in the world. Not even Planetary Annihilation can compare to this. Not enough depth I feel. Thus, this game gets a full 10/10 from me. Seriously, if you haven't bought this and downloaded FAF yet, DO IT NOW OR I WILL HATE YOU.\nJk, I don't even know you.

I advise getting supreme commander 1 & 2 if you wanna understand the story a bit better but it is no biggie. the skirmish is spectacular, and if you want to know how to startup like the average player i recommend versing an easy bot and building your way up from there because supreme commander 2 is very differant. also the skirmish maps like the (64x64) in most cases slow up your gameplay. but setons clutch i recommend playing whatsoever can be challenging when versing a rush or adaptive bot (especially if an alx rush bot). so i guess i will give it a 8/10!","August 3, 2014","true","462.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention massive robots 10 times the size of trees killing eachoher. But also the complicated economy where if you dont balence it early on will lead to your death at a later stage of the game. Last but not least the multiplayer! Amazing, it can either be really fast paced or as slow as you like, with up to 8 people to play with at one given time It's makes for really fun matches!

Well I agree but there are a couple of things that still make the original TA a better game. For starters SupCom takes a LONG time to get a base up and running at maximum efficiency with multiple factories churning out tanks and bots, and the problem is that the AI immediately begins attacking you fom the start so unless you repel the first rush properly and you are able to repel each subsequent attack on your position, because by the time you have dealt with the first the second is often already on the way, then you are screwed.\n\nThe maps are much larger which makes for more epic combat and I must say this is a good thing. You can play with more than 4 players on one map as opposed to TA and that is also good. There are three tech levels instead of two and the ability to customize your commander unit which is also pretty cool but beware that upgrading takes much MUCH more ressources, easily exponential amounts which means if your ressources infrastructures are not ready your facotories will simply stop producing. This is what I had the most trouble with in this game whereas in TA I always got the upper hand on the ressource situation I have a very difficult time maintaining my production in this game because of how expensive good units are. Producing masses of tech one level units is simplky not worht it because a tech two unit can easily outmatch upwards of a dozen tech one units and so on for a tech three unit.\n\nFurthermore on the ressource issue, the AI methodically targets your ressource infrastucture before even targetting defensive turrets at times which simply adds to the trouble of collecting enough ressources to maintain production. This is not a complaint in itself just somkething that adds to my troubles with the game.\n\nAll in all this game is very good though if you liked TA just don't expect it to be a revamped reworked version of the 1997 classic because this game has a flavour all of its own. Epic battles await and Nukes are awesome in this game.\n\ncheers","September 1, 2014","true","45.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We were big fans of the game when it first came out, but there's no doubt it was one of the most complex, time-consuming RTSes in quite a while, and had an unapologetically steep learning curve. Many lamented that the three factions in the original, the Cybran, Aeon, and UEF, looked and behaved too similarly. And on the surface they do resemble each other, but after hours of playtime, you learn to appreciate the differences and understand how to capitalize and manipulate them to your advantage.\n\nGPG seems to have two main goals with the standalone Forged Alliance expansion: faster action and more diversity. Diversity is inserted primarily with the addition of a fourth faction, the more visually distinct Seraphim. Though they, like the other three, possess similar lower tier units, higher tiers possess more individuality, particularly those of the experimental variety. Accessing these differences between factions, meaning teching up to tier three (T3), requires a different kind of resource production strategy since GPG moved mass fabricators from tier one (T1) to tier two (T2). You have to be much more aware of your extractors this time around, making sure to expand your base of operations across the map until you can start churning out T3 fabricators and power plants, since extractors seem to play a much more vital role in maintaining reasonable resource rates in the early game.","March 30, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you never played Total Annihilation, but you love RTS's, you have to get this game. I loved the C&C games, but SC:FA is much more intense, challenging and...well... EPIC!\n\nThings I love about SC:FA:\n- Big stompy robots with giant beam lasers that cut through hundreds of units...what's not to love?\n- Fantastic resource management system (same as TA pretty much). Much better than the C&C based resource system IMO as it's much harder to starve your opponent of resources, and you can't just wait for your opponent to run out of "money".\n- Fantastic map interaction. I know that sounds lame, but it's so well designed - you can zoom right out to see the entire map and zoom in elsewhere, removing the need for endless scrolling - it's simple yet works amazingly well, especially on massive maps.\n- Build templates: Always build power plants next to buildings for adjaceny bonus? In SC:FA you can save this layout so that in another game, you don't have to manually select each building to build. Just select the template, place it down and your unit(s) will build the buildings saved in the template.\n- Ferry system for unit transports: This is sooooo good - rather than manually load units onto a transport, tell the transport to drop them off, then tell it to return to based, rinse repeat, you can mark a ferry "point" and click all the units you want transported onto that ferry point. Then select your transports and they will take them to where you marked without any more interaction. You can also set them to assist factories for a similar effect. It's a small detail, but so well executed and really takes out the annoying micro management of such tasks.\n- Millions of units - you can set the unit cap to 1000's of units making for epically huge battles. Build land, sea and air units, and there's a good variety of units to choose from.\n- Wreckages - you can always see where there's been a fight, as wreckages litter the landscape. However, you can reclaim these with a builder unit to increase your stock of mass.\n- Skirmish options - there are loads of options to chose from in skirmish games, if you don't want nukes, you can switch them off for example.\n- Order queing - rather than wait until a unit has finished it's job, you can que up the order of things you want it to do (again, same as TA).\n\nWhat I don't like so much:\n- Battles tend to be won by the better units, rather than the better strategy. One tech 3 robot could take out several tech one tanks.\n- AI can be a bit dumb in skirmishes. Tends to do some odd things such as build hundreds of unit transports for no reason, or tonnes of ships and tanks and have them sit in their base. or more annoyingly, send their commander in to your well defended base on a suicide run.\n- Can be tricky to pick up. Took me ages to work out why I was losing to a normal AI. Turns out I have to reclaim all the trees around my base to aid my resource collection (unlike TA where trees only adds energy, and very little at that).\n\nDefinately recommended for all RTS fans.","July 31, 2014","true","90.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Despite its age it still looks modern with high graphics settings and the addition of a 4th race to the game expands the gameplay possibility compared to the original. However the best thing about this game is the loyal community that continue support of the game with new updates and balance changes through the Forged Alliance Forever (FAF) Lobby after support for the game ceased. FAF provides the essential multiplayer this game absolutly thrives on, the game is still very competitive through the multiplayer and therefore I can also recommend Forged Alliance to seasoned veterans of the RTS genre. The game has quite a steep learning curve though and the fact that there can be 1000s of units on the battlefield means that the game can be laggy unless you have a good computer. Despite this, I think it is a brilliant title that is definitly worth your time if you have any interest whatsoever in the genre, especially as this part of the genre has very little competition.","August 1, 2014","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I advise getting supreme commander 1 & 2 if you wanna understand the story a bit better but it is no biggie. the skirmish is spectacular, and if you want to know how to startup like the average player i recommend versing an easy bot and building your way up from there because supreme commander 2 is very differant. also the skirmish maps like the (64x64) in most cases slow up your gameplay. but setons clutch i recommend playing whatsoever can be challenging when versing a rush or adaptive bot (especially if an alx rush bot). so i guess i will give it a 8/10!","August 3, 2014","true","462.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its like everytime a game playing developer on the pay role said 'I dont like the way other RTS' do this couldn't we just....' they listened and did it. The way the display moves from close in full detail to zoomed out icons on map and every thing in between with the mouse wheel is great. The way point system is great (throw in how it handles air transports and its mind blowing).\n\nThe combination of massive complex global tactics and close in exploding goodness is hard to beat.\n\nI haven't touched the story mod yet, I havn't had to. The shear amount of variety present (yet some how well balanced) between the 4 factions and the challanges available via the different non cheating AI have kept me well entertained.\n\nIs there a modern RTS out there as good as this game? honestly I don't know but if there is my computer wouldn't run it.\n\nIs there another game as good as this you can get at this price? no way,\n\nIf you like RTS games you should get this.\n\nIf its in a sale you should have this now already.","July 29, 2014","true","56.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For starters, th campaign might be good. I can't tell, because the objectives of the very first level go as follows: blow some stuff up. blow some more stuff up before it blows other stuff up. singlehandedly murder the Megazord (most powerful unit i've seen ever) after barely resisting a large air attack on your primary base. Also, the game can get really slow. But the modding community is active, the AI is funny without breaking too horribly, and everything just sort of works. Overall good game, but expect to deal with the AI messing up like when they parked their tank column outside my wall, or when they kept sending troop transports even though I could see them perfectly.","August 18, 2014","true","35.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it has an active multiplayer scene anno 2014, many performance improvements and an AI that won't trip over itself trying to get out the door. So if you want to actually play, it is definitely the better choice.\n\nMany of the new units, while interesting, don't really fit into the balance of the game. And are often simply bigger and better versions of previous units, entirely invalidating the old ones. While faction diversity is improved, the new faction is more of an amalgamation of all the best stuff from the other three, and can be considered to be over powered.\n\nUnit speeds in general have been increased, reducing the effective scale of the game. And things are more expensive overall, requiring you to focus more on one thing at a time than building out. The starting resources have been increased massively, reducing your choices in the early game to one structure.\n\nThe nuclear missiles have been made worthless by breaking the ability to assist their construction, something you'd expect out of every other unit in the game.\nThe GUI is said to be improved, but has made many functions of the old one harder to use, or simply omitted them.\n\nNone of these things make it a bad game, just not quite as good. The many bugfixes and the fact that people still play it outweigh those things by far.","March 4, 2014","true","168.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is based of course on the amazing in its own rights "Supreme Commander" (and that in turn on the even older classic gem labeled "Total Annihilation"), but expands it with a whole new race, new units and game fixes that balance many of its predecessor's features. Not only does it fulfill its RTS expectations but, imho, it expands and sets a new paradigm for the whole genre. Nuclear blasts, incredible massive experimental units of formidable power, shielding and cloaking abilities, are just a few of the things expected in the game. If you are in for an addictive gameplay and an enthusiastic community - even after all these years - that supports the game, then you should go ahead try it.","March 10, 2014","true","105.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then i DISSASBLED THE WEAPON RANGE RINGS, and it was as smooth as could be. These rings must be difficult for the code to calculate, although as a programmer myself, i would have thought that a 2d single colour image would have been nothing???\nHope this helps someone solve their lag issues","March 13, 2014","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
