( I took an army of 10 without losing any HP)\n- It's very hard to do normal attacks with your sword.\n- Apples and gold everywhere.....\n- The menus are still clustering together, and you have to close them down separately.\n- You can save your game now, but the tutorial will come up, when you get in again. You will also have unequipped your weapon, so you have to put them back on again\n- If you kill one single guard, then you will be consindered outlaw in the game meaning that you can't interact with the commander, so you have to restart or kill the guards.\n- When you go out of the camp, 2 quest markers will appear. One of them is the right one, and the other one will distance you farther and farther away from the original quest.\n\nThe game still isn't playable in my opinion.\n\n\n\nThis review was made at the day of release:\n\nThe game overall isnt ready for Early Acces. Played it for 10 min, but had to give up for the following reasons:\n\n- Poor optimization\n- Bad combat system\n- Your mouse cursor is in the game (wtf)\n- FPS drops everywhere\n- Apples everywhere\n- The menus (inventory, follower menu and the general menu) gets clustered together, and they overlap eachother.\n- Saved the game, but it couldnt load my save, so had to restart the game, and start over again...\n\nThis game isnt playable, therefore i wont recommend it now. Could change it later on if they fix those things.","June 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 335 of 383 people (87%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","87","335","383","14","18"

You rushed the game to be released by bribing people to vote for your game on greenlight so they can get a free key. Right now it's not worth buying. Wait for updates to fix this game's gameplay mechanics, lack of content and it's graphics. Because man those graphics are so bad.","June 24, 2015","false","0.7"," 281 of 320 people (88%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","88","281","320","7","11"

So basically I bought the game (YES I actually paid money for this game. I know this game was given out for free but I missed it) and played for like an hour or so (The rest of the time I spent idling for cards). From the hour or so I played I probably experienced over 100 glitches. Glitches include but not limited to - crashes, cliping through items, falling off the map, stamina not recharging, not being able to do any damage to enemies, enemies not being able to do any damage to you, not being able to pick up items, not being able to accept certain quests, terrible AI, freezing etc. I could keep going but the list is endless. So anyway I took a screenshot of the game and just simply criticized it for being what it is - A completely broken, rushed for Early Access, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. After about four days or so I get a response from the developer...\n\n\n"do some research how can you get the impression that this is a finnished game when there is about 900 warning that say "in dvelopment" and "early access", yes 100% complete... great intelligence skills you have there...."\n\nScreenshot of screenshot: http://imgur.com/KkCzgKe\n\nScreenshot of responses: http://imgur.com/ivOxC3C\n\n\nSeeing the developer insult someone over criticizing their game (which totally deserves it) is appalling. I encourage all of you to not support a developer who gets so butthurt like this. I paid actual MONEY for this game. I fully deserve to criticize it. The developer can just not take criticism and goes out of his way to actually insult someone over it. This is absolutely unacceptable. Please do not support developers who are like this.\n\nMy screenshot has been taken down due to a violation of Terms of Service. As you can see from the screenshots above I have done nothing wrong whatsoever. I'm not sure what happened but I have contacted Steam Support about this issue. Hopefully it will be revoked. Maybe the developer reported/flagged the ♥♥♥♥ out of it? Who knows. The developer also seems to like to flag negative reviews and ban people who don't like his "game." I wouldn't be surprised if the developer flagged this review in all honesty.\n\nSo all in all,\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nDO NOT GIVE THE DEVELOPER YOUR MONEY\nDO NOT PLAY THIS GAME\nDO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME\nDO NOT SUPPORT DEVELOPERS WHO ARE LIKE THIS","February 11","false","3.0"," 147 of 162 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","147","162","23","57"

I literally spent about 20 minutes running towards objectives which then told me to run to more objectives.\nA lot of the dialogue and text that comes up seems badly done and lacking care. Screenshot\nThe AI is near to brain dead. Beyond that there is only one enemy I ever saw in my play time and it/that thing was everywhere.\nNPCs take away any illusion of immersion you could possibley have. ScreenshotThe world is more bare than a wasteland. It is actually quite sad as I'm sure it would be beautiful with actual detail. Screenshot\nLet's Summarize It AllThis is by far one of the worst games I've seen come out of Early Access. Now to be fair it only cost me $1. While that is dirt cheap it is still hard earned money I spent to have an enjoyable experience. What I got was a look at grass while you run simulator.

Its being way too kind to call this shovelware, since that would seem to imply that some kind of tool or implement was used to dump this pile of crap onto Steam.\n\nThe game can't barely even hit 30 fps on the lowest setings and mostly runs at 20-25 fps, very poorly optimized. The dev got this game through greenlight through bribing people with free keys.\n\nThe graphics don't seem to reflect the difficulty of trying to get this game just to hit 30 fps, games either need to have good graphics or a good aesthetics. Blood of Old has neither.\n\nThe menus look dull and scream of default unity GUI. The animations are terrible and look almost nothing like what they're trying to be. Items are difficult to pick up at times and the combat is one dimmensional at best.\n\nI can see the 'developers' vision when making this game, but this guy has clearly taken on a project too big for himself. I'd recommend Mount and Blade Warband over this game, if you want to be a warrior starting from the bottom and becoming a vassal or king with your own castle. Then thats probably a better game for you, it also has mod support, multiplayer and trading cards. If you get it on sale you may get a better deal than buying Blood of Old at full price.\n\nThe 'dev' has now added trading cards try and get some positive reviews, this reflects a larger issue on Steam. That people will actually rate a bad game positively due to trading cards, its unfortunate.\n\nPeople seem to try and defend this game, saying its not a AAA game or that its in early access or that its made by an indie developer.\n\nThese excuses are just not valid. Have some standards and release something worth showing. I'd feel cheated if I spent a single penny on this, luckily I did not.","October 14, 2015","false","5.3"," 63 of 73 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","63","73","3","8"

Change the combat. The whole "hold down left click and swipe," thing is absolutely garbage. Just make it a click of the button with different movements directions changing the animation or something. Like move left to do a back hand swing, or stand still and attack for a normal swing, not this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of a Wii motion control feature. It's counterintuitive.\n\n2. This game lags when it shouldn't have problems lagging because the requirements are so low. I don't know how that happens, but fix it.\n\n3. The body actually goes through the clothes. I can see his elbow through his armor, which isn't good. Try rigging the clothes to the actual body instead of just kinda putting them on it. If these are free models and you don't know how to do that, just make the armor a little bigger.\n\n4. Don't make the item pickups a hitbox and try to fix them on to the cursor that is actually IN the game. It's a little wonky and took me a little while to figure out.\n\n5. Please fix the day/night transitions. They're so abrupt, it's actually funny. Crossfade them into eachother or something.\n\n6. There's some issues where the water is actually just floating above the land.\n\n7. That music sounds awfully familiar.\n\n\nThat's just my advice. Ban me or not, that's what's wrong with the game.

I have no idea): you can also hold the parry button and attack at will without taking damage ( even though you'd clearly have been hit judging by the animation, but the game just checks if you're holding the button)\n\n-both enemy and allies have bad AI, they sometimes get stuck on the terrain or just stop attacking for no reason. The NPC follower I hired with gold was also useless since he only attacked each foe once before simply standing there doing nothing, he was completely unresponsive to any command and was basically just a waste of money: he also couldn't keep up with my running speed, making traveling a chore. NPCs in cities also get stuck on walls or on each other at times\n\n-UI looks amateurish and bad sporting huge gray buttons with words in menus/ inventory and overlapping parts during the actual game: the worse part is the very bugged quest waypoints, you often get two pointing in different directions and they'll sometimes be both wrong, leaving you stranded\n\n-the lack of any kind of map/ minimap makes traveling a frustrating experience in a world that basically looks the same all over: coupled with the aforementioned bugged waypoints it becomes even worse\n\n-poor quest design, the only one I got was a delivery to another castle and basically amounted to running through the barren world, going near the castle and clicking a button to deliver a letter...I didn't even have to enter said castle (in fact you can clip inside but it's empty) or talk to an NPC\n\n-no way to change key bindings, if you also forget the initial tutorial (three quick pages referring to the various controls) you have no way to find out how to do something since there's no help page\n\n-last but not least there seems to be proof regarding the dev acting in a very  unprofessional way ( http://www.l45ltd.co.uk/developer-blog/a-seriously-infectious-situation )\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519625369\n\nBlood of Old was a pretty appalling experience, my first time with the game it simply didn't work enough (see the bugged waypoint section) and I had no way to actually get where I was supposed to thus forcing me to restart. Even when it works its production values are so low to make it look like something from 15 years ago and, even worse, it lacks any kind of engaging gameplay since all you can do is stumble blindly into an empty world, fighting clone after clone with a dull and exploitable combat system while gathering the plethora of apples and gold scattered around.\n\nThe lack of any polish and horrible bugs are the final nail in the coffin: this might be an alpha and thus subject to change but the dev is asking for your money now and this is simply not worth the asking price, not even on an huge sale.

However, this game is too early into development for me to recommend even putting on Steam. This should've instead been used as a free early access demo until (IF) the game is finished for release. I got a free code, and I'm hoping 100% of people who own this did too. Let me elaborate, by using fair and honest criticisms:\n\n-Very buggy. 1) When I open the controls option to view the controls, the box is all blacked out. Whenever I click the "return to menu" option, my character just swings his sword. The menu won't close, but the game will still be in motion. 2) When changing the quality, everything turns white and therefore, the menu unreadable to change back. 3) A faded text came up that says "Press E to pick up," but nothing happened. I also pressed F to make sure it didn't actually say F, but still nothing happened.\n-Textures look alright, but it has an unfinished look to it - leading to my earlier statement that this is too early to serve as an early access game.\n-When you walk sideways, your character just drifts. They don't even move their legs.\n-Slow, laggy mess.\n-Currently, the dev is trying to make money from Greenlighting ANOTHER "game" of his. This will NEVER get finished, and he'll be laughing in your face as you spend money on his unfinished junk.\n-I actually can't say what I want to right here, or I'll get sued for "defaming." Just read the reviews on here and the comments on the reviews, you'll see what I'm talking about.","April 4","false","6.8"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","24","26","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lagreskul/recommended/382240/","lagreskul","Lagreskul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lagreskul/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI worry about the well-fare of developers like this. I can understand your dream, you 19 year old, you, but at this point I feel like flat-out development is beyond reach for you. I don't mean to not keep trying, but maybe consider getting better before you release something for real money on the market.\n\nAs for the rest of you, and the developer, I suppose, if he reads through this, this is my experience with the game:\n\nI spawned in a jail-cell without context. It looked... meh, about on par with a vanilla, original release, Mount and Blade. I worked through it, finding, to my surprise that everything worked, with some minor inconveneince as I discovered that chains came with a forcefield. No worries, I suppose that it *is* in an alpha build, and collision boxes will possibly be refined.\n\nSo, once out of that, I immediately began grabbing all of the things, which is where things began going wrong, the ability to pick things up breaking after a moment and never being able to be used again with exception to the rusty sword and shield.\n\nI was then engaged in intense, mortal combat with the nearest enemy, and at first, I thought I couldn't attack, possibly because I was out of stamina, which never seems to regenerate. However, it was just that the animation for attacks rarely plays, and I was actually doing damage- sometimes. Anyway, I ran around the camp, the enemy not able to deal with my combat prowress as it chased after me, and, finding it empty, I ran on to the first location.\n\nWhile exploring the land, I found the following wonders:\n\n1) A pig model with no pig AI\n2) A completely empty village\n3) Armies of clones of a man who seemed to enjoy wearing a  skull\n4) A pond that allowed any mortal man to ascend to the level of Jesus, and walk upon it's pure, blue, surfaces\n5) A deer that can do the same\n6) Sudden day-night cycles, with night doing nothing to change the ambient light levels, and lasting a fraction of the the day.\n\nSo, I finally reached our first objective, the walled city of Completely-forgettable, and proceeded to do the following things:\n\n1) Push the horse cart around, because it's model is apparently not fixed and you can just push it around as muchas you want\n2) Hire an underling to discover that the command system does not work.\n3) Talk to the commander, get a new mission, and proceed out\n4) Decide to use the cart-horse to try and find a closer location to the new objective, get teleported inside a building model with no doors, and quit momentarily.\n\nReturning with a glass of milk and increased determination, I tried again. This time, I didn't let those roving bands of bandits stand for... standing there and attacking bystanders(!) and engaged in combat with them! I quickly found myself standing upon my enemy's shoulders, slashing at him, and him at me, and, unfortunately, quickly fell. The following proceeded to happen:\n\n1) I reloaded my last save game, however, the objective marker was now moving in an inversely proportional direction and behavior to the mouse cursor.\n2) A second music track began playing on top of the other.\n3) Mouse became unfixed, and the hotkey to fix it stopped working.\n4) Could no longer interact with any civillian NPCs\n5) Bandits refused to chase. They could attack, but as far as taking a step is concerned, they were done with that.\n\nSo, broken, boring, and ugly. Don't buy this. Sorry, dev, but, as I assume, this is probably your first game, and you should really work to make something better than this.","February 7","false","0.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

I had a hell of a lot of respect for them. But that changed.\n\nLINK TO AN IMPORTANT SCREENSHOT[imgur.com]\nOriginally posted by AndrewWatt96:"do some research how can you get the impression that this is a finnished game when there is about 900 warning that say "in dvelopment" and "early access", yes 100% complete... great intelligence skills you have there...."Yes the dev said this in that screenshot\n\nDespite the game being what it is I wanted to give the dev support.

I will not stand for butthurt devs who can't handle\n\n•Don't buy the game.\n•Don't play the game.\n•Don't activate your free key.\n•Don't support Devs like this.\n\nEDIT: Don't get me wrong there is a strong potential for this game in my opinion. It's just I don't agree with the actions the dev took out a fit of anger. The user who uploaded the screenshot of the game didn't get a free key for the game, they paid with hard earned money to get it and more than most of us deserves to critisize it.  There needs to be a formal apology and the screen shot shouldn't had been taken down.\nThis game is just not ready for early access let alone steam. I think it would do the Dev good to take this down, work on it more, and re-release it under a new name to give it a fresh start. Because I seriously doubt the game will get any good rep once it's finally done under this name and steam listing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n36 out of 50 people found my original positive review helpful (72%)\n"This game is in very early stages of development, things will be broken, things will be added some things may be removed or changed. Please DO NOT buy or play this game unless you fully understand this and wish to be active in development of the game! " -warning in the discription of game\n\nYou might be asking why I'm giving this game a positive review with the state it's currently in. It's quite simple that I don't believe this game deserves the hate it's getting. This is a green light game that was pushed out because of demand and was slabbed a "Early Access: onto it. The game just is not close [at all] to being a finished product. And that's that. There are some really wonderful ideas for the game and the Dev is trying hard to make this game the best it can be and is listening to the players about problems and the like. It is not that often you see that on steam anymore and I really think that alone warrents a 'Yes' from me.\nI suck at serious reviews.","February 11","false","4.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","24","31","5","14"

I decided to put all that behind me and just play without that bias like the dev seemed to want and see what it was all about.\n\nSo I spawn in, the menus are pretty blocky and unpolished, forgivable since this is an early access game.\nI spawn into the game, there is a short and quite intrusive button tutorial. Once I got past that I started to see what people were saying.\n\nFirst it finding quest items would be easier if it gave you a general direction of where to find them (specifically the weapon)\n\nThe game felt kind of slugish moving around but again this is early access so I am expecting all of these things to get better (hopefully)\n\nTrying to find the weapon took a while since it is off to the side from where you come out and not where the path leads you.\n\nEnemies then started to chase me, and by that I mean they ran a bit, got stuck on nothing until i moved to another side of them and then they started running again.\n\nThey also attacked once and then ran in place at me while I was standing still.\n\nI went in search of the weapon after that and tried to pick up some gold on the way which had the "press e to pick up" over them but I could not do so.\n\nI finally found the weapon and shield (while i was being attacked already and went to equip them. The game does not pause when you go into the menus nor is there a way to fast equip things, you have to go to the inventory, click on the weapon, click equip and then exit the menu. And by that I mean do NOT press esc or else you will bring up the main menu (still no pause) behind the inventory screen. You have to press I again or you cannot get out of it.\n\nI took some damage and eventually got my weapon and shield equipped. I tried to attack, did so once and then my character refused to attack again. The shield went up but only blocked once and then did nothing. Though since the enemies stopped attacking this did not matter.\n\nSo the game was pretty much unplayable at this point so I had to quit.\n\nWhat I really want to say on this game is that it should probably be taken down and worked on until there is something playable before it goes back up or else it will be one of the worst rated games on here.\n\nTo the developer I want to say stop taking all the criticism in the way of lashing back out at the people who are trying to play your game. LISTEN to the people and work on your game to make it better. Make it the way you want it to be seen.\n\nThis game has a good concept and lots of potential. I just hope the developer can realize that it is broken and needs to be fixed and work on it because this game could be great.\n\nAs of right now it is pretty much unplayable. Please stop pouring salt into your wound in the comments and show people that your game is good by working on making it good!","November 14, 2015","false","4.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

It's a pretty hilarious game though to be honest, I would definitely recommend it as a game to Ƒuck around with if you're bored with friends and only if you get it for free. For me alone, I got a really good laugh out of it and because it was free for me, I definitely thought it was worth my time. I was laughing non-stop. At the ṡhitty graphics. At the terrible controls and how difficult it is to interact with anything in the entire 'vast' world. The enemies are horrendously programmed and glitch and I moonwalked all over them and jumped on top of clans of bandits.\n\nThe world is pretty small but fun to run around in and look at the stupid ṡhit that's all over. The movement is very slow and amusing in some situations. (Like to climb up some steps that lead to some useless balcony in a mine, you have to jump up the steps like four at a time. It's things like this that made the game so quirky) The combat is very clunky and not fluid at all. Every hit feels like you're tied to a ball and chain stuck on the bottom level of an ocean. Another noteworthy mention of the game is a hilarious event that occured. There is a strange house in the middle of nowhere with what seems to be a prison door to a moderately sized house and once entered you just kind of teleport to the bottom of some mining area. Good lightning and some creepy sounds down there as well as finding motherƒucking 50 APPLES! in one chest make for another ƒucking hilarious experience.\n\nThe music is actually decent considering how bad the rest of the game is. A lot of the NPCs and models look pretty funny. More good things to laugh at. Also you can pick dozens and dozens of apples for some reason. Like.. they're everywhere. I saw others were leaving it running just for the trading cards as well as a few of my friends and after seeing it I could tell it was one of those games (kind of like those movies) where it's so bad it's kind of funny and that's what I personally think of this game.\n\nIt's like a hour of a free comedy movie better than most I see now adays. I definitely would not recommend buying it to support it for it's after-alpha stage as I'm sure almost anyone can see this is and will stay a piece of garbage. I suppose though it's comedic value pays off your time if you can get the game for free. Overall, I found it an enjoyable hilariously terrrible experience.","December 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","12","14","3","0"

Who needs another medieval combat game? The first quest I get is to run a really REALLY long way. I didn't even bother to do it. I've seen many games in early development that show promise but I'm going to have to say that this one doesn't look like it's going anywhere. There are just far too many games out there that most people would rather play. I think it really lacks creativity and fluidity. It seems as if the developers are just trying to get some practice with their skills instead of developing an actual game.

After randomly finding a guy to deliver a letter for (he was standing in front of a big castle, i guess that means he's important?), I followed the arrow to my destination. Problem is, I had no idea how to get back. I found a river which I thought was one I saw before (it wasn't), and then followed it until i reached the end of the map.\n\nAlso, you can only have one quest at a time so if you find a quest giver on your way to deliver something, you have to go back and find him afterwards.\n\nSeriously, don't buy this game","March 17","false","4.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

Just bare with me and read it. Also, AndrewWatt96, please read this review at your sake.\n\nOne of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.\n-Bryant H. McGill\n\nDev, think about his quote.\n\nIntroduction\nI got this game through a giveaway. My first thoughts were that this would be some clone of Ravensword or Morrowind or some generic RPG that I would play to cut time. But what I saw and experienced... I went catatonic. I am going to be very straightfoward with you, this game is bad, simply broken. So bad that it should be removed from Steam Greenlight. But enough of opinions, let's jump to the facts.\n\nStory\nWell... I would rate the Story section... if there was one. I think it will going to be a storyline, or at least, I hope that. Basically, you start in a jail and you have to make your way out of the bandit outpost. Sounds difficult eh? Well, it could have been more difficult if someone did not forget to drop the key to open the cell INSIDE the cell. After that you find some rusty armor and a sword and you make your way to the next village where you meet "the commander" to give you certain tasks. I really wish I could say anything more about the story but my game simply crashes after that.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics it self are not that bad! There is a lot of potencial. But everything is extremely buggy. And the lack of perfecionism is evident: you can see inside houses, there's too much grass in the hills/ground which is what makes the game with low fps's. Peaseants/Knights have different height's, some are smaller than the player, some are the same height as the player, some are a bit bigger ( I don't know if this was made in purpose, but if it was, well spotted dev).\nMenus are an abortion. Sorry for the term but Menu's like Inventory menu or Main Menu seems something tha tgot out from one of those old flash games that you played in newgrounds.\nThere is a lot of things to point out related to graphics but i won't point out because my dog just destroyed my notes. Fo'real.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is broken. You can't attack, your jump is clumsy, running will outperform any bandit. Try to jump and then run and you are back to some Super Mario classic. There is a inventory and stuff but they are merely simbolic because you will only going to use once or twice. At least you can block and buy/sell weapons...\n\nMusic\nIt's just one or two musics in a loop.\n\nOverall\nThis game is broken. Does not worth 7€ even in the Early Access phase. There were made crytical mistakes by the dev and it resulted in a very bad image problem.  This can potencially destroy your rep, dev. If you go on with this you will be know has the guy who has a steam account and made the wrost game ever on steam. The game must be re-done. Everything. Please, dev, add me so we can discuss the game image problem and maybe we can solve it out. Before is too late.\n\nSince this is a Early Access Game I will not score this game since is not yet finished. :)\n","November 7, 2015","false","4.7"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

You can`t ban people because they give you bad reviews no matter what. It`s childish and pathetic to believe that you get more bad reviews only because you gave away your game for free. Newsflash for you: at the moment your game is garbage. Put some work in the combat system, AI, overhaul the graphic design of the game, and try to put in place a story for the world you created. Without a story this game is pointless.\n\nPS: I do not recomend buying the game for the cards. If you really want the badge it would be more cost effective to buy the cards from the market because you can craft it even if you do not own the game.","November 10, 2015","false","3.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

As soon as I started the game and saw the stock unity text boxes I knew what was coming.\n\nThe music in the main menu seemed quite nice but once you get into the game you get something that makes your ears bleed, and the performance is horrible.\n\nAlso the crosshair seems way off because in order to pick up items you have to point the crosshair like 180 degrees away from the object to pick it up.\n\nIn terms of combat the game seems to either lack an attack animation or you can only damage your enemy by blocking, couldn't figure out what was damaging my enemy since I was just mashing buttons for a solid minute to kill the first enemy.\n\nI think the game has potential to become a decent game similar to Enclave which is in my opinion a great old game, but the developer has to completely change everything which probably wont happen if the game is already in early access.\n\nI'm going to check back in like a year to see if anything's changed but currently it just seems like a medieval version of Air Control.","October 8, 2015","false","3.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The idea that this game can be considered good since it has a one person dev team is ridiculous, as Robot Roller Derby Disco Dodgeball is made by one person, and is an EXTREMELY fun game with good graphics, and it has been since its early days.\n\nI know I don't have a lot of time in that game, but that is because the game is so badly laid out and the pause menu pulled up what looked like a dialouge box, which I could not figure out how to get out of, causing me to close the game and swear never to launch it again.\n\nAnyway, I will do a pros and cons list, but first let me tell you a story.\nSo, the developer was celebrating selling a good amount of the game and decided to give away a bunch of copies of the game. Since there were more people getting the game the amount of opinions on the game began to vary. People saw the game as the terribly made (It's even sad for a 1 dev team) game it was. The developer then told everyone he will never give away copies of the game as "people left troll reviews which made the game drop to mostly negative reviews" ( http://steamcommunity.com/app/382240/discussions/0/490123938437958834/ ) People in the comments began to justify why these reviews were actually accurate due to the poor making of the game. The developer then proceeded to ban these people\n\nSo that's my story\nNow for a Pro/Con\n\nPROS:\n-Somewhat of a tutorial\n-Textures aren't as bad as the game itself\n-Developer is trying to better the game\n\nCONS:\n-Enemies are extremely slow and easy to outrun\n-Enemies watch you from a distance and magically rotate to watch you, but do not engage enless you get close (Even if you are in their base)\n-At the start of the game it tells you to get a weapon but it is not clear where to get it. Luckily you don't need one as enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n-After you leave bandit camp at start the game's just like "HEY WALK AN EXTREMELY LARGE DISTANCE FOR NO REASON"\n-Poor lighting\n-Extremely poor animations\n-Even though the game looks like crap it gets terrible FPS\n-etc.\n\nOverall Rating: 1/10","November 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Now that I've played it I realize I paid for it with a small part of my sanity.\n\nRight now the game is in a very early stage and I know I should give constructive feedback and point out bugs. But it would be much faster to point out the good thing: The music is really nice! Still I will write down some of my other experiences.\n\nI think I did everything that's possible at this point, which included exciting tasks such as:\n\n- Escaping a prison cell, with the key that was conveniently placed inside said cell\n- Picking up stuff (Some apples, some gold, a sword and armor)\n- Killing my captors\n- Fleeing the scene\n- Accepting to deliver a letter\n- Delivering said letter to a completely empty castle which I entered by walking through a wall (note here, that there was no other way in)\n\nNow a thing that I found quite frustrating are the objective markers, which always come in pairs...I'll try to explain. So i was fleeing from the camp that held me hostage, running towards the objective marker when I realized the distance counter was counting up instead of down. So what happened you ask? Well, turns out there are always 2 waypoints. The "right one" and a fake one that points directly in the opposite direction...I can't even begin to understand what's going on here. Maybe you can walk around the whole globe and still reach your destination...but even in that case the distance should decrease in both directions.\n\nOther than that I can't say much about the "game" if you wanna call it that. The enemies all look alike and have the AI of a toaster. The combat is...meh. The objects popping in are unlike anything I have ever seen. The day/night transitions happen in like 5 stages and are WAY to fast (I was running 2500 meters towards the first (and only?) city and it took me 3 in-game days). The only person I could interact with was a the dude that game me the letter.\n\nSo yeah...don't buy this. The devs say it will be in early access for one or two more years. I doubt thats nearly enough time to make something half decent out of this. If I'm wrong you can still buy it when it's out.","September 22, 2015","false","3.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","6","9","2","0"

A red font on a dark background is hard to read. Besides that, everything is all over the place! So why not put a light colored background layer for the GUI and group everything there?\n\nAnother thing: despite not hurting anyone, it bothers not to be able to move the mouse outside the window without removing the focus from the game. Sometimes you just want to scroll something on another window, or just see some other data.\n\nAfter you look at a lootable item, the "Press E to pick-up item" just stays there if you don't pick it up and move away. Also, it would be good to change the mouse cursor to a hand when moving over a pickable item.\n\nAbout the tutorial: ok, I get it, it should be easy to get out of that cell, as it is not the main point of the game, but putting the keys over a barrel without any challenges at all makes it pointless to be locked. Instead, either add a little bit of challenge to get the keys, or just put the character inside a dungeon, where it would make a little bit more sense to have a forgotten key.\n\nAnother bug: A man walked into a table and then tried to get some coins. He was teleported to the other table. (Was that even a pun? Anyway, This happened on the table outside of the cell)\n\nI didn't manage to pick anything over the barrels in front of the cell.\n\nThe equipments should be easier to find, as you find a lot of enemies when you walk out of the cell, and you can't melee them. Also, I think I managed to pick them up (as they disappeared), but continued unable to attack.\n\nESC should pause the game (the enemies keep hitting/moving).\n\nI've ALT+TABbed and lost vertical movement of the mouse.\n\nI know some of these problems the developer might be already aware of, but I've decided to point them out anyway.\n\nSo, as of now, the game is too raw, and I'd say it is a No.","October 31, 2015","false","4.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I never made it out of the cell. For whatever reason I couldn't pickup the cell key which happened to be in the cell with me...\n\nPros\nUnknown. Maybe there were some, but I didn't get to experience much of the game.\n\nCons\n- Textures. Poor quality textures.\n- Wall and floor clipping. You can easily see on the other side of a wall by rotating the camera. Also the floor and wall tiles, and some part of the wall, you can see overlap and a glitchy flash that happens when the game is trying to show them both in the same spot. The part of the wall where it happens you can clearly see it's where the developer / level designer placed the next section of wall not even paying attention to lining up the wall just right so the textures line up at least.\n- Couldn't pickup more than one apple.\n- Inventory screen was just a solid wood texture and some white text.\n- Walking animations were off. By strafing right, you could see the character actually take steps to the right, however left, he just walks forward, but moves left. Also by pressing either forward or back while moving right, you can change the animation to the forward moving animation while you are still strafing.\n\nOther thoughts...\nI can't even say the game has potential. It's not even ready for alpha testers to be honest. It's way too incomplete. I don't think it's ready for Steam early access and I have no idea how it managed to make it. It honestly feels like a 15 year old who's just beginning to learn game design and programming has been working on this for about a week. But of course I never made it out of the cell. In the game videos on Steam I can see that I wouldn't have changed my mind.\n\nTo developer(s)\nI apologize for being so critical. But you really shouldn't be trying to sell this yet. Get a small group of closed access testers to help you test changes you make and notice things that are not complete. If you have any empathy towards others, you may consider removing it from Steam for a while until it's a lot more complete.\n\nSteam\nI am disappointed that you allow this content now. Steam used to be a place for quality content only. I liked it that way.\n\nFinal thought\nI got this game free on indiegala. If you want to give it a try, go ahead and grab yourself a copy while it's still available for free. Also to be fair, remember that I didn't actually get to play much of this, so judge for yourself.","October 29, 2015","false","0.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Date of first impressions is 12/29/2015.\n\n\nI thought this game looked interesting from the screens and since I found the game in a giveaway (reddit) I thought I'd try it.\n\nThe is extremly unpolished. I would say the menu system is ancient but I'm not sure I"ve ever seen a legacy game with such bad menus.  The first 10 minutes or so was me just exploring around and collecting items before I ran into a bandit. I quickly discovered the inventory menu doesn't pause the game, I wasn't slain and was able to equip my sword/shield quickly and start combat.  After a few moments my blocking and power attack keys just stopped working.  I'm at half an hour and I"m already done with this game.\n\nThis game is seemingly trying to be a elder scrolls game but clearly with much lower production value (budget I'd guess).  I'd rather just play any other elder scrolls game or even AA or AAA clone of one. The controls are clunky, the world is clunky, the menus are clunky and basiclly the game is clunky.\n\nOn a plus side tho it does have trading cards. So it has that going for it, which is nice.","December 29, 2015","false","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

The combat system should have made it fun, but I had to constantly jump up and down to hit any enemies. You don't move fast enough to run away from them, so once one is trailing you, you have to fight them or die to get rid of them. I still don't understand how to gain health back, because eating only refills hunger. There's no way to find quest spots so you have to guess. I found the jump function entertaining at least, because if you quickly tap the jump button, your character jumps straight up and down in the air without bending his knees, like a stiff board that was animated into life. Holding the jump button will make him bend his knees while he's already in the air.\n\nText layers over other text so it's difficult to click buttons. I really wanted to get to the parts where you can change the scenery and ride the horse but I can't even get that far. If this game was fixed even a little bit more, so that the combat was more precise and functioned better, I think it would be a fun, cheap game to goof around on. But as it stands, I can't recommend it because it's too broken to be entertaining.","November 2, 2015","false","0.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

( I took an army of 10 without losing any HP)\n- It's very hard to do normal attacks with your sword.\n- Apples and gold everywhere.....\n- The menus are still clustering together, and you have to close them down separately.\n- You can save your game now, but the tutorial will come up, when you get in again. You will also have unequipped your weapon, so you have to put them back on again\n- If you kill one single guard, then you will be consindered outlaw in the game meaning that you can't interact with the commander, so you have to restart or kill the guards.\n- When you go out of the camp, 2 quest markers will appear. One of them is the right one, and the other one will distance you farther and farther away from the original quest.\n\nThe game still isn't playable in my opinion.\n\n\n\nThis review was made at the day of release:\n\nThe game overall isnt ready for Early Acces. Played it for 10 min, but had to give up for the following reasons:\n\n- Poor optimization\n- Bad combat system\n- Your mouse cursor is in the game (wtf)\n- FPS drops everywhere\n- Apples everywhere\n- The menus (inventory, follower menu and the general menu) gets clustered together, and they overlap eachother.\n- Saved the game, but it couldnt load my save, so had to restart the game, and start over again...\n\nThis game isnt playable, therefore i wont recommend it now.

So basically I bought the game (YES I actually paid money for this game. I know this game was given out for free but I missed it) and played for like an hour or so (The rest of the time I spent idling for cards). From the hour or so I played I probably experienced over 100 glitches. Glitches include but not limited to - crashes, cliping through items, falling off the map, stamina not recharging, not being able to do any damage to enemies, enemies not being able to do any damage to you, not being able to pick up items, not being able to accept certain quests, terrible AI, freezing etc. I could keep going but the list is endless. So anyway I took a screenshot of the game and just simply criticized it for being what it is - A completely broken, rushed for Early Access, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. After about four days or so I get a response from the developer...\n\n\n"do some research how can you get the impression that this is a finnished game when there is about 900 warning that say "in dvelopment" and "early access", yes 100% complete... great intelligence skills you have there...."\n\nScreenshot of screenshot: http://imgur.com/KkCzgKe\n\nScreenshot of responses: http://imgur.com/ivOxC3C\n\n\nSeeing the developer insult someone over criticizing their game (which totally deserves it) is appalling. I encourage all of you to not support a developer who gets so butthurt like this. I paid actual MONEY for this game. I fully deserve to criticize it. The developer can just not take criticism and goes out of his way to actually insult someone over it. This is absolutely unacceptable. Please do not support developers who are like this.\n\nMy screenshot has been taken down due to a violation of Terms of Service. As you can see from the screenshots above I have done nothing wrong whatsoever. I'm not sure what happened but I have contacted Steam Support about this issue. Hopefully it will be revoked. Maybe the developer reported/flagged the ♥♥♥♥ out of it? Who knows. The developer also seems to like to flag negative reviews and ban people who don't like his "game." I wouldn't be surprised if the developer flagged this review in all honesty.\n\nSo all in all,\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME\nDO NOT GIVE THE DEVELOPER YOUR MONEY\nDO NOT PLAY THIS GAME\nDO NOT SUPPORT THIS GAME\nDO NOT SUPPORT DEVELOPERS WHO ARE LIKE THIS","February 11","false","3.0"," 147 of 162 people (91%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","91","147","162","23","57"

I literally spent about 20 minutes running towards objectives which then told me to run to more objectives.\nA lot of the dialogue and text that comes up seems badly done and lacking care.

Its being way too kind to call this shovelware, since that would seem to imply that some kind of tool or implement was used to dump this pile of crap onto Steam.\n\nThe game can't barely even hit 30 fps on the lowest setings and mostly runs at 20-25 fps, very poorly optimized. The dev got this game through greenlight through bribing people with free keys.\n\nThe graphics don't seem to reflect the difficulty of trying to get this game just to hit 30 fps, games either need to have good graphics or a good aesthetics. Blood of Old has neither.\n\nThe menus look dull and scream of default unity GUI. The animations are terrible and look almost nothing like what they're trying to be. Items are difficult to pick up at times and the combat is one dimmensional at best.\n\nI can see the 'developers' vision when making this game, but this guy has clearly taken on a project too big for himself. I'd recommend Mount and Blade Warband over this game, if you want to be a warrior starting from the bottom and becoming a vassal or king with your own castle. Then thats probably a better game for you, it also has mod support, multiplayer and trading cards. If you get it on sale you may get a better deal than buying Blood of Old at full price.\n\nThe 'dev' has now added trading cards try and get some positive reviews, this reflects a larger issue on Steam. That people will actually rate a bad game positively due to trading cards, its unfortunate.\n\nPeople seem to try and defend this game, saying its not a AAA game or that its in early access or that its made by an indie developer.\n\nThese excuses are just not valid.

Change the combat. The whole "hold down left click and swipe," thing is absolutely garbage. Just make it a click of the button with different movements directions changing the animation or something. Like move left to do a back hand swing, or stand still and attack for a normal swing, not this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of a Wii motion control feature. It's counterintuitive.\n\n2. This game lags when it shouldn't have problems lagging because the requirements are so low. I don't know how that happens, but fix it.\n\n3. The body actually goes through the clothes. I can see his elbow through his armor, which isn't good. Try rigging the clothes to the actual body instead of just kinda putting them on it. If these are free models and you don't know how to do that, just make the armor a little bigger.\n\n4. Don't make the item pickups a hitbox and try to fix them on to the cursor that is actually IN the game. It's a little wonky and took me a little while to figure out.\n\n5. Please fix the day/night transitions. They're so abrupt, it's actually funny. Crossfade them into eachother or something.\n\n6. There's some issues where the water is actually just floating above the land.\n\n7. That music sounds awfully familiar.\n\n\nThat's just my advice. Ban me or not, that's what's wrong with the game. You gotta try to aim for XBL Indie game quality.

There is not much to the story. The models are ok (not all of them are even nearly good, but they're ok for now). The textures are not that well - let's be honest. The combat is a bit iffy (you can attack and block at the same time...) The only other thing you can do so far in the game is pick up apples (and eat them when your hunger goes down) or pick up gold, wich I have not found use for so far (but I have not played that much - for a reason though). The picking up items is quite iffy. Sometimes you're standing right infront of it and it wont let you pick it up. I got teleported under a map once (not sure if it was because of interacting with a door or because another item was near so the script might have tried to open the door and pick up an item at the same time or maybe it was just a movement script). The walking animation is nowhere near polished (you're still moving in the direction when the animation has already stopped). The level design isn't that great either and the game did not impress me at all at this point. I see potential in it, but I DO NOT recommend this game AT THE MOMENT.\nI will try this in a few months and see the progress, but so far all I see done in this game are basic models with very basic animations and some very basic interaction plus the hunger bar. If we count out the modeling, I can say as a programmer that what I see so far could not have taken more than a couple of weeks at most to make (for a single person) unless there is more to the game than I've seen.\n\nI like the effort, but this is nowhere near recommendable or PLAYABLE for that matter. I'm not even sure it should be an early access...","September 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have no idea): you can also hold the parry button and attack at will without taking damage ( even though you'd clearly have been hit judging by the animation, but the game just checks if you're holding the button)\n\n-both enemy and allies have bad AI, they sometimes get stuck on the terrain or just stop attacking for no reason. The NPC follower I hired with gold was also useless since he only attacked each foe once before simply standing there doing nothing, he was completely unresponsive to any command and was basically just a waste of money: he also couldn't keep up with my running speed, making traveling a chore. NPCs in cities also get stuck on walls or on each other at times\n\n-UI looks amateurish and bad sporting huge gray buttons with words in menus/ inventory and overlapping parts during the actual game: the worse part is the very bugged quest waypoints, you often get two pointing in different directions and they'll sometimes be both wrong, leaving you stranded\n\n-the lack of any kind of map/ minimap makes traveling a frustrating experience in a world that basically looks the same all over: coupled with the aforementioned bugged waypoints it becomes even worse\n\n-poor quest design, the only one I got was a delivery to another castle and basically amounted to running through the barren world, going near the castle and clicking a button to deliver a letter...I didn't even have to enter said castle (in fact you can clip inside but it's empty) or talk to an NPC\n\n-no way to change key bindings, if you also forget the initial tutorial (three quick pages referring to the various controls) you have no way to find out how to do something since there's no help page\n\n-last but not least there seems to be proof regarding the dev acting in a very  unprofessional way ( http://www.l45ltd.co.uk/developer-blog/a-seriously-infectious-situation )\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=519625369\n\nBlood of Old was a pretty appalling experience, my first time with the game it simply didn't work enough (see the bugged waypoint section) and I had no way to actually get where I was supposed to thus forcing me to restart. Even when it works its production values are so low to make it look like something from 15 years ago and, even worse, it lacks any kind of engaging gameplay since all you can do is stumble blindly into an empty world, fighting clone after clone with a dull and exploitable combat system while gathering the plethora of apples and gold scattered around.\n\nThe lack of any polish and horrible bugs are the final nail in the coffin: this might be an alpha and thus subject to change but the dev is asking for your money now and this is simply not worth the asking price, not even on an huge sale.

However, this game is too early into development for me to recommend even putting on Steam. This should've instead been used as a free early access demo until (IF) the game is finished for release. I got a free code, and I'm hoping 100% of people who own this did too. Let me elaborate, by using fair and honest criticisms:\n\n-Very buggy. 1) When I open the controls option to view the controls, the box is all blacked out. Whenever I click the "return to menu" option, my character just swings his sword. The menu won't close, but the game will still be in motion. 2) When changing the quality, everything turns white and therefore, the menu unreadable to change back. 3) A faded text came up that says "Press E to pick up," but nothing happened. I also pressed F to make sure it didn't actually say F, but still nothing happened.\n-Textures look alright, but it has an unfinished look to it - leading to my earlier statement that this is too early to serve as an early access game.\n-When you walk sideways, your character just drifts. They don't even move their legs.\n-Slow, laggy mess.\n-Currently, the dev is trying to make money from Greenlighting ANOTHER "game" of his. This will NEVER get finished, and he'll be laughing in your face as you spend money on his unfinished junk.\n-I actually can't say what I want to right here, or I'll get sued for "defaming."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lagreskul/recommended/382240/","lagreskul","Lagreskul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lagreskul/","134 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI worry about the well-fare of developers like this. I can understand your dream, you 19 year old, you, but at this point I feel like flat-out development is beyond reach for you. I don't mean to not keep trying, but maybe consider getting better before you release something for real money on the market.\n\nAs for the rest of you, and the developer, I suppose, if he reads through this, this is my experience with the game:\n\nI spawned in a jail-cell without context. It looked... meh, about on par with a vanilla, original release, Mount and Blade. I worked through it, finding, to my surprise that everything worked, with some minor inconveneince as I discovered that chains came with a forcefield. No worries, I suppose that it *is* in an alpha build, and collision boxes will possibly be refined.\n\nSo, once out of that, I immediately began grabbing all of the things, which is where things began going wrong, the ability to pick things up breaking after a moment and never being able to be used again with exception to the rusty sword and shield.\n\nI was then engaged in intense, mortal combat with the nearest enemy, and at first, I thought I couldn't attack, possibly because I was out of stamina, which never seems to regenerate. However, it was just that the animation for attacks rarely plays, and I was actually doing damage- sometimes. Anyway, I ran around the camp, the enemy not able to deal with my combat prowress as it chased after me, and, finding it empty, I ran on to the first location.\n\nWhile exploring the land, I found the following wonders:\n\n1) A pig model with no pig AI\n2) A completely empty village\n3) Armies of clones of a man who seemed to enjoy wearing a  skull\n4) A pond that allowed any mortal man to ascend to the level of Jesus, and walk upon it's pure, blue, surfaces\n5) A deer that can do the same\n6) Sudden day-night cycles, with night doing nothing to change the ambient light levels, and lasting a fraction of the the day.\n\nSo, I finally reached our first objective, the walled city of Completely-forgettable, and proceeded to do the following things:\n\n1) Push the horse cart around, because it's model is apparently not fixed and you can just push it around as muchas you want\n2) Hire an underling to discover that the command system does not work.\n3) Talk to the commander, get a new mission, and proceed out\n4) Decide to use the cart-horse to try and find a closer location to the new objective, get teleported inside a building model with no doors, and quit momentarily.\n\nReturning with a glass of milk and increased determination, I tried again. This time, I didn't let those roving bands of bandits stand for... standing there and attacking bystanders(!) and engaged in combat with them! I quickly found myself standing upon my enemy's shoulders, slashing at him, and him at me, and, unfortunately, quickly fell. The following proceeded to happen:\n\n1) I reloaded my last save game, however, the objective marker was now moving in an inversely proportional direction and behavior to the mouse cursor.\n2) A second music track began playing on top of the other.\n3) Mouse became unfixed, and the hotkey to fix it stopped working.\n4) Could no longer interact with any civillian NPCs\n5) Bandits refused to chase. They could attack, but as far as taking a step is concerned, they were done with that.\n\nSo, broken, boring, and ugly. Don't buy this. Sorry, dev, but, as I assume, this is probably your first game, and you should really work to make something better than this.","February 7","false","0.6"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

I was like "k" and joined it. First giveaway I won something. I won this. I am happy to say that I won it and did not actually have to pay for it. After I won it a few days ago I never played it. Until today. I installed it and decided to give it a go, my friend said it was terrible but I thought it cant be all that bad.\n\nCHAPTER ONE - START UP/LOADING:\nI start up the game, I understand its an indie game hence the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ start up screen. I look past that and continue to get to the actual game. I am extremely happy as it runs very well at an amazing 375fps... on the loading screen.\n\nCHAPTER TWO - FIRST IMPRESSIONS:\n♥♥♥♥. Nah but seriously its on medium settings and looks worse than Minecraft and I am getting 12fps (Minecraft gets 100fps) So I put it on lowest settings which only gets me 30fps (It looks worse than a game I made for my ICT assignment at school using that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "Alice" game making thingy which was a Shrek game that ran at 60fps)\n\nCHAPTER THREE - GAMEPLAY:\nAwww mate fill up that box of popcorn this is the biggest and juciest part of the review (which feels more like an essay to me) So I spawn in the game. First thing I notice is I'm in a prison cell. ♥♥♥♥. I look at the roof and see its like half-built. There is literally 2 ♥♥♥♥ing gaps in the roof that were not filled it. I spend a good few minutes finding the key for the cell (because thats where all keys are kept... inside the cell?) Found a ♥♥♥♥-ton of apples and barrels and eventually found the key... (it was invisible 10/10 key finding simulator) I leave the cell and look at the barrels. Cool more ♥♥♥♥ing apples and a few coins. (Review in a nutshell: Game is bad, needs more apples) I try to figure out how I escape this huge camp with a prison containing a single cell. I find some creepy dudes with skeleton masks that chase me around the camp. I didn't know I could sprint at the time so I just walked. The creepy dudes were literally inside me chasing me but unable to hit me because I was 3fast5them (slow as ♥♥♥♥) I jump on top of the dudes and they can hit me so i jump on top of the barrels from earlier and they cannot harm me (Begins singing "MC Hammer - U Can't Touch This") After a couple minutes of jumping on houses and barrels (By the way the jumping animation is ♥♥♥♥. The actual jumping movement doesnt play until you have already "jumped") and finding more apples I get away from those skull dudes and find my way out of the camp. Even though I did not complete the objective (To find a weapon) the game didnt mind and let me continue to the next objective... without a weapon. So I chase after this pig boar thingy not knowing what the ♥♥♥♥ to do about the fact that I would have to walk 2km to the next objective.\n\nCHAPTER 4 - GAME'S ENDING\nNever got to it. (lol does it even have an ending?) The game just freezes and I cant do anything so I restart it and decide to do the review. So here I am, spending nearly an hour of my sad life writing this review.\n\nChapter 8 - What I r8 out of 8?\nYea I know I skipped 3 chapters but ♥♥♥♥ it I wanted to make that gr8 joke.\nI r8 5/7 its not that gr8. I didn't r8 out of 8 because I felt rebellious today.\n\nChapter 9 - PROS\nAlright, I'm sorry. I sound like an ungrateful ♥♥♥♥. After all I won this game and this entire review has been nothing but giving ♥♥♥♥ to the creators. So lets look at the PROS shall we?\n1 - Has apples (needs more apples)\n2 - Like skyrim (not like skyrim)\n3 - Great jumping animation (not gr8. just b8)\n4 - Can crash (not good)\n5- Easy uninstallation!\n\nChapter 10 - CONS\n1 - ....needs more dragons?\n\nConclusion:\nAlright at the end of the day the game is an indie game and might even be the creators first real game so I will give some credit and +rep for trying. Maybe with a bit more time (a lot more time) and a bit more work (a lot more work) this could become a half decent game. I hope this review helps you decide if you want it or not. If I were you, I would totally buy this as it is fun to review and point out its flaws. Yes, I am literally being a bully to this game. Welcome to the harsh reality, were people have opinions. Anyway thats all I got for now, I got more fun ♥♥♥♥ to play like club penguin and hell maybe even moshi monsters.\n\nWord Count: 908\n\nTime spent writing: 45 Minutes (not really an hour but.... ♥♥♥♥ you.)\n\nWorth Buying? Yea, if you want to become slowly depressed and most likely eventually commit suicide. No not worth it at all. Would be great if it was a free game instead. I guess I am being pretty critcal but you gotta expect that stuff when making games.","December 22, 2015","false","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","3","5","4","0"

Brilliant isn't it! Think that should explain the whole game and make you not even look at it but I'll tell you some more. The game starts in a prison, you're locked in and the key is in your cell. Your character basically locked himself in. You get out of the prison, you're in a bandit camp. All your loot is apples and random gold scattered around on barrels and benches. It takes ages to pick up something. To fill your hunger you eat apples. You use the money to recruit people to fight on your side or to buy your own weapon. You can't really buy weapons because you don't have enough money but the option is there to F you in the head more. And that's it game over. The only thing that changed from year ago is the graphics became even more terrible then it were before. Some houses look different and that's it, everything else is the same. If you do just that as a developer in one year don't even bother making a video game.","September 26, 2015","false","4.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The combat is horrid, my follower and the guards they kept killing would literally sit still and not move, there are two waypoints for quests (one of them being wrong for some reason), A limited number of apples, the mechanics for interactions itself was a pain in the butt to use, and it is all around not a very well made game, even considering it is in alpha.

I had a hell of a lot of respect for them. But that changed.\n\nLINK TO AN IMPORTANT SCREENSHOT[imgur.com]\nOriginally posted by AndrewWatt96:"do some research how can you get the impression that this is a finnished game when there is about 900 warning that say "in dvelopment" and "early access", yes 100% complete... great intelligence skills you have there...."Yes the dev said this in that screenshot\n\nDespite the game being what it is I wanted to give the dev support. But this is unacceptable. I will no longer be supporting this game or the developer. I will not stand for butthurt devs who can't handle\n\n•Don't buy the game.\n•Don't play the game.\n•Don't activate your free key.\n•Don't support Devs like this.\n\nEDIT: Don't get me wrong there is a strong potential for this game in my opinion. It's just I don't agree with the actions the dev took out a fit of anger. The user who uploaded the screenshot of the game didn't get a free key for the game, they paid with hard earned money to get it and more than most of us deserves to critisize it.  There needs to be a formal apology and the screen shot shouldn't had been taken down.\nThis game is just not ready for early access let alone steam. I think it would do the Dev good to take this down, work on it more, and re-release it under a new name to give it a fresh start. Because I seriously doubt the game will get any good rep once it's finally done under this name and steam listing.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n36 out of 50 people found my original positive review helpful (72%)\n"This game is in very early stages of development, things will be broken, things will be added some things may be removed or changed. Please DO NOT buy or play this game unless you fully understand this and wish to be active in development of the game! " -warning in the discription of game\n\nYou might be asking why I'm giving this game a positive review with the state it's currently in. It's quite simple that I don't believe this game deserves the hate it's getting. This is a green light game that was pushed out because of demand and was slabbed a "Early Access: onto it. The game just is not close [at all] to being a finished product. And that's that. There are some really wonderful ideas for the game and the Dev is trying hard to make this game the best it can be and is listening to the players about problems and the like. It is not that often you see that on steam anymore and I really think that alone warrents a 'Yes' from me.\nI suck at serious reviews.","February 11","false","4.0"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","24","31","5","14"

Sometimes I asked a friend to test it out.\n\nMy game was never finished, not even close. I created 4 or 5 hours of content, I had plans for at least 50. My game never was uploaded on the Internet for people to download for free, it was not worth it. It was a personnal project just for fun.\n\nI think my game was 100 times better than Blood of Old.

I decided to put all that behind me and just play without that bias like the dev seemed to want and see what it was all about.\n\nSo I spawn in, the menus are pretty blocky and unpolished, forgivable since this is an early access game.\nI spawn into the game, there is a short and quite intrusive button tutorial. Once I got past that I started to see what people were saying.\n\nFirst it finding quest items would be easier if it gave you a general direction of where to find them (specifically the weapon)\n\nThe game felt kind of slugish moving around but again this is early access so I am expecting all of these things to get better (hopefully)\n\nTrying to find the weapon took a while since it is off to the side from where you come out and not where the path leads you.\n\nEnemies then started to chase me, and by that I mean they ran a bit, got stuck on nothing until i moved to another side of them and then they started running again.\n\nThey also attacked once and then ran in place at me while I was standing still.\n\nI went in search of the weapon after that and tried to pick up some gold on the way which had the "press e to pick up" over them but I could not do so.\n\nI finally found the weapon and shield (while i was being attacked already and went to equip them. The game does not pause when you go into the menus nor is there a way to fast equip things, you have to go to the inventory, click on the weapon, click equip and then exit the menu. And by that I mean do NOT press esc or else you will bring up the main menu (still no pause) behind the inventory screen. You have to press I again or you cannot get out of it.\n\nI took some damage and eventually got my weapon and shield equipped. I tried to attack, did so once and then my character refused to attack again. The shield went up but only blocked once and then did nothing. Though since the enemies stopped attacking this did not matter.\n\nSo the game was pretty much unplayable at this point so I had to quit.\n\nWhat I really want to say on this game is that it should probably be taken down and worked on until there is something playable before it goes back up or else it will be one of the worst rated games on here.\n\nTo the developer I want to say stop taking all the criticism in the way of lashing back out at the people who are trying to play your game. LISTEN to the people and work on your game to make it better. Make it the way you want it to be seen.\n\nThis game has a good concept and lots of potential. I just hope the developer can realize that it is broken and needs to be fixed and work on it because this game could be great.\n\nAs of right now it is pretty much unplayable. Please stop pouring salt into your wound in the comments and show people that your game is good by working on making it good!","November 14, 2015","false","4.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

It's a pretty hilarious game though to be honest, I would definitely recommend it as a game to Ƒuck around with if you're bored with friends and only if you get it for free. For me alone, I got a really good laugh out of it and because it was free for me, I definitely thought it was worth my time. I was laughing non-stop. At the ṡhitty graphics. At the terrible controls and how difficult it is to interact with anything in the entire 'vast' world. The enemies are horrendously programmed and glitch and I moonwalked all over them and jumped on top of clans of bandits.\n\nThe world is pretty small but fun to run around in and look at the stupid ṡhit that's all over. The movement is very slow and amusing in some situations. (Like to climb up some steps that lead to some useless balcony in a mine, you have to jump up the steps like four at a time. It's things like this that made the game so quirky) The combat is very clunky and not fluid at all. Every hit feels like you're tied to a ball and chain stuck on the bottom level of an ocean. Another noteworthy mention of the game is a hilarious event that occured. There is a strange house in the middle of nowhere with what seems to be a prison door to a moderately sized house and once entered you just kind of teleport to the bottom of some mining area. Good lightning and some creepy sounds down there as well as finding motherƒucking 50 APPLES! in one chest make for another ƒucking hilarious experience.\n\nThe music is actually decent considering how bad the rest of the game is. A lot of the NPCs and models look pretty funny. More good things to laugh at. Also you can pick dozens and dozens of apples for some reason. Like.. they're everywhere. I saw others were leaving it running just for the trading cards as well as a few of my friends and after seeing it I could tell it was one of those games (kind of like those movies) where it's so bad it's kind of funny and that's what I personally think of this game.\n\nIt's like a hour of a free comedy movie better than most I see now adays. I definitely would not recommend buying it to support it for it's after-alpha stage as I'm sure almost anyone can see this is and will stay a piece of garbage. I suppose though it's comedic value pays off your time if you can get the game for free. Overall, I found it an enjoyable hilariously terrrible experience.","December 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","12","14","3","0"

Who needs another medieval combat game? The first quest I get is to run a really REALLY long way. I didn't even bother to do it. I've seen many games in early development that show promise but I'm going to have to say that this one doesn't look like it's going anywhere. There are just far too many games out there that most people would rather play. I think it really lacks creativity and fluidity. It seems as if the developers are just trying to get some practice with their skills instead of developing an actual game. Sorry, it's a no from me.","January 9","false","10.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Just bare with me and read it. Also, AndrewWatt96, please read this review at your sake.\n\nOne of the most sincere forms of respect is actually listening to what another has to say.\n-Bryant H. McGill\n\nDev, think about his quote.\n\nIntroduction\nI got this game through a giveaway. My first thoughts were that this would be some clone of Ravensword or Morrowind or some generic RPG that I would play to cut time. But what I saw and experienced... I went catatonic. I am going to be very straightfoward with you, this game is bad, simply broken. So bad that it should be removed from Steam Greenlight. But enough of opinions, let's jump to the facts.\n\nStory\nWell... I would rate the Story section... if there was one. I think it will going to be a storyline, or at least, I hope that. Basically, you start in a jail and you have to make your way out of the bandit outpost. Sounds difficult eh? Well, it could have been more difficult if someone did not forget to drop the key to open the cell INSIDE the cell. After that you find some rusty armor and a sword and you make your way to the next village where you meet "the commander" to give you certain tasks. I really wish I could say anything more about the story but my game simply crashes after that.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics it self are not that bad! There is a lot of potencial. But everything is extremely buggy. And the lack of perfecionism is evident: you can see inside houses, there's too much grass in the hills/ground which is what makes the game with low fps's. Peaseants/Knights have different height's, some are smaller than the player, some are the same height as the player, some are a bit bigger ( I don't know if this was made in purpose, but if it was, well spotted dev).\nMenus are an abortion. Sorry for the term but Menu's like Inventory menu or Main Menu seems something tha tgot out from one of those old flash games that you played in newgrounds.\nThere is a lot of things to point out related to graphics but i won't point out because my dog just destroyed my notes. Fo'real.\n\nGameplay\nGameplay is broken. You can't attack, your jump is clumsy, running will outperform any bandit. Try to jump and then run and you are back to some Super Mario classic. There is a inventory and stuff but they are merely simbolic because you will only going to use once or twice. At least you can block and buy/sell weapons...\n\nMusic\nIt's just one or two musics in a loop.\n\nOverall\nThis game is broken. Does not worth 7€ even in the Early Access phase. There were made crytical mistakes by the dev and it resulted in a very bad image problem.  This can potencially destroy your rep, dev. If you go on with this you will be know has the guy who has a steam account and made the wrost game ever on steam. The game must be re-done. Everything. Please, dev, add me so we can discuss the game image problem and maybe we can solve it out. Before is too late.\n\nSince this is a Early Access Game I will not score this game since is not yet finished. :)\n","November 7, 2015","false","4.7"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","16","23","0","0"

I launched the game and it warned for being "early in development" so I was like I'll keep that in mind while trying. Now immediately in the game I noticed the game runs on low fps, you couldn't pick items half the times, text goes on top of text covering it... it has a lot of bugs. This game being so undone shouldn't be handed out even as a demo, let alone be sold. The "early" message doesn't justify this at all.

The combat is... awkward. The third person perspective is terrible because of how the camera acts. the cursor is off, so to hit anything you have to stand sideways. Grabbing items off of barrels is  uh.. ."fun".  If you go to certain parts of the map while mounted, you'll climb up the invisible wall, which makes it easy to just fly over enemies, to save on the tedium of fighting them. There appears to be only one type of enemy in this game. After the ingame "tutorial" the only way to see the controls is to either delete your game, or reload the entire game. The music is ok I guess. The inventory is terrible. I got this for free, but I wouldn't recommend anyone getting it.

Not everyone of them, but most of them. (The first Slender game ever relased was actually well made, by a team of people, with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Slenderman, but that was okay)\n\nI started the game by noticing that the crosshair was utterly useless: to grab the key I had to look random on the floor, because even if I was aiming it, I couldn't take it.\n\nSprint animations starts, if you just press Shift and stay still. Running in place.\n\nJumping animation? Unexistant.\n\nNo sounds for the steps, or the ambient, just three or four music repeating everytime.\n\nVery very empty map, and low variety buildings, apart from a castle that you can't even enter in.\n\nI can choose a 1920 x 1080 resolution in the in-game options, even though I have a 1366 x 768 resolution. (Which doesn't make any ♥♥♥♥ing sense)\n\nTrying to actually buy a horse, without the money for it, will glitch the audio of the game, for some seconds.\n\nTexture flickering on, houses, wood barriers.\n\nIf I try to stick to a horse, and then jump, the horse will jump together with me.\n\nThe water is just a texture visible on just one side of the river: If you're outside you see it (Static); if you're under water, it's like moving normally, you can see the sky by looking up, and no swimming animation..? (I don't know if that's a thing)\n\nBad positioning of the buildings on the terrain.\n\nSometimes, floating barrels. Just, floating barrels. But just some of them.\n\nVERY VERY BAD attack mechanics. I could play with one hand: Hold shield button, hold attack button, while randomly moving the mouse on the screen, because you're supposed to do certain movements and attack, like swinging your mouse as the trajectory of the attack in the game, in order to hurt someone.\n\nApples are everywhere, and if I'm quick enough, I can spam E button to grab "an" apple and until it vanishes, I can get even more than one apple, by just spamming one button: I will never be hungry.\n\nAnd it doesn't even last much.. 30 minutes.\n\nI might have forgotten something, the time I'm reviewing this isn't really early.\n\n-It's an alpha; It's made from one person; I could accept it, if the game wouldn't cost 6.99 euros. Unturned is made by one person, and it's free, but it's good. This, is not. The alpha I'm reviewing, isn't.","August 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","1"

You can`t ban people because they give you bad reviews no matter what. It`s childish and pathetic to believe that you get more bad reviews only because you gave away your game for free. Newsflash for you: at the moment your game is garbage. Put some work in the combat system, AI, overhaul the graphic design of the game, and try to put in place a story for the world you created. Without a story this game is pointless.\n\nPS: I do not recomend buying the game for the cards.

It is playable, but it is very rough around the edges.\n\nOn my first playthrough, I managed to escape the first room, immediately provoke an enemy while looking for a supposedly nearby sword, stare longingly at several piles of apples and coins that could not be picked up, die, and then (adding insult to injury) had my game crash completely while trying to reload.\n\nMy second attempt is going much better so far. The items loaded correctly and are interactable, I found a sword, and I proceeded to defeat exactly one enemy before walking to the first city and meeting the commander. (And of course I beelined straight for him instead of following the road, which put me on the wrong side of the castle. It was a 10-minute detour to slowly walk around the exterior looking for an entrance.)\n\nThere I picked up my first real quest - delivering a letter. Being sick of making molasses look like a marathon sprinter, I decided to check out faster transportation options. Well, I was 400G short of affording my own horse, and the built-in horse taxi service only goes to hubs of bustling activity, so it was more slow walking. Joy.\n\nI am now making my way back to the commander for a new assignment...\n\nCons:\n- The camera zoom cannot be adjusted, and the controls cannot be remapped.\n- The game does not pause combat when in a menu, so good luck trying to eat or equip anything while under attack.\n- There is a hunger meter. You know, in case instant death via troll guys isn't enough for you.\n- Speaking of troll guys... The enemies are clumped together, so your options are fight a pack of 12 (not happening), or avoid them completely. (So far, though, I haven't seen any real incentive or benefit to engaging in melee.)\n- The attack controls do not actually work as advertised. Right clicking does bring up your shield, but left clicking does nothing. Instead, just run forward into an enemy and they take damage (assuming they don't block every attack). Think Virtual Hydlide aesthetics with original Hydlide mechanics.\n\nGlitches:\n- If you jump excessively during battle, you can glitch yourself on top of the enemy's shoulders, thereby preventing him from dealing you damage.\n- In order to click on the "Deliver Letter" text box to complete the first quest, I needed to first open the inventory menu. That freed control of the mouse.\n\nPros:\n- The music is pretty outstanding.\n- The overall design aesthetic isn't bad. I like the statue in the center of the first castle, and I appreciate the little details such as the painting on the armor.\n- I really dig the day-night cycles. It's a nice touch.\n- When you pick up a quest, a directional notification beacon pops up with the number of steps required to reach your goal. If you move towards your objective, the steps count down, and if you move away, the steps increase accordingly. Since there is no overworld map of the game, this feature allows you to freely explore without fear of getting hopelessly lost.\n- Bringing up the inventory menu does seem to pause the hunger meter, so you won't die while standing around in a safe place.\n- You can save anywhere.\n\nHonestly, it's not terrible, but it's not really all that fun either. As one person's passion project, I can applaud the dev for everything he's accomplished, but I can't really say it's a game I would recommend to anyone yet. It's clunky, and buggy, and doesn't really offer much innovation (I mean, unless you were really jonesing for an apple collection simulator).\n\nThe only reason I could even begin to justify the price would be as encouragement for the dev to keep working on it.","December 13, 2015","false","3.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

This game shows massive potential, but sadly it has such a poorly funded developer, I feel as if it may never live up to that potential.\nThe combat of this game feels slow and just feels dragging your cursor across the screen.\nThe world has the potential to be great, but sadly just feels empty.\nWater is just a blue texture that you can pass through.\nThe looting system is weird because it feels as if I can't actually pick something up or using anything.\nTheres no real customization with your character, every bit of armor and every new weapon just looks the same.\nThe eating sounds just horrify me.\nOverall this game can be amazing, but in its current state, its not worth your money, unless its on sale.\nIf the owner sees this, try and see if a small scale indie compant will help you out, as this game can be quite amazing with proper funding and a good development team.","September 7, 2015","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

I can’t remember having paid for it (Thank Cthulhu!)\n\nNote: I didn’t manage to play this game for the reasons below. That means that I couldn’t progress much let alone completing it. I gave up after an hour and a half of honest tries to get to the first major quest.\nI tried both (opposite) directions the quest marker pointed towards and ended up frustrated because the invisible walls that blocked me to get to my goal. Then I died … somehow.\n\nSo this game has some huge technical issues:\n-	Day and night switch within seconds. Or meters. I am not quite sure what triggers the changing.\n-	Moving doesn’t work: sometimes I get stuck running mode without doing anything.\n-	- Oh – I walked on an enemy once. Good times …\n-	Combat doesn’t work. My character refuses to swing his sword – unless when there are no enemies around. Than he cuts through the air like a pro.\n-	Picking up items works barely. It’s almost pure luck to get what one aims for.\n-	There’s no problem with the graphics being bad. It’s indie and early access after all. But the graphics are glitch all over the place.\n-	The invisible walls: they are literally everywhere. Everywhere. I couldn’t proceed in the game although trying hard because of them. Hell, I even couldn’t move on the map properly because of them. They are game breaking.\n-	Once parts of the menu have been opened, they can’t be closed again. Game breaking again: Never ever open the “controls” part. Don’t do it. EVER!\n\nAfter the technical issues, let’s look at the game itself:\n\n-	The music: I thought within the first few minutes that it is surprisingly good. Almost moody. Than it started to bother me as the only two tracks were just the same 40 or so seconds of music looping and looping and looping and looping and – you get the idea.\n-	I like to model my character. Unfortunately, there’s no such option.\n-	I like story in games. Unfortunately, there is no.\n-	I like beautiful or at least somehow interesting environments. There are no. just grass and hills and grey stuff that might be roads (I guess?). Unfortunately.\n\nThis can’t be considered an early access game. It is not ready for early access or any public in the first place. It is not even a tech demo or anything of this sort. It is just a broken piece of software.\n","November 10, 2015","false","5.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Unplayable. I'm crying in pain for those who paid 7€ for this piece of sh*t.\nIn the description of the game, says: "Blood of Old, Indie , RPG, First person, Strategy, with an in depth story line."\nLet's analyze that:\n- Indie game: If you can call that a game, it's indie, yes\n- RPG: The rol play in this game is picking apples and run, you can't do a sh*t, you can't even attack without a weapon, and in 16 hours in the game, I didn't find a single one.\n- First person: Ok, you can play in first person, but that makes the game worst in my opinion.\n- Strategy: Tons of strategy walking on a direction without nothing to do but picking apples and run from the pathetic IA.\n- In depth story line: WHAT? IN DEPTH STORY LINE? MINECRAFT AND IMVU GOT SOLID AND GOOD STORY LINE COMPARED TO THIS. Seriosly, calling this an storyline is calling a turd a diamond. You appear in the middle of nowhere, without a single cutscene or text who explains why are you caged in that village, then you run out of the village and there you go, you have to walk for like 30 minutes to reach a town and do more nonsense things.\n\nSeriously, don't you dare to suffer this game. I got it for free, but wow, developers, sell this game for 7€, this isn't even pre-alpha. You deserve the worst hell tortures.\n\nAnd when I try to quit the game, MY COMPUTER CRASHED.

Peasants, guards, bad guys.\n- Remember, invisible walls are a big NO NO in these games.\n\nAnimation:\n- The player and NPCs look like mannequins when they are standing still.\n- Animals need a better animation as they look like running in ice.\n\nWhat this game needs:\n+ A good story. (This game can't go with the same premise as Skyrim of do what you want and complete missions. It needs something else to be good.)\n+ A map. (It's easy to get lost in this huge world.)\n+ More weapons. (Bow and arrows, spears, etc.)\n+ Multiplayer. (It will bring more players.)\n+ Give players the chance to Mod it. (Bethesda knows well.)\n+ A lot more work. (Give time to yourselves to make of this game something good devs, don't let me down.)\n\nOther thoughts:\nI keep comparing this game with Skyrim becouse it looks like it wants to be compared with Skyrim, and this is a huge mistake, you have to change that.\nAnyways I think this game has potential and something good can come out of it if you just listen to those who know what they are talking about.\n\n","November 2, 2015","true","2.3"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","19","42","0","2"

The first thing that really sold me about this game was the combat, as when you attempt to hit the bad guy with your sword, it simply does not work. I noticed as I attempted to use my weapon, that my stamina bar was empty, but as I tried staying still to refill it, nothing would work.\n\nAt this point I realized the true essence of this game, something that elevates it far above the competition.\n\nThe character you play as is not another straight white cis male power fantasy, but rather an asthmatic femboy dragonkin.\n\nThis opened up a whole new world of possibility to me, as I was playing a character that I can truly relate to. My enemy, realizing that we weren't so different, decided that we could make peace and simply look at eachother for an extended period of time before I walked off into the invisible walls and up into the sky before dying of hunger.\n\nI can't wait to see the full version, as this is already a masterpiece worthy of praise.","January 5","true","4.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","36","5","14","7","0"

You only are able to swing a sword twice in the entire game, as your stamina depletes near instantly and never replenishes. Jumping animations are FAR inaccurate, especially while spamming the jump button. It is fun to jump on enemies to death or even to watch your character "jump" up a near straight mountain in seconds! While I do not recommend anyone to spend real money on this game, should you get the chance to try it out for free- ABSOLUTELY TRY IT! I was left laughing at just how terrible it is.

The soundtrack is amazing, the combat is tough but not rage inducing, the scenary is amazing and is just jaw dropping. I felt so immersed like I was actually in this far off land delivering a letter, trying to pick up apples with my stubs for arms. I also managed to find a glitch that revealed the story to me. You, the protaganist, are actually Jesus and have arrived in this realm to stay save it from the darkness consuming it. All the animals in the game may seem ordinary but are actually angels watching over you as you continue on your quest to either save or help destory the world and all who live in it.

If the DEV does dollow through and finish this game, ill be glad I was in on alpha.\n\n","February 13","true","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","1"

This question has been inside my head, thriving and distracting, ever since I first experienced Blood of Old.\n\nIt is a delicate, painstaking idea of a process that has intimidated and belittled me for the past week or two. I sit at my PC, but before I can even begin to type, a loud, wet-sounding voice in the base of my skull reminds me that I am not worthy and I never will be. Discouraged, alone and unwanted, I drink myself to sleep and hope that tomorrow I awake as a new person, one capable of successfully tackling this challenge, this feat, this impossible task. This has been my nightly routine since Thanksgiving, the day a download code for the game mysteriously came packaged with my new body pillow.\n\nNow I am a man anew. The New Year has arrived, and with it, it has bought a new feeling of capability and determination. Scotch in hand, one-handed ergonomic keyboard in the other, I have no doubt in my mind that I can at least make an attempt to describe Blood of Old.\n\nBlood of Old is not a game about knights. It is not a game about combat, a game about monsters, a game about gold. I can not stress that enough, Blood of Old is not a game about gold. Blood of Old is a game about you. You, the player. I, the player. We; Us. Us all. Them. All of us. Every person. Human kind. We, the players. You and I, everyone you know. Everyone I know. The collective "We." Long after every one of us is dead, it will be about all the people that are still alive. We. These are the things this game is about, and man alive is it clear.\n\nIn the same way that Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew drew from all past television, added a heaping spoonful of originality, and created the definitively perfect television show, and in the same way that Bossypants by Tina Fey both blurred the edges of "genres" as a concept in literature and created something wholly fantastical and awe-inspiring, Blood of Old has entered stage left and immediately summated all of what makes computer games such a serious and beautiful art form, while at the same time feeling completely new and fresh.\n\nPlease visit myspace.com to see the rest of the review!!

Hard to pick up items, and actions are slow.\n\nI won't deny the fact that this game needs a lot of work doing to it, but since it's early release that it to be expected.\nThis is where I tell you that Blood of Old 'has potential', but it does.\n\nI'd like to see different attack animations and a variation is responses from enemies.\n\nMarket price is a steap for the quality but considering I got this game for free the least I could do was play and leave an honest review.","November 25, 2015","true","4.9"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

I think this game has potential. I can recommend it as a early access beta test, but I don't recommend it if you're looking for something spectacular.\n(Many companies are using the term alpha, even though alpha is supposed to be when the game developers and employees are testing the game. Beta is when the public is testing it)\n\n\nI made it to the first town, grabbed my "deliver the letter quest" then died when fighting 3 bandits.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat is much better than previous to. Though it still suffers from feeling unresponsive.\nThe animations don't feel fluid and often don't complete (or start), so it's hard to tell if you're actually doing anything.\n\nEnemy AI:\nVery simplistic. They attempt to go around objects and other people to get to you. When dealing with multiple enemies, they will kill each other as they slash wildly at you. It's often easier to just keep your shield up and let them kill each other.\n\nHUD:\nNeeds much improvement.\nI can let a poor HUD slide, but it definetely needs to be upgraded a bit before launch.\nRight-clicking an item should use it automatically.\nYou need to be able to change your keybindings, or at least see them after the tutorial.\nIs there a first person mode?\nThe reticle doesn't line up with what you're trying to pick up. It's like there's an invisible reticle somewhere in front of your avatar.\nWindow mode has the mouse going too far outside of the borders of the game, so when I clicked, I clicked the border of the window. Which caused my mouse cursor to appear in-game. You should have some form of re-hide mouse cursor while in-game.\n\nGraphics:\nPoor quality, but who cares if the gameplay is good. (Mount and Blade)\nBut... the animations were very laggy, and would often stop mid-way.\nDefinitely needs some work there. I couldn't tell if I was hitting the enemy, or the enemy was hitting me. I just saw blood splatter and would hear grunts. Some body movement confirmation would be nice.\n\nStory:\nIf there is one... I really didn't play that long.","August 9, 2015","true","4.9"," 17 of 40 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","17","40","4","0"

Picking up items. Many times i have had the problem of not being able to pickup items like money and apples.\n2. The Chests. I have seen many chests in the game, but there are a major problem. There are never anything in them. I would recommend you to make the chests have a bigger chance of holding something, i have opened many chests and so far i have only gained something two times. Maybe try to make it so that there are a reason to open the chests like instead of nothing make it hold like 5 apples or something. It dosent matter how much, what matters is that you get something for it.\n3. Horses. I tried to buy a horse in the first town, i had 910 gold and then i thought about buying a horse. As i got to one of the horses i pressed e and moved my cursor over the buy button and i heard an ear piersing sound from it and after that i thougt i had the horse but i hadnt i  checked my inventory to see if i had my gold and no i had 410 now. So what happened was that i basically lost 500 gold on nothing and then i tried to press it again and the same thing happened. My gold got decreased by 500 andi got a bit annoyed and spammed the button until i had -14410 gold. I am just gonna say it. FIX THE DAMN HORSES.\nAnd 4. Fast Travel. This is just a small bug. After i had a minus on alot of gold i walked over to the horse that werent with the other and found out that it was for fast travelling. I thought that i should go to another castle, so i chose Korate and as i did i got stuck in a house that you can't exit.\nAnd that is all. Else it is good nothing that is a big problem.\nThat is all i can say for now. Keep up the good work and i hope it will be a great game later on.","October 21, 2015","true","1.4"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Thanks game!\n\n\nIn all seriousness though. The game in its current state isn't too great. There are glaring problems with the game. Even through this though, I like the game. Not the game itself (Yet). I like the devs. The devs are working very hard to make this the game it wants deserves to be. The game has a good core, but isn't quite finished (Obviously). I feel like this is an embryo: Sure, it looks ugly and useless now, but it will grow into a strong and beautiful thing. So yeah, I dont think the game is good in its current state, as I believe the devs feel that way too.

During such events I fought one guy, getting a little motion sick as I did.  I hit an invisible wall in route to town, Bearglove or something.  Then noticed that there were two waypoint markers directing me in two different directions.  So I opted for the one that was behind me, made it to the town and found the Commander as per my mission.  I asked him for a job, he offered me one, and I told him I couldn't right now.  Fin.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs up because of promise.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JEBtheGamer1/recommended/382240/","JEBtheGamer1","Jeb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JEBtheGamer1/","86 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis review states what is in the game as of June 25th, 2015 and is outdated. The game has changed since then.	However, the edit to the TL;DR was made Feb 7th 2016\n\nI have little playtime, but what I've seen has amazing potential.  Right off the bat, the menu screens are well polished (for an alpha, and I'm sure it will be beautiful when the game is finished), and they have amazing music. It is very driving. Now, since the game is very early in development, is is poorly optimized, and may tank some systems. The gameplay itsself is hardly riveting. Keep in mind that it is currently more a tech demo than a full game. There is currently no story, just tasks. I have little experience with combat, but from what I have seen it will be nice. The sounds are in place, but enemies don't do damage. A small issue I have with the combat is that your enemies and you can clip through each other, making combat difficult as you can easily get flanked.\n\nSome bugs/Glitches   (for the devs)\nCombat, as said earlier,\nThe crosshairs. It's not where your character is looking,\nCamera angle. This ties in with the crosshairs, and it makes it difficult to see sometimes.\nPros and cons  Pros\n+ Good sounds\n+ Active devs and community\nCons\n- Placeholder graphics\n- Poor camera\n- Sword and shields are rusty (combat clipping)\n- Poorly Optimized\n\nTL;DR\nThe game's an alpha that literally just released on Steam. Wait a few months, It'll be worth the price. Especially now with the release sale.\nEDIT It's your opinion. However, I can say that it is being updated, but very slowly.","June 25, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","17"
