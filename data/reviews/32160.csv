Basically, a meteor lands in a cemetary and is the impetus for the dead rising from the grave. The only way to defeat them? Bowling, Obviously....sheesh. :)\n\nAnyway, you basically bowl against a zombie, and all the pins are zombies. There are buffs you can gather and use (which include large balls, rockets, plunger guns, etc...), and also penalties you can pick up and use against your zmbie competitor. Of course, it also gets the same opportunities to use buffs and hit you with penalties. They include icy lanes, narrow lanes, obstacles, and so on.\n\nYour goal? To win each match and move on the the next lane. You get a day and night for each lane, so you will bowl each twice. If you lose, you have to try again until you win.\n\nYou can adjust the position of release as well as the ball speed before/as you throw.\n\nThat is pretty much it. Although this probably doesnt sound all that impressive, the game is actually a lot of fun. I cant imagine a person playing it and deciding they didnt like it. It's just cute, good casual bowling. Also fit for all ages.\n\n7/10","March 15, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It feels very much like a well-crafted mobile game. The game consists of you bowling down a lane full of zombies, overcoming obstacles and traps like water on the bowling lane and deploying tricks that you earn to improve your game. The controls are okay, but odd. You use the mouse to adjust the power behind your roll and then once the ball is out of your hands, you directly control its movement with the mouse -- moving left to right.\n\nIt's an idle-time amusement and little more. Not worth the price, but not a broken or terrible game. If you're into this kind of thing, I'd wait until it hit a buck or two before buying. That's about the price of a decent iPad game and that's about what this is.","August 22, 2014","true","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

In most cases, video game bowling sucks (I've never been a fan of REAL bowling, either), but this game has a nice twist to it.  While rolling your ball down the lane, you can somewhat control it and when doing so, you can grab different positive and negative items.\n\nPositive items help YOU, whereas negative items hurt your opponent, which can be a real person or the AI.  This adds a whole new dynamic to the game and turns what could've been a real flop into something quite entertaining.\n\nThere are achievements (if that means a whole lot to you) and a "normal" bowling mode, just in case you don't want to deal with crazy game items.  I don't know WHY you'd want to do that, but it's there.\n\nYou can play against a real person if you want.  This is restricted to local gameplay on ONE PC, so you can't bowl against anyone online.","March 2, 2011","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will NOT find that here. This game is nowhere NEAR to a bowling simulator like Brunswick.\n\nWhile I won this game on the Steam Auction house (the Steam Winter Sale 2014 promotion) I still showed interest in this game regardless if I won it or not.\n\nSo, the story line is simple: There is none. It's literally just challenges against CPU opponets that get progressively harder as your background and lane change. Or you can opt to bowl against friends, or CPU robots that don't get harder (the non-story mode)\n\nThere is NO BLOOD OR GORE, while there is dismemberment, it's nothing gruesome like in Mortal Kombat or any other violent game that support dismemberment in a very vicious and violent manor.\n\nThe pins are zombies. They function as if you hit a human with very thin bones in the shin with a bowling ball.\n\nPowerups are such bs in this game, but it's definitely what makes this game fun. You can pick them up while throwing the ball down the lane (It's like Polar Bowler, if you've ever played that game) and then use them to either give yourself a boost or give your opponet a little harder challenge (based on your powerup you collected)\n\nWhile gameplay is simplistic, the bowling ball is even more simplistic. You guide where your ball goes using the mouse. While i'm not too fond of this mechanic, it can definitely make or break your frame.\n\nGood, fun, time killer - 8/10","January 6, 2015","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a multiplayer game, I would rate it very differently.  But since its advertised as a single player game, and that is why I bought it, that is how I'm scoring it.\n\nThe tricks and power ups are very similar to mario kart.  They allow you to boost your game and weaken your enemies.  This is great when playing against friends who will struggle with the same mouse controls that you have.  But, when playing against AI, it just plain sucks.  The computer is not phased by the tricks you throw at it while you get blown out when the AI uses tricks against you.  You can throw tricks against it frame after frame and it will still bowl 200+ games.  But the super sensitive mouse controls will have you struggling even without the AI's interference.  The AI also seems to luck into the tricks much more frequently which seems to be how they scale difficulty as you advance in single player, making an already frustrating game unbeatable.\n\nIts a cute and gimmicky concept, but when you want to advance the single player functionality, its frustrating, buggy, and eventually very boring.\n\nThe game is lacking simply options like difficulty sliders, options to skip animations automatically, and how tricks/powerups should work.\n\nIts all about the money.  If you find this in a bundle, its worth a small distraction.  However, I would not recommend paying full price, or even buying it alone as its replay appeal is very brief and its single player implementation is very poor.  As I stated above, if you are playing against other human characters, this might be a very fun game (please keep that in mind when reading reviews).","May 18, 2015","false","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Worth one or two dollars, but no more for the single-player experience.  Online multi-player would make this infinitely re-playable and worth full price.  If a game is local co-op on Steam, they must advertise as local co-op.  No idea why this does not apply to the multi-player attribute as well, as it makes a difference in our purchasing choices.","December 21, 2014","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I am incredibly surprised as the jump this game has made to being the most improved genre of ALL  TIME, and if possible I would buy it twice, even on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC SYSTEM even though the mac looks better in every way. If you buy anything on steam, it should be this, it is a masterpiece.\n\n10/10, best game I have played in my life.","January 7, 2011","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the pricetag by default will certainly scare away people looking for a game with plenty of future replay value, if you can get this for 2 bucks, it'll easy make back the hours of entertainment.\n\nThis "scary" bowling game is more of a party game than a serious bowling game (In some ways, Rock-Paper-Scissors meets bowling), where you gather powerups scattered about on the lane you bowl upon while attemping to knock down as many shambling dead as you can. Between turns, you can deploy various powerups that can either hinder your foe or help you, but your rival can do the same as well. There is a modest about of thinking required when it comes to picking the right powerup for the right time, as well as preparing yourself to counter what hazards your rival might use against you..\n\nWhile it does make the game much more fun in a way, it can also make things somewhat frustrating due to the randomness of itemdrops. You might get lucky and get a good powerup, or you don't.. Your rival might end up getting all the good items while you are left with worthless junk, and at times it really is all down to luck more than skill.. But thankfully most of the time I played, I had a satisfying experience... Well, besides my poor ears, which had to deal with the awful background noise drowing out the decent music with no way to turn it off without taking out all the sounds, but oh well, give and take I suppose.\n\nGreat game for when you want to kill an hour or two, but only if you are willing to wait to get it on sale.. It is fun, but I doubt it'll keep you hooked for very long.","October 31, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
