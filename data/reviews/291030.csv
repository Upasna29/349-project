Great art, nice characters, dramatic, but realistic enough backstory and 9 different kind of endings (if you count 'alone' ending to be one). Music is also nice, but for my taste maybe a little too repetitive. After all, it's a really beautiful and kind of cute game.\n\nHow ever there is a big problem with this game. After a little while playing it really starts to repeat itself, like REALLY repeat. When you become familiar with how all of it works you're just basicly waiting for some random events to trigger and your friendship to increase with your chosen character. Also you have to know who you are going after from the day one in this game. Otherwise you'll just run out of time and end up getting alone ending. I can't say much about endings, because I haven't played all of them yet.

Eliot\n\nThis is the first visual novel that I've played from Winter Wolves, and I must say that I'm not impressed. Always Remember Me is an otome game with a somewhat ordinary concept, annoyingly stereotypical characters, suicidally repetitive choice actions and a scarcity of events about the main story to keep you interested. At this point, I must confess that I've completed my first playthrough quite easily and gave in a reaction of "seriously?" at the first ending that I've discovered. During my second playthrough... I got bored and wandered off to do something else, forgetting the game running. When I remembered that I was playing the game, I came back and gave in 2 more hours of the gameplay to collect the missing achievements - a.k.a. fast-forwarded through some repetitive actions and only read event dialogues. Thus, my gaming time.\n\nLet me introduce you to Amarantha - called as Amy by friends - literature student, part time worker in an ice-cream parlor and a boringly plain young woman that you could define in 3 adjectives completely: fickle, stereotypical and automated. At the start of our gameplay, Amy has a motorcycle accident alongside her boyfriend Aaron - which fills in the young, rich and handsome stereotype. Amy survives with some moderate wounds but alongside a slight concussion, Aaron now has amnesia. He doesn't remember a thing about Amy. At this point, it is up to us to either patiently wait by our amnesiac boyfriend to help him regain his memories or run after a limited selection of other handsome young man who might become equally interested with us - namely Lawrence, Eddie and Hugh; appropriately filling in the shy cutie, the workaholic overachiever and the charming artist stereotypes in that order.\n\nSo... As you may observe, our heroine hypothetically overcomes the trauma of losing "the love of her life" quite easily. She - and any other cute boy that she may end up with - are written really badly. They all consist of stereotypes with shallow reactions, superficial dialogue options and boringly unimaginative personalities. One could claim that I shouldn't expect much literary narrative or originality from an otome game to begin with, but without the visual novel quality of an interesting story or interesting enough characters - or at least decent narrative - I most certainly see no reason to spare my time specifically to experience a couple cute pictures of pretty anime characters kissing and some really lame dialogue note at the side. Sorry, but this is what the game eventually ends up being so.\n\nFor the gameplay: you have 4 romance options, 4 stats that you can raise through completing more or less the same actions for a period of 3 months. Each stat concerns one of the romance option as a target. You wake up, work in the parlor, visit the romance option, raise stats with a limited selection of actions, sleep and repeat. Oh, and once in a while you stumble upon an event where you'll get a relationship raise if you are to choose the right one in the dialogue options. Eventually, you hit an ending for the boy that you picked, witness a cheesy "happily ever after" scene and carry on. Nothing else. No surprise factor, no real challenge, no in-depth story. Nothing. You repeat the same action for the millionth time while getting harassed by the endless repetition of the same 8 note soundtrack to be rewarded by a cute picture and 3-4 sentences telling how happy you ended up. Brilliant.\n\nMany would blame me to already know what I would get myself involved with when I picked an otome game to play, but with games from Cheritz or Hanako Games of the same genre in the market, you really should skip this if you are not getting it in a bundle, like super cheap. Else, consistently avoid this one to enjoy another VN or otome with more imaginative gameplay or at least better character concepts and/or story.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","March 24","false","9.4"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","49","54","2","4"

It’s a dating sim that seems like a cute way to pass the time but in the end just feels like a whole repetitive exercise about how much you can read into non-existent conversations and relationships with little foundation.\n\nAlways Remember Me is quick to use all the big heart-tugging elements, with a somewhat forbidden relationship, a protagonist with dead parents, an amnesiac boyfriend, a manipulative ex-girlfriend, and even a struggling humanities student who is just trying to pay her tuition. The story is all very heavy-handed, never really bothering to get into the "why" or "how" of anything or anyone. But that doesn't really matter anyway, since scenes are so few and far between – and so incredibly brief when they even happen – that the story barely exists. It's not uncommon for Always Remember Me to just skip scenes altogether, passing over entire conversations and evenings out, and swiftly arriving at the ending, leaving you to fill in any romance or, well, anything at all that happened.\n\nThe sim elements feel pretty unnecessary. On easy difficulty you can spam the activity that gives you the most stats, while on harder difficulties you scramble around to figure out a strategy. The emphasis seems to be more on the “sim” element than the “dating”, and for that it’s not too fun. The relationship building part of the game doesn’t feel substantial, and if the overall aim is to grind numbers for those parts then I have to ask what purpose it serves, or if the result even makes up for the grind.\n\nAt the end of the day, Always Remember Me isn't a bad game, it just falls flat on effort in the wrong places. The plot relies on shallow dramatic backstory to give characters a false sense of depth while the gameplay is a pure grind and almost without purpose. For me, there’s not enough payoff to justify grinding through numbers to reach an ending, and that makes this game a really dull experience.","April 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 68 of 90 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","68","90","0","0"

I had some expectations before playing this game since the visuals seemed fairly appealing and I actually wasn't disappointed by the (few) CGs - they were drawn well and the character designs weren't bad either. But that's it, everything else made me - bluntly said - dislike the game.\n\nThe characters' sprites during the cutscenes looked weird (e.g. when Amy cried her posture/gesture didn't change at all, her posture stayed the same throughout the game and the same with the other characters). Additionally, the game seemed to focus more on the stat raising mechanic than the romance plot itself, leading to some annoying and boring "save & load" back and forth since you want to raise your stats as soon as possible in order to get both endings easily. Lastly, the endings to every route in this game. Briefly said, they were also very disappointing. A short cutscene with CG as a reward and during those cutscenes, you couldn't really feel the love between the protagonist and her final love interest - you just couldn't feel this achievement which you want to have as the player in every dating sim.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad they took another step forward to localising dating sims in the west and I don't regret buying ARM since it helped supporting the localisation. Still, I probably wouldn't have bought it for another reason.","November 28, 2014","false","6.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","0"

Though the art looks well done it's additionally let down by the UI which I firmly disliked and didn't allow me to fully immerse myself in it. Everything is cookie-cutter and failed to employ cliches effectively and I won't be looking forward to any Winter Wolves games in the future.","October 20, 2014","false","4.7"," 47 of 62 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","47","62","0","0"

Unfortunately It didn't, and as a matter of fact, I could even go as far as saying I dislike it even more now that I have.\n\nFirst of all, this game should not have the privilege of being categorized as a dating sim but rather as a ice cream shop sim since that's what you do for literally half of the game which becomes more and more tedious the more you play the game since it limits your progress to 1/4th the speed. In fact, if you were to take all of the useless grinding for money and stat boosting, the game would be cut down to 10 min per route.. Max.\n\nAnother bad point of this game is the fact that you have to deal with the most annoying game soundtrack I have probably heard so far, not only does it not suit the game at all, but it also plays in a loop over and over again which becomes highly annoying and sure, you could argue how muting the sound would probably fix that issue but it only makes it really awkward and boring. I would also like to point out the fact that I’m not touching the sound effects, or the lack there of, since I could talk about them for days.. woohoooooooooooo!!11\n\n+Fun fact: This game is heavily Rng based meaning you will continuously find yourself talking to one of the male protagonists and not making any progress at all for days on end.\n\nLastly this "game" is definitely not worth 18 dollars, the thought of it even being worth more that 10 is ridiculous to say the least. If you want a really good dating game go purchase “Hatoful Boyfriend” which has great replay-ability (Which is a game I will be doing a review of later) and also has characters you can end up connecting with. You will also save 8 dollars which you can save to your steam wallet or buy some other game with. Now, I bought this game in a bundle so I got my money’s worth, but i would advice not to get this unless it's in one again.\n\nThis game would only be suitable for huge fans of dating sims or hardcore game collectors such as myself\nIn conclusion.. I wouldn't recommend this game even if i was getting paid to do so.\nI rate it a 10/10 - IGN","April 25, 2015","false","6.1"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"

The ending was the biggest flaw. I got both the special and normal ending for Eddy and I felt zero difference between the two. There also was absolutely no build up to the ending.\n\nThe male characters just sort of eventually confess to Amy, with not much having happened between them since this game focuses just a little, little too much on stat building...and then the player is left a little confused as to whether or not Amy is actually dating the love interest (because even if a different guy confesses to hear and she says something like "I think I have feelings for you, too", she still visits her boyfriend with Amnesia at the hospital and gets upset when his ex girlfriend is there).\n\nAfter that, once you either fill the 'love meter' or play up until the 'deadline', it just skips straight to a short ending scene with your hubby without any build up or conflict in the story (besides the whole amnesia storyline).\n\nDespite all of this, I did very much like three of the love interests. The boyfriend with amnesia was a little too plain to be so much trouble for my tastes..but these bishies were still interesting and the sort that plenty of people can get attached to (such as myself).\n\nAmy, the heroine, is also very likable and the game has fantastic artwork (not to mention a fairly nice soundtrack which I better liked by purchasing the deluxe edition of the game).\n\nAll in all, not the greatest otome and it didn't handle the stat building particularily well (and I think the new game Backstage Pass did a better job of that..), but it was cute and charming.\n\nIt just is NOT the sort of thing if you've played a lot of visual novels or otome games.

I know a few titles that have done this before but I've never had the chance to try them out.\n\nUnfortunately, a balance needs to be struck when this comes into play. The game is too repetitive seeing as the options to raise the 4 stats are very limited. I went for the Eddy special ending and I barely used the gym. It turned out that blogging had a higher success rate for raising 2 discipline instead of 1. By the second half of the playthrough, I was watching TV all day just to pass the time and get to the next day (to progress things with Eddy).\n\nSomething else which bothered me was how cookie-cutter the males were. Aaron bored me to death and Lawrence is a huge drama queen.

Again, this is a fresh VNoob review, so keep that in mind.\n\nSo let's start.\n\nThe story. If this game was a first-person shooter or casual hack and slash, we wouldn't have to comment on that. However, this is a Visual NOVEL, so we definitely have to focus on this aspect. You play as Amy, a girl who has gone through despair after her boyfriend was diagnosed with amnesia, not remembering anything from their past relationship. As Amy you will be working part time, visiting Aaron, the aforementioned boyfriend, and trying to make him remember or worst case scenario: make him fall in love with you again. But is that really the best for both of you... ? Overall I found the story being full of cliches, however enjoyable nonetheless. With characters being well written and surprisingly deep.\n\nThe gameplay. You will be also doing various activities expanding one of four of your traits: Culture, Creativity, Romance and Discipline. These are also gained by interacting with one of your four potential love interests. Having maxed out the particular stat needed for the certain partner unlocks the 'special ending'. As you grow familiar with your partner more special events are unlocked, in which you are forced to make a choice that will either advance your relationship or do the opposite. You will find yourself awaiting these events with curiosity and excitement, partly because your daily routine will get boring eventually. The first playthrough may not wield results and you will probably do a second one. And that's okay, the replayability value here is surprisingly high. You may want to turn text and animation speed up, but you will still have fun exploring the other optio... I mean guys.\n\nThe visuals.\nThe artstyle is your typical anime stylization. However the proportions belong to the more realistic half of this particular artstyle. Overflowing with vibrant colors and interesting character choices your eyes will definitely not go dry. The animation and city map is nothing particularly impressive, but it fullfils it's purpose. All the work certainly went into the characters and backgrounds. The font is annoying, but typical for VNs, however there are many well stylized VNs out there. Overall, I wouldn't have played it for +5 hours if I was bothered by the visuals, so this is definitely a plus for the game.\n\nThe soundtrack.\nA quite rare aspect in reviews, however I always like to mention them, especially in games such as these. They represent a major part of the narrative and usually expand the experience. Not here. More or less. It is catchy, don't get me wrong, it certainly is. I've been listening to the opening the whole time I wrote this review and I had no urge to turn it down whatsoever. The in-game music gives a very casual vibe, something you should grow familiar if watching sitcoms and other family-friendly shows. It just doesn't leave a mark in my memory (guess I will not Always Remember It, haha). Unlike the game itself it is enjoyable while it lasts, but once you're done you won't feel obligated to pick it up again. The bonus 'remix' of the main theme song is a fun gimmick and amusing, but it does not feel particularly memorable as well.\n\nAnd now we got to the end of this review. The final question: Should you buy it or should you not? Well, strongly depends on your preferences. If you're looking for a dramatic heart-tearing ride, you won't find it here. It's a lighthearted and fairly casual experience and the story is pretty straightforward and linear. I don't think it needs heavy plot-twists anyways. You will enjoy this game as it is if you're looking for something fun to pick up and try. I myself had high expectations and wasn't dissapointed, but again, your mileage may vary.\n\nIt is certaily an enjoyable game and immensively fun if you can just ease yourself off after a hard day and want to kill time. I highly recommend this to you as a gateway visual novel if you want to get into this genre.","April 26, 2014","true","6.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It doesn't help that the main character failed to engage me at all so I find it impossible to actually care weather she gets back into a relationship or not. The other characters are pretty paper thin too and only have a few quirks about them, so ultimately they're pretty dull too.\n\nThe sim elements that are in the game that can be trained are really uninspired and they're really just another relationship meter for specific love interests (For example: Aaron relates to the 'Romance' stat and Lawrence relates to the 'Culture' stat). There is really no need for them and it just seems to me that the developers just included them to give you the illusion of progression, when actually you're not and if you're not maxing a specific stat like Romance for Aaron you're wasting your ♥♥♥♥ing time.\n\nThere are arguments about "are video games art", or somthing along those lines. I got a better one for you - "Is Always Remember Me a game?" Even if you're a big fan of VNs, this would not interest you. There are far better ways to waste £14 than actually playing this crap.

The story is a neat premise, the main character's boyfriend has amnesia so she can either stick it out with him or pursue three other dudes. The characters themselves aren't annoying, but they don't really stick out that much either. That's unfortunately because you don't actually get to see most of their personality unless you pursue them as a love interest and even then you only get a few choice-related events with them. Then again, maybe it was meant to be that way since they're suppose to be simple characters and not soap opera cliche characters. Although, its neat how the game incorporates morale and energy levels in it, and its pretty simple to figure out how to best balance out those stats.\n\nAs far as this review goes, I've only played through Aaron's and Lawrences's normal and special endings. Aaron's special ending was the only ending from those four that had a smooth transition for its end relationship. The other four endings just pop up abruptly once you max out the guys' love meters, almost as if they were an after-thought in the story designing process.

Of course, I was right, but it was in a bundle somewhere, and I run every game with cards till they drop.  With this in mind, here is my unbiased opinion.\nAlways Remember Me was simple to install, and started right up when I pressed play.  It continued to run while I took a nap, got up and went to the store for some soup, then came home and ate the soup.  At this point I checked and saw that all of the cards had dropped, and uninstalled the game, which was also very easy.  I then filed the game into a folder, where it will sit for years to come.  Overall, I give Always Remember Me four out of five chins, only falling short of five due to the senseless violence and lacivious content whose absence prevented me from playing.","April 28, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Maybe on sale. It was terribly repetitive. Very grindy. The mechanic, once figured out, is so simple it is easy to find all the "hidden" scenes. Maybe, just maybe if you were new to dating sim games and had no idea....it might be fun for more than an hour.\n\nThe story was so full of common themes and tropes, the cup runneth over. Amnesia, no parents for the main character, the back-stabbing ex. It was all just so predictable.\n\nNot much imagination went into the art either. It was quite typical. There were several times when characters were having an important scene that the camera was focused on some irrelevant part of ONE picture. That is right, you work several hours just to get to a pan of one picture at the end. Or in the middle of a defining moment of dialouge the focus stays on a character...who isn't even speaking. A lot more care could have been taken with this. I mean this is supposed to be a heart-string-pulling anime inspired romance. How are you supposed to have your heart-strings pulled on with no character face to pull emotion from. It was very disappointing.\n\nIn the end I played through all the endings just to see them. But I wouldn't even invite my friends over to try this one.","July 22, 2014","false","13.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It has most, if not, all elements of a dating sim game. The story is cute. The artwork looks nice. And depending on the guy you choose the story invokes emotions. There were some parts where I felt sad. So the game did a great job on that.\n\nHowever, it's heavily focused on raising stats. Always Remember Me has a few elements that it lacks compared to other dating sim games. You can't really go out on dates with the guys, call them, etc. There's only one or two interactions with the guy. So after a while, days get kinda repeative.\n\nThere is a small amount of scenes you can get with the guy. That's really about it.

I really like the painterly style used. I purchased based on the art alone.\n+/- Ost is so-so. There was only 1 track that stood out to me. The instrumental theme song that comes on at random is really annoying.\n- The only voice option is the chibi protagonist's reaction to how well you performed a task. It becomes quite repetitive and annoying immediately, so I ended up muting it.\n- Horribly structured amnesia plot which makes the writing unrealistic. The intro leads into the main love interest's route, but for the sake of having other love interests, forces the MC to be a shallow person by abandoning him to date another character. The plot continually pushes the main love interest's involvement throughout the story as something important, when it doesn't have any direct impact to the other routes.\n- Huge lack of character development/character scenes. It makes the pacing of the game awful. I really feel like the scenes you get are randomized, because there is a screenshot in the community hub of a character that I have never run into in any of my playthroughs.\n- Endings felt more like quick epilogues with no real conclusion at the end. There were little differences between both route endings.\n- Stat grinding felt boring. Even being efficient with saving and reloading to get the most points in the shortest time was still a chore.\n- No incentive to do a harder difficulty. It's just not fun.","September 11, 2015","false","14.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's got very simplistic choices and game mechanics, which makes it enjoyable for those experienced with the genre or those who are just trying it out for the first time. The game takes place over a 3 month time period and features eight different endings. The first playthrough will take about 2-3 hours, which means that it's not an overally demanding time commitment even if you are going for a 100% run for all the endings/achievements.\n\nAlthough the game can be a bit repetative (as are most dating sims), I definitely recommend it. It's not overwhelming, but the game still offers enough that I wanted to keep coming back to it. There are four different choices of love interests, all vastly different for all kinds of players. The story isn't overbearing, but it does tear at your heart strings a little, which is more than enough, as I personally don't like a dating sim to feel overally cheesy or mushy. The game is also very clean, with no nudity or profane language.\n\nThe few cons that I will include is the steep price tag. For the less than 10 hours of game play I got out of it, 17.99 hardly seems worth it (even though I got it on sale for 15.00). I didn't feel ripped off because I enjoyed the game, but if you're not completely sold on the idea of this game, wait until it goes on sale before purchasing.\n\nAnother con is that the events with your potential love interests can feel far and in between. When you do finally get an event, the event is rather short and that can feel unrewarding. This is due to the game's short time span/play time.","April 27, 2014","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Winter Wolves did this in Heileen series too and although it was sometimes a bit annoying the process of getting there was interesting events with clear choices so it worked for me. I consider them very good games on average.\n\nb) Save scumming and forcing the player to concentrate on one thing and one thing only to get a ending. This game is heavy on this - unless you consider it a 'splendid' idea that the game just 'awards' the player with the ability to re-play it again with increased point awards for activities.

There's a simple and another developed ending with each of the guy and an "alone" one.\n\nThe game timing lasts 3-4 months, you have to respect it in earning the ability and pleasing your love in answering well to/ in front of him to get its ending!\n\nOverall it's a rather good game.","November 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

All the guys in this game are either hard to pursue or jerks. This seems to be more of a life management game than a dating simulator.

But will it be a game that you will want to read through ? In this game you play as Amy. She and her boyfriend Aaron get into an accident which leaves Aaron without his memory and its up to you to get it back. While trying to get his memory back you either can choose a diffrent boyfriend to go for or just go for the main goal. Overall how is this game ?\nI find this game a mixed bag let me explain why. Now for the better things: The game has great story and really good art. The gameplay is fun and its also really fun to do the diffrent activities. Now for the bad things: The game gets really boring after a while since every day you have to do the same thing and it gets quite repetitive. The game also has pretty dumb choice making and what would feel like youre moral choices to differ the story what it does to you it gives you a penalty for the wrong choice which feels dumb so essiantly theres only one choice and theres not going around it and plus the choices dont affect the story at all which feels stupid. Overall the game is a fun simple game and has 9 diffrent endings to be achieved which will prolong the two hour campaing. The game also gets repetetive after a while so be aware.

Each has their own personality and quirks, aswell as enjoying (or not!) different things, and each ending is amazing in its own way. Personally, for me, Hugh's ending(s) are the easiest to achieve, with Aaron's being the hardest, and Lawrence ended up being my favourite character! I love different aspects of each character and their respective ending. I guess games like this are "each to their own", but I'd definitely recommend it, just don't be foolish and under the influence that this is a "dating sim", as in, a dating sim where it results in sex scenes with the love interests, because it has absolutely no sex or erotica in it at all. Despite that, it's a fun game to play, light-hearted (for the most part) and it's worth getting! (Er, being brutally honest, not at full price. I got it for £6.99 during the Summer sale and I think that's about the most I'd pay for it anyway!

All the mechanics work fine with your typical speedy ctrl command for alternate ending playthroughs, and a well thought out ui.\nHonestly I didn't think I'd have as much fun as I did with this game, and all I can hope for is that either this developer team or another will make more visual novel dating sims for steam.\nOkei I'ma go listen to that techno song and shoot down Hugh some more :3\n11/10 Best Waifu Game 2014","May 21, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

MEH.\nThis game was literally meh, in every sense, in art, story and love interests. Or, well, the town map was impressive looking.\n\nIt's a fully working dating sim, but that's really all there is to it. The plot is really weak and unimpressive, sometimes even cringe-worthy to the point that I'm suffering secondhand embarrassment. It feels greatly unbalanced and repetitive. Wake up. Raise your stats. Go and earn some brownie points with the boyz. Go back to bed. Repeat the routine till you eventually get a small plot scene without CG.\n\nEndings are usually the essential part of a dating sim, it's the goal of the game. You usually have these expectations of them, for them to feel like the wrap up the game and give you closure. This game didn't just didn't manage to achieve that. It felt tedious (even the special ending), and it did not make me want to replay the game to unlock another ending.\n\nOverall, if you don't have too high expectations and/or you've never played at dating sim/Otome game before, you might enjoy it. There is a lot of room for improvement in this game, but honestly even if it was improved there is few things that could make a cliche plot like this interesting.\n\nOther than that, this game shows off a lot of different functions that it's engine is capable of.

Yes, you can help your amnesiac boyfriend regain his memories, and yes there are occassionally sweet moments, but the pacing is horridly off. You can visit your potential boyfriend every single day and only run into dialog between your character and him MAYBE once a week if you're lucky. What little dialog there is also doesn't help bridge the gap between starting to like someone and falling in love, which leads to an awkward jarring ending. Within a few hours you can hit the end of the game, which is disappointing, and it goes even quicker if you decide to skip dialog for a second playthrough.\n\nThe gameplay itself isn't nearly as important as the story, but it's supposed to keep the game decently paced, but once again it fails. You end up grinding for stats almost everyday of the week, and other than plot items, money is nearly useless as regular activities are usually just as useful for stat growth, especially since you only need ONE stat at max to get the special endings. Because of the randomness of the stat-growth, moods, and money it can easily become a slow mess of saving and loading as you grind for your ideal outcome. It only slows the pacing and artificially lengthens the game, which is sad for such a short story.\n\nThe audio gets old quick with an upbeat soundtrack that repeats far too often. It's especially obvious when going about your daily routine on the town map. It's a relatively small gripe, but it's worth mentioning.\n\nIn conclusion, the game had romantic moments but ultimately lacked the dialog and pacing required to make a romance believeable. I wouldn't recommend this one.","September 16, 2014","false","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","The story is what made me interested in this game, where a young woman is having to cope with her boyfriend suffering amnesia and forgetting about her. I enjoy the stories and couplings that Winter Wolves make for their visual novels.\n\nHowever, unlike most of the others (like Heileen, Bionic Heart), this one doesn't depend on the choices you make, but rather how  much you decide to grind for a certain skill or activity. Such as if you want to build up your friendship with Aaron (the boyfriend), you need to read books to him. But instead of getting a scene each for the time you read them, you get the same repetetive two-liner whether he liked the book or whether he was too tired to listen. The same goes for the other possible romances in the game, you get a repetitive two-liner if things went good or bad.\n\nThere are a few meaningful scenes in the game. When you reach a certain point on the relationship level (like 30), you get a special scene with the boy your character fancies. These scenes, if they had been more regular and not depended on your choice of grind, would have made the game excellent. These scenes are very touching, and some very important, to move the story along.\n\nFor me, the lack of these meaningful scenes gave me no incentive, aside from achievement, to persue romance with anyone but the boyfriend. There's not enough character development with the others to make me interested in persuing romance with them. So even if this game is longer and offer more choices than Heileen, I still prefer Heileen for the fact that it was decision based throughout and there it felt more rewarding to persue romance with anyone.","September 18, 2014","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Not a good start for a visual novel. At first, I ended up playing the Aaron route simply because I felt I should out of loyalty. I didn't even like Aaron, in fact, only at the end does he stop being a jerk to you and getting back with his old girlfriend. Lawrence is probably the nicest guy so I went back through the game and tried the Lawrence route. I ended up wanting to skip pretty much everything I had seen previously as this game has little to no replayability.\n\nOverall, the writing was mediocre, the music wasn't very good, the skill building didn't seem to achieve anything at all, there is minimal story and lots of grinding doing the cafe, sleeping, going to the park etc. It would have been MUCH better if they focused less on making it like a game with a skill tree and such, and just focused on writing a good story. People play visual novels for the story and this really felt flat and boring.\n\nOn a positive note, the art was quite lovely.\n\n3/10","February 19, 2015","false","5.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Overall, its just repetitive and there isn't much of a reward to show when you're finished with everything.\n\nStory-wise, the story is underwhelming. The main plot with the protagonist's boyfriend getting amnesia is a bit cliche, and there's even an ex-girlfriend that tries to steal him away. The characters are pretty stereotypical as well, and there isn't any real depth to any of them. Not to mention afters raising enough stats or going through all the days alloted in the game, the story just kind of ends. There are "secret" endings with each character as well, that you can get by maxing out the stat associated with whatever guy you're trying to get, but I always seem to prefer the normal ending, and the CGs for the "secret" endings aren't much different from the normal ones either.\n\nThe art can be underwhelming at times as well. While the sprites look fine, the CGs aren't very consistant with the rest of the artwork. Speaking of CGs though, the event CGs aren't very memorable either. In fact, I can only remember the CGs from the end of each route I took, which mainly just consisted of the characters looking and smiling at each other.\n\nIf you're an experieced otome player, I'd skip this.

Cries a lot, but seems to be strong-willed. She works part time in an ice cream shop and loves to write.\nAaron: Amy's actual bf who suffers from amnesia after she and him end up in a motorcycle accident.  Amy suffers next to no injuries and Aaron gets hospitalized for severe trauma. Seems like a stereotypical bf in the beginning, but he can't remember anything about him and Amy.\nLawrence: Amy's coworker at the ice cream shop. He's the type to worry over everything and doesn't know what to do in emotional situations. Unreasonably passive but cares a lot for Amy.\nHugh: A random guy who's friends with Amy (and maybe Lawrence too?) and owns a shop in the mall. He cares a lot for Amy, but in a different sense than Lawrence. Kind of a womanizer type of character.\nEddy: Aaron's doctor in the hospital. He's a workaholic and lacks the ability to cook or do any sort of house chore because of his busy schedule. A deadpan mostly, but he keeps a close eye on Amy.\n\nFinal Impressions:\nThis game is worth around $5-$7 at most due to the lack of a storyline and a cast of underdeveloped characters. It had a good premise, but the way the story plays out just doesn't work well with the interactive quality of the game. I wouldn't invest the $20+ in the game because you really only get a few hours of playtime to complete the whole story with all routes and achievements obtained. If this game ever goes on sale for around $5, then buy it then so you don't regret spending over $20 for it. It has it's fun points and it was kind of enjoyable, but it's not as good as other otomes on Steam, but it wouldn't be so terrible if more work was put into it. 5/10 at most.","October 25, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The achievements weren't too difficult to earn, but still had a challenge to them, the artwork was charming, and the storyline was, well, it wasn't half bad. I think the price for this game is definitely too steep, and I'd recommend only buying it if it's on sale. This visual novel is a 7/10 for me because I really enjoyed some of the elements like having a consistent responsibility and an air of determination to get certain stats up for the different guys.\nDefinitely could use improvement in the storyline, and the odd leveling up sometimes just not paying off.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pseudoveverka/recommended/291030/","pseudoveverka","pseudoveverka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pseudoveverka/","158 products in account","This game is one of those cases when I wish I could choose a neutral rating. It's not stellar, but it's not bad either; still, I can't recommend it with clear conscience.\n\nFirst off, the story is nice, if bland. You won't remember it (pun... mostly intended) as something that gave you All The Feels, but it's cute enough to play through when you have some downtime. The characters are hardly complex, but mostly pleasing, and the dialogue seems fine, if you keep in mind that it's a short game without any deeper moments other than Aaron's amnesia (which presents an interesting situation that is handled okay, but could've been developed more).\n\nI also like the art well enough - I don't really see why some people seem to have a problem with it, since it's very nice imho and I've seen way, way worse sprites and CGs in some other VNs I played.\n\nThere is, however, an issue that ultimately led me to the negative review: the game mechanics. I'm not talking about stat raising - an element which I personally hate, given how annoying it turns in every (however good) game, but I understand why it's used. I'm talking about the fact that key scenes with each of the characters trigger based on approval, but there's still a random element to WHEN you get them. That means that if you raise your relationship points (or other stats!) too quickly, you can easilly miss out on even scenes that are essential to each route. People playing otome games want to have their hard-earned confession scenes served on a silver plate, not accidentally skipped while only getting the happy epilogue. And yes, that happens in ARM - Lawrence's route is the best example.\n\nAll in all, you might have fun with this game, but only if you are willing to pace your play carefully so you don't miss out on anything. And I definitely wouldn't get it for the full price; I bought it on sale (75% off) and that's about as much as the game is worth.","April 18","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
