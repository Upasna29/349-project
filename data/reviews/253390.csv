Video review embedded below.\n\nBuried under its tortuous level designs, needlessly convoluted mechanics, and overly ambitious plot, there’s the game Hot Tin Roof wanted to be.\n\nA quirky mixed of film noir, classical adventure games, and exploration focused platformers, it’s full of heart but lacking in direction. It attempts to blend so many styles of play as to end up degrading all of them with an unfocused design that often left me confused and frustrated, wondering how such a promising start had spiralled into a mess of half-finished concepts.\n\nHot Tin Roof follows Emma Jones and her sidekick cat, Franky, two up and coming detectives thrown onto their first case when a wealthy business man is murdered and his will stolen. Events quickly become much larger in scope however as the murders start piling up, fingers are pointed, and Emma and Franky are the only ones seemingly capable of doing anything about it.\n\nWhile Hot Tin Roof’s setup is lovingly reminiscent of classic detective films, it has trouble piecing its plot together between its opening and closing moments. Events and clues are presented in an anachronistic, disorienting manner which often accidentally discloses key plot points before you’re meant to understand them. It commits a cardinal sin of any whodunit narrative, by only ever introducing important elements when they’re immediately relevant to the mystery at hand and thus degrading the impact of seeing how the pieces fit together in the end. I was constantly being clued in on the happenings of characters I’d never been introduced to, relationships that seemed to spring up out of thin air, and revelations that I didn’t understand the significance of. Everything comes together in a way that feels agonizingly contrived and stretched too thin, as if originally intended as multiple stories haphazardly bundled together for a shocking last minute reveal of how everything is connected. Only in this case I already knew what was happening, I just wasn’t allowed to proceed until the game realized it too.\n\nMaybe what’s more disappointing than what Hot Tin Roof tries and often fails to do with its plot, is everything it leaves on the table. The elements I found most interesting, like the rampant inequality levied toward the rats, the discrimination of cats by their human owners, and the sprawling city left to rot as people built a new one above ground, are all used as window dressing for the actual narrative which in many ways is fairly routine and simple, only delivered in a way that suggests otherwise. I’d have loved to greater explore the different inner city societies that the game hints at, or to have seen an expansion on the difficult relationship between Emma and the waitress of a local diner, but Hot Tin Roof is too preoccupied with its web of plotlines to do anything but introduce these and other subplots before abandoning them.\n\nAbandonment is something I felt in a lot of areas of the game, from its near complete lack of direction, to an excessive number of mechanics that have a habit of stepping on top of each other. The world is huge and twisting, and without a map or anything pointing you toward your objective I was left to wander in the hopes I’d find some sidepath I’d missed, or stumble upon a button prompt I’d accidentally passed over. At times it became so bad I began to wonder if I’d broken the game, but it was only that I had missed a trigger somewhere the game had never informed me I needed to go.\n\nExacerbating this issue is how much of the world is used for nothing but putting distance between you and your destination. I spent a significant amount of time wandering through barren streets, empty hallways, and dull caverns looking for the one clue I was required to pick up to proceed, and often the only way out was to retrace all of my steps essentially doubling the amount of time needed to travel anywhere in the game.\n\nHot Tin Roof’s mechanical structure similarly takes on more than it had any need to. Abilities come in the form of different bullets for your revolver, but most are used only for extremely particular tasks, usually ones that require more convoluted executions than the result would seem to imply. It also has the habit of neglecting most of your abilities to focus on whatever new toy you’ve acquired, but then force you to use an older ability in a way you were never informed it was for. Switching abilities also requires you reload your revolver bullet by bullet, which while a cool system takes up an exhausting amount of your playtime do to the constant necessity to switch abilities.\n\nThroughout my time with Hot Tin Roof, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was playing something unfinished, and which had had little to no playtesting performed prior to release. It’s trying so so hard, and at times I was completely on board, but it’s bloated design consistently felt like a project that had veered wildly from its original intent into something larger than it had the ability to pull off. I’m not sure how I could do anything but adore a game costarring a cat in a fedora, but clearly Hot Tin Roof has given me that answer, no matter how much I didn’t want to hear it.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NfK60dM2mc&list=PLmaGkDQUd2inWbUZoSoB7v2zcJ_cJ0VGA&index=4","February 23, 2015","false","6.1"," 71 of 96 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","71","96","0","2"

The Game starts of with Jones a Female Private Investigator and her cat Franky who is also a female. The game mentions 8 bit graphics and while it is 3D it does accomplish the feeling of those type of graphics brought into a modern time.\n\nHere is a full review on my channel\nhttp://youtu.be/PyiE7Ctqnyg\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are great and throughout the levels I did not run into tearing or graphical glitches\n\n-Sound track is amazing it really gives you an old timey feel when playing the game\n\n- Fairly intuitive mechanics as it is easy to figure out how things work. Even if you get stuck and don't know how use something Franky will be sure to tell you what to do, how to use it, or what to get.\n\n- A story that keeps you constantly involved. The story does not get boring as you are never really doing one thing at a time. You constantly figuring out to get to one area, what clues to use on a civilian, or what case to focus on.\n\n-Clues are found easily but if having trouble you can always ask your chief or save money for a clue to be bought.\n\n-6-8 hours gameplay\n\n-Fairly comedic\n\n-Very Bug free\n\nCons:\n- Some aspects of bullets are not explained well for example Knockback bullets can be use to propel yourself it took me 30 minutes to figure that out.\n\n-Grinding for money can become a problem when you need to buy a big purchase\n\nOverall the game is a lot of fun I have been recording/playing it before it was released and have almost completed the game. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzle crime games. I am constantly using my brain to think how to get past certain situations to progress the game. Franky and Jones are on the job and there will be no one who can hide from them.","February 20, 2015","true","10.0"," 47 of 61 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","47","61","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squidwalk/recommended/253390/","squidwalk","squidwalk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squidwalk/","418 products in account","This game is too charming to not recommend. It has a lot of major faults, it's clearly a freshman endeavor. But giving it a thumbs down would feel like criticizing a poem a loved one wrote for you. It's earnest and charming. You noticed it uses a slant rhyme, but you don't want to make the author feel bad about it. They did something nice.\n\nThe good points of the game:\n\nThe high concept/theme works well. The "cube people" concept is used just enough to be fun, but not overbearing. Sentient animals in a noir setting has precident in books like Gun, With Occasional Music. Hot Tin Roof does an excellent job making the idea its own, while still using the background metaphor of interspecies classism.\n\nThe soundtrack combines jazz with chiptunes. After listening to it for a while, I began to appreciate how difficult that must have been. It clearly required a bit to thought to put the two genres together in such a coherent way. Easy, early accessibility to a sound test NPC suggests the devs knew how well the soundtrack turned out.\n\nThe revolver tool felt extremely satisfying to use. It's is your main form of puzzle interface, and the animation/SFX never stops being rewarding. Literally chambering the solution to a puzzle provided a sense of anticipation to your now-inevitable small victory. The inclusion of the self-propelling knockback bullets helped mitigate a lot of my gripes about having to re-tread areas do to unclear objectives. If there's one thing that makes retreads feel less bothersome, it's satisfying active movement acceleration.\n\nMajor characters don't get a lot of development time, but manage to feel colorful and noir-thematic without being too trope-dependant. The writing does a good job using tropes to circumvent the need for characterization without making characters feel flat. It subverts tropes in places where nior can seem mean or rough, making for a charmingly "noir nice" overall aesthetic. In particular, it portrayed the "noir foreigner" trope with humor and even-handedness.\nThe okay:\n\nFranky, the tag-along character, was a high point. Her writing is fun, noirish, and cute, and she doesn't get in the way of area interaction. I liked Franky. But the game allows you to shoot her, and she makes a sad meowing sound when you do. I really didn't want to shoot Franky. But the game requires a good amount of aimless exploration, and it provides you with a bullet type that propels you forward quickly when shot behind you. So I ended up shooting the heck out of Franky. I even got a shame-achievement for shooting her a lot called "Franky Hater". I wish I couldn't shoot my friend by accident.\n\nThe writing is a mixed bag. Franky manages to be a funny sidekick without being annoying, which is a seldom accomplished feat. But Jones is a little too plain, and doesn't have a Detective Flaw. Most NPCs, particularly street-level ones you interact with for a single plot point, are surprisingly compelling. But NPCs that you don't interact with for plot seemed rather dry.\n\nIt was a fun idea to play as a female detective in a setting where visual sexualization is essentially impossible. But that necessitates more dialogue-based gender representation, and Jones' dialogue was usually a bit too straightforward to address her gender identity. This could easily have been a failing point though, with a "too much to prove" character, so it's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nEvery puzzle area has a puzzle that makes good use of your combined abilities. But there are usually areas between these that merely require you to use your abilities to traverse them. This could function as conveyance. But the game's unclear objectives means you'll end up re-treading these areas frequently, and that transforms the teaching mini-puzzles into a chore.\n\nThe lack of flavor/landmarks in the background of traversal areas means that it's easy to get lost in them, extending the chore of re-traversal as you walk around hoping you're going in the direction of your objective. Some sections have great background art, like posters for the cat-mayor done in both block-cat and realistic cat art types. They clearly had a capable art team. It'd would have helped navigation if more flavor was included.\nThe bad:\n\nThere are almost always unclear objectives. The investigation process is obtuse, and entirely necessary. Players only vaguely know what they should be doing at any time. Sometimes the game helps by restricting player access to areas in purposeful ways. But expect to consult a message board or a Let's Play. I actually consulted a Let's Play, looked on message boards for help, and found the Let's Play-er on a message board looking for help.\n\nUnintentional sequence breaks can really mess you up. Not understanding your objectives will lead to exploration, and exploration will lead to sequence breaks that you can't entirely recover from. I somehow missed a section where you question suspects in an interrogation room. Hours later the plot had moved on, and I was in a random cave, and I got a one-sided cut scene about questioning the suspects. It lead to a warp to the interrogation room, which I couldn't use because the suspects were already in jail at that point. I missed a clue that would help with the game's ending. I believe said ending got a work-around in a patch just to compensate for people missing clues due to unintentional sequence breaks.\nI'd recommend Hot Tin Roof to someone I know would like the themes, and would be able to work past the rough patches. But it's not polished, and it's not for everyone.","September 21, 2015","true","7.9"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrywizardprince/recommended/253390/","angrywizardprince","Awkward With Pants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrywizardprince/","920 products in account","UPDATE: Literally within hours of posting this they put out two updates/patches, one of which fixed the original bug that prevented progress after a certain point. While the other points still stand, they've  fixed the issue (at least for me) on saves that kill completion of the game. However, at this price point, I'd still wait at least for sale to get at least your money's worth for the first few hours.\n\nFirst off - in terms of style, humor, and mood this game delivers exactly what you're looking for. It's witty, tongue-in-cheek, and one of those games where I could be posting screenshots all day.\n\nIn many ways, it feels as if the developers and creators spent a lot of love and time starting the game and creating the idea, but eventually lost interest or ran into production issues because the game starts strong but quickly devolves into frustrating platforming puzzles and a punishing gauntlet of bugs.\n\nIn early levels and stages, you're rewarded for your exploration with secret areas, collectibles, and so on. But later on, you run the risk of finding a collectible or jumping through an invisible wall which will render you unable to escape and forcing you to use the last savepoint to resume your progress. It got to a point where it felt like a rogue-like of chancing whether or not I would bug out or find a collectable.\n\nThe save checkpoints are cute and humorously executed, because as many times as you do it it never quite gets old - however the sloppiness in code execution, combined with long distances between savepoints ultimately has led to a point where I can resume yet find myself in a place unable to complete the game, essentially remembering my location in a map yet resetting all the doors, trapping me inside.\n\nI really REALLY wanted to love this game - and in many ways I still do - but unfortunately because of the large number of bugs and sloppy techncial execution towards the end I can't recommend it in the state it's in. Rule one should be - you must be able to finish the game.","February 21, 2015","false","8.4"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","30","40","0","0"

I don't think I've ever played anything quite like this; I could repeat the (quite correct) observations others have made about the innovative combination of exploration platformer and point-click adventure game, but one comparison that kept (favorably!) coming to mind as I played was an old Sega Genesis game called Quackshot, of all things, primarily in terms of the exploration and the gradually-unlocked arsenal of trick bullets.\n\nHot Tin Roof is fun to *play*, in terms of the hopping and climbing and box-busting and puzzle solving, but what made me fall in love with this game within the first hour of play was the writing and the world-building. The game world has tons of atmosphere and charm, and the writing is top-notch; both the story and the dialogue (of which there is a ton, and it's all worth going through - you can't get stuck or punished for trying out a smartass reply) are as good as anything I've found in a game. The game is certainly cute, but that doesn't mean that the underlying mystery and themes aren't thoughtful.\n\nI do hope Glass Bottom Games gives us another chance to play in the city of Tin Roof and environs; there are a lot of characters whose lives after the end of the game I'd love a chance to catch up with. And an in-game minimap might be tricky to pull off mechanically, given the twisty-turny layout of the game world, but it would be much appreciated next time! ;)","July 7, 2015","true","9.8"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

And you may find things you couldn't before coming back to areas with new bullet types.\n\nBut be warned, if you don't like reading flavor text and prefer voice acting skiping over text, you will not get as much out of the game since it is all text which gives the game part of its fun, much like how a big part of CRPGs isn't the RPG part but the conversation trees part which is also very often text only without VO since there are a lot of tree options. And like CRPGs if you just do the main required dialog the game can be relitivly short but if you do all the dialog you can, it has a lot of good content there that takes more time.\n\n","February 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sutorei/recommended/253390/","sutorei","Sutorei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sutorei/","152 products in account","Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora is all about the fusion of seemingly incompatible elements into something unique.\n\nWhat do you expect from a game, when the first thing you see are detectives in fedoras and trench coats, working inside a dimly lit police station with wooden furniture and red carpets everywhere? Maybe some gritty story about a rotten-to-the-core megalopolis, full of injustice and corruption, ruled by undefeatable criminal masterminds?\n\nHowever, it cannot be so grim, one would think, when the protagonist detective is a boxy woman, her partner is a boxy cat, and they jump and wobble as they move. Moreover, their whole world is like that too - boxy and jumpy. This visual style is lively and memorable, if limited, but one would think: can it convey something beyond a wacky-zany-surreal adventure?\n\nAnd then the heroes get an urgent request to investigate a recent burglary, and, shortly after, a homicide case. The plot only goes grimmer from there, holding faithfully to the noir canon. It does not get bleak and depressing, thanks to the carefully mixed light-hearted humor in the dialogues and interactions, that manages to ease the mood, without turning everything into an outright comedy. Also, the city and the characters you meet are not doomed to the worst: there's a big freedom of choice, and you can help citizens via side quests - almost all of your actions will be acknowledged in the game ending.\n\nThe soundtrack helps game atmosphere greatly. When you play something noir, blues music with a juicy sax is necessary. In Hot Tin Roof that sax is accompanied by 8bit-ish synths - they fit in the ensemble as naturally as a xylophone or a rhodes piano would. The overall sound is chill and relaxing, and, with all the intricate sax solos, it stays in the background, as a good soundtrack should.\n\nThat chillout mood is perfect for the gameplay - there's nobody to fight and kill, with aimlessly wandering green blobs in underground areas coming as close as this game gets to enemies. Your trusty Wobbly revolver is for overcoming obstacles and exploring the game world, which has its fair share of secrets. You collect new types of ammo as you advance in the game, and in a good Metroidvania fashion, you can always revisit previously locked out areas and use your new toys to find something desperately needed or just helpful and interesting.\n\nAnd remember -  you don't have to reload your revolver chamber by chamber, hold R to instantly reload your current configuration! While this tip is present in the game, I wish it came by earlier.\n\nThe game world is, again, a fusion of 2D and 3D. For the most part, you navigate it as a 2D platformer, but you can switch planes and make turns at some points. This actually simplifies the comprehension of the locations, as instead of sudden and not always explainable screen switches, you have obvious connections between streets, passages, and shafts. Another important tip: if you stand on the edge of the platform and can't see what's down there, most of the time there's nothing and you'll fall back to the ground level if you jump there.\n\nThis experiment with mixing and fusing gameplay mechanics and styles results in a one-of-a-kind game, and it's well worth its price. As of today, Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora has roughly 7k owners according to Steamspy, and this rare gem deserves much more recognition.\n\nP.S.

The noir genre relies on good story-telling and it just seemed to be lacking in this game, but I guess that's due to the strong emphasis on the platformer puzzles, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nAlso, there are times when you can purchase items in the game. However, I found that it was very easy to mine for money early on, and once I bought most of everything that was available, money became useless.\nIt would've been really nifty if I had been able to bribe characters for clues or tips to progress a case or complete a side quest.\n\nIf there is a sequel for Hot Tin Roof (and I do hope there are plans for it because it was delightful!), I hope that Emma's cat partner, Franky, can do more than just act as a guide; I felt that at times she wasn't too helpful and she did get in the way when I fired the revolver, but she was good company.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and there is replayability value since there are various side quests to seek out and there are (from what I've read) around fifteen different endings.\n\nIf you like noir, cats, and puzzles that are more complex than what you'd find in Mario - I'd say it's worth a try!","April 16, 2015","true","19.3"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/txster/recommended/253390/","txster","txster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/txster/","854 products in account","Full disclosure: obtained a key to the game via the #GamesMatter initiative, with the only requirement that I comment about the game, good and bad opinions alike.\n\nShort version:\n\nGet it. It has rough edges at times, no it is not perfect, but I've played so much stuff in the last 30 years that I love stuff that is DIFFERENT, and this is cool, different and fun. Some will tag it 'metroidvania' but really it is its own thing. Is adventure sleuthing a genre ? Now it is.\n\nLonger version:\n\nI pondered a while if I should click YES or NO at "do you recommend this game".. As mentionned in the short version, the game does have rough edges, even outright bugs (being worked on, dev is really neat for that and so accessible both here and on twitter) but it has soul and it has style.. It is NOT a copy cat (heh) of anything, and I love it for that. It has a bit of a problem of meshing looking for clues/advancing the story and the platforming puzzles.. My mind would be in one of the two mode but rarely engaged in both at the same time. Part of this is that level stretch for too long for nothing, and that the camera is too zoomed in to be able to easily map out the universe in my head without an in-game map.\n\nDev has stated that a 2D map isn't easily done (since levels curve around here and there) and that a 3D one is totally out of the question (ressource wise, and with the excellent point that this was attempted and failed by the big N in Metroid Prime). Maybe street signs or just crude drawings of maps on the walls in game would have helped.. or maybe some type of fudged teleport systems to get to the underground city of Remington or in and out of dump.. So navigation was annoying, but you do get used to it after a while, especially when you have all the gadgets. If you have a problem with spatial orientation, getting around and exploring nooks and cranies could be an issue.\n\nWriting is fun and witty, even if the overall plot got a bit convoluted at times to me because chunks will arrive after long periods of platforming. Game could have done the classic adventure game 'characters on each side of the screen zoomed in' type of discussion maybe, at times it all felt tiny to read the speech bubbles, giving me the impression of chitchat even if important clues and infos were dropped.\n\nI've played the whole thing with a controller, and the platforming works just fine. The clue interface is annoyjing at times and for that I'd reach for the mouse for a second to go quicker. Most reviews will explain the gun ammo/reloading system and while it annoyed me for a while it wasn't that big of a deal in the end, but it'd be a lot better to clearly explain the quick reload option ! Thinking of other game with different ammo with the controller it could have been nice to skip the reload and switch ammo type with shoulder buttons, but the current system feel more thematic to the noir tone of course. On the puzzle side, having a fixed slot order could have helped in some spot where I wanted certain different type in a specific order. Nitpicking really.\n\nMore nitpicking: the clue interface and the options/save/quit panels should have been separate. Broke the immersion. Also list the timestamp on the save slot, since there's no indication if one is used at all or not..\n\nStill reading ? Tiny warts and all this is still good fun, plus is has cats with ties and guns that shoot bubbles to reveal secrets. And rocket jumping. You could do a whole lot worse in your gaming choices! I had played the dev's Jones On Fire (Android) and will most definitely look forward to their eventual next project.","March 1, 2015","true","7.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

And I enjoy mysteries.  I enjoyed these aspects of the game, and I do recommend it, but there are some caveats.\n\nThe concept of the different ammunition in the game is a great one, and makes the game simple, provides many possibilities for problem solving, and is kinda cool.  But the way it was implemented drove me bonkers.  When in a room and needing to use different ammunitions, sometimes the puzzle would require three or four of a particular type, then you would have to switch out to a different one (or two), do something with them, and then switch back.  Granted, I'm sure in hindsight that I could have streamlined that and analyzed the problem and come up with a more efficient ammunition usage, but who wants to do that?  Swapping out the ammunition is such an annoying mechanic, it would be much easier to put in some sort of ammo configuration and swap to it with a button or hotkey.\n\nStill on the ammunition, some of the proximity/mapping of where you are in relation to the target object is sometimes not very precise.  Trying to light something on fire sometimes takes three or four tries...needlessly frustrating.\n\nIf you watched my let's play of this series, I get quite angry with the controller response -- PLEASE do not take that as a negative on this game.  That was a problem with my PC that was registering a button press multiple times and just causing no end of frustration for me.  I finally figured it out, so the controller response was fine in the game, my only beef is with the mechanic behind the way you reloaded and chose ammunition for the gun.  There were a few spots where precision is required and I'll chalk my difficulties there to poor hand coordination and not knock the game on it.\n\nWith the exception of one puzzle, which turned out to be a side-quest, and not necessary to complete the main story line, the puzzles vary from easy to hard, but not too hard.  I think I relied on hints two or three times through the series, one of which was for the impossible-to-solve-so-I-didn't-side-quest, and in hindsight if I'd used common sense and had more patience I would have eventually solved them on my own.  There were a few "tasks" which I'll group into the puzzle category, that made you revisit the maze of levels in parts of the game I'd much prefered to not have to go back down into the bowels for, but it wasn't too onerus, just time consuming...would change that in a future game.\n\nI don't mean this in a negative way...the game was simple, and has a simple design.  That is part of its charm...there aren't all these different button combos, and it is a unique story and setting.  Aside from some of the criticisms above, I did enjoy this game.  If you lack patience, or are prone to give up on stuff if you get mildly frustrated, then this probably isn't the game for you.  But if you give it a chance, especially if you like cats (I don't, ironically), then I think you will get a lot of enjoyment from this game.\n\nIt's a simple, quirky, funny mystery with cats and guns.","October 12, 2015","true","19.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Comparisons to classic LucasArts adventure games seem to be plentiful in other reviews, and the long shadow of those luminaries can certainly be seen here. However that influence is mostly reserved for the story and humor of the game. The real meat is a much more contemporary hybrid of genres.\n\nThe story drops into the role of an investigator in a world rich with atmosphere and surprisingly deep in social structure. These details are presented by a plethora of NPCs throughout a somewhat open city. One of the major joys in the game is exploring the map, not for upgrades or collectables (those these are there), but for encounters with NPCs and further details about the goings on in the city. This was by far my favorite part of the experience, and those interested in a game with a quirky and unique voice in a noir setting should be very satisfied.\n\nMake no mistake, though, despite the early game being fairly straightforward with its navigation and story focused, the later part of the game features some rather challenging platforming sections. The shift to this focus seemed somewhat drastic to me, and the mechanics of it could have been better explained. It's nothing insurmountable, and it may not be an issue for most, but after settling into a story focused game I had to adjust my paradigm to platformer. In this regard, I should also mention that even though a gamepad worked well initially, I found I had to switch over to keyboard and mouse later because aiming precision suddenly became extremely important.\n\nOther complaints fall into the 'lack of polish' category. I encountered a few minor graphical glitches, and some more problematic mysteriously vanishing characters. More problematic to me, as it interfered with the story end of it, was how dialogue options don't seem to change according to story contexts unless they have to: sometimes you'll talk to a character from an earlier point in the game, hoping to get insight into current circumstances, only to realize they have no new dialog options forcing both them and your character to rehash seemingly nonsensical dialogue given the current circumstances.\n\nMost of that can be explained away because of a smaller budget and a small team. Indeed looking back at the stretch goals on the Kickstarter page (where I did back this game, by the way), one can see hopes for a much more ambitious project with even more depth and more areas to explore. Some of these skeletons still exist in the finished product, and there are hints that the game could see some expansion with the right circumstances. If that's the case, I can't wait to see what comes next, but for the time being I'm more than satisfied with this great little game.","February 23, 2015","true","8.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Right from the start it's incredibly endearing, filled with fantastic writing that both manages to be real and topical, and maintain an air of humour. The writing is top notch. Every character introduced is unique and by far the majority of them have something to amuse and entertain. Good writing and dialogue in games is incredibly important to me, and Hot Tin Roof never fails to satisfy or impress. The theme and setting are used perfectly, which combined with the wonderful music really makes the game an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe gameplay is basic, but that's in no way a bad thing. It's a non-violent Metroidvania, in which you gather new types of ammo for your revolver which in turn give you access to new abilities. The basic ammo lets you break boxes. The bubbles let you reveal secrets. The grappler lets you climb. Each time you find a new one, you're unlocking a new part of the world that you couldn't access before.\n\nThe world feels really big, too. Overwhelming at first, but you can quickly get used to it. This feeling returns every time you find some new location to explore as well, making everything even -bigger-. I would've appreciated a good map to go with the game; if there is one, I couldn't find it, which has you relying on memory to figure out where to go, where you've been. Like I said though, you'll learn your way around the place soon enough.\n\nIt's a good game, and the price is perfect. I recommend this whole heartedly. :)","March 2, 2015","true","1.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Thanks to #GamesMatter for the code!\n\nHot Tin Roof is an adventure-platformer with a unique premise. In a gritty (yet adorably rendered) town of Boxians, cats and rats, you'll investigate a series of crimes and attempt to unravel the criminal conspiracy threatening Tin Roof. Doing this requires interrogation, thought and good-old fashioned puzzle platforming.\n\nWhile the game exudes noir style and is very enjoyable, niggling control issues combined with occasional bugs (Old Town's "ghost" acid blobs caused the most problems for me) sometimes kill the pacing. The game is vaguely kid-friendly, but (as stated by the developers) is intended for adults. So, you'll encounter minimal hand-holding and some moral concerns such as scattered language.\n\nIn some cases this "hands-off" approach can be great (not having to go through a ton of tutorial text is a DEFINITE plus), but in others...Let's just say that especially in an age of gaming focused on increased accessibility, the lack of things such as objective markers or notes/hints of where to go/what to do next may frustrate some players. This is designed to appeal to a certain type of gamer--and HTF's over 1,200 Kickstarter backers show that this niche is pretty underserved.\n\nDespite any issues, I personally enjoyed my time with Hot Tin Roof and would recommend it overall--especially to Metroid or adventure fans seeking a title that tries something "new."","February 22, 2015","true","4.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

You'll find various tools to help you traverse these sections, and for (someone who doesn't get on with platform games generally) the game is fine with this in.\n\nThe strengths of the game lie in the story that unravels via the characters you meet, and also the artwork and the music.\n\nThe story unravels as you walk around the town, using a combination of dialogue interactions and puzzle solving to piece together clues.

Either way it's pretty fun to play. You play as detective team Emma and franky (the fedora wearing cat). There is a bit of a conspiracy to unravel, multiple endings to uncover, some little side quests to do along the way and even a super secret mystery easter egg to uncover that franky will love.\n\nI saw an article the other day on rock paper shotgun complaining that the murder mystery / police procedural in gaming largely comes down to point and click type games where you have a fixed path. This game demonstrates how a mystery game could be done. You are given the tools to follow a clue trail, and if you choose to ignore those it plays out differently than if you do you due diligence and gather the evidence. I like that there are multiple ways to do a lot of things that need to be done. Optional clues to uncover and secret entrances.\n\nIt would be great to see something like this applied on a much bigger scale with more mysteries to solve, where you could finish the game without even seeing half of the content.

The graphics are actually better than the screenshots/video convey - going past an alleyway there's all levels of parallax going on. I didn't see much help on this, so for those that have bothered reading my review, go to the restroom - that's how you save ("parp!"). The order of doing things so far has been quite linear, and you definitely have to ask Franky about clues if that's an option. Not sure if I'm putting inappropriate spoilers or hints in here, but I also recommend watching closely for those little white arrows that tell you if there's another area you can explore (this stumped me very early on). Love the atmosphere, the fact that cats feature very heavily and that it's a female protagonist (but that doesn't make any difference!). Ooh, and another hint for newbies - hold R to reload whatever you put in the barrel last time - saves a lot of clicking, and the game doesn't tell you this until later on. I got this on sale, as I wasn't 100% convinced, but if you like platformers, humourous (but not slapstick) games, a bit of retro and some lateral thinking, it's probably worth a punt.","August 14, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It pulled me in...! So, whereas a lot of the reviews I've seen on this seem to just be reflecting the first hour / general ambience, this one will hopefully be a little more in-depth.\n\nTHE PROS\n\nI really enjoyed the graphics, audio, and overall tone of the game. The noir tone delivers, and bouncing around the streets is enjoyable in itself. I like the revolver system - it's very creative, though I think the way it works will frustrate some people.\n\nThe music in particular is really excellent. Soaring horns and all that. It fits the mood perfectly, and feels done with a lot of love. I enjoyed a lot of the puzzles, and a few of them were really satisfying to solve in an old-school, what-the-hell-this-is-impossible-oh-wait-no-it-isn't kind of way.\n\nI also think the writing is really well done. But that brings me to:\n\nTHE CONS\n\nThe way that the narrative and writing itself is presented is difficult to follow. Doesn't feel like it was extensively tested on people who were going in totally blind. Characters have conversations that make references to things you don't know about, the clues you look at seem to follow huge leaps of deduction that are confusing, and you generally spend a lot of the game wondering if you missed something. Apparently I hit a bug somewhere along the way, but truth be told I was a little uncertain about what was going on the entire time.\n\nYou'll understand the broad strokes of the plot, and the dialogue really is good (and funny!) but when you reach the end, and your characters recap the case you've just solved, I think you will be bewildered by the people and events they suddenly begin making extremely detailed reference to.\n\nAt the same time, I don't think it's the writing - I think it's the interface and the design. I think it's the way that the conversation and clues system works. If you're able to stop and read every clue right as you get it and really make a non-metroidvania-esque effort to follow along, you might have a different experience.\n\nOVERALL\n\nI would absolutely recommend Hot Tin Roof. It does noir atmosphere and metroidvania gameplay really well. If you liked Jazzpunk, this one is a no-brainer. The characters are endearing and the writing is enjoyable - it's just shortchanged a bit by the way it was implemented.\n\nHave fun!","February 21, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The trouble is, as you go through the game, you begin to wonder if you are the one solving the mystery, or are you just there as a mouthpiece for your cat. I did experience some crashes from the game, and since there are save points in the game rather than manual saves, I did have to replay many sections to catch up to the progress I had made.The music is good, but songs stay the same on each section, so it does repeat quite a bit if you spend much time in any certain area.\n\nThe art style is a stretch for a Noire game, as this takes a more cutsie slant on what is traditionally a dark, gritty atmosphere. It tried to stretch the Noire adult theme too far, which hurts it overall. I go into more detail on this in the video review. An excellent example of this immature take on an adult style theme would be when you save the game and have to watch your character take a crap in a bathroom.\n\nYour partner in this game is a white cat with a hat. The cat has more of a presence on the board than your character does. It feels like you are the crazy cat lady who is always talking to her cat and asking them for help instead of using any intelligence to solve puzzles and put together clues. Every step of the story is reliant upon what the cat thinks about each clue, and you can't progress without her helping you. It takes away any sense of significance you might hope to feel as a detective, when the cat is more of a PI than you are.\n\nThe dialogue and character interactions are simplistic, watered down, and childlike. The game lacks a sense of purpose in your actions, and the progression. It is very chunky and stagnant, making it hard to feel any connection or immersion to your experience. The one thing this game did do well was it's platforming. which is ironically something they did not market it for.\n\nAs a Noire title, and as a detective game, it's a failure. It claims to be a detective game, but you don't do any detecting in the game. As a cutsie platformer game, it did okay.  I cannot recommend this game as what it proclaims itself to be is a  misleading, and  a lie.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/c/SocioPsycho","February 5","false","5.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You're a nonviolent police detective in a violent world of coldhearted murder, child abandonment, and forced surgery. Also, cats and birds and rats can talk.\n\nThis game focuses entirely on exploration. You're using new bullets you find for your revolver to bypass platforming challenges and find clues to navigate the intrigue of your (interconnected) cases. The characters are cute and likeable and the art remains striking and appropriate the whole way through. The soundtrack is fun and very listenable.\n\nEverything in this game fits together well, but it's got the rough edges of an indie title; if you're easily lost you'll have some trouble, as there's no map (and I don't even know how you'd map this game). There's a lot of backtracking through old areas to pick up new clues when you acquire new tools, which gets a bit old, and I had a few points where I wasn't sure where to go next.\n\nIf you're the sort of player for whom clever dialogue and fun exploration will make up for a bit of awkwardness in navigation and structure, check this game out.\n\nI was a Kickstarter backer.","March 23, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

After wasteing a good chunk of my time I gave up on it . Got the card drops and will never reinstall this again .It is not worth the curent sale  price  at 50% off !!!

Warning, it is NOT an adventure game, which is what i was expecting. I love noir. I love cats. I love lesbians. I love funny dialog. The creators have made a wonderful little world here that incorporates all of those things, unfortunately the game itself is a platformer. The kind of platformer that forces you to fall down the same hole and repeat the same room over and over and over till you get the timing perfect, and then when you finally get past, something kills you and sends you back to a checkpoint three rooms ago. There is so much promise here, but being forced to collect coins and jump around like a Mario brother is absolutely not my cup of tea. Only for die-hard platformer fans.","March 14","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The visuals aren't that indicative of the actions to take or of ways to proceed through the game, so I could have benefitted from a short tutorial before being released into the world (and I'm against tutorials, whenever possible).\n\nSome of the design choices are real game-killers for me. While it seems like a more "real-world" way of going about things, delivering the story through auto-advancing dialogue bubbles and forcing you to reload individual revolver rounds really detracts from the experience. I wish I could like it, but I don't think I can :(","November 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"
