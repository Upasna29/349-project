It starts off very easy, but things start becoming significantly trickier and more challenging as your progress (and also trippier). The game should not be judged by it's simplicity; the graphics may be very simple and minimalistic, but the game itself is rather packed with action. With it's content ranging from fireballs to lasers to absolutely terrifying monsters, Pertinence is free of repetitivity, the deadly sin many, many of it's kind seem to endlessly commit; ultimately and easily making the game one of the standouts of it's genre.","March 27","true","3.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Requires a lot of patience, as the gauntlets are tough, but I haven't encountered anything that felt impossible.\nIt also looks really, really slick.\nBrand new, and there are some bugs and UI issues, but nothing game-breaking. Well worth it.","April 20","true","6.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Trippy chiptunes which switch out instruments and movements based on what's going on in the room, including a horrifying red spider with vaccuum powers and dubstep. It's really tough and has some downright unfair runs that remind me of NES games, but I enjoy it in short sessions. The graphics and sound effects add to the minimalist and trippy theme, and I look forward to a soundtrack release.","March 27","true","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

But it keeps crashing for me every 15 minutes or so.  The crashing doesnt appear to be related to any actions I try to take in the game, just a periodic crash, windows 10.","April 3","false","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","2"

The game is fun, but very frustraiting, maybe if you belong to the select few who likes to torture your way past i wanna be the guy and games like that you will have the patience to finish some of the rooms.","March 26","false","1.4"," 6 of 25 people (24%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","24","6","25","4","2"
