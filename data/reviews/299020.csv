"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/299020/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account","Runaway Express Mystery is a decent HOG title and one of the earliest games coming from the relatively small Czech developer, Icarus Games. The game presents an interesting and well detailed supernatural storyline, ending up with a couple loose ends, convenient for developing future installation as series.\n\nAmanda Waters is a mother of two young children, visiting the nearby antique train exhibition to see Runaway Express, a famous locomotive hailing from early 1900s. It's all fun and games until the appearance of a mysterious engineer and the train taking off with Amanda's children on board! Determined to find her children, Amanda catches the train in last minute. From thereon, she'll meet many strange passengers on the train - long dead and lost in time. If she is to find her children, she should solve their mysteries and shed light into their stories first. With each new clues she gathers, Amanda gets closer to saving her children. Can she solve the dangerous mystery of Runaway Express, revealing the dreadful affair of its last journey and return her children home safely?\n\nAs you can once again observe, a loved one in danger + a supernatural mystery dynamic never fails in HOGs. This game is no different, aside the remarkably irritable personality of our protagonist. Amanda seems to be immune to fear or surprise, and amazingly fixated on finding her children only. She is a mother first and foremost, okay. But she embarks on a train, meeting corpses and travelling back in time for God's sake! She keeps walking around, reprimanding living corpses (!) and demanding explanations about the whereabouts of her children from them! It's amazing to watch her reactions and listen to her comments. This whole eerie setting has literally no effect on her. Once she is declared that the only way to save her children would be solving the mystery, she gets into the investigation yet keeps challenging the rules, looking for shortcuts all the way. The mystery itself doesn't concern the mother of the year. Talk about one track mind. Imagine your mother reprimanding Frankenstein's monster - that is Amanda Waters for you. Now that would be hilarious.\n\nVisuals are beautiful, and the atmosphere is appropriately rustic. Background artist knew what he was doing. Character designs are well done too. Talking animations of characters are a bit clumsy, but they have impressive facial mimics and body gestures. All characters are voice acted with clean cut accents. Listening to Evelyn's heavy Aussie accent was cute, for example.\n\nThe main attraction of the game is the investigation process for each new case about various passengers you meet. You walk around, gather clues about their pasts and try to solve their murders a century after their demise. You are expected to arrange your clues on a crime board, explaining the course of events. There are not many HOG scenes, but the ones that we have are short and easy to manage. Puzzles are mostly innovative and interesting. The train is huge - with a couple of visited stations along the way - and backtracking may become an issue if you are not playing in casual difficulty, but the map has a teleport function at least.\n\nThe ending was a bit anticlimactic, I won't lie. The mystery of the train is revealed alright - with a nicely arranged inter-relevant background story, but the nature of the engineer is not explained at all. It is hinted that this won't be the last time we'll be facing him as our enemy. Over all, Runaway Express Mystery is a good casual game for you to spare 3-4 hours and explore a nice story. Hit it when you'd feel like having a light reading on the mystery department.

(sigh, so sad)  In all good conscious I can not recommend this game, unless the developers fix this game stopper.  (There is a game fix listed in the discussions for good game hackers, unlike me who messed up my game so badly I had to erase everything and start over anyway.)  Also unsure if it is my computer or the game but there are severely lagging areas.  When Amanda first jumps on the train, and the background graphics are moving, everything lags severely.  This lagging occurs anytime Amanda is outside the train while the train is moving.\n\nThis glitch is avoidable so here it is where the glitch occurs for the intrepid or the just down right obstinate like me.  The glitch occurs in Budapest as soon as the gamer opens the bank safe.  Before you do anything, or even move, click on the vault and the gamer should get a photograph.  If you do not get the photograph for criminal evidence you have encountered the glitch.  Please understand this photograph occurs in the third segment of the game, and more then halfway through that segment.  So play this game at your risk.\n\nOther then this the gameplay is unique and interesting.\n\nStory: Amanda Waters (is the name the game automatically gives the gamer but the name is changeable) has brought her children, Peggy and Jimmy, to a train exposition.  The arrival of the train the Runaway Express is the highlight of the exposition.  While her children are on board they are not allowed to leave by a person in an iron mask and the train starts to leave the station.  Amanda jumps on board to rescue/save her children.  On the way she encounters three different crimes and must solve each one.\n\nGameplay:  A fair mix of Hidden Object finds and point and click gaming.  The Hidden Object finds, however, are not the usual list word finds.  The Hidden Object scenes are a combination of three different types of finds.  The first find type is the criminal investigation.  The gamer is given a magnifying glass, fingerprint power, a squirt bottle for finding blood stains and a flashlight for dark areas.  When using the magnifying glass and flashlight the game will state whether they are needed or not.  Finding blood stains is fairly easy as a find, since the game scene goes darker and the stains can be seen if looked for.  Otherwise just spray all over the scene like one has to do with the fingerprint powder until all of them are found.\n\nThe second type of find is silhouettes.  Find the object and click on it, easy enough.  Which leds directly to the third type of find, interactive.  If the silhouette picture stays this indicates that the item needs to be used somewhere in the scene.  Overall the Hidden Objects are not overly challenging, but not especially easy either.  They are a nice change of pace from the usual list finds.\n\nPuzzles: The few actual puzzles (not counting the point and click obstacles) are brain twisters.  Before my game glitched I encountered two quite worthy of the time and effort I put into solving them.  I would have to call them master puzzles since they are between the segments of the game or between major points in the game.\n\nI really would recommend this game if it were not for the game breaking glitch.  (I would even recommend it despite the lagging, though I would warn everyone about that.)  Too bad.  I wish I knew how to contact the developers so I could tell them about the glitch so possibly they would fix it.  That way I could change this "thumbs down" to a "thumbs up".","December 30, 2015","false","8.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","2"

I won't spoil ^^\nThe game is really well done, I really liked the graphics and the good music, the story is very well told too. The dialogues are fully voiced and it's rather well done. The characters are nice, the locations are beautiful and varied. Original thing: the evidence board, a special game mode where you piece up a story by collecting evidences, very cool. You have 3 cases to solve and you'll find blood stains, pictures, letters, etc. As far as HOG scenes, there's only the silhouette type where you have outlines of items to find, some helping you to find others etc. Pretty classic gameplay but it's very well done. You also have a forensic variant where forensic tools are also used to find some of the items (black powder for the fingerprints, flashlight to check dark places, etc). There's some mini games, really well done too.\nIt was short - 4 hours but I'm pretty fast with HOGs, so add an hour for a leisure playthrough. The short time length is also due to not having classic HOG scenes with lists of items.\nBig up for this game, it's very good and should not be missed by any HOG fan!","March 22","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

For a game with no save slots and no chance to backtrack, this is just unacceptable. Especially since the game tells me that I have everything I need to solve the case, but that's obviously not true as a quick Google search for others with the same problem showed.\n\nThe graphics were really pretty and the story ok. The map has fast travel, which I loved. It's only my second Hidden Object Game, so I don't know what's "normal", but the HO scenes have silhouettes you have to find and you must often combine items (Need a zebra? Find a paintbrush, use it on a white horse ...). Having to find fingerprints and blood splatter in each scene with some crime kit was just plainly annoying and made me abuse the hint option.\nI played it in Dutch to learn and noticed that not everything was translated - probably the same for other languages.\n\nOverall, I liked the game, but I won't restart it and risk getting stuck again.","July 11, 2015","false","8.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

The main character will have to solve some murder cases to help the ghosts of the train's passengers, visiting Paris and Budapest to gather clues and analyzing crime scenes. No achievements and some backtracking is needed but gathering clues and solving the HO scenes using detective tools is very interesting.","March 28","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At least it didn't crash, but the lags were enervating nonetheless.\n\nGenre-Type Scores:\n\nStory: + The story is ok. It's kind of Orient-Express with some more murders, which you have to solve. And at last find the final conflict to get your kids back. The devs could have made more with the story, but it's ok. Not a full winner, but at least a nice story.\n\nTechnical Realisation: + Could have been better, but isn't all bad. Strange is the problem with frequent lags, not during the cutscenes, but in the actual gameplay. On the good side is how the HOS were presented, they are like Crimescene Investigation Pictures, you have to use Luminol and Powder, a Magnifier and a flashlight... But actually this was too simple, just spread dust and spray around and you wind up finding the clues...\n\nExtras: 0 Sorry, no Extras present. This isn't a collectors edition and furthermore, the game is concluded after playthrough.\n\nOverall Rating: 4 + The game isn't that bad at all, just let's say it's a bit of a disenchantment here. The characters you meet during the game are good, the graphics are sometimes very beautiful, the story is ok... it's more the trouble with the protagonist and... well... kidnapping. You've seen this so often now in different games that it too, becomes more and more a burden - especially if the protagonist is kind of... well, Mary Sue... it's so cheesy all the time, but other games also have this problem.\n\nValue for Money: Low Basically a hidden object game with very limited replayability, the seven bucks do actually hurt. There are sales and bundles, if you want to play it try to get it cheap.\n\nConditionally Recommended\nThis game is more for hardcore fans of the genre, it also could be a good starting point for newbies - if they aren't familiar with HOG's. This mostly is the case because there are only a few Hidden Object Scenes around, and there is more sleuthing stuff, but this is better solved by any of the Nancy Drew stories - and Nancy Drew at least doesn't come along as a total Mary Sue. The game feels at times like an adventure light game, or casual adventure. And this is giving most of it's actual charm.","April 19","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
