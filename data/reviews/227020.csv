Yes graphics are better than those but that doesn't matter when you are not even looking. This is a "trade simulation", not an rts, fps or something like that which requires any graphics after all.  A few cities (excluding dlc, because i don't have it), a few items to trade the game becomes nothing of a challenge after 3 hours or so.\n\nPrice is damn too high also. I pre-ordered it for 40$ which i can easily say that it was the worst gaming decision i have ever made in my 18-19+ years of gaming. Maximum amount i would pay to this game after knowing what it really is is about 10$ and it is a "maybe".\n\nBUT if you don't have Patrician or Port Royale (Patrician 4 was better for trade i think) and have the money or this game is on sale, go for it. It is quite okay. But don't expect you will play it 2-3 hours a day for months or you will go back to it after 3-4 months. You play it for a few days, a few hours a day and game manages to bore the ♥♥♥♥ out of you.","November 25, 2013","false","12.3"," 194 of 235 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","194","235","3","0"

I played most of the economics titles with the exception of tropico which i will try someday. As for Port royale and Patrician , RoV follow the logic of the economy of Kalypso titles with enough difference to have its own title, you don't place building or expand your city size like Patrician or Port Royale. Everything takes place in the wolrd map , which is not a bad things as it saves tons of loading screens. RoV requires you not to play in '' God mode '' meaning if you scale back too much the map you will miss everything froms teachers to black market or chests floating around. With the DLC the map get a decent size, still much smaller than Port Royale but bigger than a Patrican map. In short if the others titles i mentioned pleased you in the past, RoV is for you. HOWEVER, and i must warn you all, there is a massive crash bug regarding Nvidia cards which as of July 25 2014 is not yet solver at all. Yes friends almost a year out and there is still a major crash bug unresolved with no news as of we are working on it.... If you are the kind of people getting angry at stupids bugs AVOID this game at all cost. The only thing that keep me going is my addiction to the capitalism system Kalypso titles gives us. Because of this i will not recommend this game to anyone. A TDR bug with one of the most popular 3d cards of the decade means a broken game that should not have been released.","July 25, 2014","false","47.7"," 87 of 106 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","87","106","0","0"

After being a long-time fan of the Hansa Tycoon series which were the Patrician games, I'd expect some flavour in a Venice-centered sim. Nothing but disappointment is what I found.\n\nPros: .Simple to play (if you like to play extremely simple games, it's a positive value)\n\nCons: .Economy ridiculously simple. Being a game of economic management, I see it as a major design flaw. Goods have the same standard prices all over the mediterranean; it doesn't matter where you buy them. The prices tend to stabilize as time goes by (and some occasional events like fires, etc). Offer and demand have little to do, other than on the very moment of buying/selling\n.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hulkdad/recommended/227020/","hulkdad","Hulkdad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hulkdad/","694 products in account","Quite a bit of negative comments for this game, though I believe largely undeserved. This is a trading/political (lite) simulator. The crux of the game is to further your personal success across a defined region. Many claim the campaign is too simple and after a few trade routes are established This may be accurate, however, the campaign is primarily a long tutorial, not desigend to be crushingly hard. The heart of the game lies in the Free Play mode through setting the world up and stacking the odds against you to begin with which gets increasingly fun, especially if you reach in to the dark corners of your mind and do some backstabbing and pillaging. It is most definitely a title built upon the foundations of the Patrician and Port Royale series, however, the steps taken to create a more fluid engine are very welcome. Seemless transitions into ports provides easier access to the game menus and provides a neat "tilt shift" effect to the world. If you are looking for a good trading simulator focused more on running your businesses than battling pirates Sid Meier's style, then you will fall right Rise of Venice.

It enables you to build up a grand empire from zero up, advance to political honors and get filthy rich.\n\nGraphics: Nicely done, do their job. Nice zoom-in/zoom-out function. 8/10\nSound: Not groundbreaking, but OK. 7/10\nMechanics & Gameplay: One of the strong sides of the game. Nice trading system, OK combat mechanics with some tactical depth. Interface works very well after a brief learning curve. 9/10\nLong-term motivation: Here is the point that I found weak. After some hours the game got repetitive. I felt as if I had achieved enough money to get more or less what I wanted. Only I couldn't motivate myself to do it anymore, as it now felt pointless. In contrast to other "endless" building or build/fight/think games, such as the Guild, SimCity 4, X3:AP, I didn't have any goals that I badly wanted to achieve then... 4/10\n\nSo, do I recommend this game? Yes, I still do! It's a well balanced, atmospheric sandbox. I would not recommend buying it at the current standard retail price, though.

Static production locations.  Static prices (dynamically computed, but the cricumstances basically never change).  One or two kinds of random events that increase sale prices for a moment.\n\nThe most interesting part is when you can program your own trade routes, and there is a lot of configurability in how to you load/off-load to your warehouses and how you buy amd sell, but for reasons that defy the imagination, this is done via an interface that doesn't let you see a) all of your instructions for a city at once (how much was I buying here again?), b) what the other cities on the route produce or demand at the same time, or c) what the going rates are for such goods or how much of each goods are in stock at the time.  Basically, I think a real Venetian trader in 1455 with a few parchement sheets and some chalk and tablets would have had an easier time controlling his fleet.\n\nThe game is thus reduced to programming your obvious trade routes "through a straw" and hoping for a mission as exciting as "Rome needs dyes".  Oh, and there are naval battles but you'll want to automate them anyway.  Except the campaign insists that you play some of them.  So there's that.","December 29, 2013","false","10.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","2"

As both games share the same main gameplay principle, playing both simultanously didn't work for me. I recently started thinking about going back to Port Royale 3, but then I remembered I haven't given Rise Of Venice its rightful chance yet, so I started playing this instead. As evident by my play-time counter (almost 30 hours, as of writing this review), I got hooked very quickly, just like with Port Royale 3.\n\n\nSimply put, Rise Of Venice is a trading simulator with some strategy and political elements. The idea is to build your business empire by building businesses in cities, and trading the goods between them by your naval fleet. Just like in the real world, there are politics involved, as your competitors have their own agendas and interests, which hardly ever align with yours.\n\nJust like with Port Royale 3, there's a story-driven campaign, which I believe is the best way to start the game. Except in Rise Of Venice, the campaign feels much more than a mere tutorial. I've actually found myself enjoying the plot and the missions presented to me, and was disappointed to finish it. I really wanted it to go on. :)\n\nAfter the campaign, the game turns into a "Free Play", where you continue to build and maintain your empire. You still get missions, but there's no deep or interesting story behind them, as there was in the campaign.\n\nAll in all, I really love this game, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes this type of games.","April 17","true","39.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Basic Graphics, basic gameplay and gameinstruction who makes me think this game was menth for children (Or maybe they think we are dumb). The game has a Limited map With few cities to trade from. Not that it matters how many citites there are, as they all look the same and you just dont need going far to make decent trades.

Rise of Venice is almost an identical clone to Partician and Port Royale.  The major difference comes down to the maps.  Rise of Venice original covers the area of the world Genoa and east while the Gold version extends to the Portuguese coast of the Mediterannian.\n\nThe game is broken down into ships (convoys), businesses (production buildings), and warehouses (where you manage resources).  The game can overly overwhelm new players to the sub-genre but it comes with an excellent single player that breaks down the game.  The single player campaign can take up to 20 hours to complete while the free play will be worth another 100 hours.  Add in the Challenge Mode and you are looking at a grand total of 160 hours of gameplay in this game.\n\nUnlike previous titles the game has improved ship combat.  However, all ship combat is mouse based.\n\nFor what you're paying the game is well worth your time.  It's not going to be your most favorite game in your library, but it will be one you will find yourself unable to simply quit.","March 11, 2015","true","188.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I am not all that familiar with this genre but i have played Patrician IV and this game is extremely similiar to that game in almost everything except the setting. The game is certainly prettier and die hard fans could probably name thousands of ways that the games are different but i found the games to be so similiar that i would have been really disappointed if i had paid a whole lot of money for it.\n\nLuckily i did not and if you have not played Patrician IV then there is no reason for you to care. But people who have should know about this.\n\nNow concerning the game itself. I really enjoyed my time with the game at first. The game should should be pretty easy to get into both for newcomers and old fans and it is really fun at first to travel the Mediterranean Sea buying low and selling high. Setting up trade routes, building industry and expanding your trade empire is really fun and relaxing but the game is just way too easy.\n\nYou really have to try to fail at making money and after a couple of hours you should have been able to set up some trade routes which basically makes you a bunch of money without you having to do anything. There is a bunch of stuff to do in the game but it all comes down to making more money and it is often more time consuming than it is challening.\n\nSure you can produce your own wares to increase your profit margin which means that you have to make sure that your factories have the required raw material and so on. But why would you do this more than once only to increase the profic margins that are already good enough.\n\nSure you can try to make some more money to buy some new ships and create an extra trade convoy but you have already done this a bunch of times and the endless loop of making more money so that you can make more money gets old.\n\nI found the game lacking in having interesting stuff to spend your money on. Some people might be satisfied with simply making money so that you can make more money but i found that really boring after a while and there really was not anything there to keep my interest after that.\n\nOh and the naval combat is crap. It controls really odd and for some strange reason the devs decided to take away the slowed down speed modes in the combat. So the combat is really fast and i thought that it turned into a hectic mess. You can also only control one ship at a time and the ai takes control of the rest. This is functional for normal sea battles but it turns into a mess when you have to sail around and try to catch a ship so that you can board it.\n\nI have probably sounded quite negative about the game but i absolutely do not dislike it. It is a charming and simple game about trade and i would recommend it to people who is looking to spend some hours doing just that. But i did not find the depth in the game to keep me interested after a couple of hours and you should probably take that into consideration when thinking about the price.","September 26, 2015","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a trade and economic simulator it is entertaining but when you try to choke out your competition by using war and espionage this game is severely lacking. Naval combat in particular is unsatisfying especially when you are trying to blockade a port to strangle trade. The biggest convoy size you are able to put together is 3 ships while the coms are not limited to this and frequently come at you with convoys of 5 ships. Granted this is to combat AI being unable to make strategies like a human player but when you are fighting over a reef which negates your ability to manouver while the AI is not hampered by the reefs. Espionage is also unsatisfying and is never a good idea to use in this game as it is only good for kicking the hornets nest inviting your enemies to all start sabotaging you back negating any possible benefit in terms of reputation gain.","August 26, 2015","true","82.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

WIth Rise of Venice we get a beautiful looking game with some nice features.   Its fun right up until you understand that the game plays itself, it really doesnt need you.\n\nOnce you automate 2 seperate convoys you will be rolling in money and the difficulty of the game is gone.  To be blunt it feels like this game was shipped about 6 months too soon in its development cycle.  Some of the features wernt really that well thought out.\n\nIt still plays and is a fun time, just know you arent going to stick around long and will forget it quickly.","July 19, 2015","false","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
