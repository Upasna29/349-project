Be it by meleeing them to death, or reaching the top of the building first.\n\nYou have two main controls: Jump and attack. However, there are a few things that mix things up to allow you to strategise. For example, while running on a bigger piece of debris, it will tilt more. The more vertically tilted the object is, you will launch high once you jump. You can also hold the jump button for when you land on tiny pieces of rubbel to get an extra bounce. Using your attack button, you can either directly hit opponents away, or knock small debris into them.\nWhile you play, your special meter also charges up, which allows you to either do a special jump or attack by double tapping the corresponding button.\n\nThe game is most fun with friends, although you can also play a singleplayer campaign which has you going from country to country, fighting different opponents. Street Fighter style. There's also a bit of dialogue before each fight.\n\nThere isn't too much variety within content to keep you playing for long. You can choose different looking maps, and alter the height of the building, and there are only 4 characters to choose from, which all seem to play the same.\n\nOverall, don't get it expecting tonnes of hours of gameplay, but it's still a fun and simple game to play a few rounds of whenever your friends come over!","October 15, 2015","true","0.5"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

This is due to a lack of variety in the game especially with the combat. While the game has two combat buttons, both attacks appear to do pretty much the same things so there isn't a lot of variety in the combat. If the game had more variety in the combat I think the game could have been a lot better.\n\nThe platforming aspects of the game are not bad. The platforming controls work well for the most part. I liked the fact that you could jump higher off debris that was more vertical. The problem is that it feels like you need to either focus on jumping up the building or attacking the other players in any given round since it is too hard to do both.\n\nI had some fun with the game but after about a half hour I was getting tired it. If you are going to play the game I would highly recommend playing against other players instead of the computers since the computer AI is not always the greatest.\n\nIf you generally like these type of games and have some friends you can invite over I think you can have some fun with SkyScrappers. If you find the game in a sale you could do a lot worse.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy of the game from the developer.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","October 16, 2015","false","0.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I really don't mind losing that much against most of the characters (especially not the mysterious Jessica) but there is something about that artistocrat smugness that really gets to me. I'll keep at it though, honing my skills until I become the ultimate SkyScrapper. And then Phileas... then I'll hunt you down. And I will kill you.\n\nSeriously though, get a bunch of friends with controllers over and this is great competitive fun (even if you lose).","October 16, 2015","true","16.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
