However, it is not overly different to the first.\n----\n\nI purchased this game due to the premise - an anime style ninja platformer (if that makes sense). However, it was a little bit underwhelming and disappointing.\n\nGameplay is pretty much how you would expect your normal platformer - it is nothing special. There are 3 levels in each stage, with the last being a boss battle. Each level gets more difficult as it goes along (as you'd expect). Whilst what you get here is nothing too bad, very few new gimmicks are introduced as you go along (certainly no new enemies (excluding bosses) in the second and third stages), making gameplay seem a little monotonous at times. The secret ninja technique mechanic is ok, but it is a shame that these cannot be used in the boss fights and that there aren't more to unlock or use (I seem to only ever use one).\n\nControls are unfortunetly clunky and still feel a little slow despite the update. There is no tutorial - and as far as I am aware the keyboard controls are a little odd. Despite using an xbox controller, controls in some areas are a bit tempermental; this is especially the case with the wallhang aspect, whereby getting a bit close to a wall sticks you to it, leaving you to either slide or jump umpteen steps in the opposite direction. These controls ultimately (and unfortunetly) affect gameplay, making it difficult to dodge in some situations and leaving some areas a little bit tedious to navigate.\n\nIn other areas, the game is adequate but not excellent. Graphics are standard, with some areas featuring tiling that is a touch too obvious. Sound works but is nothing special. Cutscenes are relatively uneventful and slow, and can be a little slow to skip.\n\nAll in all, it is and little things that let this game down - it just needs a bit more usability and polish. Every time you die or which to retry, you have to do so from the level menu; I'd be more inclined to continue playing if there was a restart button on the menu or game over screen. Likewise, there could be more options changing sound volumes in game. Again, bosses could be better - the first two bosses were both disappointingly repetitive affairs, especially as one critic outlined them as "impressive and fun".\n\nWhilst nothing special was necessarily expected from this game, the controls and little usability things prevent it from being a decent game. That is not to say it is a bad game - some people will definitely find some charm within and with the game as cheap as chips it might be worth a look. However, I can't say I got a great deal of enjoyment from it - whilst the premise has potential, the overall controls and execution of the game could be a lot smoother.","May 2, 2014","false","2.4"," 220 of 286 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","220","286","0","17"

Many of the reviews I see here are pretty negative about this game. I myself have a hard time to see something bad with this game.\n\nIts your standard generic story about somebody trying to save somebody they love from sudden generic badguys. We can call it "the Mario concept" exept that instead of being some dude trying to save a girl you are instead a ninja girl called Akane and you need to save some dude she loves. Each level is filled with enemy ninjas and dogs that are trying to stop Akane from reaching her loved one. There are also alot of cool bosses that you need to beat. They all got different patters that you need to learn and are over all unique and fun in their own way. The levels offer a great variety and keeps you wanting to know whats coming next.\n\nAkane can throw kunai's and walljump pretty easy. She also got 3 jutsus that she can use and they are all different. One throws alot of kunai's in one direction and the second one makes alot of kunai's rain down nearby and my personal favorite is the one that shoots kunai's in all directions at the same time.\n\nThe music is really great and atmospheric and has a good variety.\n\nOther then that the game is kinda hard at times and can be really challenging at certain moment. You pretty much need to be ready for the challenge this game gives you. Do not get fooled by the first 2 levels. It gets harder then that.\n\nI give this a 10/10. Feels alot like an old game that you would play on your 8-bit but at the same time if feels really fresh.","October 21, 2014","true","15.9"," 75 of 97 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","75","97","4","7"

Though I suppose I'd find it pretty hard to move effectively if I had two watermelons bouncing around on my chest, making the simple act of walking across a room an involved procedure as you desperately attempt to deal with the sheer uncontrollable force of your own momentum. Making matters worse are dozens of the worlds second dumbest ninjas, who patrol around in obnoxiously difficult to reach places while starring at you like you're a harmless circus animal jumping through hoops.\n\nAnd that would be somewhat accurate, though there are rather a lot less giant flaming rings and many more exceedingly dull platform layouts and cheep traps. Checkpoints apparently missed the cut and to seal the deal an agonizingly long death screen makes retrying levels far more tedious than they had to be. Not that you ought to bother starting over, mind you. Akane never gets better through its five worlds, instead becoming so outrageously cheap and difficult that I confess to having abandoned ship on the second to last level.\n\nWhat I'm getting at here if it wasn't incredibly obvious, is Akane the Kunoichi is rather outrageously incompetent. It feels like someone ripped a platformer template out of their rear, painted some very ugly textures all over it, and then spent the rest of their time carefully animating the lead characters breasts. Because that's what really matters in a platformer: boob physics.","December 2, 2014","false","2.0"," 63 of 80 people (79%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","79","63","80","14","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/recommended/291130/","shikono","Elfee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shikono/","382 products in account","Akane the Kunoichi is a classical platformer (singleplayer).\n\nGraphic:\nSimple 2D graphic. It kinda looks like a mix out of an old retro game and ANIME. Anyways even it’s made so simple it’s still really cute designed (especially the „Maneki Neko“ the Chinese beckoning cat). There's not much enemy variety, but that's compensated with the awesome level design and funny Chinese details.\n\nControls:\nThe controls are a bit extraordinary and seem to be initially clunky, but are actually perfectly responsive once you get used to it.\nAh by the way (if you buy the game) you also have to use WASD (up, left, down, right) and K for Enter (L = Back) in the main menu!\n\nStory / Gameplay:\nYou play as the ninja girl Akane who seems to adore her master Goro a bit (looked for me like that from the intro lol). Suddenly Goro got kidnapped by the evil Hiromi.\nTo rescue Goro you have to find a way through 15 stages. You have to fight against common enemies, to climp and jump and of course with the last part of a stage theres always a boss battle. If you want to make all the achievements you also have to collect all kimonos. You should use your 3 different ninja techniqes just when needed because you have a limited number of scrolls which you need for the special attack. So if it‘s just one enemy or two you can also throw one random „Uchi ne“ (it’s a bit like killing people with dart ^^).\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend this game for everyone who likes platformer, anime, ninja or China/Japan because this game is really simple but has the named elements in it which makes it sympathetic. Besides it just costs 2,99 €! That’s really cheap and a fair price for the game. PLUS you also get Steamtrading cards in this game which you can sell or use for crafting a badge.","July 23, 2014","true","1.7"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

However there are far too many flaws to make the playability of the game worthwhile.\n\nThe reviewAkane the Kunoichi is a game about a turn of a cliché, whereas the bachelorette spots an arguably fine man, and desires for his romance. However to her discomfort, he was abducted before her eyes and she was destined to save him.\n\nAnd that is it for the storyline. It's more of supposedly a fast-paced adventuring game, where you'll overcome its hinder. Although the game is awfully obtuse, the response timer for the controls is horrid.\n\nControlsThe game do have controller support that works pleasantly well, if it wasn't for its response timer which doesn't differ from the keyboard. It does however have no mouse-support whatsoever.\nThe controller used in this situation was a genuine Xbox 360 wireless controller.The movement and its animations consist of running in adequate speed, crouching, jumping and clinging onto vertical surfaces. The latter is my biggest issue, as soon as you reach a vertical surface, you're stuck onto it and glides slowly downwards. You may hold down the movement key in order to slide faster, but you're unable to release yourself from the wall, unless you dramatically repel yourself away from the surface.\nThis is rather troublesome as when you're jumping onto a platform edge and didn't jump high enough, you instead cling yourself to its vertical surface, and you'd have to either jump away from it so you'll additionally have to run back to get on top of that platform, or simply allow the protagonist to slide down until she reaches the ground for another attempt to jump ontop of it.\n\nThe process is so unforgiving when there's gamemodes that consist of you being chased and have to run away from the chaser from devouring you.\nAnother thing that concerns many people is that once you're on a wall, you basically have to double-tap or triple-tap the jump button while directing the character to the opposite direction in order for it to detect your movement. This is a controls-issue regarding it being semi-unresponsive. Making the jumping wall to wall a very uncomfortable experience.\n\nCombatYou attack enemies with endless supply of kunai throwing knives. You also have got three special abilities where you Throw a circle of kunais around you\nRain down kunais from above in one single layer\nThrow a large wave of kunais from the direction you chooseThose special abilities requires one kakemono to perform, and you normally start off with three of them.\nA kakemono is a japanese wall scroll.Then there is a sort of power-up item that can be picked from smashing those porcelain kitten statues, each power-up provides additional kunais during your default attack. It builds up by starting with one kunai, then three, then four,  five, etcetera, etcetera.\nUpon being damaged you'd backpedal on the power-up, basically if you were throwing four kunais at the time, and then got damaged by an enemy, you'd after that be throwing three only again.\n\nNow having said all that above, they're all disabled during the boss maps, meaning it completely drains its entertainment value. All enemies apart from bosses takes three hits to die, apart from dogs, that are immortal.\nYou're forced to fight the bosses with only your one throwing knife default attack for enhanced challenge I suppose. But where's the fun in building up the power when you cannot fight the boss with these? Speaking of...\n\nEnemiesThere are four different kinds of hostile generic enemies and then five bosses, one boss for each act.\nOne is a casual ninja, dressed in forest green and bronze outfit, moving back and forth only. Another is an improved version, dressed in orange and navy blue outfit, that throws kunais as well, highlighted in red. And the third one is a monk dressed in black robe and concial hat, which they use as throwing weapon as well. It acts like a boomerang, spins forward and returns to its bearer, before they decide to repeat the attack while they're still alive. The last but not least are the dogs, they run remarkable faster than the other enemies and grabs onto you and drags you along for a bit until it drops you on the ground and takes away one heart from you.\nThese should only be avoided by jumping over.\n\nThe boss fights are very linear as expected, however some of them can be rather dull than others. For me it was the specifically the act 2 boss. The fight consisted of you'd lure the boss to hit you with its sword, that he'd normally be covering his face with. The face is his only weak spot, you'd have to back up as he swings his sword, and then attack his face and repeat the step. As I counted, it takes literally 43 times of the exact same attacking motion, under the course of approximately three minutes to defeat the boss. The boss is very slow as well.\n\nThe slightly gamebreaking issueNow my biggest problem with this game is the time. In every act you run, there's a timer that ticks down. You may find an hour glass to increase the time with set of seconds, but the problem however is that sometimes you'd have to go through a cutscene. The cutscenes plays out by itself, you can't control anything nor skip it. The protagonist start to walk slower and then awaits the approach of whoever it might be, before the battle begins.\nDuring the cutscene, the timer actually still ticks down. It doesn't freeze.\n\nDuring a bossfight I had, I was able to defeat the boss with 0:05 left on the timer. Then it procceeded to go through a cutscene showing I have unlocked a door that would allow me to finish the map. But the timer ticked down to zero, and once the cutscene was over my character died and I'd have to restart the whole map since I did not finish in time.\nNow what the f*ck.\n\nLet alone the respawn timer is awfully protracted, that it is literally faster to pause the game, hit Exit, and enter the map selection screen and start the map that you were currently in.\nThis contradicts the purpose of it being a fast-paced game.\n\nThe verdictThe idea of the game is worth a smile, the soundtrack during bossfights are fairly inspiring, it does enhance the adrenaline. But there are far too many crucial aspects of the game that is flawed, deceiving the game from being playable I'm afraid.\n- And the achievements are easy to achieve, you can achieve them all in one go, if you bother to withstand the tedious gameplay.","December 4, 2015","false","5.4"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","0"

For starters the level design is horrid and constantly forces you into a trail and error process. Platforms that move and fall have very questionable collision detection. Those that fall are not distinguishable from other normal platforms and never respawn causing to restart the level without warning. The controls are unforgiving and the stick-to-wall mechanics take some getting us to. Put this all together and you get some very frustrating experience that I cannot recommend.","October 15, 2014","false","7.9"," 39 of 50 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","39","50","0","0"

If you die, you restart from the beginning.\nEnemies are attack pattern based as well as bosses.\nPlattforming may feel unresponsive at first, but once you get the hang of it (Akane's plattforming is not speed-based precision plattforming) they get the job well done and provide you with enough precision to get all the collectables (especially in the last 3 levels).\nKeeping that in mind, I highly recommend Akane to everybody who remembers or is interested in classic gaming era style games.","July 19, 2014","true","7.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

Players will engage in some platforming, do quite a bit of wall-jumping and give enemy ninjas, dogs, and monks everywhere a kunai makeover. Each of the five zones ends with a boss-fight. You know what to expect: There’s a large foe with a lot of hit-points and they’ve got a couple ways of getting rid of Akane. Unlike a surprising number of platformer-heroes, Akane is thankfully the sturdy type and can take four hits before dying horribly, causing the act to restart. There are some pieces in the level designs that are questionable at best. As with a lot of other games, some of the worst-designed levels can crop up towards the end. Akane the Kunoichi, ultimately, isn’t bad; it’s just not great. The controls could use a bit of work, the level-design could be a bit more solid and maybe the enemies could be at least somewhat threatening. On the other hand it is nice to have an adventure that doesn’t push itself too hard and create something truly awful.","September 19, 2014","true","62.1"," 21 of 29 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","21","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/291130/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Imagine a game where you play as a ninja. What kinds of things do you do? Do you leap nimbly from rooftop to rooftop, strike silently from the shadows, and vanish in the blink of an eye? Or do you plod around slowly, bump into pacing bandits, and collect ugly kimonos? Because if the latter sounds good to you, boy do I have a game you'll love.\n\nThe game opens with a bunch of tiny women in kimonos and Akane swooning over some dude who gets whisked away by some witch lady. I guess you're trying to get him back by platforming through 15 levels, and impress him by finding three of the same ugly kimono in each level. That's pretty much all the direction you're going to get, and the kimono thing is optional. Along the way you'll have to throw tons of knives (your only attack) at tons of bandits, monks, and dogs. You can find power-ups for your knives, health, and magic (lots more knives) by breaking lucky cats scattered willy-nilly like bricks in Super Mario Bros.\n\nLevels are bog-standard fields, forests, and castles, with one background and one floor texture apiece. Akane really looks like a game made using an open-source tileset, with enemies tweaked to be more ninja-y and Akane to be more top-heavy. Every third stage has a boss that attacks in such challenging patterns as "drops things from ceiling" and "jump over when he charges". Everything in the game moves with the same sticky jumps and molasses slowness so there's not much challenge other than the threat of dozing off. I wish I could tell you how Akane's tale ends but I could only take about thirty minutes of zero-effort level design and boilerplate platforming. Actually I lied, I don't care how the story ends, either.","February 18","false","0.5"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","18","25","4","0"

(They start off as WASD + something on the right side of the letters, but I rebound them to arrow keys + ZXCASD very easily.)\n* level design on boss stages: bosses themselves are easily accessible, so you can practice on them, without going through the rest of the stage.  Basically, you can separately practice getting the kimonos and beating the bosses.  This is good stage design.\n\nNot-so-good points:\n* Basically everything in the game moves too slowly:\n* * Left/right movement momentum effects, making it so that you can't turn or stop quickly.\n* * Akane grabs the wall if she runs into it while moving downward, and doesn't ungrab it even when you let go of the direction facing the wall, so you can either slide down slowly or slide down somewhat more quickly (if you press down), but you can't just drop down.  (Strangely, boosting off of a wall causes Akane to move much more quickly.)\n* * Level complete screen animation and music just takes too long to play out.\n* * Game over sequence also takes too long to play out, considering how easy it is to fail a stage.\n...So in general, it doesn't feel like you're playing a ninja.  You don't get to enjoy the agility of a ninja...though it's not like the enemy ninjas do either.\n* Edges of platforms should be drawn so that they don't stick out beyond their hitbox (or don't stick out that much).  This applies mainly to the forest area.\n* Bug: If you are in a corner and there is water flowing against you, you can't simply move left/right out of it.  You can only jump out of it.  (Please post a comment if this is fixed; then I will remove this item.)\n* Soundtrack doesn't loop properly -- it fades out then restarts.

The gameplay is simple (jump, basic attack, special attack) and the difficulty is increasing after each act. The first act looks like a tutorial and, in the end, the fifth and last act is quite challenging : there is no doubt that you will die a lot before reaching the end of the game.\n\nYou may need between 2 and 3 hours to get all of the kimonos in the game, which will result in 100% achievements !

Through world 3 it seems to have a base set of enemies that are put in different patterns across the stages. Each world has 2 levels and then a boss stage, which may also include some platforming and regular enemies. Also stages all hold 3 specialty items that need to be collected for the best ending, I believe. Levels are timed, so collecting the items and completing the stage takes a little skill--although if you collect pieces and beat a stage, you keep them. You don't need to collect that particular piece again if you rebeat it for others. The pieces provide some incentive to explore around--as to hidden powerups.  Stage design is nothing revolutionary but enjoyable, mixing things up enough to keep you thinking.\n\nIn terms of gameplay Akane does move slow compared to say Ryu or the unnamed protagonist of Mark of the Ninja. This doesn't fundamentally hamper the game in my opinion. Enemies generally move slower as well, so the pacing overall is slower. In terms of the wall-jump, there are times where you will stick to a wall you didn't want to stick to. However, its relatively easy to recover from as you can press down to slide off quickly or jump off. Wall-jumping, like regular movement is slower than other Ninja games I have played. But again it is a slower paced game. I will say I have only played with my 360 controller and I have not tried using the keyboard.\n\nMusic is adequate and not repetitive or obnoxious and the story is minimal. Mostly I bought this for action-platforming and have been happy with that decision. It doesn't turn the formula on its head but delivers enjoyable level design and some clever bosses. Collecting the specialty items present another challenge as some require a bit of thought on how to get there and get back. The game itself is not very long, I am slow to progress through games and halfway through at 2 hours, which includes some backtracking. I recommend this game for those looking for a fun, straightforward action-platformer. Gameplay is simple kunai and jumping for the most part, but level design and different elements in the worlds keep it interesting.  If a slower paced game of this stripe is really not your thing, then you may want to pass.  For everyone else, given the price its a fun, short romp with some clever elements and small challenges to keep you engaged.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Comments\n\nSeems the first few reviews weren't that thrilled with this game. I just beat the first two worlds and had a lot of fun. I think the game-speed is a little slow, but this isn't Mark of the Ninja where you have to kill enemies in seconds or be exposed, its just a good old action platformer. The level design thus far is enjoyable and the bosses I fought were clever. There are collectables and power-ups that encourage you to explore around. For the price, if you like old action-platforming games its worth checking out from what I've seen.","May 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 49 of 85 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","49","85","0","1"

The controls get a little taking use to, but then it became second nature for me. I used an xbox 360 controller. The game is very simple yet had some challenging moments. The artwork and style is what drew me in. A lot of games that come out get too complicated, as I grew up with old school games. This brings me back to my childhood. I usually struggle to complete games because they're too lengthy and have too many different abilities to remember. This game was just right and great for the price.

A bunch of girls are stalking this guy Goro as they all adore him - even Akane, our heroine secretly loves him but stays in the back. He gets kidnapped however, and it is up to Akane to save him.\n\nThe gameplay is responsive and fluent, but being a ninja; Akane can cling to walls and slowly slide down on them and perform wall jumps if walls are close enough. She attacks primarily by throwing kunais and can use secret ninja scrolls, having a selection of 3 ninja arts; wether it be kunais shooting at all directions, death from above or devastate anything left or right.\n\nThe music fits the mood and overall it's pretty fun; although you best have patience - the wall-cling takes some time getting used to and there is no true game over, but dying means starting the whole level over. No checkpoints, but I feel that's fair given the short length. Each chapter consists of three acts where in the third a boss awaits.\n\nI recommend the game - the difficulty ramps up as the game progresses as the final levels made me die a lot in comparison to the first act which was a cakewalk and it's an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe last thing to mention are the kimonos. These make you take longer and risky routes to get, but they make a notable difference: The ending.\n\nAs most people can expect; defeating the final boss has Akane kneel infront of her master Goro - the mission is complete.\nHowever...\n\n\n...if Akane can assemble all of the kimono outfits; she will have these jump in after defeating the final boss and dress her up; winning the love of Goro.\nNow that, was pretty cute and felt worth my time.","January 26, 2015","true","4.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I have a lot I could say about the game, but for those with little time or attention spans, I'll be breif. Its a good enough game for the price. It isn't amazing or even that great. But it isn't bad. It is just solid. The price is cheap enough for this to be ok, but I do wish it had more to it. The game is not shovel knight, or briad, or super meat boy, or any other big indie title like that. But its a good enough game for the price. The gameplay is solid and the controls work well. The Music sucks. Plain and simple it just is bad. Turn it off and turn something else on. The visuals are classic. The boss battles are the low point. The stages dont let you use your special moves and to actually fight the boss is tedious. It isn't about skill or finding the pattern. Its all about hitting it in just the right place at just the right time. All within a short time limit. Overall though, it is an ok game and worth picking up for the price.\n\n[UPDATED REVIEW] So the new update seems to have fixed all my issues. The slowdown was what was killing my game. Akane was unable to jump high enough due to the lag, but now that the game runs at the normal speed she is actually able to jump up and complete the level. Of course I still have a lot of game to play before I can make a final review, but so far the game is exactly what I wanted out of it. Its a fun retro style game with a ninja. For 2$ its not a bad deal.\n\n[ORIGINAL REVIEW] The game looks like a fun game designed like a classic SNES game, but for some reason it runs much slower than the trailer shows despite that I have more than the reccomended requirements. Also I can't seem to progress past level 1. There aprears to be an unreachable ledge that you have to jump to.","May 2, 2014","true","2.4"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","29","49","0","8"

A frustratingly difficult action platformer. You take the role of Akane and traverse many levels, collecting Kimonos and power-ups in each one.\n\nThe first stage more or less holds your hand as you figure out the controls and the basics. You are equipped with shuriken, with which you hurl at enemies to defeat them. Akane's kimono seems to be full of them, as you'll never run out of them. You also have a "super move", which is only useable as long as you have a Scroll. 1 Scroll = 1 Super Move use. There's 3 types: A very large "spread attack, which forms shuriken in a circle around you and fires them; a line of shuriken forms horizontally above you then drops down onto enemies; and several small rows of shuriken form in front of Akane and all fire off at the same time in the direction you are facing.\n\nAkane also has the ability to cling to walls and slowly slide down them. This ability is very useful in dodging attacks and also useful for mobility purposes. You can jump from your clinging position as well as attack with your shuriken.\n\nWhile overall it's not a bad game, its just ball-breakingly difficult. The difficulty ramps up tremendously starting with Stage 1-3. In this stage, you pretty much start off being chased by a very large, portly fellow wearing hardly any clothing. As you platform your way ahead, you eventually come to a pit where you have to fight him. At each end of the pit are 2 floating platforms from which you are supposed to attack his head to deal damage, and then jump over him before he crashes into you and the wall. While the fight itself isn't overly hard, it's very, VERY drawn out. The guy also tends to speed up as you go, making it difficult to get to the opposite platforms in time to fire off one or two shuriken to damage him. He also has at least 2 health bars, and each hit barely dents his bar. It takes maybe 10-12 hits to notice any significant health loss from his life bar.\n\nIf you like super hard platformers, this game is for you. If you are frustrated easily by challenge, I would not recommend this.\n\nKinda Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","October 23, 2014","true","1.4"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","23","39","0","2"

Protagonist is probably the laziest ninja ever to be seen on a computer screen with looks and a frown / hair color matching a SJW from San Francisco.\n\nCareful recomendation if you find games like this appealing. Price is not much and this game will give challenge after the initial easy levels that show you the ropes.

It wasn’t such a bad experience, but it did have its flaws that made me want to drop it like a hot potato.\n\nWelcome to Akane the Kunoichi, a game where you play a bodyguard who is trying to get her husbando back into her life when a b*tch takes him away from her…..strange, this seems similar to my own character Ame the Ninja.   Adding to it, Akane’s antagonist Hiromi has a name similar to a character belonging to an ex-friend….weird…. More reason to root for Akane.  Lol\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=586533947\n\nAkane the Kunoichi is a $3 game that provides 15 levels.  Some fair, others completely brutal, but passable.  Fair levels will be your typical run-of the mill style gameplay, but in World 4, you’ll find that being perfect will become an essential trait.  Practice and you can succeed.  I believe in you.  :D  (If I can do it, you can too.)\n\nPros:\nClassic platformer gameplay\nSimplistic story\nEasy achievements\nShort\nA game that reminds me too much of my own character (guilty pleasure, I admit)\n\nCons:\nCan be brutal\nToo short\n\nIn the after considering the brutality of the last levels and the “100%” achievement, it all comes down to “Did I have fun with this game?” .  To be perfectly honest?  Yeah, I had fun.  I enjoyed this game.\n\nPersonally, I’d recommend you wait for a sale and get this at a discount.  The game will get rough in the last 5 levels, so be prepared and sharpen your kunai and your wits.  (Discount, it’s around $1 or $0.50)\n\n7/10  Needs polishing and level adjustment, but it’s a fun experience overall.

Hmm.. where have I heard that plotline before?\nOh right, in every Super Mario game ever. They only reversed the genders. I don't know what it is with that "female protagonist" trend.. I like games with female protagonists in general, so I usually buy them and give them a shot. This time, however, I was disappointed.\nAlso that's about all you get for a plot line. No additional thoughts, just genderswapped Mario.\n\nI have not researched the game's creators, but I reckon this is some kind of university project by one or two people. It's not a bad start, but there's a lot waiting to be fixed, for example the controls and general responsiveness of the game.\n\nAll in all I'd say it's more or less well thought out, but kinda got cut short during production.\nThere's definitely some potential there, however I don't see a reason to buy something that reminds me of Mario and Megaman, however is just inferior in quality.\nI'd have to say this game earns about a 6/10.","October 12, 2015","false","3.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The cost is not much, but there are free games of Newgrounds that feel more polished.  I did 100% achievements to finish the game, but Area 5 was the only interesting one since getting all the kimonos was challenging in those stages.  Let's break it down a bit further:\n\nGameplay:  I was playing on a controller, so I don't know if it is any tighter on keyboard, but jumping can be a bit of an issue. Not the act itself, but while running if you time out to jump near the edge of a platform, most of the time you will not jump leading to a fall.  This is particularly frustrating in the last act.  The sticking to walls like a magnet to make wall jumping easier can make certain areas more annoying but since it's not that dissimilar from the original Ninja Gaiden you get used to it.  There may as well have only been the one ninjutsu since the other 2 are fairly useless.  Overall it lacks polish, but the technical aspects are not the biggest problem.\n\nGraphics:  16-bit era graphics are nothing to write home about, but it feels like sprites were imported from RPGmaker.  There is nothing anime about this, so no idea where that tag came from. Don't expect cutscenes, the intro and ending are simply the same graphics as the rest of the game.  Boring.\n\nSound:  Nothing special, but I guess it works.\n\nDesign & Challenge:  As noted in graphics the design seems boring and lazy.  There are 4 types of enemies throughout the whole game other than bosses: ninja, kunai ninja, dog, monk.  They all take 3 hits.  This never changes throughout the game and is the laziest and most egregious issue I had I think.  As far as challenge, the only parts that felt interesting were in act 5, and only because I was going for the kimonos to 100% - without that it is extremely simple.\n\nFun:  I can say the game entertained me while I was playing it, but I don't think I can say it was actually fun.  If it had been more like act 5 throughout, and the jumping were fixed I might have enjoyed it more, but the sameness throughout is a huge detractor. Oh well.","September 29, 2014","false","3.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It starts out ok despite the terrible floaty jumping and dumb wall grabbing mechanic and you feel like you can still manage.....until you start advancing through the levels and the game exploits the awful controls and becomes exhaustingly frustrating. Everything about the controls is dreadful: sluggish movement, inaccurate jumping, unintuitive wall grabbing, unresponsive button pushes. Even crouching takes longer than it should.\n\nWhen you're trying to walljump you can't immediately jump to the next wall like in every other game. First you have to jump on a wall and wait until you "stick" to it, then press the direction of the wall you want to jump to but before you can you have to wait until the game lets you which is indicated by a visual cue from your character -- her eyes will look behind her -- then you're able to walljump. It's tedious and takes way too long. You also can't cancel the wall jump and just drop down. You either have to slide down the entire wall or walljump off.\n\nThe game will punish you further by adding slippery mechanics like waterfalls going down platforms or snow on platforms, as if the p!ss poor controls weren't torture enough. Then add enemies that throw projectiles at you from annoying angles where they can hit you but you can't hit them. When you get hit you get knocked back which will most likely make you fall off the platform. The hardest part of the game is not the boss fights. It's getting through the levels.\n\nIn a platformer bad controls almost always results in a bad game. This game is proof positive. It could have been decent if the controls were tight and responsive. But they're not and it isn't. Skip this game it's not worth it.","August 13, 2015","false","3.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Got all the Charming Lost Kimonos, and beat the game, obtaining all achievements, as well as receiving the max amount of trading cards you can obtain.\n\nWith that said, I will now list the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros: I didn't have any problems with the controls of this platformer, as it kinda reminded me of Ninja Gaiden from the good ol classic NES. It was a fairly steady playthrough, with each level becoming increasingly more difficult. 5 Acts, 3 stages per act, 5 bosses, pretty simple straight-forward game, like any classic platformer would be. As for storyline, it had no words, just animation, but it's not hard to depict in the mind how the characters feel, or what they are thinking. Each boss battle had a unique way of defeating the bosses, though you never get any kunai power-ups on boss stages, it all worked out.\n\nAnd now the...\n\nCons: The game did have special abilities, but only 3 to choose from, in which I found myself only using the first one (the all-around Kunai shot which shoots Kunai in all directions). The straight-forward barrage of Kunai skill seemed overkill for any regular enemy on foot that is in front of you (and you'd only most likely kill 1, maybe 2 if there's more behind him). And the ceiling-kunai skill...didn't quite see any opportunities to make any use of that either (that, and platforms above enemy heads will shield them from the falling kunai). As for the story, it is cute, but fairly generic. Rather than "Bowser kidnapping the Princess", we have "Jealous B!tch of some Ninja Clan kidnaps some guy that all the girls think is hawt and want to marry him" (this includes the main heroine).  Now, don't get me wrong, it's not like this game really needed an elaborate storyline, it's simple, cute, and okay...but maybe we could've had a twist in the end, or some extra hidden level afterwards where the guy somehow became cursed, or possessed by a demon, and you had to defeat this demon in order to free him. See? I just lengthened the story just by abit and it also would've maybe introduced some new enemies like demons. That's another thing, not a large variety of enemies. I can probably count all the regular enemies (not counting bosses) on one hand. We have the basic ninja enemy that paces back and forth (that's 1), the ninja that throws a slow moving kunai in any direction (that's 2). Another enemy that I'd say is a wanderer that throws his hat like a boomerang (that's 3). And finally, we have starve craved wild dogs (or maybe they're ninja dogs, that's 4). So, if you hold your hand up flat, and count down the number of enemies, you're left with 1 finger stand...I'm sure you all can figure that out. And no, it's not me flippin the game off, but rather it's like a representation of the game flipping you off for not giving you a bigger variety of enemies.\n\nAll in all, aside from my cons being larger than the pros, I still say the game kept me playing simply because it had achievements and trading cards (the only redeeming factors), and since it seemed possible to get all the achievements, I did just that, and that's what kept me going. The game is challenging if you intend to getting all the Charming Lost Kimonos, but in the end, was the reward worth it? I'll leave that for everyone else to decide. =)\n\nI hearby give this game a 6.5 / 10. It's not a top of the line game, but it's not the worst game in the world either. And it's decently fun and entertaining for those that like side-scrolling platformers. I dominated the game in about 2 hours-ish of gameplay (dominated as in obtain all achievements). Think anyone can top that? XD","September 18, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I consider myself an average skilled platformer, and I still had to play the last level roughly 50 times in order to beat it. Luckily, the levels in this game take less than 5 minutes a piece. I played this game with a controller as keyboard and mouse felt kind of weird for me. If you're interested in clearing this game as a 100% achievement, be sure to evaluate your own platformer skills as I said, the last few stages require timings and coordination--I spent about an hour just doing the very last level.

It is fun for a quick play but the brutally sluggish controls can make things extremely frustrating at times. Especially a few stages in. IMHO it takes too long to start walking & it takes too long to actually grab a wall before you can jump or attack again. I can't complain whole lot with this low of a price. But it really could use some fine tuning. At least for the controls.\n\nAlso, it takes frickin forever to get back into gameplay after you die. I have a hard time believing it's because there is too much to load. The game is minimalistic. Regardless of how much time it actually takes between the point of death and next life...it feels like 30 seconds. Way too long.

The slower pace of the gameplay actually benefits you as the map layouts are well designed into tricking those who attempt to speed through without caution.  Graphically the game looks quite good.  The color pallete and characters remind me favorably of some of Nippon Ichi's work, like Rhapsody and La Pucelle.  The music is a bit of a disappointment, however.  Songs are of good quality, but many do not fit the theme of the game nor the atmosphere of the level in which they are used.\n\nThe difficulty curve is well handled, and ramps up smoothly at the final set of levels.  They are certainly a good challenge and will test your patience and timing.  Overall I enjoyed my time with Akane the Kunoichi and feel it would be enjoyable to players of all skill levels.

In fact if you want the game to be as challenging as possible then do that because otherwise it may give you the impression that the game is much more shallow than it really is. Can't really complain about level design because it's good enough to allow you to finish every stage without getting hit once if your skills are good at this kind of games.\n\nThere are still some annoying things that hurt the game. Enemy variety is quite low and the bosses are easy for the most part. There were several other annoying things when the game was released but the developer actually read the feedback posted at the forums and fixed most of them since then. Wall jumping is still a ♥♥♥♥♥ if you're not precise enough with your inputs.\n\nMusic could be far better but it's not annoying and the last stages have much better tracks than the first ones. Sounds could use some variety too.\n\nGraphics are weird. The characters could look far better with a smoother animation. All the graphics seems to be hand drawn and then filtered with some weird effect that makes them look far worse than the backgrounds.\n\nPhysics are kinda weird. Akane's friction is at times unbearable and can lead you to cheap deaths just because you wanted to move one pixel forward for a tricky jump and fell instead. Jumping is not that bad though.\n\nPositive review, even though it's not a super amazing game or anything like that. Be advised though that you can get all the achievements in 4 hours or even much less if you're better than me at the last stages but at least that means there's no bullcrap achievement like "Kill 1.7 million enemies" or anything like that so it's all good.","July 9, 2014","true","4.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Is it contender for Game of the Year?  Not by a long shot.  Granted, I have a few gripes about the gameplay, but I'll get into that in a bit.  The graphics are great, though animations are similar to a cross between 8 & 16-bit, with good pixel graphics, but characters seem to average about 4-6 frames each total.  Some less, some more.  The character design seems a bit generic at times, BUT they are whimsical and fun.\n\nThe story is a silly 8-bit era "Damsel in Distress" where Akane's love interest is kidnapped by a rival Kunoichi and her shinobi comrades.  The story is told by a short animation without language, but icons and animation to convey the tale, similar to what one would find in the games of yore.\n\nLevel design (from what I've encountered so far) is fairly simple, but flows well, and the levels are fairly short.  Each level is timed.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, I have a few complaints.  It largely handles as how one might expect, but suffers from a few issues.  The Wall-Jump mechanic, while fun at times, is more of an annoyance than a benefit, seemingly working randomly (though I know it's not random) but often hooks me to a surface when I don't want to be, or causing poor Akane's death, or Fails to hook me to a surface when I wanted to be, again, causing poor Akane's death.  Or sometimes, I get caught underjump over and obstacle, and I end up getting hit by an enemy, maybe causing poor Akane's death.  Again.\n\nMy largest gripe has to be what one might call "ice slide" (you know, those 2D platformers that the characters slide a little extra as the ramp into or ramp down from movement in ice levels?)  Yeah, movement handles a little bit like that.  The controls feel a little sticky and slightly unresponsive.  It is forgivable, but it takes a little getting used to.  All in all, I would recommend this game for a quick afternoon of battling boredom before work or during down time.

Some bosses have techs that make them seem hard or near impossible to beat with the time limit. Then the item collecting is nice.\n\nThough I would reccomnd this for the price and for the content. For that alone for the price seems worth the content.\n\nIt is well done and very amage to classic games in this genre. Though I do finshing it is near as hard as Ghouls and Ghost or the Super version of that game.\n\nOverall if you want something cheap and with cotent for the price can not go wrong with this game. Just be expecting Dragons Lair NES hard levels.\n\nI do say at least give it a shot.\n\nCons: The bosses can not have powerups used on them that I have found. No other Life points to get other than 4. Platforming is ok.   You will need a contoller to get the most out of it. Hard to master. Very Quick level in difficulty spikes and curves.\n\nPros: have not found any glitches in it or it seems run stable for me. Easy menus and easy to learn and play.\nBut for the price it can not go wrong.\n\nThank you for the game. I have played more than a hour of this but due to connection problems I had to play offline so the hour on it could be more or less.

The game is definitely reminiscent of older SNES and Genesis titles. The music is definitely of Genesis quality. The controls are fairly tight although the wall grabbing ability takes soem getting used to. The game is fairly basic but it's an adequate platformer. The graphics are really good especially the backgrounds. The foregrounds don't always mesh with the backgrounds but this is likely intentional as that was the style used by many SNES/Genesis games.

Appears clear to me, that this was purposely done to lengthen the extremely short game duration.\n\nThere are a total of 15 levels, five of which are Boss levels. Each level contains 3 collectable items, if you collect all the 45 items you can witness a special ending. The gameplay it's about jumping and shooting, with a special consumable ability, but if you think that every time you shoot, the character stops for a little while... the game flow becomes clumsy. Furthermore, the aforementioned special ability is sadly bugged, so when you use it, chances are that it won't target the enemies, resulting in you getting hit, subsequently killed, ending up to develop a deep frustration in the player, already challanged by a not fluid jump&shoot platform.\n\nThe graphic is nothing remarkable, but rather it's easily forgettable and not very appealing; be no less so, the sound department: reduced to the bone, there are just a couple of music tracks that, for how catchy, tend to become boring excessively quickly. Probably, because there are just a couple of tracks, indeed.\n\nDespite I've already covered what concerns the controls, I shall add how the keys you bind to play are the same keys you use in the main menu. Hence, if you bind WASD to move and J to jump, you will have to navigate the main menu using those keys, rather than the arrows.

Instead of a man saving a girl in this one it's the other way around which I find nice for a change of pace.\n\nEasy to say without check points this game becomes more challenging but deletes at least to Me all the fun of a good platform game since You get severely punished if You do one thing wrong for example level 5-2, At the end there is a lava-pit area you need to get around just to be welcome by jump spot with pit so if You fall You get instantly Game Over and has to go through the entire level again.\nI rather be stuck in 1-area and lose all my hearts and know I will return to that check point and get to keep my kimonos I gathered rather than doing the entire task again so for Me this game gets a "No".\nThe level design are okay since some area make You use your scrolls which at some points are a relief to have for certain spots so that Multi kunai mechanic is a total relief to have.\nSadly there is no upgrades beside one power-up box that does make Akane shoot 3-kunai's that you only get to keep in that level and lose if You get hit by a enemy like many similar platform games.\n\nI give it a Score 3/5.","May 19, 2015","false","6.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It doesn't have a positive rating for a reason. The contol of the character is meh as best and she is slow and sometimes unresponsive. The biggest problems are game and level design. you fight the same 4 characters through the 15 total levels. You waste so much time replaying levels due to the poor game design. You can get hit 4 times before dying. There is basically no health, and for no apparent reason if you die you have to completely restart the level over again. The problem is the level design and game design force you into losing lives for no fault of your own. One type of ninja can shoot homing shots even when you cant see them and it somehow can go up or down depeding where youre at but they are stupid, make no sense, and are annoying. The levels suck because unlike any decent platformer, it forces you to take damage because so many times there will be a tiny guy walking back and forth in a small pedestal and you have to use the same weapon you always have. That means you have to land on it from not dying/taking damage, by the spikes/lava/etc around it, then you have to be able to kill you right away. Getting hit knocks you fall way back and it gets you killed a lot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XyberDemon/recommended/291130/","XyberDemon","Demon_Dice","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XyberDemon/","483 products in account","I bought this game since it was low cost and was looking to zero out my Steam balance. You know the phrase “you get what you pay for”? WELL IT APPLIES HERE!\n\nAkane the Kunoichi looks like it would be a cute little game. The plot is simple. You are Akane, a Kunoichui. Your crush, Lord Goro was kidnapped by a woman in charge of a clan of Ninja. Her name is Hiromi. Save him from her evil forces. Simple enough. There are five levels each with three stages with the third stage always being a boss stage. Yes, the game only has 15 stages but it was nearly $3 so I thought “why the hell not”.\n\nThe stages are relatively short. The longest being five minutes but BOY will those five minutes feel like an eternity with the gimped controls. Broken does not even begin to describe them. The jumping and movement is clunky as all get out. You can SLOWLY inch your way between rising and setting spikes with the most delicate of touches and still end up hitting the spikes when you mean to wedge yourself between them. On top of that, the Mountain stage has the gall to have slippery ice physics when it has a difficult time getting non-slippery physics right. Add all of this on a NARROW PLATFORM THAT RISES AND FALLS WITH ENEMIES THROWING THINGS AT YOU AND PREPARE TO SCREAM AND CURSE!\n\nSpeaking of cursing the wall jumping/clinging is as intuitive as programming a Blu-Ray player with boxing gloves on. Whenever you even SLIGHTLY hug up against a wall when jumping you cling to it. With jumping at clutch moments almost always failing (running near the edge, pressing the jump button and TAKING A FALL INSTEAD!) the wall cling/jump only makes it worse. You have to hold in the direction you want to jump and THEN jump. And I mean ALL THE WAY. If you’re off by even a SLIGHT amount you’ll be stuck or worse. These kinds of issues are made even worse when its time to fight the bosses the dysfunction shines its brightest.\n\nYou do get three Jutsu as screen nukes (all of them involve a stupidly high number of Kunai). This helps get SOME of the pressure off you, but beware, because before the knives fly the screen zooms in, THEN the Kunai appear and FINALLY they fire. This has foiled many an attempt using the downward Kunai rain to get enemies above me just because of that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zoom! Oh, and they had the bright idea not to have these available for use during Boss fights. Yeah...\n\nLevel design is both uninspired (just platforms placed with a different tile set) and treacherous. Now, let me go on record by saying that I do not hate hard games. I however do hate hard games that are hard for the wrong reasons and this game is the latter. If you just want to blitz through the game I think you could do it in an hour or less. If you want to find all the Kimono’s (three per stage) this could extend the game time considerably. The levels just have the worst event triggers for suddenly appearing enemies possible. They seem to love popping up in droves in narrow places with high difficulty of dodging projectiles. I don’t mean in a “trick, but possible” kind of way I mean in the “there is no way you can avoid taking damage” kind of way. You have to pitter patter through suspect places or get wrecked and this is the most apparent in the last two levels. How long did it take me to beat the game? FIVE HOURS! FIVE. LONG. PAINFUL. HOURS because I wanted to teach myself a lesson for buying such an incompetently programmed game. So I told myself that I wasn’t allowed to stop playing the game until I acquired ALL OF THE KIMONO’S AND BEAT THE GAME. THAT WILL LEARN ME!\n\nSpeaking of enemies outside of the bosses their are four minions you face (thank GOD they mercifully decided against flying enemies) They are (in order from what I found least to most annoying) Green Ninjas, Dogs, Hat Throwing Monks and Orange Ninja that throw Kunai at angles you cannot. The Orange Ninja and the Hat Tossing Monks are just the absolute worse with the control issues making them insufferable. One quirk about the Monks that killed me was this. Normaily they throw their hat at you and then it returns to them. Should you kill them when the hat is mid flight and not begun to turn around IT FLIES RIGHT AT YOU FAST! This has gotten me knocked off platforms and killed on its own too many times to count. The Dogs are also annoying because they run quickly and only their legs are vulnerable to Kunai’s. Aim at the top of their heads? THE HIT DOESN’T REGISTER!\n\nIn later levels they tend to cluster up. The range makes the Orange Ninja and Monk the bane of your existence in these scenarios when they suddenly appear in groups in narrow passes making it nearly impossible not to get hit! What makes this worse is that ALL OF THE MINIONS REQUIRE THREE HITS TO KILL AND YOU CAN ONLY FIRE KUNAI BUT SO FAST! This is worse on the Boss stages when you attempt to get the Kimono’s because the Jutsu aren’t available here to screen nuke! And when they ARE available in stages the game is very stingy with them.\n\nBut on top of all of that the final boss is a joke in concept (but high on the irritation meter). You do not fight Hiromi directly. She’s standing on a platform, walking back and forth with her jiggly ♥♥♥♥ (YES, I think they had her move just for that and Akane also jiggles when she walks/jumps) and summons minions. She starts with just the Green Ninja, but as she gets damaged she starts spawning Dogs, Orange Ninja and Hat Throwing Monks as she gets closer to death. You avoid and kill the minions and you cling to a wall and toss Kunai at her before you slide down too far to hit her. Repeat until she dies. That’s right... Hiromi does not fight you directly, she summons minions against you. For a leader of evil Ninja she sucks...the game cannot even give you a satisfying final fight. Yes I spoiled the final boss but trust me, no one has any business buying this game. And the ending is so lame its not worth talking about.\n\nOh, one more thing...the timer still runs during cut scenes (boss intros, boss death scenes and even waiting for the stage title card to go away). I died because time was still going and ran out when I beat a boss.\n\nIf this game gets a sequel then I hope the “team” that developed the first one isn’t allowed anywhere near this. In fact considering the games “state” they need to fire the play testers, the level designers and the people in charge of the controls of the first one.\n\nWhile my words are rather...hateful I didn’t want to hate this game. I wanted to enjoy a decent little platformer, nothing amazing for its price tag, just something to pass the time. I wanted to like Akane the Kunoichi. Their is nothing I like about this game other than Akane herself...and I think its rather unfortunate that the game she makes a grand appearance is so...flawed. The reviews listed in the store to sell us on the game are lies. These people either have not played a platformer before or were paid off to give glowing reviews.\n\nDo not buy this game. If you see it on sale, pass it up. If its a part of a bundle do not buy the bundle. This game does not deserve your time or energy. The company who released this do not deserve to make money off of this title. If and when the control issues at least are addressed I could probably recommend it for its price but until then I wouldn’t even send this game to an enemy. Counting the time I took to place my thoughts down and organize them into a coherent review I lost six hours and $2.99 to this subpar product. Please, do not buy it. Do not play it.

You have that image in your head? Good.\nThis game isn't it!\nImagines it's hard difficulty, but fair controls. Shinobi is a game that rewards your skill while punishing you for showing off. Not as hard as battletoads but a hard game, none the less.\nNow that is out the way this game is 'special' and I hold it dear in my heart. For being bad!\n\nAkane is what you would get if you wanted to remake shinobi.\nWith zero experience, no talent and a copy of gamer maker.\nIt is a shame, a huge shame! Because the Shinobi franchise doesn't feel 'done'. The basic gimmick of the gameplay seems like it still has life to it, like it could still work. But Akane for all it's good intentions just falls flat.\n\nControls\nThe biggest failing is the controls. They are not the worse but they are an odd mix. Akane builds momentum and holding the jump button makes her jump higher. She sticks to surfaces and you can wall jump. But something about her isn't right in every facet. for example there are some serious issues going on with jumping which you will notice right away; hard to explain in words but as soon as you play, pop in a good platformer like Mario or Shinobi and you will know exactly what I mean.\n\nSecond of all is the screen. It's Bubsy type. For those of you unfamiliar with "Bubsy" it was a horrible tortue device used in the late 21st century to induce motion sickness. Akane continues this trend by fall and on occassion moving, faster than the screen. Falling of course, in this manner is usually fatal.\n\nSound\nThe sound? Ha ha ha ha hooooooooo! If you have watched the video you will be thinking "man, I can't hear this guy" because the sound effects are so oddly loud! I actually turned them down to 20% before recording and they STILL blazed my ears! Even worse, even the developers turned them down because they were louder! I guess 'normalization' is a foreign term to the devs.\n\nThe music is great...Because it is royalty free. So you may have heard some of the music before, but regardless, the music fits.\n\nGameplay\nFour badguys. In the whole game, four badguys. I honestly kept waiting for more, something new some challenge, some variety. It never came. Even the last boss just spams all the other four mooks you have already killed, over and over. Just jump over them, shoot her and you win. Why?\n\nI just, you know what? This review could go on but in my honest opinion I feel that this is the first game made by this dev team and they honestly did their best. As far as games go, its not good but there is worse out there...On Early Access...GODUS!!!\nFor me, I played it, completed it and I never want to ever play it again. How could the game be improved? I think really the controls. The rest, while not original or inspired (forest level, snow level, shinobi level complete with 'borrowed sprites', fire castle last boss level) is sufficient and while I am being harsh on the game it is more because of what it tried to be.\n\nShinobi as a game was fun and I want to see more Shinobi style games but not like this. If there is ever a Akane 2, I would buy it. I might never play it but I would buy it, because I want more games in the style of Shinobi.\n\nI can only recommend this game if you feel the same way, outside of that your money is better spent elsewhere.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/zTPSvxJlXS8\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","November 4, 2014","false","2.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

The story isn't really much, but I suppose it works for something so simple. What really got to me were the controls. I played with a gamepad (specifically a Logitech Dual Action). I don't think it would've mattered if I had played with that or a keyboard, but sometimes the game wouldn't properly register jumps for me, leading to a lot of frustration. I also could not remap the "Pause" key to use my gamepad's button 10 (where the start button is on most controllers of that design), so the only way to Pause the game was using the keyboard's Escape key. The transitions between dying and respawning again were also too long and made dying a chore. This seemed like it could've been a much better game, but I really can't recommend it, sadly.","February 13","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This is an old-school, Sega Genesis styled action platformer. It has heart, and it's easy to tell that the dev put some effort, time, and soul into it. The graphics get the job done, while the soundtrack actually stands out for a budget title. Unfortunately, where the game really fails is with an extremely awkward wall-hanging / wall-jumping mechanic that, more often than not, interferes with the gameplay, slows down your progress (each level is timed), and will be responsible for your death (due to it suddenly clinging to a wall while you're trying to make a jump) more often than actual environmental hazards or enemies will. There are some nasty jumps in Akane the Kunoichi, and that poorly implemented mechanic only makes it worse (not to mention completely frustrating).\n\nThat said, the game actually supports more controllers than just the Xbox 360, which is pretty much unheard of these days (thanks, Dev!).\n\nI can forgive assorted goofiness like the fact that your throwing weapons go right past dogs (huh?) while hitting everything else.

I hope theres a sequal with a lot more stuff and i loved the boss fights.","May 26, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The controls are weird, the graphics are kind of bad, the music fits ... but the mechanics work anyway. The sloppy controls are actually factored in with the level design, so whenever you die it's your own fool fault. And the wall-cling mechanic is interesting! Simple side-scrolly action with overly easy bosses, but it's pretty easy to sit through an hour of it.

The music isn't anything special, the controls are stiff, the characters have basic animation and the enemy variety isn't quite large. Now, sadly I can't exactly recommend this game. It almost tried to bring in Ninja Gaiden's wall cling into the Shinobi game play style, and It somewhat works. Power ups are found in cat statues that contain kunai power ups, scrolls for your screen nuking attacks, and health. Enemies range from grey ninja who just walk back and forth, orange ninja who will throw kunai at your location, men with hats who throw said hats like boomerangs and finally dogs. (You also have bosses but I won't really touch on them.) Personally, I don't find the game to be all that fun. Some of the level design and enemy placement can be annoying, the collectibles aren't that well hidden and like I said, the game itself is just a game. It works, but it's rough. So I'd only give this a recommend if you wanted a game that's easy to 100%. But for everyone else, I can't recommend it.","September 26, 2014","false","3.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Also, each one of these takes three hits...tTHREE HIS to defeat, it jsut slows down the gameplay cause you have to stop and make sure three kuni hit your targer before proceeding.\n\nthe Kuni is all you have. You can attack left, right, jum attack or couch and attack. You can not fire up, down, or diagnally while enemies are free to fire in any firection they want. YOu never get another weapon to used, just kuni,,,15 levels, one weapon.\n\nIn all fairness you do have three special attacks, but if you want to use one, you need a scroll. You start each lvl with three scrolls and can fine anotherone in the lvl. HOWEVER, i the boss stages, the third of every area, you don't get any scrolls.\n\nAnd let me tell ya these bosses are pathetic. ONe jdut wanters back and forth, one tries to hit you with a sword, but just looks pathetic as he slithtly slants forward, thrid guy actually put up a fight, 4th was tough, and the final boss was.....jsut a person who stood there and summoned the same enemies you fought this entire game...\n\nThe controlls are the wors part of this game. For startes you move so slow. when I hear ninja, I think fast pase action, now slow and slugish. While you are "running, and realize you need to change direction, your character will slide a small distance before she turnes back around and goes the way you want. Jumping is such BS. some platforms feel like they wer eintentionally placed jsut hi enough so that you havt tot ake a longer way around, or only reaching at the peak of a movig jump, good luck with that.\n\nwhat hurts me the ost is that dissapointmen and wasted potential. I can not reccomend this game to anyone, please ignore.","January 13, 2015","false","4.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The rules don't change, so your three-hit kills are always measured which allows for running through the game real fast. The super attacks are actually powerful. You'll want to save up your super attack credits each level for fast corridor clears, or making a particular jumping segment a little easier with the fewer enemies. The levels definitely seem like they're designed around these super attacks.\n\nThe music is okay, I guess. Maybe not that intro theme, but that finall boss theme, aww yiss.\n\nBut yeah, overall Akane the Kunoichi is a great experience. It's only 3.29 CAD and it took me a little over four hours to beat, 100%, and perfect.

I knew that I was going for shovelware at that price, but even for shovelware, it was disappointing.\n\nThe game itself is extremely shallow, only featuring 4 types of enemies and artificially lengthening playtime with cheap shots (along with a stage clock to keep you from avoiding the cheap shots with a slow and steady approach) and a kimono-collecting mechanic to make you replay and replay for the 100%.\n\nFlavourwise, the chanbara flavour is only a slight frosting on a bog standard jump'n'run. Your character has basic jumping, straight horizontal projectiles (with some additional angled shots by power-ups until they get taken away by the cheap shots), three kinds of smart bombs that do basically the same thing, and wall-jumping (which was great and revolutionary in Super Metroid... but now is the year 2016, and even Super Metroid had more moves than that). There could have been so many moves to add to at least make me feel like a ninja as I tackle the low variety of enemies and level designs, like teleportations, grappling hooks....\n\nI can't really recommend this game to anyone.\nIf you look for a quick and fun platformer, Newgrounds has better games even for free.\nIf you look for some quick cartoonish retro chanbara-flavoured fun, you could just replay Pocky&Rocky or even freaking Samurai Ghost for the umpteenth time.

If this was released in the earlier 90's, it would be the cheap chinese knock-off of Shinobi. Everything from the character abilities, enemies and level themes are stolen from Shinobi. But that's not really the problem here. The real threat here is just how terrible the game is. The controls are incredibly sluggish, you move slowly and the game responds slowly. Your only attack is a one directional shiruken throw. There are 3 ninjitsu clones but they aren't cool magical abilities like in Shinobi, instead you just throw shirukens in one of three fixed patterns across the screen. Don't even get me started on how unintuitive the wall jumping is.\n\nOverall the game screams of amateur design and incompetence in game development. There is nothing of value here whatsoever. Not even if it's $1 on sale. There is no fun or challenge to this game. Even the boss battles are incredibly dissapointingly shallow. The only positive thing I can say about this game is it looks okay. That's all. If you do dare to try this pitiful excuse for a game, make sure to mute it because the music is the worst part of the game. Clearly somebody using a musical keyboard for the first time in their life.\n\nPlease avoid this game, we should not be supporting developers like this. If they cannot make a good game, or at least a creative one, than they shouldn't be in the games industry. We have too many terrible games selling on Steam as it is. If you want to play a good ninja platformer, you are better off getting Shinobi III on Steam for $3.","July 7, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unfortunately there's a lot of little things that keep it from really shining.\n\n1. The controls suck. Period.  They're sluggish and not very responsive. It feels much more likt you're trying to play as a bear than as a ninja. Even the simple movement left and right is hampered by some momentum building style of controls, so just moving feels kind of like a chore. This is a BIG strike against the gameplay.\n\n2. Sound effects. The sounds don't seem particularly balanced. At times certain sounds are very loud, and other very soft.\n\n3. The normal enemies are quite boring and not very animated. Mostly they just pace around their area and then do their attack, no more, no less.\n\n4. The intro...wha? The whole premise is to save her samurai lover after he gets kidnapped right in front of her, because she gets downed by... one of the basic boring mobs. I mean seriously, if she's supposed to be this great ninja, she could have gotten a cup of coffee and come back before that shuriken he threw got to her.\n\nI get that it's an indie game, and it's supposed to be a throwback to all the retro sidescrollers, but the game feels very unpolished. A little TLC on some of the more annoying things and I'd be able to give it a thumbs up, but as it stands, I can't really recommend this to people.\nIf you're looking for an intense action-packed side scroller, this is not the title for you.","August 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Wait for a sale and buy something better for the same price or less. The game is functional, but has a lot of mistakes that could be fixed with experience. I might be interested in another game by this developer in the future, but definitely pass on this one. Longer review below. Nitpicks below that.\n\nThis game is basically a difficult NES-style platformer, but the controls just aren't good enough to make it work. There's a slight delay after attacking that feels very inconsistent, sometimes letting you mash the button and sometimes ignoring your input. Most ledges have decorative borders that you can't walk on but look perfectly solid, leading to a lot of deaths and mistimed jumps. It doesn't help that enemies appear to walk on these ledges constantly, even though they're only technically on the platform by a pixel or two. Wall jumping feels very slow and sticky, as you don't grab on until you start to descend rather than when you hit the wall. You also grab on every time you touch a wall while descending, and there's no way to drop off. You either have to jump halfway across the screen or ride the wall all the way down. Level design is about on par with any given flash game. It's generally not memorable, and later levels have stage hazards that don't really add anything to the game. They're just kinda there. A lot of levels are vertically designed or have vertical sections, where one bad jump or unlucky hit will set you back about 30 seconds of platforming, assuming you don't drop into a bottomless pit. Bosses are awful all around and are a definite low point of the game. It all adds up to a pretty poor experience.\n\nThere's also a lot of small quality of life issues that shouldn't be there.\n\n-Bosses have about twice as much health as they need, so each battle feels very slow and tedious. The ones I've encountered also only have one attack, which adds to the problem. They're not even complex attacks that are challenging to avoid, so you're just repeating the same five-second loop for two to three minutes.\n-Bosses are also drawn art instead of pixel art, so they clash with the rest of the game. Some are poorly animated as well, making them stand out further.\n-Trying to skip a cutscene causes a slow fade out. Dying causes a slow fade out. Winning a level causes a slow text fade in. Bosses have a slow introduction and defeat 'cutscene'. None of those can be skipped. The first couple times you won't notice it, but if you replay any levels or have trouble beating one, it becomes irritating.\n-There's no restart option. You have to quit, die, or win if you make a mistake. Ties into the previous problem and makes it more noticeable.\n-The timer continues to count down after you die or win, and doesn't stop for boss cutscenes. Cut about ten seconds off the timer of all levels, plus another ten on boss levels.\n-Two of the three special powers aren't very useful. Most levels are enclosed, making the kunai rain power bounce off the roof in most situations where it could be useful. The forward attack special will kill anything in front of you, but there's not really any open stretches with a lot of enemies, and you're not allowed to have specials on boss levels. This leaves the omnidirectional special, which will generally kill everything on the screen. There's just no reason to use the other two.","August 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The first two levels aren't bad, but I have played level 3 over two dozen times and have reached the conclusion that the controls for repelling off walls are SO clunky its making it impossible to beat the boss (who requires repetitive use of the repel feature and is an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥.) In addition, you have 0 special attacks and no chance of finding one despite crashing through dozens of the item that usually drops them. So ALL you get is a basic attack. Each time I play, I can get the boss down to about (-----) health left, but still get killed off even when I clear the first half (the run part) without losing any hearts. I appreciate what challenge they were trying to present, but the controls do NOT live up to it and leave me ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and wanting my money back.\n\nYour options while clinging to a wall are to press the outward direction and jump or slide down the S key. Just hitting jump to repel, instead of holding the direction and jumping, is how you should have this set up instead. This would take a lot of the clunkiness out of the controls. (What is the point? So you can trigger the animation of her looking over her shoulder?) Same thing for the attack, remove the pressing the outward direction, just use the freakin attack key to throw out. We know she is not going to jump into or attack the wall.\n\n--------original below-------\n\nSo I didn't really see much instruction in the game. Having played through level one here is what I figured out:\n\n1) A for left and D for right movement.\n2) K for "ok" and "jump"\n3) L for attack\n4) Space for some super attack\n5) S for crouching\n\nHow I -wish- it was set up would be WASD with K to confirm/attack, L for super attack, and spacebar for jump. This can be changed in options, and I'm working on it but somehow I keep closing the damn menu. I think its when I try to change what L does, it just goes back. T_T\n\nWhen jumping, you can move forward against a surface and cling to it. You'll move down slowly. You may press outward with your movement key and hit jump (K) to repel off and catch another wall.\n\nKimonos are not lives, they are liking getting all the yoshi coins in super mario brothers, it shows how thoroughly you completed the level.\n\nBreak the waving kitties for things like POW which ups your attack, hearts to heal, and some other things I didn't get a good look at as I grabbed it up.\n\nThe game does not move slow like people had trouble with, not did it hang for me at loading, so I think their patch fixed it. I'm going to keep on playing, as I like the old school feel. I think its a game you'll get the hang of as you play. My only request is add some dialogue to make the story more engaging.","May 2, 2014","false","3.0"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Now I looked at the version I downloaded from Steam and I can't see those icons. I know, I know it may not be a big deal but I just wanted to put that out there.\n\n\nWell congratz you indie developer because you got my moeny twice.

Now heres the deal; the game is quite okay for a 2d platformer, however my only complaints are:\n\n-The controls are stiff:\nI feel that a kunoichi should be able to move much quicker while having controls very responsive\n\n-Unable to skip the intro:\nSeriously do you guys need to remind me what game am I playing??

Here are my first impressions:\n\n-The excuse plot makes the female lead look pathetic. All I know is that she is in love with some monk (indicated by her shooting more hearts from her face than an entire group of women), and can be taken out by a single kunai.\n-Beyond the menu, the art is unappealing. The pixel art for the characters is stiff, and clashes immediatley with everything else which is hand drawn (and not even at a decent resolution)\n-The music is repetitive and boring. I kept forgetting it was there, only to start listening to it and wish I wasn't.\n-For a game that features a Ninja as it's protagonist, the platforming is incredibly slow paced and uninteresting. There is no incentive to gather collectibles, and using a cat icon for a destructible block just feels out of place. The first boss fight could have been mildly interesting, as it starts as an advancing wall of doom. Too bad you can shoot through all the obstacles.\n-The powerups are redundant and bland. Go from throwing one kunai, to shooting three, to shooting FIVE! The enemies are so easy to kill that it hardly even matters. There is a wall jump ability, but again the level design is so bland that I was never really using it.\n\nYou're better off visiting a Flash Game website and playing something there for free.","January 3, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's deffinately not the worlds best platformer ever, but its not the worst. I find it more of a good time-killer for platformer fans. Finding all the kimonos and clearing the level was rather challenging. Each level is more of a trial-and-error process. It doesn't feel like a "old school super duper retro whoooaaa" sort of platformer that many of them keep doing. Which is good because though I don't mind those sorts of platformers (quite the contrary, I loooove those sorts) it's good to see this just being itself and not like the others. So it gets points for originality. Oh, and the graphics are niiiiiiice. If you need a new game to keep you busy for a day or two and you got a few bucks on you, this might be what you're looking for.","January 7, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here are my first impressions:\n\n-The excuse plot makes the female lead look pathetic. All I know is that she is in love with some monk (indicated by her shooting more hearts from her face than an entire group of women), and can be taken out by a single kunai.\n-Beyond the menu, the art is unappealing. The pixel art for the characters is stiff, and clashes immediatley with everything else which is hand drawn (and not even at a decent resolution)\n-The music is repetitive and boring. I kept forgetting it was there, only to start listening to it and wish I wasn't.\n-For a game that features a Ninja as it's protagonist, the platforming is incredibly slow paced and uninteresting. There is no incentive to gather collectibles, and using a cat icon for a destructible block just feels out of place. The first boss fight could have been mildly interesting, as it starts as an advancing wall of doom. Too bad you can shoot through all the obstacles.\n-The powerups are redundant and bland. Go from throwing one kunai, to shooting three, to shooting FIVE! The enemies are so easy to kill that it hardly even matters. There is a wall jump ability, but again the level design is so bland that I was never really using it.\n\nYou're better off visiting a Flash Game website and playing something there for free.","January 3, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can be very aggravating at times, but if you have the patience it can be rewarding to just get through it.  So..the above should be a word of warning about the impending trials of patience for those who want a challenging platformer.  I've revised the below accordingly from my initial not recommending.\n\nReview:\nI had picked this up in a bundle and decided to give it a shot.  At the time of this review, I've spent ~3.6 hours in it and I'm at the last level out of 5.  Each level has 3 stages to it, and in each stage has 3 collectibles to find and grab.  Probably most of my time spent has been trying to get those collectibles over...and over...and over again because of the level restarting from some stupid death or another.\n\nBtw...I was amused how Sonic the Hedgehog it felt with the splash screens introducing the stages.  Felt like the acts in Sonic. xD\n\nBeing a platformer there are a LOT of jump sequences to deal with.  It starts off pretty fun, but after awhile it's just gotten annoying to say the least.  I play using an Xbox controller and am pretty darn sure all the buttons working fine.  Even more sure after reading similar reviews of one big issue I've had - the jump timing being really clunky/delayed.  So many stages were restarted because of running off a cliff with no jump.  I've probably spent 2.5 hours just dealing with all the jump sequences over and over to get the collectibles instead of just beating the game outright.  I'd like to think I'm a decent platformer gamer but geez this one has been infuriating at times...which is not good.  And as other people have commented, many of these sequence are almost pixel perfect at times where you need precise timing or...game over and restart the level AGAIN.\n\nBtw, what's with the instant game over after one death?  Why not a few deaths so you can keep the collectibles you've gotten already in a stage and keep going?\n\nThe combat is simple enough with a kunai shooter like megaman which kill pretty much everything in 3 hits.   Except bosses...which take SOOOO many more hits that it's just a matter of getting the pattern and slowly whittling them down.  I really haven't had much use for the 'secret arts' (yay special moves?).  Though I have a feeling I might in this last level for the little I've tried it.\n\nAs I've said before, it started off fun and felt like I game I could easily recommend just to play around with a simple and short platformer.  However, the more I went into it and the more infuriating and unforgiving it felt...I really don't know anymore.  I'll probably spend more time on it just so I can finish it for all the time I have put into it already (and how close I am).\n\nBuyer beware I suppose?","September 30, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls are pretty basic for a platformer but it took a while to learn the timing for wall jumps- you need to make sure to stick to the wall long enough before jumping. It makes it feel clunky compared to some other platformers, but it allows you to set up kunai throws. However, it also means it's clunkier to detach yourself from walls which is a pain when enemies are approaching. The bigger problem is that you can't control yourself well after wall jumping, so you can't really shorten your jump to avoid enemies or jump a little higher to make it up to the top of the wall. I don't know if it was me but sometimes it felt like it was strict about jump commands from ledges, there were a couple times I could have sworn I'd jumped in time yet ended up running off the cliff.\n\nPretty much no story, music is decent, animations and sfx are mediocre. There are 15 levels with 3 kimonos to collect. Since health pickups are very rare to come and enemies don't drop health, you should avoid as many enemies as possible. Later levels can be especially unforgiving and if you don't have the reactions/coordination necessary, will have a frustrating experience. In the longer levels, if you take 1-2 hits early on, it's probably best to reset. In the last level, collecting kimonos before facing the boss was infinitely harder than the actual final boss. Bosses have simple patterns that are pretty obvious and it's really just up to your execution.\n\nSome other points:\n* Obnoxious, wavy text appears after completing levels that wouldn't be so bad if you could skip them (they last about 10-15s)\n* Controller support (used x360) seems bad because after a while it randomly pauses the game intermittently. Was forced to use keyboard.\n* I would've liked more settings, especially volume controls to turn sound levels lower\n* I played in windowed mode, and when it's out of focus the game just shows a purple screen\n* The sprite of Akane doesn't match the game art\n* I would've liked to be able to reset the level from the pause menu (can only resume/quit)\n* Hurtbox on dogs are annoying: you need to crouch to hit them. Nothing wrong about that except that normally kunais go right through their head, you arbitrarily have to aim for their feet.\n\nIf you enjoy platformers and have already played through other more polished ones, you could give this a go. Otherwise there are better platformers out there.","January 22, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aka lots of precise jumping and positioning required, and also lots of pacience required.  This also means that the tag of "Casual", that the store page has at the moment of me typing this review, might not be so true either.\n\nThat does not mean its bad, I would even go so far as to say the pricing is fair.  Sometimes all I want out of maple story is just to go back and experience what little there remains of the heavy challenge they had; and the Jump Quests were the one thing that Maple Story had kept.  So This game basically allows me to ignore going back to Maple Story a bit more by having a way to quickly set myself up to play a jump quest style map.\n\nThis game, if you go for the 100%, will likely give you about 3 to 5 hours worth of game time, if your decent at this sort of gameplay.  Parcially because Akane doesn't like to jump off walls once she's on them, parcially because some of the later stages require a high level of precision, especially those last three stages.\n\nSo would I recommend this? Yes. Yes I would.","December 30, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/travino-exe/recommended/291130/","travino-exe","Travino.EXE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/travino-exe/","223 products in account","First things first, I wanted to say this game holds the neat personal honor of my first 100% completed game on Steam! And there will be a TL;DR at the end for you lazy folk.\n\nAnyways, this game isn't too shabby. It feels like it was made by inexperienced hands at best, but it has a solid action platforming concept, a sweet and simple story, and just enough difficulty to keep you trying to win, yet not forcing you to break your controller. I've played much, much worse.\n\nAs far as the story goes, you play a role that, in gaming and societal standards, is reversed - you're a female protagonist saving a male love interest who becomes the 'damsel' in distress. You platform and kunai b-slap ninjas through fifteen levels. The ending is nice and simple as well - you get the guy and, if you collect all of the collectible kimonos, you get a slightly altered and better ending. It's a cliched story, but it's nice seeing a female protagonist rescuing a man.\n\nThe platforming, which is the key element in this game, can often lead to unneccesary frustration. The momentum is awkward, as you slow to a stop when you stop running. You also have awkward momentum in the air, and quite a few jumps, especially at the end, are difficult to judge, as you barely touch the tops of the platforms with your feet and barely make it. There's also an obligatory ice-platforming level [sort of] that has you sliding rather quickly to, all too often, your death. It's shoddy at best, but you get used to it pretty quickly and work around it. Wall-jumping though, is better and a lot easier than most games make it out to be, but I do have one complaint - disengaging from the wall is a chore if you didn't intend on latching on. You're forced to either hold down and slide, which can lead to a lot of damage or deaths, or jump the opposite direction, which results in the same thing a lot more often. Executing the wall jump itself, however, is incredibly intuitive and feels good when you actually need to do it.\n\nThe action is mediocre at best. You throw kunai at enemies. That's about it. You have three special ninjutsu skills, which also throw kunai - one rains a screen-wide line of them from the sky, one shoots a wave of them straight ahead in the direction you're facing, and the other sends them out in a star-shape around your body. The first is the one you'll use most, as it can kill the annoying kunai-throwing orange ninjas from higher up so they can't snipe you. The star one is the second-most useful, but I only needed it once or twice. The second, the kunai wave, is completely useless, as you'll rarely have a solid line of enemies directly in front of you. This one would probably be useful against bosses, but you get zero ninjutsu on boss stages.\n\nSpeaking of bosses, enemy variety is nil. You'll run into the four main enemy types by the third level, and encounter nothing more throughout. A basic grey ninja that simply walks and injures you on contact. An orange ninja that does the same, but shoots kunai if you're in his line of sight. They're slow and usually easy to dodge, but can become quite tricky in large numbers. A dog that does the same as the grey ninja, but is faster and requires you to crouch to hit it. The last is a monk who performs the exact same as the orange ninja, but throws his hat that boomerangs back to him, and has limited range. Again, tricky in numbers, but not too tough. All enemies take three hits to kill. The bosses, frankly, are the worst part of the game. They're all incredibly easy (save the Dhalsim-like floating head until you find the sweet safe spot in the lower left corner) and have very simple attack patterns. If the boss beats you once, I guarantee you'll know enough to beat it the second try without getting touched.\n\nPowerups are incredibly rare. One gives you the ability to spread shot three kunai, and get a second one and you can shoot five, which is devastating. Get hit once, though, and they're gone. Then there's a timer that gives you an extra few seconds, and health and ninjutsu scrolls to give you more special attacks. Since there are no checkpoints and you're expected to beat each level on one try, there aren't any extra lives or continues. But since each level is fairly short, you'll never really miss them.\n\nThe music's not too bad, but nothing I'd bump in my car or put on my phone. It fits the game but isn't really unique or interesting. The boss music is good, though! I dug that. THey're all really simple, couple-second loops but the music sin't so prominent that it becomes annoying.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game not because it's life-changing or particularly good, but it's an easy 100% [I did it in three hours altogether] and.. hey. The animation of Akane that pops up during specials is pretty nice ;) I'll admit, the boobies lured me in, and, while I don't regret buying it at all, I would probably have waited for a sale if I knew what I was in for.\n\n5/10\n\nTL;DR\n\nPROS:\n- Easy 100%\n- Female protag saving a male 'damsel in distress'\n- Easy bosses\n- Kunoichi boobies\n\nCONS:\n- Shoddy [but manageable] platforming\n- Bland story, blander ending\n- No enemy variety","February 19","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It looks, at first glance, like it just may be simple, arcadey fun - like ninja jajamaru-kun or something. But this isn't that, it's just... too janky.\n\nEverything about this reeks of having not enough time/effort put into it. From the sprites, with their visible 1-pixel border around them, to the super basic presentation in the menus and title screen, to the (important part) character controls which are never as precise as they should be and far too floaty... it all just is unsatisfying to play. It feels like it was made after spending a few days screwing around with tutorials and saying, "I know enough! Time to make a game and sell it!". And while it's cheap and you may be thinking it's harmless to take a dive for 2 dollars or less, it's not worth it. It's just so tedious.\n\nBecause while it may not offend with it's various pieces, it absolutely never approaches anything near rewarding or fun. It's just menial work. You set about to go through a course, and maybe you do. More likely though, you'll die due to cheap level design, enemies that spawn on top of you, or Akane having a slight collision issue. Either way, you learn very little from it, and try again, and maybe get it the next time. Maybe not, maybe try again. Do the next course. Repeat. ZZzzzzzz\n\nThis whole thing feels like a waste of time. There's the basic framework of a game here, and then someone built a game, resulting in it all feeling like it wore out it's welcome and has too much content, but without ever hitting it's stride or becoming worthwhile in the first place. There's no apex to this experience, it's all just a slight downhill slide. When it's not satisfying to play, and when there's nothing in the presentation that suggests a story or anything important or anything at all to care about, it's just... work. It's really, really laborious. This is what a waste of time feels like.\n\nIf you want something that capably nails old school arcadey ninja fun, I suggest waiting for Ninja Senki DX to come out. As of this writing, it comes out later this month and is only $5. And trust me, it's 1000x better than this! Go look up Super Meatboy and check the recommendations for other challenge-level style platformers too. Just don't waste your money - however little - on this. It's not worth it, sad to say.","February 6","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you think you can play through these problems, then you got your self a nice and simple 2D platformer that'll give you couple of hours of play time, if you are veteran in the genre or few hours, if casual in the genre for completion. It took me about 2 hours or so to complete everything. My play hours are high, because I left the game on over night.\n\nWall of text incoming.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, the positive aspect of the game. The game holds the basic essentials of a platformer, which will allow the players of the genre to be familiar with the mechanics, so they can play without being lost.\n\n-Standard projectile attacks\n\n-3 types of special with skill icons that clearly shows the effect.\n\n-Wall grab and wall jump. You can hang on the wall and able to slide down by gravity or drop faster by pressing down. You can also fire projectiles to the opposite direction by facing the direction as coming down. Simple mechanics, but there is a flaw to this, which I will explain in the cons.\n\n-Touch sensitive jumps. Hold longer for higher jump. Tap for short.\n\n-Different types of platforms to give players challeges. If you played any of the side scroll Marios games, you'll recognize them immediately. Again, small flaw within the game's mechanic diminishes good of this a bit. Noted in the cons.\n\n-Extra objectives for challenge. Each stage has 3 Kimonos (Japanese traditional garment) that you can grab for achievement and special ending.\n\n-Low price\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow, for the cons of the game. This is where the potentially a solid platformer stumbles down. These issues really frustrated me during my play, which made me think, if the developer purposed created them to further challenge the players.\n\n-Controls are rather stiff at times yet slippery? To elaborate, the control itself is quite simple, but it's the way the character reacts that causes a misconception that the controls are clunky. When Akane begins to move, there is a very brief period of acceleration for attaining her normal movement speed. This can easily be mistaken for delay in controls, but it's not. Same issues happens when she stops from moving. She'll take extra couple of steps, which will likely cause a notion that you may be sliding. Normally platformer characters have a fluid and snappy movements, but that's not the case here. My assumption is that, the develooper tried to emulate an actual human movements for Akane. If true, such emulation is unnecessary for 2D platformers like this. If must be done with fluid and snappy motions.\n\n-Wall grab. Nice mechanic to have, but it falls short here. If you like to hold forward little extra long, perhaps influenced by other platformer, well you may become annoyed by wall grab, as the grab take action by pressing towards the direction of the wall and side surfaces in mid air, while right next to it. You'll often end up grabbing the walls and side surfaces even when you didn't mean or want to. This can be easily overlooked if you can let go of the wall instantly, but only way to let go of the wall is to wall jump or press down to come down slightly quicker.\n\n-Platform layouts really created frutrations for me the most. Usually there is an extra 5-10% room for you to make it up to the higher platform, but here the highest platform gives almost no extra room to make it up there. You'll have to perfectly time your jump from very edge of the bottom platform with maximum jumping height to barely make it up. You'll often fall down or grab the side of the platform if off by the slightest. Some may like this feature for purpose of challenge, but this is unnecessary if the stage layout is more complex.\n\n-Bug? In the water fall stages, if you end up getting pushed against a wall with water flowing in the same direction below, you'll be practically stuck there, as you'll barely move against the current. In that case, jump out is the only option. Sometimes enemy's attack will hit you when you are on a moving platform and hate throwers attack goes through the terrain in certain areas.

However, this game is frustrating. Several times I got the feeling that the game was punishing me for playing it.. or for even buying it.\nThere are no checkpoints whatsoever, so if you get everything in a level, but screw up a few steps before the finishing line, you have to do it all over again.. and believe me, this is very frustrating especially at the later levels.\nEnemies can throw kunai at you in every direction, but for some reason you can only throw your kunai straight forward. This is no big deal though, I can deal with it or consider it some sort of challenge.\nThe controls are aweful. You not only need to time your attacks or jumps, you also need to worry about the controls response.\nThe game has no replay value imo.","December 27, 2015","false","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First I was not sure to buy this as i read the reviews bout it. But i come to love the game.....Let me list....\n\nPositive:\n+ Nostalgic Graphics with a mix of modern texture\n+ nostalgic fitting Music-Mixes\n+ I certainly love the background\n+ Much to jump. Tiny Traps...\n+ no crashes. yes no crashes! No errors....\n+ Easy to learn\n+ controls were good after few setup\n+ lol i got really angry with dying a lot, but only my mistakes mostly.... XD\n+ Like a Ninja *_*\n+ Level design was a surpise for an indie Game. (Some complain about texture cloning. I don't mind. Some play WoW the King of texture cloning. so don't complain XD)\n+ Funny looking bosses\n+ I hope for a continuation!\n+ I love the frustration factor... You collect all. And die because of stupity. And have to do over :3\n\nMain Negative Point:\n- You can't seem to start a New Game. Thats bad. cause when some need the normal finish achievement. I think they are kinda screwd.\n\nMinor issues:\n- too short - 6 Hours Gameplay (3 Hours dying XD, but its ok. for more money i guess we get more things, so its ok)\n- sometimes controller feel clunky. but thats ok....\n- I miss a more sexy Akane sprite. omg....i would love it. (art is very different, i would marry her)\n- sometimes ninja scroll skills hit invisible walls (happened last  level)\n\n\nNothing more to mention. It was fun. 80% Satiesfied :3","July 13, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vsonic128/recommended/291130/","vsonic128","vsonic128","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vsonic128/","53 products in account","This game is just very tedious. It looks, at first glance, like it just may be simple, arcadey fun - like ninja jajamaru-kun or something. But this isn't that, it's just... too janky.\n\nEverything about this reeks of having not enough time/effort put into it. From the sprites, with their visible 1-pixel border around them, to the super basic presentation in the menus and title screen, to the (important part) character controls which are never as precise as they should be and far too floaty... it all just is unsatisfying to play. It feels like it was made after spending a few days screwing around with tutorials and saying, "I know enough! Time to make a game and sell it!". And while it's cheap and you may be thinking it's harmless to take a dive for 2 dollars or less, it's not worth it. It's just so tedious.\n\nBecause while it may not offend with it's various pieces, it absolutely never approaches anything near rewarding or fun. It's just menial work. You set about to go through a course, and maybe you do. More likely though, you'll die due to cheap level design, enemies that spawn on top of you, or Akane having a slight collision issue. Either way, you learn very little from it, and try again, and maybe get it the next time. Maybe not, maybe try again. Do the next course. Repeat. ZZzzzzzz\n\nThis whole thing feels like a waste of time. There's the basic framework of a game here, and then someone built a game, resulting in it all feeling like it wore out it's welcome and has too much content, but without ever hitting it's stride or becoming worthwhile in the first place. There's no apex to this experience, it's all just a slight downhill slide. When it's not satisfying to play, and when there's nothing in the presentation that suggests a story or anything important or anything at all to care about, it's just... work. It's really, really laborious. This is what a waste of time feels like.\n\nIf you want something that capably nails old school arcadey ninja fun, I suggest waiting for Ninja Senki DX to come out. As of this writing, it comes out later this month and is only $5. And trust me, it's 1000x better than this! Go look up Super Meatboy and check the recommendations for other challenge-level style platformers too. Just don't waste your money - however little - on this. It's not worth it, sad to say.","February 6","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
