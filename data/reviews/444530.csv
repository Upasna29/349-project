Right now it just pauses for 5 seconds and the music doesn't even change. Probably just needs a sound effect.\n- It'd be nice for the lasers to 'lock on' when you point it at the correct location. There were many instances of when the mirror would move as I let go of the trigger, mostly at long distances.\n- I couldn't work out how to see what progress you've made as you go. I didn't know what level I was up to but pressed the menu button. In the main menu all the targets are red and didn't know how to get back to the last level I was on. Perhaps if they changed colour upon completion. Perhaps a scoreboard or progress indicator on the wall in game.\n","April 12","true","0.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Really fun and interesting puzzle game that also allows for creativity.  It will be interesting to see how it gets expanded over time.\n\nSome suggestions for improvement:\n- Better indication of when all targets are hit (sometimes you stand around waiting for the end wondering if you missed one)\n- Better indication when all targets are NOT hit (the damn blue targets that are right over your head when you start can be a bugger if you don't spot them right away)\n\nOverall it's a great pickup for the Vive.  Can't wait to go finish that last level and hope there are plenty more coming.","April 11","true","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's easy to lose yourself in the game, tweaking the angle of laser reflections and so on, with no artificial movement mechanics to think about.  A enjoyable, relaxing puzzle solver. Only the occasional fiddly bits, mostly just a matter of using logic and experimentation. The lasers are colorful and fun to look at.\n\nNot a terribly long game -- I finished it in just under 2 hours while taking my time, but it was over a few sessions and felt satisfying. If I had one request, it'd be for more levels, which the developers have said they plan to add. I already feel like I got my money's worth though.\n\nOne request to developers: please no levels where I need to coordinate the temporary stopping of multiple moving panels. The one level I encountered that was the only place where I felt frustrated.  Figuring out positions for multiple moving panels is fine, just give me enough lights to not have to juggle them.

The game is not long, there is maybe 2 hours worth of content but hopfully more to come. The controlls are solid but i had trouble in the puzzles which required you to move pipes out of the way by hitting them with a beam, they never seem to move in the direction which you expect and because the target moves with the pipe it will often stop when you miss and start going the other way.","April 16","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nothing else about it seems well designed or innovative. It is basically a glorified  flash game in 3D instead of 2D.\nThe Music is quiet slow and not motivating at all. When you finish a level the lights above you turn on, but in some levels you don't even realize it and just stand there while you wait if the next level starts. Also i was able to finish the last level without doing 15+ levels before that one.\nYes this game lets you choose from every level without progression. Which I even think is a cool idea. But the game has no real learning curve! You have prisms to split beams, round mirrors to merge them and three colors to mix. If you do have this freedom you need things to learn - like in The Witness.\nFinally When the Dev. addresses his design choice he compares the game with examples for linear progression "like Puzzle Dimension, Portal 1/2, FORCED, World of Goo, Crayon Physics, Legend of Zelda" which is not appropriate. The game is not on the same level of complexity at all.","May 25","false","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is excessively tedious to center light on a receptor even though I managed to master it quickly. However, I believe I literally couldn't progress any further after going 10 minutes into the game. I won't be able to share this VR app with my friends or family due to the poor design quality, therefore I had to request a refund. I'll continue watching the title for future improvement.","April 8","true","0.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","8"

However, there are currently a considerable amount of things that need to be addressed and fixed/changed by the developers. I've made a video review of LRT4 which you  view here  for all the details.\n\nWhile my rating is currently "not recommended", it is very subject to change upon the game's improvement!\n\nIt should be noted that my playtime isn't accurately reflected here as this isn't my primary account I use for playing games.","May 7","false","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Could use a little bit more optimization, it was a little jittery most of the time. As another review mentioned, it's a bit tedious to aim the lights to the receptors, this could use a touch-up.\n\nThe navigation system also needs huge improvement. You're dropped in to the main area to select what level you want to play. There's no unlocking levels, you can skip right to the last level (I believe, I didn't actually try). There's no indication what levels you've completed, you have to memorize the level number you were on if you want to pick it up again later.\n\nOverall, I'd say it still needs some tweaking but it's a nice, relaxing puzzle game and fairly priced. Many other VR devs are flocking to prices of $20+, so I commend this dev for not trying to rip people off for what's available. I hope some DLC ends up coming around with new challenges, I'd be happy to pay a few more bucks for it since I've only had to pay $6 on sale for the base game.","April 9","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gm_stack/recommended/444530/","gm_stack","[Blackhats]gm_stack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gm_stack/","143 products in account","Really cool game. You use mirrors, beam splitters and prisms to direct lasers at targets.\n\nYou can walk around the space and aim the mirrors with the controllers.\n\n\nThere's a few things I'd love to see - it'd be great if you could just slightly nudge the mirrors with the controller trackpad.\n\nAlso I think it'd be fun if there was simulated eye damage if you looked straight into one of the lasers :)\n\nThere is just one thing that drives me crazy though - the light mixing is wrong! The primary colours of light are red/green/blue and yellow + blue doesn't make green light :)\n\nDid finish it in about an hour though. But still well worth it.","May 10","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pulsatile/recommended/444530/","Pulsatile","Pulsatile","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pulsatile/","105 products in account","A mediocre puzzle game not ready for release.\n\nNone of the puzzles were challenging, especially since most of them gave you more tools than you needed to solve them. Nor did they give much satisfaction in solving. The time spent was mainly the tedium of getting the angles just right. And it took about 1 hour to get through them all.\n\nIn addition it teaches colors incorrectly. Red/Yellow/Blue are NOT the primary colors when combining light! Yellow light + Blue light does NOT equal green!\n\nPlus there's a couple other unpolished things, for example it doesn't show you which puzzles you've completed.\n\nWould be decent enough for kids (again, if it taught color correctly), but there's certainly not enough here to justify the $8 price.\n\nIf some additional mechanics are added that require more thought and planning, along with more and better designed puzzles, it could be worth it. But I can't recommend in its currernt state.\n\n","May 26","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
