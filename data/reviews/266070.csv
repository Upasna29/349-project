The story is decent.  It isn't your cliche cookie cutter story out of a rpg recycling bin, and is good enough to come back for more.\n\nThere are lots of quests to do, besides the main story line.  In fact, later on, most of the leveling will occur from doing sidequests rather than the main questline.  At any time of the day, there will be a global event for you to participate in and earn gold or gear.\n\nThere is a guild system and a PVP system.  There are 2 types of PVP, which I find pretty ingenious.  The first is your regular PVP combat... the more powerful character wins.  The second is where the game equalizes the playing field for both characters.  In other words, a lvl 50 character vs a lvl 10 haracter will have the same exact stats.  This helps newbies become acclimated to the combat system.\n\nTHe PVP system is also implemented in a variety of ways.  There are 2v2, 3v3, 1v1 equalized PVP duels.  There are guild wars.  There is a regular 1v1 pvp based on the strength of your character with the AI controlling the opponet.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nIt's... yes, you guessed it, a godamn pay to win. I have added a few of the top players (ranked in PVP and level) how they attained their current statuses.  One told me she paid $1000 (no I counted the zeroes correcly) and the top 2 paid over $2k. The items that are purchasable only with electrum (the in game currency only obtainable through cash) are ultra end game gear that have no level requirement.  It takes about a little over $100 USD to gather most of it.  (If you want all of the gear, itll be an upwards of 200, excluding armor upgrades which can become very costly.)\n\nWhat's worse is that this gear is unobtainable anywhere else.  You MUST pay.  While other games may offer xp boosts, temporary gold gain boosts, or a sweet aesthetic item (like leagues of legends), this game falls within the very definition of pay to win: exclusive ultra gear for those who drop money. (Even Leagues lets you eventually buy champions if you grind hard enough. This game doesn't.)\n\nSadly, it rewards this type of behavior.  Those who pay money, even get to claim more rewards for charging their credit cards.\n\nConsequently, this Pay to Win encouragement totally destroys the guild PVP system out of the water due to the higher tier companies having members who have paid their way to glory.\n\nAside from the major pay to win flaw, there are other faults with the game.  Item customization is very lackluster.  While there are color rankings for rarity, there is no INHERENT customization of stats.  E.G. Diablo 2 had great item customization in terms of different rare items providing alternate stats to skills and even helped characters gain abilities.  For CoS, the rarer the weapon, the stronger the stat.  Each item adds one stat. (Yes, just one stat... different pieces of gear add different stats)  Item customization is minimal.\n\nSO is the skill system. Over the course of your gameplay your character will receive 5 more skills on top of 3 default ones.  You unlock a skill every 5 or 10 levels.  When you do unlock a new skill: you are given a choice of 3 different skills that do different higs.  You pick one and level it up as you progress.  This means, the game has 15 different skills for each character.... as I said, builds are not very diverse.  This is not like D2 where there are vastly different builds... a different build varies by 2 skills. THATS IT.\n\nGameplay is unresponsive and at times, is severely handicappd by lag.  Lag is a reocurring problem as there are only 2 servers.. both located in the US.\n\nAs you begin playing, the pay to win problems will be masked by the fact that there are just so many evets abvailable for you to do.  However, as you begin to gain a decent grasp of what the game offers, you slowly realize the huge, lingering grind wall in front of you.  The novelty wears off, and the tedium of grinding begins.  Main quests are the same: dungeon clearing with a boss at the end.   This is when you start searching for alternate methods of lveling faster, as it begins increasingly difficult to reach the next level.\n\nThis is where you fall trapped to the pay to win scheme. You begin to think bout spending real cash on offers such as"brand new ultra gear!" "Tired of being ♥♥♥♥♥? SPend 200 dolars and become awesome!"\n\nBottom Line: The game is pure pay to win.  Unbearably and horribly pay to win. Stay away.  It encourages the behaviour with rewards for those who spend money.  Not worth your time. Spend your time elsewhere looking for another RPG.  Not here.","April 20, 2014","false","24.5"," 373 of 402 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","373","402","0","17"

This is yet another Korean Grinding game with tons of illusions of choices, with lots of cheap rewarding systems that are actually other ways to make you pay. - This isn't the project that we've backed, loved and cared. This isn't the Great Mechanism that we've wanted to play on. This isn't City of Steam.\n\nSomething happened to City of Steam Project in its early days, when Mechanist Games gave their publishing rights to R2 Games. They issued a Regional Ban, caused serious problems in community and they couldn't maintain the game as it was. Eventually, Mechanist Games got the rights to publish City of Steam back and renamed the game as Arkadia; We hoped that it would end the nightmare and actually make this whole project something.\n\nBut, they choose to become a Browser Game that has an Energy System to make you pay for almost everything. Don't know what has changed since then, but as I've played after about a year, I didn't see anything new, or at least something for me to care as I've cared about it before, but more fake rewarding systems.\n\nYou can play it, without playing it, by the way. You would just push a button and the game would play itself. - Point? None. I wish things would be a lot more different than this, Dave. Your universe had so much potential.\n\nAnd, for god's sake, what happened to the Soundtrack Album? It was composed beautifully; Now, you have a fake Intro Music that is NOTHING compared to City of Steam's old Main Theme.\n\nUpdate - Absolutely nothing has changed. I mean, literally, nothing has changed. This one's also probably going to join the Uncontinued Club, pretty soon.","November 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 141 of 151 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","141","151","4","1"

It basically plays itself. Everytime you click on your quest tracker to take you to where you need to go, it will do so, which is fine and all until you get to where it wants you to "complete the dungeon objective." Then it puts you into "Auto Combat" which you can turn off and fight on your own, but why is that even a thing? Why have a game that can play itself and allow you to just sit and use potions while the game fights for you?\n\nThe game is also still buggy in the tutorial section. I kept dying repeatedly against one of the first bosses because i got stuck on absolutely nothing and kept getting pulled back and forth to the same spot so I had to keep relogging before it finally stopped doing that.\n\nAll in all, the game has a good idea for what it was going to be when it was in pre-alpha but something made the devs change their minds or something to make it like it is now with the "hold your hand" combat system and still many bugs to be found. Definitally not worth my time anymore unless they fix the problems.","March 6, 2014","false","1.1"," 319 of 407 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","319","407","0","17"

Current features are being changed, just to lure people in spending more. Good example would be the mercenary system. The first one was unique, simple and works nicely. Right now they've copy+pasted a feature from R2Games (company that's only out on people's money), changed the looks, and that's the new mercenary system. Giving players the option to get a orange (best) mercenary for 3 dollars. While players that doesn't spend probably get that chance just once or twice a day. After that they changed the pet system. Now they changed Daily Goals.\nFurther every single patch they update, it contains so many bugs that it just makes anyone sick. Sometimes even leads to exploiting. Half of the time people get away with it. Other half people getting banned. The game is just being developed and run by amateurs. Probably interns/externs working on a game. Even lacking on simple math and logic.","November 28, 2014","false","732.8"," 70 of 76 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","70","76","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Draconomicon/recommended/266070/","Draconomicon","That One Halfling","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Draconomicon/","158 products in account","I started playing City of Steam: Arkadia mostly due to the fact that it was a Steampunk based MMORPG with the fantasy touch that I enjoy added in. The story at the start was interesting and easy to follow, and it held my interest long enough for me to get to level 20 something as one character - which depending on the MMO you play can range from super easy to down right difficult.\n\nNow, let's get down to the nitty gritty...\n\n/PROS/\n* Steampunk, Steampunk everywhere. Glorious top hats, goggles, corsets, and a Steambike!\n* The Story - It has a story, I'll give it that, and one that's actually interesting enough to keep me curious about the next chapter.\n* Easy-to-get Costume Items - While they do give some perks, via set bonuses or on their own - they are easy to get with daily log on and your 5 free lesser items and your 1 free better item, and if you keep opening those, you eventually can open more boxes to get a chance at the rare set.\n* Different Battle Options for Classes. I like this, but at the same time it doesn't really do much when half of your ability to kill things depends on your gear that you're actively using.\n* Mercenaries. A good idea, pretty nice at low level.\n\n/CONS/\n* Graphics - They're not all that great, but considering it's a Free MMO, there's not too much you can do [aside from maybe polishing it up, I guess?]\n* Music/sounds - Music makes a lot of the game for me, and if I have to turn off all sounds just so the game is remotely bareable, then that's a huge issue.\n* Auto-Battle - While this could be a good thing, it's not. You can set yourself to AFK level and get through things [if you're high enough of a level and item-set] and never talk to anyone in the game ever. If that's your thing, go ahead.\n* The amount of difficulty ramps up /quickly/. I'm all for a hard game, but when you have an auto-battle system in place, you're pretty much saying "Press button to win" and if you're not paying complete attention to how your gear is set up and when you're using potions, you will die pretty fast, even with things being done for you. The dungeons and other areas aren't marked off by level restrictions like most other games, but by item restrictions. If you don't meet them, even by a mere 20 points, you will be killed off.\n* Limited Character Customization. This one is self explanitory, but even WoW has more customization in comparison to this game.\n* Pay-to-Win - Like I stated about difficulty, it ramps up hard if your gear doesn't meet the requirements. Funny thing - If I remember right, Costumes add to that. You can buy really good costume armor and weapons and just glide your way through a good chunk of the game. This also includes Bike skins, pets that also give you stats, as well as mercenaries that can wreck things.\n* Mercenaries - These guys can make or break you too, as /they/ are also figured into your relative ability to kill things fast so you don't die, even as a tank class.\n\nIn short - Play at your own risk, this game has more Cons than Pros.","January 24, 2015","false","30.1"," 44 of 50 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","44","50","0","0"

Steampunk and fantasy, what could go wrong? And at the start, it was quite fun, seemed like good story...until you get to Arkadia.\n\nIt doesn't take long for the game to get repetetive. In fact, to level up all you need to do is log into the game and claim daily prizes, that's about it. Fighting is routine, just mash hordes of monsters. As a player of MMOs such as Dungeons & Dragons Online and The Lord of the Rings Online, I had high hopes for City of Steam.\n\nAlas, while it was cool in the beginning...it gets boring once you get to the main city in the game. There's not much storyline after the intro, and you can't do much in the way of exploring. The races are balanced, the concept of the game is very promising...but if you're intending on playing it past the intro, I can't suggest it. All it's good for in the end is going into a dungeon and killing hordes of bugs and mechanical annoyances, which aren't that hard to beat. Even the bosses are easy to take down. As a player of MMOs, I was hoping for more actual fighting and...well, being able to explore the world.\n\nAs much as I wish I could, I can't recommend this game. Does the story show promise? Yes. Could the game have been more than it is? Yes. The sad part is the developers didn't take that route, and City of Steam: Arkadia seems like it's vastly unfinished in terms of story and exploration.","June 22, 2015","false","10.7"," 34 of 35 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","34","35","0","0"

While it is an interesting concept,it also had to be the worst MMORPG games available in steam. There is many reason why.\n\nThe character creation is one of the worst i seen in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥mes. Barely any customization at all and preset choice is extremely limited. You basically can choose 3 races with different appearance and 4 classes. These 4 classes would be your typical gunner,warrior,mage & alchemist.\n\nThe game also present a lot of loading screen to you and you need to wait extremely long to load to the next area. I believe the reason for the loading screen because the game itself download some parts of the area while in the loading state since it only took 50 MB to download this game. I don't mind loading screen but boy does this game have a lot of them.\n\nCombat is just laughable cause it so poorly done and the skill progression is very weak. Not to mentioned the game has auto battle mode. Yes a game that can play itself...... While the auto battle mode is optional,i prefer turning it on since the combat is extremely dull.\n\nOh and don't get me started on the level progression. At first leveling is easy but once you reach like level 20,boy does it get super grindy. The developer also think it a good idea to LOCK SOME OF THE FEATURE UNLESS YOU REACH A SPECIFIC LEVEL !!!\n\nYou can recruit mercenary too but it pointless since they don't die ( at least from my 3 hour of gameplay ) and they deal little damage.\n\nThere is a pet you can get by completing a quest but it only last for one hours......Seriously...\n\nYou can collect a bunch of collectables too. From there you can rank you individual collectables that you can find and this give you bonus stats ( felt really unbalanced )\n\nThere is a talent you can upgrade but it seems OP since you can gain talent point easily just by completing a bunch of quest.\n\nYou can craft,smith,mod your equipment and other things but it is locks until you reach a specific level.\n\nThere is a mounts you can get earlier on and you able to upgrade it too. Upgrading your mounts also change the appearance so that a plus.\n\nThere is a quest trackers that automatically moves your players to the quest destinations. It poorly done i would say. Even Fiesta had better quest trackers.\n\nThere is a emotes system but it just make me faceplam. Barely any expressions from your characters.\n\nGRAPHICS : 3/10\n\nThe graphics on this game look dreadful since the Unity engine is capable in making a great looking game.\n\nTexture details is ugly,the atmosphere in this game seems bland,character details look like it came from a 2004 games and environment is uninspired.\n\nThe monster you faces against look like it comes from your everyday generic MMORPG.\n\nAnimations is just laughable and you can clip through a lot of objects too.\n\nAUDIO : 4/10\n\nSoundtrack is pretty ok nothing spectacular.\n\nHowever almost all of the character in game doesn't even have voice ( only in cutscene they do ). Your character don't even grunt or scream when he/she get hit.\n\nSound effects is pretty bland too.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 5/10\n\nWhile the game offer a lot of event. Most of it invovled in killing mobs so the event is no different from the others. Just the rewards.\n\nPvP is really crap considering the game is Pay 2 Win\n\nWhile the quest felt rewarding at times,you pretty much done the same thing over and over again but with horrible combat system.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 3.8/10\n\nStay far away from this game. It is heavily pay 2 win and the loading times between small area is just unbearable.\n\nThis game is basically MMORPG for lazy cause of the auto-battle mode and inconherent quest trackers.\n\nThose who have patient to reach to level 30+. Kudos to you.\n\nGRADE : U ( Catastrophe )","June 4, 2014","false","3.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

One thing I found from other reviews was that the game babies you a lot. They do have this thing called ''Hardcore mode'' which is intended to disable the auto combat mechanics that essentially plays the game for you.  However, even when on ''Hardcore mode'', the game is all too boring because you can click on your quest objective and it will literally walk you there by itself. If your objective is far enough away, it even summons your ''mount''  (motorcycle) for you.  This kind of LAZY GAMING is what i despise most in the current world of videogames.\n\nAside from the poor gameplay mechanics, the variety is very lackluster, and in order to get the variety I needed to not be bored, I would have need about 30 more hours of boring grinding to level up a decent amount.  Here are some examples of which I am talking about:\n\n4 different classes to play\n2 starting skills (3 including your auto attack)\n1 additional skill every 5 ish levels (you have an option of 3 skills evey time)\n\nAfter walking around in game for 6 hours, i noticed that those who had put the effort into leveling up past 40, all looked the same.  The gear had no variety, and speaking without experience, I assume the game rewards those who follow the beaten path, and punishes those with creativity when building your character stats.\n\nAll in all, I'm sad I wasted my time on this game, but hopefully i can warn others of how boring this game will be after about 2 hours.  This game is sadly free for a reason, because no one would pay to play this on a constant basis.","April 20, 2014","false","6.1"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","25","32","0","4"

Even though I was playing it.\nLike spectating a really bored gamer playing a boring game.\n\nTo understand what I mean, you need to know that the game features two vital functions:\nAuto-run to get to quest locations, and auto-combat which will spam all your skills it can and glug any potions you need for either Health or Mana. (called 'Steam' in this game)\n\nAnd that's all you need to know. If you're not fighting or moving, click the quest marker and your character will go there. Upon which they'll then end up fighting if that is required, which is automatised as well. And in general, the game's enemies are simple enough that, all you would have to do anyway is spam your skills. That's all there is to it.\n\nThe 'selling point' for this game is that it's a mere 50mb. A nice premise, but there are flashgames out there that take less than 1mb and are tremendously more fun than this. Again, there is no reason to not play this game on auto-mode because in 95% of the time, it is the most efficient way. Not to mention that potions are stupidly cheap to buy in mass ammount, and auto-combat includes auto-looting.\n\nIn fact, whenever you pick up gear that is a straight upgrade to what's equipped, it will prompt you to equip it. Have skillpoints or stat points to spend? The game will remind you of this and offer a convenient 'automatic' button that'll spend these in the amount best suited to your class.\n\nEverything in this game is designed to remove any thought process from you. You choose a class, choose a race with a handful of variations, have a VERY basic array of options to change your hair (the face is stuck with the one of the 'race presets' you picked) aaaaand... that's it. Press quest marker to continue.\n\nThere are games out there that make tremendous usage with little space. They draw you in, even if their style happens to be 8-bit. And then there's games that use very little space, and have absolutely nothing to show for that feat. City of Steam just doesn't bring anything worthwhile to the table.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it doesn't do anything particularly horribly bad. If anything, what the game does is simply somewhat sub-par, beneath the commonly accepted standard across the board. This game just enables you to turn it into a lazy man's game, a detriment to an already unimpressive title.\n\nHonestly, this shouldn't be on PC. This should just be on iOS and Android and it would flourish like crazy. games that size are not uncommon and it wouldn't be impossible to translate the controls.\nMaybe it already is on mobile devices, but I'm having a mighty hard time finding it.\n\nI would really just say... don't bother with it unless you've got absolutely nothing else to do and you want to spend that free time on something that won't enrage you.\nBut neither will it really engage you.","March 17, 2014","false","3.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

My experience is rather mixed.\n\nThe environment is wonderful, the story interesting and the in-game universe has a great potential. There's many races to choose from and the way the world works is amazing. Unfortunately, this potential is unfulfilled because so far there's very little difference between the stories of various races and the game itself makes the player focus on other things (mostly PvP). The RPG element is kinda taken away because your dialogue choices don't really matter.\n\nHowever, every steampunk fan should try this game. It's a great inspiration for costumes and/or steampunk props, some armor sets are kinda cool and there's not only steam guns but steam swords too! (not sure how that works but whatever) Plus the soundtrack is A+ and gives the game a nice touch.\n\nPossibly the worst thing (or two things) is that it's pay-to-win and if something goes wrong the support won't help you because they're gone. No updates for months, no bug fixes, dead forums. Many players experience problems with loading or other things and there's no response from the devs or anyone. Some people are complaining about the auto-combat feature but it's completely optional. Turn it off.\n\nMy recommendation would go like this:\nTry it. Play the game for a while and see how you like it.\nBut don't take it too seriously and don't use your real money on it.\n\nTL;DR\n\n+ environment and lore\n+ soundtrack\n+ skills animations\n+ detailed weapons/armor\n+ wheelie on a steambike\n\n+/- auto-combat feature (optional)\n+/- focused on PvP at higher levels\n\n- non-existent support\n- pay-to-win\n- bugs, bugs, bugs","November 2, 2015","true","6.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Not even does the tutorial hold your hand with more menus for basic actions just to give you an "autofight" "autolevel" and "autoexp" buttons, and the suprising thing is that the "auto" buttons play the game very well, to the extent that you really don't need to actually play it. I left mid quest to get food, came back and I'd leveled up and beaten the dungeon. I can hardly say that is much of a game, if you don't have to actually play it.\n\nIt is also a bit irksome that there is a "training" button that generates exp for sitting still while online, as this encourages players to stagnate online and clog up servers so "We have thousands of players" really means "we have 10 guys actually playing, the other 990 are grinding exp and most likely not even paying attention", as you can imagine, this REALLY makes the login and server exchange of character creation really long, in my case I had to wait almost 10 minutes staring at the character creation screen after I had clicked to finish my character and start playing.\n\nNot reccomended: good concept, poor execution.","April 1, 2015","false","1.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The first time you do a (level 10?) dungeon (PER character), expect the game to lock the dungeon reward screen on you to the point you have exit out of the game. Near as I can tell, this only happence once per character. For good or bad, you get 5 characters per account. Any server you log into will show any characters you have already made.\n\nThe game is sometimes hard to log into. They seem to be working hard on content and bugs. I got fairly quick responses to the emails I sent to them, and have edited and kept this review updated accordingly.\n\nNext, the good news. Its actually worth dealing with bugs till they fix it.  My husband and I discovered this game on the same day, and as we played, it seemed every 10 minutes or so we were finding something new that we loved about the game. I haven't seen him this hooked in a loong time.  I've paid it the highest compliment I know how for a game... I created a solo... I almost never solo.  Yeah, its that much fun. If you like steampunk at all, you want to give it a shot.\n\nYes, the character creation is exceedingly limited, and the classes *seem* limited. Trust me, by level 6 or so you dont care. The classes have variations within them. And the looks of the character constantly develop in game, given a combination of luck and your taste.\n\nThey are generous with rewards for those who log in every day for up to seven days in a row, and have a constantly changing event giving out new rewards simply for being logged in and playing on any given day. Almost everything you do has a completion reward, collection reward, something extra built into it. It may sound overwhelming, but give yourself a day and you will find that they did an excellent job of helping you track it. While it may seem too easy at first, you really come to  appreciate their ingenious ways of helping you to track as you level up and find more to keep track of.\n\nNow something that some will see as horrible and others as excellent... I happen to love it. This game reaches new heights in pitting brain vs brawn. If all you do is push to level up to max in one weekend, you could find yourself with a level 50 character with little better than level 10 abilities. Every time I play I find new ways they give to make your character unique. There are miriad ways to buy, build, plan, level everything about your character, and every level counts. Each time you finish your quest and level up, take the time to look around, did you do your dailies and level up your abilities? Do you spend more on your merc(battle pet, in essense) or more on your armor, or more on your abilities? Do you buy more bag space or a better buff pet? All choices are good, and all take time to build.  If you love to do a slow, thorough build of your character, like I do, you will find this game addictive. If you are all about the max level as fast as possible, you may find yourself a little frustrated with having to slow down and plan your character. Either player type given time can find themselves addicted to this game.\n\nHope this review helps. Keep up the good work!","July 21, 2015","true","24.9"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

I played for 6 hours to get a good understanding of the game on first day available on Steam. I made it to level 23 so far.  I found some buggy issues, but overall not a major issue for me. The game was enjoyable. I met some people from other countries which was cool. At the beginning it seemed very easy but as I got higher level it began to get tougher to beat the mobs and bosses. I asked around and am under the impression I now have all the icons available. (as you level you open more opportunities to power up, which is needed to defeat higher level mobs/bosses) The graphics were very good when I ran around and visited the suburbs to check them out.

The pvp "of fate" events were good and I was able to beat a couple of higher level people.

I have not joined a company to join the company wars, so will find out about that when I do.\n\nFor those that complain about the "auto-combat" mode, DON'T use it if you don't like it.

Somthing that supports this game being good is that as it is a widely played game it may get abuse in some ways but as it has now been publiced by steam it will always have new players that like it. If you are a gamer that likes to upgrade your equipment this is most likely the game is for you as you can find multiple types of armor, wepons, medicine and other general stuff from killing enemys. If you are looking for new "internet friends" then your job will be quite easy as the comunity is ok to get along with.\nAlong with this there is also some down points to the game. One massive thing that should not happen in freetoplay games is that you have to pay for in game stuff, with real money. Its called a freetoplay for a reason, I know that the game producers need to make money to pay for the game but this is a huge factor that comes into "city of steam". If you want to play to try to get to the top of the leaderbord, you need to be really lucky with drops and chests or put you own money into the game. Along with this problem, when you are in the main area you have to put up with the lag that comes with everyones sidekicks and pets just filling the whole of the map. I know that you can fix this problem by tearning off the option to view other players, but I do like to see other people so that I can try to go for new armor and or weapons. If this could be fixed in the next update I kow that me and many more people would be gratefull.","July 30, 2014","false","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Note: it just spams your abilites, so it works best when you are not worried about using up health/mana potions.  You play more efficently if you are at your keyboard, but it is nice to have a button to press while you pay the pizza guy or grab a coffee.\nTraining: allows you to afk grind for experience, it gives you an amount of XP every 30 seconds of AFK time, up to 6 hours.\n_\n\n\nCons:\nPay to Win:  You can buy advantages in the cash shop, this is not too much of an issue for PvE, but I could understand how it could kill PvP.\nThe human races let you play any caucasian you want (WTF?), character models have fairly limited customization.\n\nBottom Line:\nSkip the PvP.

The questing system was a constant extermination and delivery quest type, both of which can get boring really quickly.\n\nAlthough I haven't played much of the game, I didn't see very much open world. It was more of a dungeon crawler, but the dungeons were extremely short. You could see the exit from the very beginning of the dungeon, which gave the player almost 0 interest in exploring.\nThe game itself was incredibly.. uninteresting.

As you progress, whether it be story or level, the game gives you many varieties to build up your character. The game doesn't depend too much on cash money, just only on short cut ways to progress faster.\n\nYou get to choose 4 races: Humans, Elves, Greenskins, and Dwarves (Males only).\nThere are 4 classes: Warden (Melee), Arcane (Mage), Gunner (Long Range), and Channeler (Healer)\n\nThe story is good, but not much voice acting on the NPCs, you only get dialogue. It's not interesting, in my opinion, due to the narrator tells your story. So if you care for the story, it's not worth listening to (once again, in my opinion).\n\nThe gameplay is your standard MMORPG style game. You start off with 3 moves and as you progress you get to unlock more skills (resetting skills to use the other variety is free). If you play with a friend, it's more fun. People say this game is lazy, what with it having auto-attack and when press the quest you automatically go to the location. But that's the beauty of it, I recommend for those that always needs to take a break from the game play this game.\n\nIf you already made an account in their website, you can't play it on the Steam version since the two are different accounts, one being Steam and the other being the CoS account.","April 2, 2014","true","685.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Firstly, it has plenty of real-time events and each of them have tons and tons of rewarding items. The more you level up, the more you unlock events you can participate in. Secondly, you have bike which you can ride over landscapes to get to your objective faster. You can even upgrade your bike, which not only improves it's speed and other attributes, but it also changes it's design. You can upgrade your armor and weapons using metal and mods (mods also changes the design of a weapon). Even though the game supports micro-transactions, personally, it doesn't feel like a pay-to-win game. But the greatest feature of this game is it's file size, I have no idea I how they got it right, but all those 3D elements and everything with just a 50mb download, that is incredible. The game is no near perfect, especially when it comes to the PvP elements, because you might just face someone with 20 to 30 or more levels higher than you but other than that, the game is certainly enjoyable.

Each quest rewards a full level up until level 16 or so.\n\nQuest related dungeons are not solo/party instanced, you will find yourself competing with other players and potentially losing out on rewards due to other players rushing the boss.\n\nThere is also the "Casual" mode, where you can tell your character to auto attack and it proceeds to wreak havoc until 1. the objective is complete, 2. you tell it to stop, 3. it dies. I actually found this feature rather amusing.\n\nThe cash shop itself is reasonable for a f2p, you can buy boosts, materials, pets that collect loot, mounts in the form of jetpacks, and cosmetics. Nothing too outragous.\n\nThere are quite a few bugs, some not so bad while others will render the game unplayable until you email support and get them to fix it. The support crew are very quick and my account was repaired in less than one business day.\n(Mercenary Tutorial quest at level 11 completely disabled my curser ingame and removed parts of the UI)\n\nRecharging cash shop currency gets you premium weapon skins with large stat buffs (I was willing to overlook this)\n\nSpending cash shop currency also unlocks rewards.\n\nAll of the above didn't seem like much of an issue, but one thing that really got my attention were the Subscription perks.\n\nSubscribers also get collectible stamps every day that can be redeemed in the Collections menu for permenant stat boosts.\n\nI don't want to call this game pay to win, so I'll let this screenshot say it:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=265274685\n\nIf you can overlook all of the above, you can have a decently fun time. There are events held almost hourly including huge boss raids, wilderness boss hunts, PvP tournaments, events that give free ingame currency, and events to collect free experience.\n\nNot to mention Modding, where you insert mods into armor and weapons to alter their stats and their appearance (appearance alteration is only for weapons+shields). This is my favorite feature, unfortantely mods seem to be somewhat hard to come by. I've only found 2 or 3 on my own. Also mods come in different shapes and you must match the shapes with compatible slots in your gear, which is very frustrating.\n\nI still find certain charm in City of Steam: Arkadia, but I would not recomend this game to my friends.","May 30, 2014","false","24.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stromnas/recommended/266070/","Stromnas","Best Player in Village","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stromnas/","230 products in account","In all honesty this game isn't as bad as many of the negative reviews make it out to be.\n\nMany of them are plain wrong, after logging into the game for 5 minutes and selecting the admittedly stupid "relaxed" playstyle they complain that there is no fullscreen and the game plays its self, while the combat is incredibly dull and generic its not quite as bad as so many have made it out to be, and the fullscreen option is presented to you right at the main menu.\n\nWhile not the worst game I've ever played, and not as bad as several negative reviews claim, I cannot honestly reccommend it to anyone but the most bored of individuals seeking something that not only wants your money, but your time afterwards. So far as I can tell from the relatively short time I played this game, the subscription model is rather odd, you pay for a basic subscription (if you so choose to of course) and over time as you play, your exploits within the game upgrade said subscription to higher tiers in order to recieve more bonuses. As someone who enjoys MMORPGs thoroughly I understand that they are a medium for making money, no matter how much love is put into the game, so I can't complain about that fact in its self, but it seems rather odd that after you make a purchase the game requires you to play it to get more out of it. Now before you say "But you're going to play the game anyway, why is it a problem?" the issue I have with it is that when you do pay you still aren't guaranteed your moneys worth of in game advantages, Now I don't normally pay in free games anyway, but if I'm going to pay a subscription, then Im definitely not going to play the game exactly the same slow grinding way that someone who isnt would be.\n\nThat brings me to another point, grind. Now I will admit I played this game for a relatively short time considering how much content any MMO brings to the table, theres plenty that I didn't do, however there was  one thing that I did do, and that was grind. Grind grind grind. Now grinding isnt always a bad thing, some people enjoy it, in fact, I do myself to an extent, but every quest felt EXACTLY the same. The description and lead up might seem like you're going to go collect something or find something but either way, 99% of the quest objective required to complete the quest its self, was summed up by 2 little bars under what most of the time was your "Dungeon objective," an experience bar, and a shillings bar. In order for you to complete nearly any real objective (excluding standard 'go talk to this fellow' quests) you are directed to an open instance in which you pretty much just murder everything for a minute or two, click a shiny clearly visible objective, and leave. Sometimes you have to kill a boss as well, but with the volume of people inside the instance with you, you normally don't have to actually kill it, in fact you dont even have to hit the thing, you can walk in and someone can get the killing blow on the boss creature and you instantly get credit for the kill as well. The combat its self doesnt aid in making the grinding any more enjoyable. I myself played a warder, the warrior class of City of Steam. While the class had some interesting mechanics, one of which being switching between equipped weapon sets to boost different stats, the combat is generally uninteresting and bland. You have a resource, you have health, you have some buttons. You click, character whacks, you press a button should you feel the need to (I rarely did) and then numbers and death proceed to spread everywhere.\n\nThe game's aesthetic design however is somewhat nice, I 'll give it that, but only to a certain degree. The game has some decent style despite having relatively dated graphics, however this style is quickly ruined by the vast amount of clutter and dull color palette used within the game. Being steampunk focused, I can't expect too many color splashes, but the way that the game is presented with its browns and metallic grays just makes the game look confusing and crowded. On the note of aesthetics I will say the character customization is okay, all of the races look relatively interesting... all but one... the only one I wanted to play. That being the orcs. Now every race in this game has SOMETHING about them that makes them look a little stupid, whether it be a somewhat silly facial expression locked on their face, a strange array of hairstyles, huge ears etc, but the orcs just downright look terrible, and I love orcs, so this made me sad. Their hair looked glued onto their heads, their moustaches looked like paper cutouts hanging under their noses, and the beards looked no better. Well at least I looked pretty neat on the free motorcycle dressed in my overly badass level 5 armor.\n\nYes I said motorcycle. Everyone gets one for free very early in game, as far as I know this is the only mount in the game. The motorcylce can be upgraded with vehicle parts to go faster and look cooler (though I thought the last several upgrades available looked less like badass steampunk motorcycles and more like something I would unlock in Mario Kart) but the upgrades are another way of getting your money, you need more and more parts to upgrade it, and one of the ways you can get them is connected to the payment system.\n\nAll in all the game is by no means the worst game I've ever played, and I admit I didnt play very much, but the first impression is always the strongest in an MMO, and sometimes you can just tell when an MMO will play the same throughout, this was a strong feeling with this game in particular.\n\nI wouldnt recommend it to anyone, however I do encourage you to try it if you really wish to, theres no large download to deal with, in fact I assume that only those with the slowest of internet connections can download the game within 30 seconds, the game downloaded in less than ten for myself. In fact by the time I had clicked on my steam library to confirm it was downloading it was already finished. You don't have much to lose aside from an hour or two of time becoming disappointed.","March 7, 2014","false","1.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

But, you can also go to places and choose if you want to join the hostile (PvP) or friendly (Just PvE) areas. The one thing I dislike about the game is the speed in which it takes to level, its too quick!

They nerfed the xp gain to 1/10th so now it is a huge grind to level 60. On top of that when you hit level 18 or lower depending on your class. It is almost impossible to solo a heroic dungeon to farm materials for gear.\n\nIt's hard to find someone close to your level to xp with because this game uses "chances" that gets used up in every instance. So everyone who isn't level 60 is using their daily "chances" to xp grind and with a small player base, it's very frustrating.\n\n2) HUGE PAY TO WIN. Even the cosmetics have set bonuses.\n\nI can deal with #2 if they had a healing merc npc like in SWTOR to help you grind but they don't. If it's almost impossible to solo heroics at 18 when great gear doesn't really matter then it will be impossible at 20-60.","March 25, 2014","false","34.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It isn't supposed to be this good. I mean it's web based (although that doesn't really mean anything nowdays, since html 5, and unity web player), runs on a potato, and needs like 60 MB hard disk space. But it's suprisingly fun!\nThe graphics look pretty good! The models are detailed, textures aren't that blurry, I can say it looks the same as WoW. It's just much more fun!\nYou can play in TPS style, or in "2.5d" (kind of like Neverwinter Nights or Baldur's Gate). Plays much more like an actual crpg, than any other mmo-s i have tried. The character development system gives you much more freedom over your character. Your choice if you want to have more accuracy, more health or more armor.\nThe actual gameplay is like in similar mmo-s, you have your skills, that you can upgrade, some of them are aoe, some of them are cc, you have seen it before. There are pets, you have a steambike you can upgrade (and even change the looks of your "mount", like to a mech). There aren't many customization options at character creation, but after that, you can have like a hundred different steampunk clothing pieces, and accessories. Also there is a pretty interesting mercenary system.\nCrafting is there, but that only upgrades your gear in a variety of ways. There are events constantly, like boss killing, clearing dungeons for rewards, asynch pvp besides normal 1v1 arena, and of course the hillarious golden egg smasher event.\nOh yeah, rewards. You get a sh*tload of rewards just for playing the game, xp, money, crafting materials, you name it.\nYou get rewards for being online, you get rewards for being offline, you get rewards for everything!\nSo is it pay to win? Well if there are still games that are pay to win, this game is the complete opposite. You get shop currency as rewards (bound electrum), only a few items can be bought with paid currency (unbound electrum), and you can get that, if you manage to sell something on the market, without spending a dime. You even find subscriptions as item drops.\nI have only one problem with the game. The dungeons (especially the early ones) look boring, and they aren't that long either, however you can always go deeper, where stronger monsters wait for you.\nThe developers did a pretty good work on this game. If you are looking for an mmo, with original ideas, and not something along the line of WoW, just give it a try.\nI absolutely recommend this!","September 26, 2014","true","31.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Could become repetitive, could use some polishing, and if it weren't just a PVP griefer world it would be fun :)\n\nThe "autoplay" button is a great idea!\n\nHowever, the game has a forced PVP mode and I am a strictly PVE player so I'll be uninstalling because of that.  Though I only played a few minutes I liked the feel of it, environment and pace, and only wish they'd take out the forced PVP idea, as more than 50% of the game playing market is PVE/stand alone game play only (again why autoplay is a great idea) so they've reduced their potential market substantionally, even though expanding it with the innovation of an autoplay button (which wouldn't be workable in PVP obviously).\n\nSo I recommend this for PVP players as it gives them a chance to grief others from behind their computer screen, to have fun with others who find that fun as well as abuse new players who don't realize this game forces PVP.\n\nThe Steam info about the game on the right needs to be updated to include the fact this game features forced PVP, and if that's not being mentioned because it would discourage some players like me from even trying the game (I wouldn't have tried it if it listed the force PVP), then maybe it's time to take the forced gameplay out of the game instead of fool people into thinking it's not PVP by failing to mention that in Steam's listing on the right side.  Yes this would be my gripe, but not to say don't play the game.  If you're a PVP player you'll love this, just play it while the game affords itself for the narrowness of the market for this game means it has basically less than half the financial potential it would have without forced PVP, so it may not last long.","March 7, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only reason that I would play this is that I just have pretty colors to look at while I sit there and do nothing.\n\nThat's right! NOTHING! I don't have to target enemies, fight them or mess up my perfect hands by clicking multiple buttons. I just click one button and done. My game plays itself.\n\nMy problem with this game is that once you hit a certain point you HAVE to do the dailies and you HAVE to do the secondary quests and you HAVE to do the other things. It's basically a "grind wall" if you will.\n\nSome games actually make combat enjoyable... This, however, does not. Its combat is that of a WoW clone, but remeber you don't have to press buttons. It does all combat for you.\n\nThe game quality is just poor overall.

I played the original CoS, it was fun and I had high hopes for it. Unforuitnately the game's bugs that were affecting my gameplay weren't fixed. I was hoping they would be but it never happened. I installed this game and tried it briefly.. not sure if it was on Steam or I went for the regular client. Anyways, I was hoping with Arkadia releasing some of these bugs I had an issue with would be fixed. Unfortunately it didn't even matter cause\nthe auto feature in this game totally killed the experience for me. An MMO with a feature that plays the game for you is just not  something I'm interested in.. not to mention communication in game between the community is way different.. no one really responds to chat. Makes me wonder if anyone is AFK and playing lol..  I really wanted to come back to CoS but it's not the same.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldreactive/recommended/266070/","coldreactive","coldReactive (Iyeru)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coldreactive/","313 products in account","Normally a browser-based MMORPG, this game uses the Unity Engine for its 3D Power. For those of you not aware, Unity is a 3D Game/Model engine similar to that of Unreal and other engines in the market. It uses FMOD for Audio. All in all, the game is very "Pay to Win," you can buy a lot of "Power" with real money, in fact, the "Auction House" uses that same real money digital currency, known as Electrum in-game. The game has a few faults, though it's only recently been released. For instance, you cannot move the quest tracker, you cannot move the chat box. Some other normal MMORPG amenities aren't in it, such as auto-decline duels, guild invites, etc. As well as basic chat filters, so you don't have to look at world chat on the first tab of game chat.\n\nThe audio in the game is pretty clear, but it sometimes cuts for a split-second randomly. This may be due to the audio engine it uses. There is very little customization for characters, but being mostly a browser-based MMORPG, I was expecting no customizability at all. The game even allows you to turn off costumes, showing individual armor models.\n\nThe game is mostly instance-based, yet the instances usually have all types of players going through them. (This is only experience up to level 10 or so. I am unsure about higher levels.)\n\nLike most browser-based MMORPGs, costumes bought through the cash shop usually give stats, as well as mounts giving passive stats such as attack, etc. (As do cash shop pets.) If you don't mind "Pay To Win" then this game is a nice little browser-based or Unity-Based gem.","March 6, 2014","true","48.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Runkify/recommended/266070/","Runkify","On","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Runkify/","157 products in account","Gameplay is bland and boring. It's interesting to see an MMORPG to have the option to essentially play the game for you. There's auto-walk and auto-battle. Using these options, you can just sit back and let the game play itself while you relax and do other things in the meantime. While this may seem like a great idea, it gets boring real quick when the combat is already slow. There is no real tutorial to show you how to play and what things are. For example, there is no description that describes each race in the character creation screen. Nothing that tells you the difference between each class and race. Basically, you have to figure it out yourself, be it playing through the game blindly or searching up a guide online. This review may not have been helpful at all because this merely just a first impression of the game. The first things I noticed right when I started the game. In my opinion, the idea was great, but execution could have been improved on greatly.\nIf you enjoy doing nothing in a game, this might be just for you.\nIf you would like a game that involves more action and whatnot, I recommend avoiding the game. Of course, you can go ahead and give this game a try.","March 7, 2014","false","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The game has Auto-Travel, Auto-Combat, and Auto-Targeting and seems to try and do everything for you. I only spent about an hour playing through it, but from what I can tell, it also has server and optimization issues as I had frame rate and lag problems consistantly through the entire game.\n\nAlso, the game seems to have Pay-2-Win packs you can get, which makes the aspect of sinking any time into this game even worse. I'd avoid this game unless you have a thing for games that seems trivial and focus on tossing reward after reward at you to keep you playing.","March 7, 2014","false","0.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But it just makes so many mistakes.\n\nIt's too much like World of Warcraft in its controls and feel.\n\nThe combat requires no skill at all.\n\nIts aestetics claim to be steampunk, but it just lacks the feel of having any soul at all.\n\nIt claims to be MMO, but you only see other players and can attack the same people. I haven't seen the actually MMO aspects that aren't dated back to 2003. However that might be due to the fact that I've only played just under an hour and haven't seen it yet.\n\nDespite all this I see potential, if the designers were to take it and rework it there might be something good in here.

I don't like how the camera zooms in because of a barrier in the environment such as a wall. I think it'd be better if the camera went through the wall and the wall became transparent expect only, perhaps, a small fraction of the bottom of the wall, which would remain visible.","September 4, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed what I did. Now I do have to say the classes to choice from are llimited the classes seem to be real good. At least once you have choosen you class and lvled up enough. There are about 4 classes to choice from. I choice the gunner class, and my lvl is currently 14. Like in most rpg games there is a guild in this one it's called a Company. There are Company War's everyday at a certain time. Besides the Company War's there are many other events to do in the game once you are the right lvl to take place in them. Some events once you get to a high lvl you will no longer be able to take place in them. Also once you get far enough in the game you will be able to get a vechile that you can get on when you want to. Now for attack style you can choice from three different things. Dual weild Two handed and Shield and Weapon. Each one gives you a different boost. This is a fun game to play you can upgrade your weapons equipment and vechile.","May 24, 2014","true","61.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would often click next to the smaller enemy units and hence walk to that position, when I really wanted to auto-attack them.\nI like the depth of the character empowerment system, with all those ways to obtain things to upgrade your character.\nThe camera controls are not really that good, though, especially in combat. I don't like how the camera zooms in because of a barrier in the environment such as a wall. I think it'd be better if the camera went through the wall and the wall became transparent expect only, perhaps, a small fraction of the bottom of the wall, which would remain visible.","September 4, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I good mix of mobility and strategy, and it's not just a simple point in click.\n\nHowever.  Absolutely remove the 'click to complete' quest option, where once you click it, it automatically finishes the quest for you.  Makes it feel like you think player's are clueless.\n\nThese other things I could really ignore because it has a good theme to it despite the rather low model graphics.  However there is one HORRIBLE thing that keeps me from playing it.\n\nThe camera angle.  Seriously.  It's awful.  You can barely customize it, and when you do it resets it back to the default, low-to-the-ground, close up angle.  Makes this game impossible to play.  Maybe that's why you put the 'click to complete' option?\n\n3/10 - Don't recommend.","September 6, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You end up staying in one place over and over again fighting the enemies.\n\nIf these are instances then they should not respawn enemies so quickly.

If you're interested in some very basic combat to turn your mind off for a while, the game is decently entertaining.  The idea behind the game and the steampunk genre makes this game entertaining enough for a few hours.\n\nI disliked the fact that so much experience, skill points, in-game currency, etc. is just given to you carte blanche.  There's an in game mechanic where you can earn experience just being AFK and there are various events where you're just awarded in-game cash.\n\nAll in all, it's a very simple game and I'd recommend it for people new to the MMO genre.  More seasoned gamers who are used to more diverse mechanics and challenges may find this game too simple and "mind numbing".","March 16, 2014","true","15.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All those games had something special in them one way or another.\n\nAnd as for City of Steam: Arkadia - I would have simply few words to shorten the description. : I simply love everything about it. ( And I choose hardcore mode of playing style ) Everything feels so relaxed and just fun, after many many many games I turned around I actually have some fun.\n\nThe only thing what I could put this game Thumb down is - Dragon Age II version of dungeons - they are repeating it self to much. Areas are too similiar one to another. But then again Dragonage II was 50€ when it came out and it has 8gb. This has 50mb installation package with some updates rest is load on screen. So I belive even that will be eventually fixed and changed.\n\nWell, to the last conclusion if You are sick of all MMORPG's up to the neck try this out out. You wont regret it. :)\n\n","March 17, 2014","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The movement is horrible and glitchy, and the game, as mentioned in othre reviews, is pretty much run by itself. You shouldn't be able to let your character run to an objective by themself with the click of a button, especially not in a MMORPG. This is really the one thing that dettered me right away. The movement I could probably get used to, but the fact that the story runs itself is a big downfall for the game.\n\nIf you like that sort of thing, then play your heart out. Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this game to any of my friends.","March 27, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My review is going to be all over the place because I am just going to type it as it comes to me rather than seperating it out.  Like others have said, there is a lot of auto piloting in the game, though that isn't necessarily tragic. what gets me is the rigidity of the world. the world has potential but its repetitive and has lots of invisible walls. It isn't a horrible game but it isn't an outstanding one either.  It does reward clocking in and consecutive play but also rewards you for down time as well.  It does these rewards for each individual character. There is no switch characters button though, so you have to quit completely and relaunch the game for every character.  For a game that tries to be cash shop heavy by giving you a way to buy extra upgrade supplies and cosmetic stuff, it is almost impossible to buy the currency. None of the buttons for buying/recharging work in the game. The only way is to buy the bundles through Steam.  Another thing is if you played this from their launcher originally and hoped to move your character over...nope, not happening, either stick with their launcher or start over through Steam.  There is more stuff to be positive and negative about but I give it an overall Meh rating.  It is however something easy to do when multi-tasking other projects and is relatively computer resource light.","March 28, 2014","false","47.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall it's been a fun game to play and if your a fan of point and click movement (Like Diablo) As well as a fan of Steampunk then I would recommend this game to you.","July 1, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are pay options but I haven't needed them yet.\nThe only bugbear I have is that at one point I had to by a potion from this machine to progress through the game, I didn't need real money to buy the potion but the instructions didn't state buy a potion from here to proceed so I almost got stuck.\n\nThen there was trying to find lumber in one of the areas as part of a quest it was relatively hard to find.\n\nI played this game in advanced mode where I could 360 the camera and use abilities and such, and I chose the fighter route because I wanted to tank it out.\n\nI beat the bosses and such and got some good gear, it seems the bosses only sometimes drop gear sometimes they drop nothing and it's not clear that they will ever drop anything unless you redo the dungeon, beacause there is a limit to how much gold exp and a boss counter you can get per dungeon run through. Also bosses just keep respawning pretty quick if you hang around be prepared to refight the boss or run for the exit which is usually not far from the boss.\n\nBut I did get good gear and I picked skills that helped me solo dungeons because I don't always have friends to bail me out.\nAs far as what you need to put in to the game to play well thats the good point just a 50 mg download and small updates and your in.\n\nAs someone who deletes games off his computer because of file size especially mmos I don't like, I'm happy to keep this one going as it's not that big a deal leaving it on.\n\nI can see why people don't like it but hell it gave me a motorbike in the first hour of the game and then upgraded it in the second and I don't care if the game auto drives me places if I click the quest button if I want to drive around I can and if I'm lost blammo a button that takes me where I need to go, pretty smick.\n\nI give it a 8/10\n\nP.S. on my comp it comes up with an error saying to close the program, I just minimzed it because the game runs fine then made sure I had read the error message and set my taskbar to auto hide so I could see the whole screen and everything was hunckydory.","July 20, 2014","true","153.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Too many class balance problems that the dev's are floundering to fix. When they do make an attempt at balancing the classes they are taking bad advice from the players who only want to see their class become 100% op with heals and support classes weak and unplayable as anything else.\n\nLong story short it is a grind, PvP, rinse and repeat game. If your into rude mods and dev's that only have an interest in finding more ways to make P2W players empty their pockets you'll feel right at home.\n\n\n\n\n","May 6, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyneFan/recommended/266070/","UndyneFan","☾Zombie † Queen☽","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UndyneFan/","107 products in account","TL;DR - It's a very basic game.  Lots of store junk, lots of stuff happening in the UI.  Automated game play most of the time.  Nothing too bad.\n\nThis is a very basic, auto-play game set in a neat world.\n\nI won't talk about the story line because I don't care about it.  If it was more of an RPG type, it would be different.\n\nThis is what I call an auto-play game because you can basically automatically run to every quest NPC and objective without any difficulty or really trying.  I've only just started but I don't think it's bad necessarily, it just doesn't really stand out.  As an at-home mom with a one year old these types of games are kind of ideal from time to time.  It even has a feature that allows you to automatically equip gear if you let it.  Of course you don't have to use the automation system, but I am a fan to an extent.  It does sometimes take away from a game for me at times, but something like this it just doesn't bother me.\n\nThe graphics are a little dated but nothing terrible, if that is a major factor to you in your games.  I don't think it looks terrible but it's a game that depends a lot on bloom functioning to smooth out the graphics (IMO) and I hate bloom.  It still looks fine without it.\n\nAttacking is pretty automated, which can get kind of tricky (not because it's difficult, just confusing at times).","May 20, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have never seen a game that allows jumping where jumping is absolutely 100% pointless.\nVery few customization options was also a big downer.\n\nI think if more work had been put into this game before it was released, it would have been an absolutely AMAZING game to play.\n\nAs it is now though, it's just...

You can even set your dungeon runs to auto-pilot if you happen to have to go AFK for a minute or two, which is helpful when you have to refill a drink or use the bathroom lol\n\nI am however having trouble logging into the game today and the game updates in the forums are lacking.  I don't know if anyone else is having similar issues but after verifying the game integrity and then updating the missing files it puts me in a constant loop.  Maybe my graphics card finally needs to be replaced or something but it can still play high end games with no issues so i suspect it can't be the graphics.\n\nEither way it is a fun game and for free you have nothing to lose :)\n\nEdit: I solved my issue by closing the Steam Client, right clicking on the Start Menu icon and running as Administrator.
