I played it for hours as a kid because it was quick fun, had exploration and crafting and a vibrant community with extensive mod support. I taught me the basics of modding  which later got me interested in programing.\n\nThe game is still as fun as I remember, but the community is quite gone -- which is where Steam comes in. I can only imagine what kind of mods steam users would make.

This game was doing survival in a hostile world long before Minecraft popularized the genre. Crafting, alien landscapes, multiple playable races, solid modding community, the works. An incredible game, more so for the time it was released, it still holds up today. For the incredibly low asking price, this game is highly recommended.","December 18, 2015","true","25.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

It covers multiple races with distinct gameplay strategies, crafting, a nicely written back-story and loads of aliens to kill... or be killed by. It's also moddable to the point of being able to create expansions to the original game or just something completely different.\n\nAlthough its introduction to Steam and the improvements available in the Special Surprise Edition (™?) are a fresh breeze to the game, this version brings the same spirit of the freeware versions from 2003 and onwards. In fact, one of these earlier versions of Notrium is open-source. Hence, my greatest inclination of buying it here is to support the (very) nice developers behind it. It's still worth every cent.","December 12, 2015","true","25.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","1"

Probably one of my most favoured games of all time, I can't believe it's on Steam! I dropped the $1.99 in about a second!\nNotrium is a survival game. You play as one of 4 characters from a crew that crashlands on an alien planet. Your goal is to survive, be it that you find a way offworld, or take presedence over the locals and become ze' ubermanche. There is the Human, Alien, Android and Psionic. I personally prefer the Human and Alien to the other two races, because of the amount of gameplay each presents. Notrium hits the "Survival" Part right on the money. You constantly have to moniter your temperature and hunger, as well as focusing on the whole NOT DYING part. I sincerely hope Ville releases workshop for this game, due to the huge amount of moddability. Someone modded this into a side scroller guys! How crazy is that? Insanity aside, $1.99 is a small price to pay for a game with this kind of content. Definitely worth the time you'll spend dying over and over again.","December 19, 2015","true","5.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

No brainer,\n\n!tl;dr\n\nThis is a great game, and for the price versus the amount of gameplay you're likely to get out of this is a great fun-to-cost ratio.\n\nIt feature 4 different 'races' to play with, that actually have vastly different playstyles (well perhaps two of the 4 are not vastly different, but still focus on very different items for scavanging).\nIts maps are randomly generated to a large extent, meaning that even if you play through all 4 races you will not feel like you are simply trudging through the same world in a different set of shoes.\n\nDisclaimer:\nI originally played Notrium back in 2005, and it kept me entertained for quite a while. So I am probably wearing nostalgia glasses to some extent. But at the same time there aren't many games that caught my attention like this over the years.","December 9, 2015","true","9.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Played it for days back in 2003. Was really surprised to see it on steam finally and already played 40 hours on steam too. All i can say is definitely buy it, great indie game for a cheap prize.\n\nAs for game, you are the sole survivor of a shot down ship, landing on planet notrium with last escape pod. You have to scavenge, find food, fight local aliens and marines and esentially reach one of the ending.\n\nGame has 4 races that plays differently.\nHumans are overall average, they can use pretty much every tech. and you have to manage your hunger and temperature.\nAndroids are stronger than humans, they can carry more, don't need food and become really strong endgame. Downsides are they lose energy constantly so you need constant supply(kinda like needing food) and they can't heal like other characters, you need repair units.\nAlines can become really strong end game. Downsides are they have increased hunger and can't use tech. They differ from other races with their ability to evolve. Completing certain tasks evolves your alien so you get stuff like better night vision, different attacks etc.\nPsionic has complete different play style from other races. They can't carry stuff and has tokens which you combine to make different skills.\nAlso each of them have their own storylines which you will read as days pass via their journeys.\n\nApart from 4 races you also have 6 different endings which i won't talk about so you won't get spoiled. But some of them are really fun and rewarding.\n\nIt has quite number of mods, one i will recommend is "werivar" mod which adds a lot of content.\n\nWith different races, endings and modding you can say game has a lot  of replayability too.","January 12","true","41.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Suddenly you see an old wound on your leg heal rapidly!"\n\nman, this game still have its charm, if you like survival games this one might be old and doesn’t have some conventions of new survival games (including standard control, the first thing I believe that will kill you if you never played old games before), but its damn good, the theme is great, the choices and discovery is simply a joy, has lovely dialog and the playable characters are so diverse that you will feel like playing a different game foe each one of them, even though it is the same generated maps, the game has several surprises, different endings, and an interesting items diversity that will keep you guessing which one could be combined with which, the game will give you some hints but most items have different combinations, heck, just everytime you have tons of items go through them, but remember to save first XD\n\nand yes, this game has kinda fixed maps and sometimes u will get some of those fix maps sometimes not, and each map has certain items in it, I mean if you want sand and you didn’t get a desert map, well good luck in finding some. and it is not that huge world, but the experience itself is huge, thanks for items diversity and different endings it doesn’t feel as random luck or the experience is lacking, instead it feels it gives you a good space to be creative and try new things everytime. The game is a bit hard, based on your style and which character you picked. For human I.e it is not easy to go out in the dark with extreme cold at the night or extreme hot at desert area without preparations, sometimes your death will be swift if you start without finding good supply and wondered in wrong maps without knowing! Sometimes you will venture long till you discover your character is starving and die with hunger, but in general the game because easier with each run, u discover how to use things in better ways, what expected from each map u visited, and what's ur character weakness and strength, all in the hard way.\n\nas you can expected, i played the game when it was like version 1.2 or something and followed it till the dev. decided to focus more on his space starship game, he had like 3 models without textures at that time, so hopefully there is something new in this version, if it is small and insignificant i would still looking forward to see it. (edit: I found a weird thing that seems doesn’t belong to the theme, wonder if this is the secrete, but it was fun)\n\nWhat only worries me in this game … why is it sold for 2 dollars? People might get confused and think it is a bad quality games, I enjoyed playing this game more than a lot of games that I bought for 10-25$","February 27","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It features a simple crafting system basic survival elements 4 playable characters and multiple endings. Yep there is an ending to this finely aged indie gold that many have enjoyed over the years.\n\nGameplay: The Characters\n\nNotrium isn’t your average survival mainly due to its multiple characters to play. There are 4 characters to play. The Human is affected by temperatures and will die quickly if food levels are depleted. The Alien depletes food levels faster than The Humanis, more agile and cannot use guns all this with a reduced carry weight. The Android (My personal favorite) highest health, doesn’t need to eat and has a spectacular carry weight. These perks come with a price the price being energy drain and repair kits required to heal. Our last and final character The Psionic has it’s own tutorial and is one of the more difficult to play characters in my experience. A very slow food drain and overtime energy regen are the perks that come with playing The Psionic however The Psionic has the lowest health and can’t carry items.\n\nGameplay: Survival Elements\n\n\nYou have your basic food health and energy bars these all are important unless your character doesn’t use food. Speaking of food there are multiple ways to fill your belly the most basic is gathering some delicious fungi with a food generator being your greatest source once you have the supplies. Energy well doing what it’s name implies powers certain items and is The Psionic’s most valuable asset. Crafting is another key survival element that makes any survival game and the crafting is a simple click one item then click another to combine them it isn’t a fancy material based one but it still gave me the same enjoyment when combining items to build a weapon to fight for my life with. Temperatures oh the dreaded cold and heat it could be your best friend or your worst nightmare if you can’t keep your temp just right. Finding ways to balance the temp wasn’t too hard but if you don’t pay attention to it you might end up dying.\n\nGameplay: Combat\n\nCombat depends on what character you play. The Psionic uses runes that when combined certain ways make different abilities. The Human and Android use guns to eliminate hostile threats. The Alien uses claws to slice and dice its way to victory. Now while combat is fun it can be avoided using stealth.\n\nDifficulty: Something that can scare people away from a game is difficulty. There are 3 settings wimp, medium, and hard. Wimp has little energy and food drain while medium offers the normal food and energy drain and hard makes enemies aggressive on top of the food and energy drain. A problem with this golden survival game is the tutorial. The Basic Training Tutorial took sometime to complete due to the tutorial messages being a little vague on certain mechanics like the food generator but it wasn’t hard to figure out how to put ether into it.\n\nPros:\nGreat survival elements\nMultiple endings\nMultiple characters\nSimple yet great crafting system\nMultiple play-styles\nStealth mechanics\nCombat is fun\nModdable\nMap Editor\n\nCons:\nSome tutorial text Is too vague\nDated graphics\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.
