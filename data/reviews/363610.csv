"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rickyhorror/recommended/363610/","rickyhorror","ricky horror","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rickyhorror/","770 products in account","As of right now, for the English players out here, this game is in broken English, and understanding it is far and few. I've tried for the longest time to get though the tutorial sector, "Sector 0", and their explanation of what to do is completely misunderstood and trial and error isn't seeming to work. Wait until there is an English guide posted with controls and gameplay basics before picking up the game, or, at least playing it. Because that way, you'd at least know what to do in the game.\n\nEDIT: After 2 hours, I was able to finally make sense of it. It is possible to understand after a while if you're an English player, but it takes time and quite a bit of trial and error.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's pretty repetitive. The game consists of: Shooting things, unlocking locks, shooting some more things, unlocking more locks, shooting more, crap ton of more locks to unlock. That's about it. :/\n\nThere is a lot of running from "point A" to "point B" to go back to "point A" to see if you can though yet, just to go to a "point C". A Bunch or large green orbs that teleport you to random locations on the map, but you feel obligated to go into them anyways because there is just so much damn walking.\n\nThe walking pace in the game is like a snails movement, and the sprint is more of a below average walking pace.\n\nAll of the max upgrades can be acquired within the first level, taking out all of the challenge of even fighting anything. Running into an enemy feels more like a nuisance at this rate, kind of like a gnat flying around you.\n\nThe "level", "sectors", "tasks", whatever you'd like to call them, are incredibly large for what the game is, making the game a walking/unlocking locks simulator, and going from "point A" to "point B" is always 100% boredom.\n\nThe game rips and tears non-stop while playing, and it's jumpy at all times.\n\nDuring most cut scenes, you can still somewhat control your character, to it's a bit awkward. During the movement cut scenes, you can even press shift to move slightly faster, or as the game calls it, "sprint". If you have your weapon drawn before a cut scene starts, your entire HUD will overlay the cut scene. If you accidentally click more than 1 time to start an interactive cut scene, you will have a permanent text overlay on the bottom of your screen. For example, don't click "E" twice on the first lock in Sector 0, you will be forever annoyed with the rest of the game til you restart the game.\n\nThere are tons more bugs from here, and a good number of annoyances.\n\nFor the $4 the game costs, if you're going to achievement hunt and grab some steam trading cards along the way, go for it. The achievements are pretty simple, and pretty straight forward. But, for a few of them, the "task" achievements, you must complete the entire game, and that's several several hours of gameplay, walking, and unlocking.\n\nIf you're looking at the game for the gameplay, and a possible game for entertainment, your money is probably better spent elsewhere.","June 24, 2015","false","4.4"," 147 of 165 people (89%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","89","147","165","8","11"

They speak different languages with some english words inserted in the dialouge but there are english texts to accompany them, although the grammar's relatively poor. Gameplay's linear (go from A to B), you move pretty slow despite running and pretty much a point and shoot on one kind of an enemy early in the game. Graphics-wise it isn't top notch (depsite the max settings), although it's not going to bother you if you don't really care about those types of details.\n\nUpgrading your gear isn't really well explained at the beginning of the game, just some form of text description on some of the recipes to craft upgrades but you are really only given a vague idea of how to go about it. You'll figure it out yourself - considering the fact that the enemies are very tough to deal with even at the beginning of the game, upgrading your gear is essential. It seems without upgrades at all it'll be one kill - one death, then you respawn at the furthest stage (e.g. You started stage A and got killed in stage D, you respawn back to A with respawned enemies which you have to kill again). With minimal upgrades you'll manage to get 2-1 KD, but otherwise don't bet on sweeping stages easily.\n\nLastly and also one of the most disappointing features of this game - No Saves! Or rather, it autosaves only on essential cutscenes with NPC, otherwise quitting afterwards will delete any progress you have made in the game - that means upgrades, inventory items, money, progress, etc. This no longer makes the game any more enticing to replay after one session.\n\nOverall won't really recommend this game right now, as you can tell from the review already. There much better ones out there to get. If they can remedy most of the cons, I say for $3 it's ok to purchase but wait for an update.","June 25, 2015","false","1.2"," 77 of 85 people (91%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","91","77","85","5","0"

Unfortunately, it seems like the core mechanics of the game are not fun.  You literally just open locks the whole time.  It took me awhile to figure out how to open the locks, and I am still not 100% sure of which items I need to have in my inventory, as there are 3 different tiles of each color of lock unlocking elements.  The descriptions hardly indicate what you would need, but it appears you need to get an empty jar, put the element in it, then you have a jar full of that element, then you need to click on it again and press 'use' and it creates another identical type of jar with the same description with a slightly different icon in the image and you need this to open a lock.  After an hour I still had no idea how to do it but you can just click on everything and you'll get that lock open.  [edit: it appears after watching someone else play that that identical jar type is a crafting ingredient!  So you need to have the crafting jar, the empty jar, and the element, to create a full jar, It would have been much easier if we didn't need the crafting jar]\n\nAnd then there are robots that want to kill you.  It's pretty fun having to battle them, although they are pretty powerful and you may end up dying a lot.  I found it entertaining until I saw that the robots just spawn randomly and constantly so you can't exactly "clear" them all out, you just have to deal with whatever is in front of you, just long enough to open the lock (while you are mashing the buttons in your inventory trying to create the right type of jar).\n\nSo from a quality standpoint, it's very playable, but as far as "fun" I would say that I do not recommend jar creator/lock opener simulator.  PLEASE tell me that there is something beyond the locks.  If so, I will do it.  I will open all the locks if there is something of enjoyment on the other side besides more locks.\n\nAND LET US RUN!!!\n\nPLEASE!!\n\nThe game has a not-visible stamina bar, so you have to walk most of the time.  You can run for like 10 seconds, then walking.  Try to run again and you will have like 0.1 second of run, then back to walking.  The gameplay is so frustrating and annoying that the least you could do is let us run around!!\n\nAlso, the english translation in the game is really extremely bad, but that's at least skippable.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fs986AxfJs\n\n^ here is me stumbling around trying to figure it out for an hour.","June 26, 2015","false","3.3"," 54 of 66 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","54","66","8","2"

The gameplay is just horrible. It wasn't obvious how to upgrade gear, making everything impossible. 10s of people asked and the DEV replies with "watch the tutorial"  clearly your video wasn't clear.\n\nI didn't figure it out before I quit, but some forum mentioned it might not happen until level 3 - which I ran round in circles on for plenty of time before it crashed and I didn't have the desire to redo it.\n\nI found a black shop, but still found no way of upgrading gear. Only stupid potion like healing where you will have to open your inventory to heal mid combat against 3+ mobs which each take 3 clips of your worthless rifle to kill.\n\nThe only thing I have positive to say about the game is that some of the graphics are better than I expected and the achievements are stupid easy to obtain (2-3 unlocks at a time is common)\n\nIf upgrading gear is obvious and I just missed it, let me know - I managed zero of the upgrade achievements yet had most of the others before leaving the first sector - silly. I also only bothered to kill like 200 enemies the whole time as its such bad AI you are better off just walking away","November 7, 2015","false","4.1"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","25","27","0","0"

Here's why:\nTask(s?) and game mechanism are horribly explained, mostly because of some very bad English but also because everything is explained as if it is obvious, but believe me it is not;\nthe human-character's face aesthetics are the worst. In years of gaming, I've never had hated a videogame character just because of how they look. Now I have.\nterrible, terrible main map; as boring as it is big (and we have some piece of pointlessy huge map here);\nterrible, terrible graphics: it made me check the year when the first Half-Life was released;\nenemies stop considering you as soon as you stop shooting at them. Also you need to empty like 4 or 5 plasma magazines before killing one and that feels really overdone. Also they keep respawning one friggin' minute after you kill 'em;\nif you die you have to start from the beginning of that piece of tedium map;\nrobot-character sometimes stop running for no apparent reason;\ngenerally nothing in this game is entertaining;\ngenerally everything in this game is boring and grinding.Achievements are initially easy to get but even this turns into a grind-fest very rapidly (kill 100, 200, 1000 enemies? Really? I killed 25 of them and I can't stop yawning already).\nI bought this game on sale for 0,39€, played 37 minutes then idled it for the rest of the cards, that I sold for 0,11€.

Thank you for making this review possible!\n\nFew words about the game\nBotology is a game where... I'm not even sure what's going on as it's explained with twisted and badly translated english. Intro tries to explain bits of backstory but it's hard to catch up even there. When you get into a proper game finally, you just go forward, without any clear instructions, just walk and hope you'll get somewhere. Once you get gun and some kind of objective... oh boy that's where fun begins. By fun, I mean grind at every corner. Literally. One of the most repetitive games I have seen in a while. Only thing that is good(ish) is music in main menu, that's all.\n\nAdvantages\nGraphics here and there but only partially\nAs mentioned, music in main menu. Hey, it's something!\nDisadvantages\nEverything is translated into weird, broken English. It's hard to even partially understand what's going on and what you're supposed to do\nControls are weird and not really understandable thanks to translation that explains everything in default controls\nThere is no vocing, everything is "voiced" by some speech synthesizer. There's also no language used, just gibberish with random words used here and there\nGameplay is repetitive, all you have to do is kill enemies and unlock different types of locks, over and over again\nTutorial teaches us nothing and even if it does, it does it really unclearly\nAnimations and mechanics are compareable to game made in 2000s\nFull of bugs everywhere (I fell through textures, died while touching the wall, walked on water e.t.c.)\nSummary\nGame is not worth time or money spent on it. Even achievements are easy to get but to 100% complete them, you need to pass whole game, good luck with that. Game is very below average, totally not recommended.\n\nPersonal score\n2.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","February 28","false","5.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

The gameplay is a pain; it's easy to get stuck in strange places, the camera is atrocious, and you have to hold shift to get around with any speed at all. This mayb e corrected later.\n\nThe environment is pretty decent, and with all the NPCs walking around the opening area, it does feel like a living world.\n\nI hope this creator is still making things; there's a definite talent lurking here. It just needs a lot of polish.","November 15, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you read nothing else, read that.\n\nI got the game as a joke, to see just how bad it could possibly be. I was going to write a review detailing the game. I was going to give you guys the benefit of a doubt.\nThat will not happen because the game WILL NOT launch.\n\nLet me explain. Most gamers now have Windows 10, including me. This game apparently only works with Windows 7, for whatever reason. Here's the thing though, nothing you do will get the game to launch with Windows 10. No compatability settings will do it. And you know what the worst part is? It's not crashing, it just refuses to go past the menu screen. Will not budge. I press "Start", the UI disappears and nothing happens. I press "Continue" and again, nothing happens. "Options" brings up the options menu, but what good is it? How am I supposed to review the game if I can't play it anymore?\n\nI've played the game on Windows 7 before I upgraded, and it was the blandest, and one of the most boring games I've ever played. That's all I can say.\n\nYou know what's worse than a game that has terrible gameplay? A game that doesn't work and can't be fixed.","December 13, 2015","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
