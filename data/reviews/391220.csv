"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/391220/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is far slicker and more balanced than that 2013 reboot. Lara’s graduation from naïve punch-bag to confident adventurer opens up her skills as she traverses the ice of the Siberian Mountains, sidling across cliff-sides, using axes to climb sheer faces, firing arrows from her hand-crafted bow to create rope swings. Abilities learned in the first game that are built upon here.\n\nSet one year after the events that began her journey to becoming the ultimate raider of tombs, Lara is now obsessed with completing her late father’s quest to find The Prophet’s Tomb. Despite concerns by her pal Jonah, she embarks on a quest to snowy Siberia, determined to discover the truth about The Prophet before a shadowy military group called Trinity does. It is said that whomever solves the mystery of the Prophet will unlock the secret to immortality.\n\nBelieve it or not, that’s the quick version of the plot summary. Throughout the campaign, many secrets and a few well-placed plots twists are revealed, with tons of content on the history of the Prophet delivered by way of audio logs. In the last game every time Lara came across these logs, she would need to stop moving and listen to these entries. Worse, the backstory was not at all compelling. In Rise of the Tomb Raider this function is exactly the same, but the events leading up to finding this quasi-religious leader is engaging. It helps that the voice acting is utterly convincing now.\n\nSiberia itself is a beautiful, hostile and believable setting. Storms whirl, battering Lara as she crunches onward through sheet-white snow; abandoned Russian military outposts sit rusting between peaks. And further down, the snow melts away and forests sprout up, the tribespeople setting up camps and huts between the trees. Despite every inch being meticulously designed with conveniently placed hooks and overhanging tree branches to aid Lara’s clambering, there is a tremendous sense of place. The whistle of the wind and a cinematic flair to framing environments as huge expanses communicate a sense of isolation. One woman against the elements.\n\nCrystal Dynamics put forth a fantastic effort with audio and sound for Rise of the Tomb Raider. When you hear the sound of Lara’s boots crunching against the fresh fallen snow, you’ll be brought right into the game. I could almost feel the bow stretching to its limits by the sound of the string crackling and tightening. This is good audio, people. When the sound design can make you feel the action you’re doing, that’s an A+ in my book. Lara’s voice work is remarkable. She could be brought to life through her dialogue alone.\n\nThe gameplay of Rise of the Tomb Raider is reminiscent of the 2013 game which requires the player to control Lara in a third person perspective which features exploring, climbing, stunts, combat and a healthy dose of puzzles. The title also boasts some great quick-time events which flawlessly switch from ingame to an interactive cinema that requires you to push a button or perform an action such as jumping at the right time or attempting to use your pick axe.\n\nClimbing mechanics seem much sturdier then the previous game as you precariously explore dangerous mountains and forgotten cities looking for clues, documents and ancient treasures. So as you jump, climb and hang, the control of Lara is perfect and even the wall scrambles which require you to run up the wall in order to reach a climbing point all work well.\n\nCombat is another element of the game which works well and it’s always a joyous moment when Lara gets her handguns because it pays homage to the original series. So while you shoot and use a variety of different weapons against your enemies, you’ll also need to use the environment to your advantage that may be covering or using something else to destroy your enemies.\n\nThere’s a stronger emphasis on stealth this time around, using the environment around Lara to get the edge on her opponents. So for example, in most encounters, at least outside of the guided and highly entertaining cinematic set pieces, enemies won’t know they’re being hunted unless the player makes themselves known. There are trees to climb to avoid detection, shrubs to move through to silently incapacitate foes and various distractions to use to your advantage. There’s even a minimal detection meter that will pop up over enemy heads, but this feels a bit underutilized as it’s just a two state alert (curious and found) and rarely came into play.\n\nAs you progress, you are awarded points that can the be used to purchase these skills plus the items you found in the world can also be used to upgrade your weapons and equipment. Apart from the main mission, there are also challenge missions such as exploring a new tomb or using some newly acquired skill to help complete this task. This definitely increases the gameplay.\n\nCrystal Dynamics have effortlessly done the impossible with Rise of the Tomb Raider, crafting a sequel that is superior to their reboot in every single way possible. It’s a bigger, more expansive experience that has a captivating narrative, engrossing gameplay loops and an absolutely stunning presentation.","January 28","true","178.2"," 287 of 342 people (84%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","84","287","342","16","8"

RoTR takes place one year after the events of TR2013 and you are of course playing as the character we all know and love, Lara Croft. This time around, Lara has set her sights on something known as the Divine Source, an ancient artefact that her father was trying to locate until his untimely death. While your adventure begins in Syria, the majority of the game takes place in Siberia in an area once controlled by the Soviets. Lara’s interest in the Divine Source has attracted the unwanted attention of an organisation known as Trinity who also wish to find the Source though they want it for different reasons, they are willing to do whatever it takes to get their hands on it. While the story isn’t really RoTR’s main selling point it is an engaging and for the most part well-written story that ties all of the missions together well.\n\nAs you’d expect from a recent release, RoTR is an absolutely gorgeous game though you’ll need quite a powerful rig to run it on the higher settings. While the appearance of the game does help make exploration more interesting the game is still enjoyable on lower settings. Personally I was running the game on lowest graphics settings on 1280x720 (my native res is 1920x1080) and while it wasn’t exactly easy on the eye I didn’t find that it took away from my enjoyment of the game. While we’re on the topic of appearances, I’ll briefly mention animations. RoTR is very well animated, as you’d hope, both with lip sync and general movements which really helps the characters feel real and give the player a real sense of just how cold Siberia is and what harsh conditions the characters have to put up with.\n\nRoTR’s gameplay is very similar to TR2013 though there is less of a focus on combat and more of a focus on the exploration side of things. If you’re familiar with TR2013 then you’ll know that the reboots are third person action adventure games with a few puzzles thrown in, if you can really call them puzzles. While RoTR has cut down on combat the gunplay is still a hell of a lot of fun, especially the stealthy portions which make up most of the enemy encounters in the game. You’ve got four different types of weapons at your disposal: the bow & arrow, a rifle, a pistol and a shotgun. While you start out with a bow the other three weapon types are unlocked over the course of the game with a few variations to unlock too. Speaking of unlocks, one of RoTR’s new additions is an item shop where you can buy equipment using the collectible currency in the game. While it can be handy to have the shop available to you it’s not a huge problem if you can’t find enough of the currency to buy what you want as most of what can be bought in the shop can also be found just by playing through the game. As well as this currency there are a few other types of collectibles most of which act as a way to feed you the backstory, such as Russian documents that discuss the layout of the building you find yourself in or even the origins of some of the in-game factions.\n\nOne of the other new additions is crafting equipment as well as ammo and bandages. The equipment you can craft is what you’d expect, ammo capacity upgrades though they do require quite a lot of resources which you’ll find by hunting animals as well as keeping an eye out for certain things in the world. You can now craft arrows, both regular and special, as well as use things you find in the environment to craft useful things such as using a bottle of alcohol and a rag to make a Molotov cocktail. Bandages can be crafted in and out of combat, though you’ll probably only need them in combat, and are again made using resources found in the world around you. Of course there’s also weapon upgrades in the game which you again make using resources found in-game and there are quite a few new outfits for Lara which are mainly unlocked by completing certain missions. There are a few other new mechanics introduced in a similar vein to the rope arrows we became acquainted with in TR2013 (which you also get in RoTR) but I won’t talk about them so I don’t spoil them, I will say they’re a lot of fun to use though.\n\nA big part of any Tomb Raider game is obviously the challenge tombs you can play. This is another area in which RoTR is very similar to TR2013, the tombs aren’t hugely challenging and they’re quite short but you do get nice rewards for completing them. Rather than the weapon part rewards in TR2013, RoTR offers players special skills for completing the optional challenge tombs which can’t be unlocked in any other way. The skills aren’t game changing with what they offer the player but they do make it worthwhile completing the tombs if you wouldn’t want to otherwise though the tombs are pretty enjoyable anyway. The similarities continue when you look at the skills available to you when you level up. While there are some new skills related to some of the new gameplay mechanics the majority of the skills are either the same or very similar to those available in TR2013. The skills are still useful of course but it can be a little bit frustrating having to unlock skills Lara learnt an in-world year ago (if you played TR2013). Speaking of skills, a couple of them do feel almost like cheats, such as once which gives you automatic headshots on three enemies when your bow is fully drawn but if you do think that's cheating you can simply avoid unlocking it.\n\nLike I said earlier, RoTR seems to be less focused on combat and more focused on exploration. RoTR gives the players several large areas and a few smaller ones to play around in and these areas can be explored in whatever way you want at whatever pace you want. If you want to you can just rush through the game, only doing the story missions and complete the game in around twelve hours. The game really is meant to be played with you doing at least a little exploration though. It is beneficial to go through the areas doing the tombs, exploring crypts, hunting and finding the strongboxes mainly for the upgrades that these will give you access to, making the later game slightly easier where the enemies are significantly more difficult. If you want to do a 100% completion run through the game you’re obviously going to be spending a lot more time in the game since you’ll have to go back through each and every area but I imagine most players won’t be aiming for this so it’s probably going to be around fifteen hours of gameplay for most players, that’s the main story anyway. There’s also a new game mode to keep you busy called Expedition Mode. Expedition Mode lets you replay story missions while using cards (earned by reaching certain story milestones and can be bought using in-game currency earned in a similar way) to either make the level more challenging or easier. The difficulty factor of the cards contributes to how many points you earn, points can then be compared with your friends for each level with the game’s leaderboards.\n\nVerdict\nWhile Rise of the Tomb Raider doesn’t offer huge improvements over the previous title it does give fans of the reboot more of what they enjoyed. It’s a gorgeous game with great gameplay and while it does require a good PC it can still be enjoyed on lower graphics settings.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","February 3","true","17.4"," 212 of 255 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","212","255","9","10"

This is without doubt one of the best looking games out on the market now. Whether it is the lifelike snow where you can see the miniscule ice crystals, the way the sun rays shine through a massive cave system or the elegant painted on the walls of ancient tombs… It simply is just gorgeous. But also the small details will make you fall in love with this game, like Lara wringing her hair out after taking a swim.\n\nRise of the gameplay:\nRise of the tomb raider has smooth controls, comparable to the previous title. It plays the same but you have more options now: for the first time you can climb in trees (hello assassin’s creed) and more weapons are available. Especially the bow and arrow feel really good compared to the one in Tomb Raider 2013. By improving previous features and adding new ones, Rise of the Tomb Raider plays like one of the old tomb raiders but still has a pleasant fresh feeling to it.\n\nRise of the tombs:\nIn the previous titles, tombs were small caves where you could find some extra ammo or some goodies, or a little experience if you’re lucky. The tomb design in this game is really powerful and makes me wonder why they are optional. They all contain memorable puzzle that will provide variety from all the action. Don’t expect any mind-bending puzzles that force you to look up a guide, but they all are gold-grabbing-finger licking good.\n\nRise of the conclusion:\nCrystal Dynamics created a dazzling exciting adventure which exceeds her predecessors in every aspect. A magnificent action-adventure game with more freedom,  both in exploration and gameplay.\n\nThe real Lara has risen!","January 28","true","4.2"," 368 of 494 people (74%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","74","368","494","38","16"

More importantly, does this game have puzzles?\n\nPresent and expected are the improbably improbable puzzles ubiquitous to the Lara universe; I ‘pray’ for these contraptions with secrets hidden beneath massive moveable walls and oversized cogs each controlled through a series of timed switches powered by gravity and water. A little bit of patience always yields a Codex with life changing knowledge (nudge-nudge wink-wink).  Inexplicably these puzzles seem to have been relegated to the “optional side missions”, a direct in-game quote. These are the classic Tomb Raider pieces that I love and I completed them as soon as possible; they always yielded extra XP, gold coins and skills; I wish these puzzling sections had been way longer. What then is ‘central’ to this digital archeological hunt? Read on….\n\nThe main plot unfolds wrapped as a “third person shooter”. Feeling a bit shaky are you? Yep, the spelunking has really taken a back seat to the shooter gameplay. There should have been far more dialogue options for negotiations, skillful stealth mode with zero death, and more creative gameplay in the central campaign.  Has Crystal Dynamics made a choice or a mistake? Don’t get me wrong, I love shooters but not this one. Combat with guns in tight spaces and an over the shoulder camera leads to a poor combat experience. Would you like a game with great combat, weapons and well designed arenas? Try Unreal Tournament 3 Black edition instead. Consequently, I found myself  avoiding all main story paths as long as possible because they were so combat unpleasant, and eventually I set the game to the easiest setting to make these encounters as short as possible. What else made the campaign a grind? The controls are ‘tuned’ for parkour platforming; mid combat my character kept putting away the gun and jumping into water or grabbing a ledge; who wants fudge? The default graphics settings use over-the-top screen effects making it uncomfortable: ‘water splashes on the lens’, ‘depth of field’, and others, all of them summing to a ‘digital finger in the eye’. Thank you Crystal Dynamics for letting me turn off all those ‘enhancements’ in the options menu.\n\nCrafting and skill trees were welcome and enjoyable although heavily dependent on hunting. The upgrade mechanics lead to a veritable slaughter-fest: I must have killed over 700 bunny rabbits, 300 deer, 50 wild boars, 10 grizzly bears, and a partridge in a pear tree. In fact I started farming previous maps for humans because they had the specialized parts. The weapon upgrades yielded for the most part palpable advantages in engagements: Would anyone like an RPG arrow head? Woooooo!  The remaining XP system felt hollow and served to redirect you back to previous maps, that is, if you want to find all coin stashes, hidden provisions, caves and relics. Meh. This is just a poor substitute for replayability.\n\nCrystal Dynamics have done superbly well with the extra game modes. I was particularly impressed with “Endurance” mode placing Lara in the Siberian wilderness to see how many days you can survive; requirements to eat, stay warm, collect resources, craft, and collect artifacts improve your chance of survival and reward the players having skill. Many players will enjoy “Score Attack” mode, an arcade version of the campaign. “Replay” game mode allows you to compare yourself to your Steam buddies through point accumulation.\n\nWhat else should you look forward too?\nA visually stunning and sprawling game world. check.\nTons of Steam Achievements. check.\nOne Special achievement for teaching BBQ chicken to fly. Sweet!\nPuzzle deaths: 30 times in a row with a game reload. Blame wonky controls. Rage quit. double check.\n‘Collision detection’ that doesn’t know ‘collision’ from a ‘hole in the wall’. triple check.\nExcessive grunts, breathing, and expletives in that sublime British accent. Yeah.\n\nBuy this game; all Tomb Raider fans will find something they were looking for and ‘more’. Thumbs up.\n\n\nMy score 9 / 10\n10 / exemplary execution of the genre with compelling innovation\n9 / exemplary execution of the genre don’t miss out, for fans of the genre and the curious alike\n8 / for well done not a must play, fans of the genre and newbs will be happy it is well done\n7 / for calibrated expectations only, fans of the genre would not miss out if they skipped this\n6 / only for serious fans of the genre for whom game play with bugs is acceptable\n5 / enough bugs to make me unhappy\n\n2016.02.17","February 18","true","85.5"," 169 of 213 people (79%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","79","169","213","24","5"

It's a glorified QTE system. Expand on the jumping system, design the levels so that I can jump, hang and land everywhere and have to figure out the way on my own, not this linear solution. It's not satisfying.\nOverall, it's a better game which improved a lot of my initial complaints but not extensively enough.

The last generation saw games evolve past pretty pixels and simple gameplay mechanics as studios set about achieving their cinematic ambitions thanks to the available technology. The upside of all of this is that while trying to beat Hollywood at its own game, game studios and publishers are slowly placing good storytelling at the heart of their games. Audiences are growing up and demanding more mature content while graphics are constantly evolving and pushing the boundaries of realism. Fortunately, or unfortunately depending on which side of the coin you fall, gaming characters now need to appeal to a far more broader demographic than merely just teenage boys. So out with the highly sexualized, top-heavy gymnast who previously enjoyed traversing the snow peaked caps of Nepal in a set of hot-pants and tank top while supporting Mount Boobius on her chest in favor of someone more real and tangible - and flat chested.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623439786\nLara's origin story worked wonders giving us a more real, relatable and well rounded Lara that was not only NOT invincible but bled, cried and groaned. A lot! Where the origin story focused on survival, Rise of the Tomb Raider grapples with the nature of obsession with a head-strong Lara letting her obsession with with her late father's research into the lost city of Kitezh and the promise of a immortality take her down a dangerous path. Her father's partner, Ana, attempts to warn her from following this obsession with Kitezh as this sadly drove him to ruin and eventually suicide. Of course Lara ignores the warning, heading off to Syria to find The Prophets Tomb which supposedly houses the Prophet of Constantinople and hopefully the key to immortality. Of course things are not as simple as that. They really ever are. Hot on her heels, and to make sure she does not succeed with her current mission, are an ancient organisation of knights known as Trinity who have their own dubious reasons for wanting to get their hands on the the divine source.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raiders plot is a bit more expansive this time around with varied locations that sees Lara traverse from the dusty deserts of Syria to the snow peaked mountains of Siberia and its surrounding forests. Once Kitezh has been located and found an element of the supernatural is included where players will get to explore a hidden world ruled over by a sect known as the Deathless Guardians. Each locale is exquisitely designed with some of the most shiniest and beautiful graphics ever to grace the PC bringing each area to vivid life . Rise of the Tomb Raider is definitely the most downright lovely and detailed game I have ever played on the PC. While my specs where below minimum with regards to the GPU requirements (a 4GB mobile 680M GPU), the game still looked outstandingly good. I can only imagine how beautiful it can or could look with more PC power at the helm. Even with my minimum spec GPU I was able to sustain a relatively good 30FPS throughout most of the adventure. However, for some strange reason cut scenes really caused the frames to tank sometimes even dipping into single digit territory. While this didn't happen too often I did find that the frames tended to fluctuate wildly during cut scenes. Hopefully this is an issue Crystal Dynamix are hard at work trying to solve as it also affects beefier systems.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=623682491\nWhen it comes to gameplay, Rise of the Tomb Raider tinkers with very little that made the reboot so successful. Cover mechanics are as solid as they where back in the reboot with skills and perks getting a much needed and more detailed work over. If like me you where blown away by the reboots escape sequences, Rise of the Tomb Raider features a fair few that amplify the action and are simply exhilarating. Often I found myself  needing to catch a breather after each had just taken place. Much like the first one your successful run through each of these gauntlets will be determined by how quick your reflexes are as well as your muscle memory. None of them are particularly long so dying during a sequence thankfully doesn't end up becoming a chore. Rise of the Tomb Raider also features more tombs to raid this time around although they are not as detailed or intricate as the tombs from the past. It appears in this department we are taking baby steps.\n\nWhile the reboots tombs where laughable at how simple they where, Rise of the Tomb Raider at least has the good graces not to overly dumb them down this time around but still they are not nearly where I was hoping them to be. The original series often struck a fine balance between gun battles and exploring and while exploring now also comes in the form of an open world to discover it would be nice if the next installment gave us tombs that are way more substantial. Gun battles against the game worlds enemies also appears to have been toned down somewhat from the first adventure although the ruthlessness with which Lara dispatches her enemies, I fear she may be in danger of turning into a complete psychopath. I highly recommend setting the game difficulty above normal because normal is just way to easy. Having gone back to play the reboot straight after finishing up the sequel it becomes very apparent, very quickly that Rise of the Tomb Raiders normal difficulty is a bit of a cakewalk. Having never touched the multiplayer portion that came with the reboot I certainly didn't miss it this time around. Instead the game offers up score attack modes for each level you clear that can then be used to challenge your friends. There is even an in-game card system that you slowly unlock through the main games campaign that grants perks and traits which are fully customizable and can be loaded in or out of a level when challenging your friends to beat your high scores.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=617638239\nRise of the Tomb Raider is that sequel that, while not straying too far off the beaten path, offers up everything the reboot did but on a far larger and grander scale. The games core systems have also been refined in positive way, such as the fact that Lara can now actually run, through to crafting and hunting that overall make the game a far more enjoyable one.  There is a lot to interact with here and thankfully the systems don't come across as too simple as the survival element of the reboot did or end up hindering ones enjoyment. With an adventure that is incredibly cinematic, Rise of the Tomb Raider is one of those games that I imagine is just as much fun to watch than play. Thanks to some truly phenomenal facial tech and and excellent voice cast headed by the fantastic Camilla Ludington, Rise of the Tomb Raider easily rises to the top as the consummate AAA blockbuster for 2016 that for the most part nails everything it sets out to do. Lara Croft is once again reborn and I for one eagerly await the release of her next adventure because as it stands, Rise of the Tomb Raider is now my favorite action adventure title. 2016 may still be young but Rise of the Tomb Raider certainly ranks up there with the best of the best. In fact by year end it very may well nab my GOTY for the year.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 27","true","38.0"," 135 of 172 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","135","172","7","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/391220/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is an action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. This game is the sequel to the 2013 release of Tomb Raider.  Rise of the Tomb Raider was released initially on Xbox in November 2015, but has just been released in January 2016 for PC. It is also due to release on PS4 later in the year.\n\nFans of the series will probably know what to expect when it comes to Tomb Raider. The reboot in 2013 changed the formula to the original series, and Rise of the Tomb Raider continues with the reboot’s theme. You play as Lara Croft in a third person view and you have to battle through enemies and solve puzzles with a good amount of platforming involved too.  Much like the previous game, there is also a crafting system, allowing you to create medi-packs, upgrades for your weapons, different ammunition along the way as you collect materials.  What I wasn’t too keen on in the previous release was that a lot of the game play was focused on the “all guns blazing” aspect, whereas Rise gives you a lot more option to play stealthily. You can of course go with route one and go gung-ho, but if you want to sit back and plan your attacks meticulously without being spotted, you can do that too.  The weaponry in the game is almost the same as the previous game too; with my favourite returning, Lara’s bow.  There is now the addition of throwing items such as tin cans and Molotov’s at the enemies to either act as a distraction or just for damage.  The platforming has had some interesting additions, such as being able to scramble up walls that are a little too high for Lara’s regular jump. This makes traversing the environments a little bit easier than normal.\n\nI played Rise of the Tomb Raider on 4k, with all of the graphics turned up to max, and sweet baby Jesus this is one gorgeous looking release. The facial animations on every single character are finished to perfection. It is almost like you are sitting straight in front of Lara, so much detail and effort has gone into making everything look just gorgeous! I find myself saying this every couple of weeks, but the animation has seriously blown everything out of the water in my opinion. Not to mention the stellar voice acting throughout the game too, with Camilla Luddington returning to play Lara Croft.\n\nI can’t say that Rise was a very difficult game to complete; there are a lot of puzzles to complete throughout the play through, but none of them are so hard I had to refer to a walkthrough. You simply have to study your surroundings for a second before taking any action. The combat scenes are probably the trickiest part of the game, especially in the later stages of the game when you are pretty much forced into using your bow against hordes of enemies instead of being able to rip them to shreds with your sub machine guns.\n\nThroughout your play through of the game, you will find artefacts in abundance. These upgrade certain skills for Lara when finding them and you can even be rewarded with regular experience points if you choose that talent when you level up. They add a lot of extra plot and lore to the story with a lot of it revolving around a lot of the main characters. You will also find that there are hundreds of items to collect, whether it be scavenging for materials to make an upgrade for a weapon, or finding the collectables, you will never find a section of a level empty with nothing for you to want to explore and find.  A new addition for Rise is side quests. Throughout the game you will find a handful of side missions that you can complete which will reward you with either a new weapon or piece of equipment to help you on your travels. Whilst you can complete the game without any of the rewards, they are simply there as an additional resource for skills and experience.\n\nI finished my play through of Rise in just over 12 hours. Whilst this is still fairly short, it is certainly an improvement over the previous game which only took me about 7 hours to complete.  There are a few additional game modes you can play when finishing the game. You can firstly go back and replay older chapters in order to finish collecting and finding items. You can replay the chapters but on an elite difficulty whilst also keeping all of your equipment and skills from your previous save though.  Score attack, which means trying to complete a chapter as quickly as possible but with a new set of rules in place, such as chaining together different attacks.  This means you can probably get about 20 hours of content out of the game, maybe more if you are really into it.  There is a season pass available for the game which promises a couple things, such as extending the single player experience in the story, and will also add a multiplayer mode.\n\nAs I said above, I played the game on 4K with all my settings ramped up to max. I was able to play the game perfectly fine with 60 FPS. The game was installed on an SSD so loading times were almost none existent. I played the game with keyboard and mouse due to the need to be quite precise when it comes to aiming and jumping etc.\n\nThe latest release of from the Tomb Raider series really does it self-proud in my opinion. Whilst some may consider this game bad due to the poor sales figures it received when releasing, a lot of that was due to another extremely popular title being released on the same day. Now the game has come to the proper gaming platform, it is truly an experience everyone needs to take for themselves.  The price of £35,99 on Steam is OK. I personally don’t ever tend to buy games for full price but this game was one that I actually pre-purchased just for my love of the series and I am more than happy with my purchase with this game.  As we’ve seen with the last game in the series, it will go on sale fairly quickly, so you may want to wait a few months to get it for at least half off.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

READ BELOW.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider is better at everything Tomb Raider (2013) did, which was a pretty good game. Rise is as good of an action adventure game of this type I've played. If you're into these types of games, this is one of the best ones, plain and simple.\n\nSome minor complaints are that it starts to narrow to an action oriented game only in the last couple of hours. Throughout the game there is a healthy medium between exploring and combat. The last couple of area's of the game look very cool but basically cannot be explored at all. First of all, there is nothing noteworthy to find in them and secondly you're 'forced' into combat constantly. It's not that the main game lets you avoid combat, but you can engage with it when you are ready for the most part. In the final hours it's all: 'nope, more combat, go!'\n\nIt makes sense narratively, but I'd rather they would've come up with a way for it to make sense to still explore and be stealthy if you choose.\n\nThe very final hours are combat overload and keep spawning guys against you. It's not the greatest, but unlike most other games, it doesn't feel ridiculous. You are plenty powerful at that point and even playing on the highest difficulty setting I had no problem disposing of everyone. And the combat is fun. So it was still a fun section, just not as good as the rest of the game.\n\nNow as for DLC...\n\nDO NOT ♥♥♥♥ING BUY ENDURANCE MODE. It is a shell of a game mode. Survival? Nope. Here's the thing, it has a Hunger Meter and a Warmth meter. Kind of like Don't Starve. Shoot one deer, loot it, whoop! Hunger is full again. No food preperation, no setting up camp, nothing. There is also no crafting or camp creation. It's just a bunch of fires spread around the map and you can light them for 5 wood. Clothing has zero influence on all of it. You can wear a tanktop if you want. Stand near the fire, it's full again.\n\nAll meaningless survival stats. Start the game up, 2 minutes in you have a bunch of wood for fires and you shot a couple deer. Congratiolations! You've beaten Endurance Mode!\n\nYeah... it's bad. There is nothing to do to actually make survival matter. I was expecting skinning bears for better clothing or having to craft camp fires and build a shelter. Nope, none of that.\n\nDon't. Buy. Endurance. Mode.\n\nIt's a waste of 10 bucks.","January 31","true","21.9"," 118 of 154 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","118","154","12","4"

The world feels more natural as it's full of different types of collectibles and puzzles. Unlike the first game, crafting different ammo types and weapons require a variety of materials. You need to scavenge for wood for arrows, herbs and cloth for medkits and so on.\n\nYou've got a "Survival vision" mode that highlights many objects throughout the environment, although it isn't necessary to use if you don't want to.\n\nAs you discover different relics, Lara will learn how to read languages, which then gives you the ability to read more complex artifacts with said languages. It's a pretty interesting system, and although it isn't much, it just adds to the feeling that you're progressing.\n\nThe exploration and platforming is the same for the most part. You can hook into walls, do a bit of a scurry/wall jump thing to grab ledges. Most importantly, it feels very tight, and if you die, it's your fault for missing the jump.\n\nThe combat has gotten more interesting.\nStealth has much more to it. You can distract enemies by throwing objects such as glass bottles, or hide on branches above them.\n\nLoud combat also gives you more options. You can throw lanterns or gas cans to light people on fire, or craft poison arrows that stun enemies in its radius.\n\nCrafting is very easy, as it just requires you to hold one button. Even while you're fighting, Lara can just craft up some arrows, as long as you have the required resources.\n\nSitting at a campfire gives you the ability to unlock perks that may come in handy. Explosive damage resistance, or chance to loot an arrow off an enemy after you've shot them with it. These add variety, and compliment your feeling of improving alongside your weapon upgrades. You can also change your outfit. Some are purely cosmetic, while others add small bonus stats.\n\nYou also have the option to fast travel to previous campfires if you want to go back and find all collectibles in an area. Secret tombs wield useful upgrades, and environments might have loot that could help you out, so it's a nice option to have.\n\nThe beginning of the game is a bit too linear, but I guess they were trying to make an action packed intro. It's still enjoyable, but the game gets much better after you really get into it around 1 hour.\n\nThe PC port seems to be pretty good. My computer is decent, although far from amazing, however, I can still run the game on high graphics with almost a constant 60fps.\n\nOverall, it's a really immersive, and well-crafted experience. It's fun and action-packed. If you enjoy third person platforming adventure games, or cover shooters, then you'll probably have fun with this.

If you rush through the path the game indicates, you can finish this game in a couple hours.\n\n- Eventhough you are climbing and jumping over cliffs most of the time, it's really hard to fall, like, you must put a lot of effort to achieve such feat, because the game is dumbed down so much, that it refuses to let you die. If you step over a cliff Lara automatically grabs the edge and etc.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall a good game, I wish it was not so dumbed down, at least on the hardest difficulties it shouldn't be so fricking easy.

Nothing comes even close, especially in 3D Vision, and the devs keeps adding more stuff like the new ambient occlusion called VXAO, that surpasses the already very good HBAO+, among other things. Gameplay is very enjoyable and it never gets boring, at least I didn't felt bored at any point while playing (some of my friends said it was so good that they rushed to the ending, and the game felt short due to this). Story is the usual hollywood cliche but that's not game breaking, it suits Lara Croft universe pretty well infact. The voiceover is very well done, like in the first of the franchise reboot (2013), and there is a brazilian voiceover option now that's above the standards.\n\nPSA: The engine is a huge step up from the TR 2013, and it's also very GPU heavy, but it has so many options to mess with that even if you don't have a very powerfull highend PC, you still can enjoy the game with a relentless presentation. So there is no excuse to not play the game, unless you are the kind of PC player that buys a GPU at a given time and expects it to run all games at 60FPS maximum settings ad eternum, it's just silly. So don't expect to have top notch graphics with your GPU forever, 'cos that's not how it works. The engine is very flexible, so the player must to be flexible too. In other words: Don't be delusional.\n\nI highly recommend this game for the ones that wants a very good single player gaming experience. Lara Croft has never looked so good.\n\n*Portuguese*\n\nEm relação de fidelidade gráfica, é o mais avançado que eu já vi até o dia de hoje, a maioria das pessoas concordaria com isso. Nada chega perto, especialmente em 3D Vision, e os devs continua a adicionar mais coisas como a nova técnica de oclusão de ambiente chamada VXAO, que ultrapassa o já muito bom HBAO+, dentre outras coisas. A jogabilidade é muito agradável e ela nunca fica chata, pelo menos eu não senti entediado em qualquer ponto durante a jogatina (alguns dos meus amigos disseram que era tão bom que eles rusharam para o final, e o jogo pareceu ser curto devido a isso). História é o habitual clichê de Hollywood, mas isso não estraga o jogo, ele combina com o universo Lara Croft muito bem na verdade. A dublagem é muito bem feita, como no reboot da franquia (TR 2013), e agora há uma opção de dublagem brasileira que é acima dos padrões.\n\nPSA: O motor gráfico é um grande avanço baseado no mesmo motor do TR 2013, e também é muito pesado no lado da  GPU, mas tem tantas opções para mexer nele que, mesmo se você não tem um PC high-end muito potente, você ainda pode desfrutar do jogo com uma apresentação implacável. Portanto, não há desculpa para não jogar o jogo, a menos que você seja do tipo de jogador de PC que compra uma GPU em um determinado momento e espera que ela seja capaz de executar todos os jogos em configurações máximas a 60FPS ad eternum, isso é bobagem. Portanto, não espere ter  gráficos topo de linha com o sua GPU para sempre (como muitos infelizmente pensam), pois não é assim que a coisa funciona. O motor gráfico é muito flexível, de modo que o jogador deve ser flexível também. Em outras palavras: Não seja delirante.\n\nEu recomendo este jogo para aquele que quer uma experiência single player muito boa no gênero que o jogo se propôe.  Lara Croft nunca esteve tão bem.","March 24","true","58.0"," 57 of 69 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","57","69","9","4"

For fans of the first one, expect a lot more of the same overall gameplay. For those who were wary or had some complaints about the first, ths second installment may have addressed some of those issues.\n\nAt the heart, it's still very much an action-adventure ala the Uncharted series. Many of the same mechanics seen in the first TR are still here: wall climbing, upgrades to weapons, stealth kills, etc. However, these systems go somewhat deeper, allowing for a more varied and advanced crafting system, as well as outfits. The various areas of exploration proivde a wealth of materials, and many of the fights have opportunities for multiple solutions, be it straight up brawls, using moltov cocktails, or stealthily moving about. QTE's are kept to a minimum and used mostly in obvious locations. The addition of the Marketplace and Expedition system also add a good deal of replay to the game that fell flat in the first game, unlocking new gear, outfits, and customized challenges to certain areas of the game.\n\nAs you explore and fight, the game also has a plethora of hidden areas, tombs, achievement items, and so on. The tombs are more robust this time around, and there seem to be many more of them to go through. While not overly difficult, most of them also provide direct upgrades to your talents and weapons, giving players motivation to solve them. Plus, they are created in beautifully rendered environments that fully immerse players in the game world.\n\nIf there are any drawbacks, those graphics are still a bit of an issue. I'm using a somewhat older system with an HD 7750. The game runs, for the most part, fine. The hair effects in particular do not give me the same problems the original did at first. However, there is still noticeable slowdown in areas with large amounts of water effects, as well as the start of most cutscenes, which is frustrating. It's a gorgeous game, to be sure, but without an option to adjust draw distance, it can be quite hefty for lower-end systems.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a similar step up to the ones the Batman series had after Arkam Asylum: a great game that takes most of the template of the first installment and expands upon it in a largely positive way. They clearly took a lot of the feedback of the first game to heart and did their best to make one of Lara's best games yet. It might not win fans who want strict reliance on the original 1990's games, but I'm having a blast.","April 19","true","11.7"," 43 of 50 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","43","50","3","0"

There's some nice scenic areas that are nearly as nice as witcher 3, nearly.\n- There are some nice semi-open areas which are really nice, it's not sandbox though.\n- The gameplay as far as tomb raiding is pretty good.\n\nCons: (Most of these are only a little annoying)\n- most of the combat scenes are very linear, with very restricted ways to approach enemies and this can get boring and frustrating when you want to be creative. The distraction techniques only work so well.\n- The combat areas are very scripted, often enemies coming from another room, with no possible way to see where Lara is, will know instantly where you are and immediately start firing exactly where you are.\n- The AI is both stupid and omnipotent at the same time e.g. I've taken down a whole room of soldiers standing near each other but slightly off from directly in front of each other, just with my bow, and none noticed their friends dropping like flies. Other times you can throw a molotov near an enemy and none of them were looking anywhere to see where you threw it from, but they instantly knew exactly where I was.\n- I've found times I've thrown a molotov, then hidden behind a wall, and all the while out of sight then moved to a different area and found the enemy to come straight to where I'm now hiding.\n- The combat mechanics are really clunky. you can't block, you can't go crouch or prone unless it's scripted for you too. When near enemies, Lara often stands bolt upright when she should be crouched, there's limited way to move between cover in any stealthy way.\n- The stealth mechanics are crap, I'm sorry, they just suck.\n- Enemies being able to see through thick smock to shoot accurately at Lara, despite not being able to see them on the other side, and no, they didn't have thermal vision goggles.\n- The camera often misbehaves, showing us what it thinks we want to look at. It would be nice to have more control over it, It also doesn't handle well when you move through a doorway whilst aiming a weapon, good luck seeing anyway but the wall.\n- Maybe I'm just picky, but the "tomb raiding" is too easy and too scripted.\n- Want to jump over a knee high barricade? Nope, not allowed there, oh there's a spot you can crawl through, nope again.\n- The arrows are not realistic, in any way, physics just doesn't seem to apply to them.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's a fun game and I'm enjoying it for the most part, but I didn't have to think much to find all those little problems that seriously shouldn't exist in a game like this, and the sad thing is, the main problems are with gameplay, the game looks beautiful, but there's lots of gameplay issues that could have been addressed, this really feels like it was dumbed down from what it should have been, sad thing is, the dumbing down is probably deliberate.","February 2","true","19.7"," 42 of 52 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","42","52","2","2"

Rise of the Tomb Raider improves on its predecessor in almost every way, with better gameplay, better graphics, better sound design, better pacing and most importantly, more actual tombs to exploreI i was dazzled by the size and scope of the island, the fast paced cinematic "escape" sequences, the simple yet captivating shooting mechanics and the boldness of delving so frankly into supernatural territory. Rise of the Tomb Raider just came out a few weeks ago here and I nabbed it as soon as I was able. It delivered everything I expected it would, a decent story with Lara's first encounter with Trinity and the race to find the "Divine source", an object that grants those that gaze upon it immortality before it falls into Trinity's fanatical hands. The combat remains fun, fast paced and somewhat easier with less need to take cover and instead allowing the run and gun approach. The traversal is more detailed this time around, with Lara having more tools at her disposal which unlocks areas previously inaccessible to her, like the Rebreather, Broadhead climbing arrows, and the ability to throw her pickaxe as a grapple hook. The crafting system has been overhauled, with Lara being able to craft bigger ammo and resource storage pouches as well as innumerous upgrades for each variant of pistol, shotgun, machine gun and bow. Most of these upgrades requires special animal hides, which Lara can acquire by finding hidden caches or through good old fashioned hunting. Bears and feral felines make an appearance this time as potential hunts for rare skins, but they won't go down without one hell of a fight... Lara can craft special ammunition on the go and accept side quests from allies who reward her with otherwise unobtainable rewards like new gear or attire. The tombs this time are more numerous and a lot more complicated to solve, at least the first time around. Completing them rewards Lara with unique skills like faster climbing, triple arrow shots and the ability to mine for rare metals required for the best weapon upgrades. There are also crypts in which Lara may find weapon parts and coin caches she can dig up to trade for weapon attachments and unique weapons. Unlike the previous game, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to acquire every skill and upgrade before the end, unless of course you enjoy grinding the same groups of enemies for hours, and so skill and upgrade choices need to be selected more thoughtfully and resources spared for the weapons you enjoy using most. The areas Lara visits are not as numerous as the previous game, but they are unquestionably larger, some maps may take hours and hours to complete while the transition areas usually take about an hour. Not every NPC is hostile towards Lara and there is one particular area that is home to a village filled with friendlies who Lara must help defend against Trinity\n\nPros\n1) The game looks and plays amazingly well.\n2) Gameplay\n3) Graphics\n4) Sound design\n\nCons\n1) Major FPS drops, especially during the cut scenes\n2) Very High Texture settings have lot of issues\n3) Game got stuck a couple of times, and i had to 'end-task' it\n\nHopefully they fix it soon.\n\n","February 3","true","704.4"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","82","37","45","5","0"

And was I judging the game on face value the review would be much more positive. However I can't, because the decision to include Denuvo DRM absolutely ruins what otherwise would be a very great gaming experience.\n\nDenuvo is inrusive, needlessly affects performance, installs unwanted software that remains on your PC even after the game is removed, and most importantly is totally  unnessecary.\n\nThey seem to feel combatting piracy is a more important priority than giving the paying customers a good experience. Hindering framerate and installing intrusive software is anti consumer and is only going to punish the honest. The truth is pirates will pirate, honest customers will pay. That's how it is and always will be. And it's pretty debateable whether piracy even affects sales.\n\nThe truth is most pirates aren't going to buy the game anyway, hence the reason they are pirates. So in reality the "sales lost" argument falls apart.But by god lets spend tons of money and resources combatting them anyway, even if it means taking advantage of the loyal honest customers.\n\nThey haven't released a game using Denuvo yet that has performed well. The heavy handed DRM is more important than giving us a quality experience.\n\nMeanwhile Witcher 3 is selling like hot cakes AND gaining goodwill by not forcing knee jerk, over reactionary, framerate crippling software in an attempt to combat the phantom piracy "threat", and good for them. I'll gladly give them my money for their product.\n\nThough I bought this game out of sheer appreciation of the game itself this is the LAST time I will purchase a game from Square Enix as long as they keep using this type of DRM that puts performance and the customer last. Which means it's probably the last time I buy a game from them period since they seem to think Denuvo is fantastic, and the inconvenience to customers unimportant","January 29","false","2.2"," 386 of 628 people (61%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","61","386","628","27","30"

What the hell? It's like the developers thought unless every 5 minutes Lara slides off a cliff and grabs on to the edge at the last milisecond then players will get bored with the game. Well, they thought wrong, because it's the repetitiveness that is boring. As far as raiding tombs go, every time you think you're about to start exploring some ruins you get attacked by a 100 mercenaries. In this installment Lara being an adventurer/explorer is no longer the central point of the game. Instead exploring has been abandoned for the sake of shooting bad guys. Which in my eyes makes this game a non-Tomb Raider game, especially when tombs are now officially 'optional'. At best this is a third person shooter with Lara Croft.\n\nPros:\n- Good graphics, gorgeous detailed environments.\n- Smooth gameplay, smooth controls.\n\nCons:\n- Narrow escape every 5 minutes.\n- Horribly written dialogue. The kind that you would see in a mediocre fantasy movie.\n- Lara does the dumbest sh*t and is incredibly lucky to be alive at all. She will climb any structure that is obviously about to fall apart. What kind of survival instinct is this? After a few bad decisions you lose any sympathy you had for Lara. She's not brave or wise or skilful anymore, she's just stupid and lucky.\n- Like I said before, can't explore anything, have to keep shooting enemies. I suspect this is an effort by the developers to sell Lara to the GTA and Call of Duty crowd.\n- Optional tombs are a joke and have no contribution to the story.\n- As always some rich a**hole is after the same thing as Lara and has to stalk her relentlessly. Needless to say they have access to better equipment, better transportation, infinite number of mercenaries and so on. How many times do we have to see this story in a TR game/movie?\n- Impossible to keep track of Lara's abilities. A new random ability is acquired every 10 seconds, with its own keyboard/mouse combination. And to use these you have to collect a ton of random sh*t and 'craft' things. Who has time for this? I for one don't.\n- Native people of Syberia speak perfect English with various accents, including British and American. What?\n- Where the hell is Putin when you need him? Trinity is bombing the crap out of Syberia in a modern day Russia and the only resistance they're getting is from Lara and some hillbillies.\n- Seriously the plot is BS. It's the kind of story you'd expect to see in a Twilight grade movie. It's extremely hard to get invested in the story. Every cutscene contains at least 10 movie cliches.\n\nHere's something for you to think about. Angel of Darkness is a better game than Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nUPDATE (After finishing the game):\nI was right, the game is r**arded, the writing is r**arded, Lara... is r**arded. If this was a movie, it would bomb hard. It would have like a rating 4 on imdb or something, max. Up to the very last cutscene they milk every Hollywood movie cliche any movie has ever suffered from. They made Lara the most boring character ever. Not because there's lack of action or anything like that. But because she is so perfect in every way that she comes across as pretentious, condescending and full of herself. At the end I found myself rooting more for the villains than Lara. At least they had a goal and a personal investment. Meanwhile Lara's goal was to show how better than everyone else she is, how noble and kind she is, while at the same time not having a problem killing a thousand people in the process. Thousand is an understatement, by the way. I feel like I killed more people in this game than I have killed in my 2000+ hours of Counter-Strike. In conclusion, I'm not writing off TR completely, but this is probably the last time I will pay to play TR. Also this will probably end up becoming the only TR game that I don't have any interest in replaying.","February 15","false","9.8"," 146 of 234 people (62%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","62","146","234","24","14"

I played for 36 hours to end the campaign and 90% of extra content. Dispending 40 hours you can make 100% of the game. Very good, but not consistent with the information of the producers 'would take 35 hours just for the campaign'. I estimate that the campaign can be completed in about 15-20 hours.\n\n- The voice acting is great. Lara's voice with an English accent is beautiful. The sound effects are perfect. The soundtrack is almost imperceptible, with no memorable melodies, and only those ambient sounds, a little disappointing.\n\n- Visually, it is one of the most beautiful games ever created. The optimization is reasonable, and fails in the shadow effects (very demanding and even at maximum quality are pixelated, Skyrim type). In open areas the frame rate drops significantly. The internal areas are much more beautiful, and you will find yourself often admiring every detail and forgetting to play. Lara's movement  is impeccable, interacting with the environment and the situation (cold, fear, danger, stealth, etc). Her modeling is awasome, many polygons and without any "square curves", leaving Lara more beautiful than ever.\n\n- The story is interesting, but like most games of the genre, are simple, short and predictable. The theme comes to religious fanaticism, that doctrine the faithful and leaves susceptible to manupulaion by people and nefarious corporations.\n\n- The optional tombs are the best thing in all game, in my opinion. Pure exploration, puzzles and beautiful scenery based on the Byzantine era. The game has more exploration than the previous one and the Uncharted series, which is great. There are still many exaggerated action scenes, such as the common clichés: walkway breaks during the passage, you fall and be safe in a wall of ice that break too, will roll to the edge of a cliff and clings on the edge, one helicopter launches a missile at you, breaks the platform and luckily you fall into a pit. I personally do not like these impossible sequences, and I think the studios could use their resources in more areas of exploration.\n\n- There are various clothes available for Lara, but without much variety, perhaps due to the cold environment. They are all coats and long sweaters and pants only. I could not pick a really cool outfit, and ended up leaving the less boring one.\n\n- The enemy AI is weak, getting too exposed all the time. I have killed more than 90% of them with head shots. It's frustrating because several improvements available for weapons and skills to show themselves useless. Only with the initial makeshift bow you can finish the game without difficulty. You do not feel any need to improve your weapons.\n\n- The expansion packs coming in the season pass are ABSOLUTELY DISPENSABLES. Strongly recommend that you do not spend your money on it. Only an additional mission, which is boring, some clothes, and two game modes that you will probably never play.\n\nRate 8.5 / 10 - Recommended (no season pass)","April 17","true","48.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

I'm dead serious. The facial animations are AMAZING.\nThat's all you gotta know about the graphics. If you're looking for an eye candy then this is it.\n\nAlright. The "important" graphics are out of the way so let's talk about the actual game itself.\nRise of The Tomb Raider is the first big triple A title to hit PCs in 2016 and it hit us hard.\nThe half-arsed, unnessecary and unwanted multiplayer got removed and replaced by more fitting Remnant Resistance and Score Attack modes.\nRemnant Resistance is much like contracts mode in Hitman: Absolution. You can pick a level, create your own challenges with your own terms and then share it with the world...Or you can just try to complete challenges other people have created.\nScore Attack, like the title says, is a mode where you try to get the best score you can in a singleplayer map/level.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much the same as in the previous game but the setting took a quick 180.\nInstead of being on an exotic and mystical island you're now located in a more known place...A place noone really wants to visit - Siberia.\nYou'll be doing lots of climbing, gathering materials for weapon upgrades and healing and you'll unlock new gadgets to progress into different areas. You'll also face another crazy cult. So in that sense Siberia really isn't that different from the previous island...Except there's A LOT of snow and in reality you would freeze to death...\n\nThe last title was all about Lara being an ordinary girl just trying to survive, adapt and become a warrior. Well she has been through that transformation, she's more confident in herself now and she's here to hunt and kill. Watch out 'cus she's dangerous!\nYou're not a scared little girl anymore. This time you'll be facing a crazy cult head on while helping locals to survive. You can even take side-quests from the locals which can turn out to be quite rewarding.\nI also have to mention that all characters in RoTTR are very well written. Especially the villains who are just so amazingly done. They're not your typical video game villains. The game actually kind of explains you why the villains are doing what they're doing. It's nice to see villains who actually have reasonable motives.\nIn most games the villains just kill for the sake of killing.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth, graphics are amazing, voice acting is top notch and i didn't encounter any bugs or glitches during my time in the game so i'd say that Rise of The Tomb Raider is worth your hard earned money.\nIf you liked the first game then this one should be a no-brainer for you.\n\nGame on!","February 19","true","12.0"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","32","40","4","3"

It's a bigger and a longer game than the first one. The game brings you to various huge and gorgeous environments, filled with (optional) tombs to explore and many treasures/relics to find. The level designs were improved as well from the first game, as the level are usually big and you can choose to stealth or go run and gun into battle where you can use the surroundings to your advantage, such as climbing trees, and crafting things from stuffs you pick up (even new outifts for Lara! Wow!).\n\nThe story is just fine, nothing too special, as it also brings you to Lara's dark past as well as the current events of trying to unearth the lost city of Kitezh and she faces a lot of difficulties to get there.\nThere are more tombs in the game than before and they are optional and you have to find the secret entrance to the tomb, which are usually not that secret anyway. The tombs' design could be better as they could've made better puzzles to solve the tombs and a little increase in the number of tombs wouldn't hurt, as I left unsatisfied after the game finished, as I wanted more tombs to explore.\n\nPros:\n- Great, gorgeous environments\n- Well optimized for a stable 60fps experience\n- Good balance between combat and platforming\n- Great action set pieces throughout the game\n- More tombs, new game mechanics\n- Great soundtrack and graphics\n\nCons:\n- AI is still a bit weak, even on the higher difficulties\n- Story could be better\n- Boring collectibles that makes you not want to 100% the game\n- A bit too easy, even on higher difficulty\n\nRATING: 9/10, the pros outweigh the cons\n\nShoutout to my friend, follower, subscriber, and loyal viewer, ajigapar aka ajipagar aka backseat gamer.\n#2 Shoutout to my favourite weaboo, friend, follower, subscriber, but not a viewer, Aoi-Chan aka BearDown for One Exam.","May 17","true","23.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","10"

Instead of building upon the strengths of the last Tomb Raider game and pushing this maybe a little further towards Uncharted with its intrepid action, compelling story, challenging puzzles and shooting sequences, they of course had to go a different road the with Rise of the Tomb Raider to appeal to the masses.\n\nIt appears that games no longer sell unless they get «openworldified» and filled with boring fetch quests where you need to collect X tons of garbage at some random location and need to help dozens of insignificant NPCs that don’t even get a proper introduction to begin with. This game feels like Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry combined with all their tower climbing, radio-tower-deactivating and animal skinning glory. To add insult to injury, the puzzles in this game have been simplified as much as possible.\n\nThe openworldish areas in the game lack credibility like in the last Tomb Raider game. They are filled with zip lines and seem like a show-jumping course in an amusement park. Due to all the nonsense I’m coerced to do or collect in these hubs I’m constantly being reminded that I’m actually playing a video game that ultimately just lacks immersion and builds upon empty time fillers and skinner box mechanisms instead. A lot of times it feels like I’m doing chores instead of having fun.\n\nOf course the game isn’t without strengths. It’s beautiful to look at for example, but the performance is weak even on fast systems. The story feels generic and uninspired, but I’ve seen worse overall. The combat is supposed to have gotten better since the last game, but there is very little challenge in it due to how dumb the AI is, and the clunky controls don't exactly make up for it...","February 4","false","21.5"," 118 of 190 people (62%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","62","118","190","8","8"

Lara croft becomes spider man and now she can raise her climbing axe with a rope and fly from building to building.

If yes, you should buy Rise of the Tomb Raider.  When playing TR2013, did you think "This was the worst decision I made since I tried to lick that opossum"?  If so, don't buy Rise.  If you never played TR2013, go buy that instead -- it gets down to like $5 these days on sales.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider is an improved take on the 2013 game.  As noted, the QTEs that plagued the first hours of TR2013 are gone, the pacing moves better and there's the usual improvements in tricks of the trade.  The story is nothing special: Lara has found a lead on an artifact her father ruined his life and career trying to find and so now she plans to redeem his legacy by acquiring the Divine Source.  The game is set mainly in Siberia with you traversing numerous forests, caves, lost settlements and abandoned Soviet installations under varying degrees of snow and ice.  For the most part, game play is straight forward and you likely won't get stuck on what to do next for long; objects you can interact with are either splashed with white paint or glow when you use your Tomb Raider Spider-sense.  Puzzles are better than in TR2013 but still nothing difficult -- I completed all with minimal issue and I'm pretty poor at physics puzzles.  Combat in the game usually seems to favor stealth (you'll silently fire your bow a lot) but only in terms of killing enemies.  It usually isn't practical or possible to sneak through and you'll be expected to bloody your hands often.\n\nAs a rollicking and action-filled archeological adventure, Rise of the Tomb Raider was a fun time.

I am impressed with the great story it tells. There is much more adventures than Tomb Raider 2013. It has more than my expectations. This title definitely worth 59.99$ as Tomb Raider worth 19.99$. You can't even guess how much amazing and fabulous is it. Though i completed the story with much time to feel the every moment of this game. I already can say it's gonna be awarded for Game of the Year 2016. Because it deserves something great and massive. Well, now i am gonna share my opinion and experience about this title.\n\nStory\nAs we have experienced the story of Tomb Raider 2013 which was mind blowing. But i have to say Rise of the Tomb Raider got far better story then ever. It's like reaching Lara's destination to discover divine source and uncover the truth what her father couldn't made it before his death. So it was Lara's destination to know the reason of the death of her father. So still there are so much barricades to stop Lara and find the Divine Source before her. She have to face something terrible with betrayal and conspiracy. So it was quiet attractive to live the story of Lara Croft in Rise of the Tomb Raider. I hope you are not gonna be disappointed.\n\nGraphics Quality\nI just stopped to take breathing when i watched the GFX of this game. It's seems so amazing and great. Never saw that sun light effect and skyline in other games. I took more than 100+ snapshots when i was in the top of the mountain. I thought The Witcher 3, Assassin's Creed Unity and Assassin's Creed Syndicate got the most attractive GFX ever. But Rise of the Tomb Raider failed me this time, that just crossed all other renowned games and became the most incredible. Developers really worked hard to polish facial work in this game. I can see they applied few numbers of facial layers on the face to make it more and more realistic. That was quiet more than my expectations for GFX of this title. Finally i got something like my taste.\n\nPros :\n1. Remarkably Optimized Game\n2. Stunning Dynamic Graphics Quality (GFX)\n3. Adventurous and Brilliant Story\n4. Detailed and Fascinating Gameplay\n5. Interesting and Useful New Features\n6. Enjoyable Combating and Actions\n\nNew Features and Gameplay\nI found few new features in this one. Like Expedition. Expedition allows us to reply any of the chapters with Score Attack or Chapter Reply or Chapter Reply Elite. We can earn credits by completing their given objectives by replying those chapters. We can upgrade ourselves to reach a bit higher in the leaderboards. Also there is Play Card which we can use through chapters. I also got few new outfits, some of them were gonna be unlocked by progressing on story mode and some of them were gonna be unlocked by completing their given tasks. But i just loving her Leather Jacket and Grey T-Shirt, these two suits her amazingly and She looks so beautiful and innocent. Well, that's what she is, too innocent and determined. There are few more upgrades available for Bow, Pistol, AK-47, Shotgun and Axe. Now i am gonna say about the Grappling Axe which helps us to grapple ledge if we fall from it or if we have to reach somewhere quickly. We can still use Axe to make finisher or melee attack as always. You can choose four types of difficulty in game like Adventurer, Tomb Raider, Survivor. I completed the game on adventurer difficulty because i had to feel it's story amazingly. Not just wanna die again and again for hard difficulty. I got many puzzles to be done to progress story more then Tomb Raider 2013.\n\nOptimization\nI have to say this is one of the best optimized games ever. They optimized it so brilliantly. Really loved it. i played this game with Very High settings and 1920X1080 resolution. Everything were maxed out, Even i maxed out Anti-Aliasing for best experience. My FPS crossed 135+ when i reached Syria. But averagely FPS stays between 60-80. My configuration : Intel Core i5 4690K, RAM 8GB DDR3, R9 290 Vapor-X 290 4GB GDDR5 OC Version with S2240L 1080P display. Well that's all happened with me, so don't know about your experience. Just said my opinion about it's brilliant optimization.\n\nError, Crashes, Bug, Stuttering\nWell, my gameplay experience was so smooth as hell, there was no error or crashes like Assassin's Creed Syndicate, no bugs, no stuttering. They made it just remarkable. There was no unexpected shut downs what bothers you the most of all. Just stunning as hell.\n\nMy Opinion and Ratings on this masterpiece :\nStory : 8/10\nGraphics Quality (GFX) : 10/10\nGameplay : 8/10\nOptimization : 10/10\nCombats and Actions : 8/10\nNew Features : 9/10\nOVERALL : 9.3/10\n\nSo i hope you are not gonna be regreted if you have planned to purchase this masterpiece. Remember, Rise of the Tomb Raider worth more than 59.99$. Highly recommending so try it if you can.(CROFT)","February 7","true","127.9"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","32","42","4","5"

Once again you take control of Lara Croft in third person as you go about the unknown, discover conspiracy plots and face dangers of nature and man alike. Who can you trust? Who will betray you, and why? These are things you will need to figure out as you play this game.\n\nUnlike the first game, you'll be playing the majority of this game in frozen Siberia, it's cold and Lara is freezing. The conditions are even harsher than the first game. There is more exploration to be had, more caves, more tombs, more secrets... just more of everything in general and that's a good thing. Not only is the campaign bigger, the locales are more open and there is a larger sense of freedom. The levels seem less linear as well, which is great for people to get more creative.\n\nWhile the 2013 game acted as a pilot to the series, Rise Of The Tomb Raider refines that foundation and builds upon it. It basically sets the bar higher in any imaginable way. Is it classic Tomb Raider? No, but it is a whole outher beast, a force to be reckoned with in the action/adventure genre. As Lara, you'll learn even more than tricks to help you survive in the wild against your foes, you'll continue to collect salvage an upgrade weapons and keep warm near fires but there is plenty of new things as well.\n\nThe high octane has been pushed to the 11 in this fluid action/adventure game. Everything has made more accessible from the plot to the graphics, giving the player more clarity to the world around Lara. It's not just all about running and gunning or climbing, the game has a great atmosphere and story and that's one of the many things that make me like it better than the first.\n\nPros  Amazing graphics\nGreat storyline told very well with nicely voice acting\nRefined game mechanics\nThe game has alot more tombs and treasures\nDiverse locales\nFull controller support\nCons  May not have enough differences from the 2013 game besides the locale and upped graphics\nHardcore classic Tomb Raider fans will be unsatisfied\nA.I can be a bit clumsy\nQTE's turn some people off\nLara's appearance has changed dramatically\nInsane DLC... $9.99 for endurance mode just to give you an idea\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis is a great continuation of the 2013 Reboot, it's worth the price of admission. It's solid in all areas and lacks very little. It's a blockbuster action title that holds its own against other well-known giants such as Uncharted. The adrenaline pumping heroine is back and ready to plan her next attack.\n\nRating (9.3 out of 10)\n\nThis review was written for and is published on the  Lit Reviews [LR] curator page.","May 23","true","4.5"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/391220/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","You often hear how AAA games don’t have the kind of pre-production time you’d expect, with projects often going into full production before anyone has a clear idea of what they’re making. Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like one of those games, as most of its story is thin and poorly thought out.\n\nI was excited to play Rise of the Tomb Raider, being a fan not just of the last game, but the series as a whole. With the last game the devs raised the bar, creating a very interesting jumping off point for future installments. Unfortunately they don’t seem to have had any good idea for where the series is supposed to go. What you end up with here is a hodgepodge of ideas from Uncharted and Assassin’s Creed, with most of what happened in the last game completely forgotten.\n\nWhen you’re in control of Lara, the game feels just as good as the last game. The feeling of climbing, sliding, shooting etc is all very well done, and it’s no problem at all that this basically plays exactly the same as last time. They haven’t run this system into the ground just yet. The way the game is paced feels perfect, with all the different elements getting just enough screen time for maximum effect. In general this feels like a better game to play than the last one, and is a big part of why I enjoyed this game despite the story being disappointing.\n\nYou just can’t make the exact same game a second time, wrap a different story around the systems, and expect it to come out the other end in a coherent manner. In Rise of the Tomb Raider I couldn’t buy into the villains, or Lara, or her allies, or the setting, or almost anything that was going on in the story. I liked the ideas on kind of an abstract level. But the way the story plays out is borderline incomprehensible. Events seem to happen out of order, and characters are as thinly developed as it’s possible, with audio logs acting as an emergency measure to add motivation and depth (in a way that does NOT work btw).\n\nIn the last game, Lara made sense to me. As the violence escalated, her willingness to go along with it made sense, as she was turning more feral, looking less and less like a normal person. In cutscenes the contrast between her wildness and her companions became more and more extreme. In Rise of the Tomb Raider that Lara seems to be gone. In every scene she seems kind of normal, even in later parts of the game. She doesn’t go through any kind of journey like last time, nor does she seem to have any baggage left from the previous game, which is strange. Much of the her motivation this time is around her father’s legacy, and the things he left undone before his death. Remember that father figure mentor guy from the last game? Because this game didn’t. The more I think about the details in the story, the less it all makes sense. Like doesn’t she love historic artifacts? Then why are many of the challenges designed around destroying them? I didn’t do some of them because it felt like sacrilege. One moment the native villagers directly say to Lara that she’s a friend, just before she goes off and robs their ancient tombs within eyesight of the village. Is she just pulling the wool over their eyes? Is this some allusion to how the British empire managed to spread back in the days? She tricks everyone into thinking she’s a friend, all while robbing them of their historic artifacts and leaving the rest in a pile of dust. The story doesn’t acknowledge this aspect at all.\n\nPart of the appeal of the Tomb Raider series is getting to explore old mysterious ruins in exotic locations. They kind of botched part of that here, as you visit old soviet era factories and interact with locals who somehow all speak English without an accent. One of my favorite moments of Uncharted 2 was when you’re in Tibet and is led by a guide who doesn’t know a word of English. The environments in Rise of the Tomb Raider are very similar, but they for some reason decided that the people of North Asia should just look exactly like the island dwellers in the last game. Feels like they’re wasting the potential of the setting and kind of missing the point of making a game like this. They might as well have set the game in Canada instead if they weren’t interested in presenting other cultures to the player. Instead you get a strange contrast between the ruins & artifacts right next to the supposed descendants of those cultures still living there, not displaying any resemblance to those cultures in any way whatsoever. I’m just guessing this stems from the project being so poorly thought out before they started making it. If they knew in advance where the story was going to take place, they probably wouldn’t have made them like this.\n\nBut for all my complaints, I still had a great time playing Rise of the Tomb Raider. The way the exploration and combat feels is about as good as you can get from the genre right now. Just being in the world, looking at it, moving through it, hearing it, are all critical aspects for a game. And this game nails all that. Some of the set pieces feel overindulgent, throwing in more explosions than the story had earned. But when the finale rolled around, the way it built up to a crescendo of everything exploding and falling apart was very nicely done. I was hoping for more, but even so this is an easy recommendation. It’s highly unlikely you’ll have a bad time with this. It just doesn't inspire any confidence that the series will ever top the last one.","March 7","true","14.8"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","25","31","3","2"

He's a lovestruck fool who follows this crazed chick called Lara across the world, enabling her destructive, often callously vandalistic behaviour. Jonah's a bit of a mystery to me, but my best guess is that he'd like to get in Lara's pants - she'll never let him, though. She's a descendant of snooty british aristocracy and he's from the West Indes, so there's that. Jonah is forever cast in the friend zone, it's kind of sad, really.","February 8","true","7.7"," 42 of 61 people (69%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","69","42","61","97","4"

(GTX980TI)\nCrashes due to "Not enough RAM". Since when are 16GB not enough?\nThe performance of the Game is clearly terrible.\n\nWe already know that the developers get cheaper and cheaper and instead of giving us a good performance they just say "buy better equipment".\n\nBugs:\nAlready in the first hour of playing this game there have been lot's of bugs.\nAt one point Lara even had a stone attached to her body, which was stuck there for about 15 minutes.\nEven though these small bugs are not very annoying or game breaking, they exist and there are not just a few.\nTherefore they have to be mentioned. Bugs like that aren't acceptable in a full price game.\n\nThe game itself:\nThere has been alot of recycling in this game. I didn't see any big new features or ideas in this game. Even parts of the design and story have been ripped out of earlier games or even the movies.\nOf course people like it when there are things in the game that remembers them of something they know, but if the whole game is made out of those things, it's just annoying.\n\nThe really bad thing about this game though is that they just use the name of the Tomb Raider franchise. It's not really Tomb Raider anymore. Not even Lara's looks are how they used to be.\nLara's background story is messed up as well.\nThe puzzles are too easy.\nThe game is too short\nThe performance is too bad.\nAll things that used to be way better in the earlier games of the Tomb Raider franchise.\n\nDon't understand me wrong. It's not a bad game, it's just not Tomb Raider anymore. With any other name, character and story it would be more than just acceptable, but this is just a cheap use of the name of the franchise.\n\nI still prefer Tomb Raider I - IV above all the others. Those were the original ones and not those action bound games that have nothing to do with Tomb Raider but using the name.\n\nIn conclusion: Alot of game magazines already state at the beginning of each year that it's "the best game of the year". I can already tell that this is one of the most disappointing games 2016.\nI highly recommend not to buy it and not to help them destroy the franchise even more. Just buy the first few Tomb Raiders for much less money and have a way longer and bigger game.\n\nEDIT: This is a review about the game and how it was programmed. I got alot of comments about how to improve the performance. I deleted all of them and will continue so since this is not a help forum and simply about the game. The end-user shouldn't be responsible for fixing any kind of issues or bugs.","January 29","false","15.4"," 117 of 195 people (60%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","60","117","195","8","30"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/matezzz/recommended/391220/","matezzz","NA Salt King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/matezzz/","43 products in account","Tomb Raider series have always been able to find their fans, who were looking forward to a new game. The main character Lara Croft's seeking adventures throughout the world and reveals unknown mysteries, explores tombs and caves.\nThe series were indeed popular, so there were 2 Tomb Raider movies released in 2001 and 2003. Lara Croft was portrayed by beautiful Angelina Jolie, who was following trails left by her father. To be honest, potential of Tomb Raider franchise could have been used way better. Everything was fine, but not exciting at all. More climbing, more tombs were missing, basically we know Lara Croft in a better light.\n\nBack to videogames. In 2013, Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics took this title into a whole different level. In collaboration with Nvidia they managed to improve the graphical side of the game. They’ve begun with a brand new story. Improved gameplay. We’re getting more detailed Lara. She’s leaving her known Dual Pistols and places more importance on a bow and stealth. Playthrough is way easier with the new Survival Instinct. Tomb Raider was definitely surprising and many of us were looking forward to continuing.\n\nAnd now, here is the sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider. It may sound a bit unbelievable, but the developers improved the already amazing graphics from 2013. The game looks insane even on lowest video settings, and Very High is a heaven for screenshoters. Characters look very realistic with sick voices and communication, the environment is breathtaking and you might stop at a view to take a screenshot so many times.\n\nDespite the fact that the game works on the same basics as the previous one, there are few new details making the gameplay more enjoyable. One of the most important news are resources, which can be gathered throughout the world and further used for crafting arrows, equipment, upgrades etc. Of course the ammunition can be picked up directly, but you should barely run out of ammo during combat thanks to the crafting ability.\n\nThe story is quite good, although I have to say it takes after a regular FPS. From adventurous Lara Croft seeking for historical artifacts becomes a woman seeking for revenge, anyway, let’s see what the next sequel will bring us. Unlike the first game, there are more optional tombs, some of them are easier, some of them more difficult. In fact if you’re going for 100% game completion, you have to collect all relics, documents, caches and go through every single tomb and cave. Should take about 30 hours of playtime.\n\nBack in Main Menu I recommend trying Extra Game Modes, thanks to which you’re able to replay earlier chapters of the story, or play any mission of your own volition.  The game is enriched by Expedition Cards, which can be bought for credits. Credits are earned for completing challenges, exploring the world or completing Game Modes mentioned above. These Expedition Cards further modify your missions, either they become an advantage or disadvantage and in combination with high difficulty can give you a really hard time.\n\nFor current price of 50€ Rise of the Tomb Raider offers an unforgettable gaming experience. If you fell in love with 2013’s Tomb Raider, there is really nothing to wait for. The game will pay off and you’re going to wish it’d never end.\n\nEnjoy the game!\nMatezz","February 16","true","27.2"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","32","46","3","0"

I would recommend playing on High instead of Very High to save about 20 fps, with small differences.)\n\nThe game runs at around 40-45 Fps with max setting (except shadows turned off, V-synch set to double instead of triple buffer and msaa at x2 instead of x4 - this includes HBAO+ on and textures on very high etc. This seems to be a good port, but a demanding one all the same. I'd recommended anyone with a lower system than me, or people with a similar set up looking to get 60fps, to turn the hair effects off as I have heard they are demanding. HBAO+ is supposed to also be demanding too. Especially to those with AMD set ups. If you own an AMD system I can't confirm how this game runs with AMD, but Tomb Raider (2013) was pretty well optimised for AMD aswell as NVidia so hopefully this is the case with the sequel too. (Minus all the Gameworks NVidia features).\n\nOverall seems like a solid port.

I wasn't sure whether i'd get this game or not due to the fact that they made it Xbox exclusive (Timed exclusive, releasing later this year for the PS4) which was a big 'FokkYou' to the fans that played on PC and or PS. It was definitely something i do not support. With many people claiming they wouldn't buy the game because of that. Hopefully the people at Crystal have learned to not do this again.\nAnyway.\nI love this game, i really do.\nBut lets get right into the pros and cons.\nPros:\n+ Decent story, definitely better than the first game IMO and a very intriguing after credits scene.\n+ Fantastic graphics with Lara's hair looking beautiful with Purehair on.\n+ Semi open areas, semi big open spaces to explore, not a sandbox/open world though.\n+ Actual tombs to raid. But are completely optional. With challenging puzzles from time to time.\n+ Improves on everything from the first game.\n+ Great gameplay, works great with an Xbox One controller.\n+ Crafting adds fun to the game.\n\nCons:\n- Way too easy, played on the second hardest difficulty and died about 5 times from AI.\n- Dumb AI\n- Even with different weapons and explosives. Combat stays pretty much the same.\n- There is stealth in the game, but its awful. Only went stealth once and ended up rushing the last guy.\n- Mouse and Keyboard during some puzzles can be troublesome (Played with an Xbox One Controller though)\n\ntl;dr: It's a great game that improves on everything the previous game did. Definitely worth it and i highly encourage anyone to go pick it up now despite its problems which are very minor.\n9/10 without a doubt :))","February 3","true","17.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","22","30","5","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/recommended/391220/","athravan","Athravan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/athravan/","863 products in account","This is a visually stunning story driven adventure that takes everything that was good about the 2013 game and enhances it. Graphically realistic with a smooth PC-port that has a couple of glitches, but great performance overall. The amount of detail in the background and setting is impressive and immersive whilst seamless integration between cutscenes and action really pulls you into the environment. In short, it looks flippin' awesome.\n\nThe controls are smoother than before, with even more climbing, jumping and in my case, excessive falling. Combat is reactive, and the bow a viable weapon choice - so much better than previously, with added stealth and distractions like a ton of different types of arrows and explosives. The upgrade and crafting system is relatively simple, but gives a feeling of growing power as you progress and makes it worth hunting down those extra resources. Puzzles are complicated enough to make me feel smart, whilst not so challenging as to leave me frustrated, and there are an absolute ton of collectibles for the trophy hunters. It starts off incredibly linear, but branches out more after the first 60 minutes of gameplay, giving you the option to take on side quests, hunt for collectibles, tackle optional challenges and puzzle tombs, or progress through the main story. Of course, a game like this is always going to be fairly linear overall, but there are enough optional things to make it feel like you have an element of choice and discovery. Oh, and remember those QTE events that were everywhere and annoying as hell? Yeah, they're gone!\n\nThe story is decent. It's not breaking any boundaries - but I wouldn't expect it to. It's the origin story of the most famous bad-♥♥♥ adventuring lady in the gaming world, who seems destined to save the world and grab some loot along the way. It's what you would expect, a mix match of legend and history and it works really well. Some of the dialogue and voice acting is top notch, and some of it leaves a lot to be desired, but even when I'm groaning at the lines or yelling at Lara to stop being so dumb it's still a super fun action adventure to play, and that's the important bit.\n\nOverall it's a well crafted balance between story, exploration, brains and action.

I'd like to see where the story is going somewhat, and I'm still kind of miffed Lara's iconic dual pistol thing isn't at least an upgrade in this since it was so perfectly built up in TR2013. I still like Lara's aggressive attitude and how she explains artifact lore.\nWhy are there two games to establish her starting character arc? That's a little much. A lot much. It is almost as if they made this alongside TR2013 and both are separate reboots. I say that when talking about mechanics and story both.\nI can see the dev’ meetings are dry on ideas and hitting on popular tropes and cliche for TV. I see Jonah becoming a love interest immediately in the next game and that kills me inside. No one involved with Trinity is a compelling antagonist at all.\n\nUpgrades are terribly paced, with backtracking and/or grinding to get most of the needed ones or ones that were in TR2013. This includes things such as the grenade launcher, pistol silencer (Now un-toggleable?), and rope ascender. This also ties to the tacked on side-quests, three of which were directly related to the main story, all others were backtracking for certain gear upgrades that you never needed and could pass by on accident as you had to actually go back to know you had these quests available. Weapons were overpowered on every difficulty regardless. Once you get any shotgun you'll go from powerful to being untouchable.\nCombat is easy, stealth is too hard to manage but not unreasonable. Throwable/craftable objects added nothing but clutter to the game and made looting and stealth frustrating. Forced backtracking for some of the fun explorable side areas. PC port interface bugs forced me to restart the program several times, specifically I couldn't interact with the game at all once a tutorial prompt for certain skills appeared. Crashed once. Artifact and document side lore was very gripping, but choice in voice actors was limited to maybe two or three and ruined immersion. (Same as the enemy voice actors too.) No interesting music at all.\n\nRuns like Hell on my PC for a few jarring seconds but then is suddenly smooth. This happens when it loads, but it also happens sometimes during set-pieces and every time I change weapons after fast-traveling, plus some others. I don't understand why it runs at 60fps and then suddenly drops to 3 seconds of a single frame. Seems to run more on my CPU than my GPU for reasons I can't begin to understand. This game looks almost live action (Which is impressive) at max settings and when it isn't stuttering. Can't seem to get the performance to be any different from min to max settings. I don't use NVidia hardware at the moment which the game seems to be more made for. It might somehow be my PC, but I really doubt it as I run other games just fine without these issues.\n\nOne of the big things to note is the additional content beyond the main game is unnecessarily convoluted. It's not set up very well to start with but then there's a micro-transaction store for other modes, where the fun New Game+ stuff should be. Replaying chapters with "Big head mode" and "Bodies sometimes explode when looted" but stuff like that is incentivized to be payed for, with a random card pack mechanic on cards that can only be used once.\nThere's also permanent cards which are gear and costumes and there is a way to use the gear that you've collected in the main game for these other modes. This applies to some DLC and stretches somewhat into the costumes. You can still get the main game costumes and the card packs with some good grind time for free, minus the main game weapon skins.\nThere's some sort of online score attack thing connected to this where you're supposed to compete with your friends on a scoreboard.\nIt's a..."Multiplayer experience" with "Optional" micro-transactions. I usually don't mind this when the game is otherwise perfect, but in this title I can't let this slide because it gets in the way.\nThis was a pain to explain and is also a pain to wrap your head around in game, I probably missed something because there's so many stipulations to it. It feels like it's trying to compromise with both the players and corporate and it does a poor job.\n\nAll in all, I feel like I should really like this. A lot of performance, design, writing, and micro-transaction backsteps keep me away from that opinion.","February 4","false","20.6"," 61 of 101 people (60%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","60","61","101","7","11"

And story was not gripping enough to keep me enjoying the same actions over and over.\n- Too many items. Items everywhere. In every corner.\n- Games focus on achievements and completion of finding documents, murales, etc. The rest is a mediocre platform and an easy shooter\n\nIf you didn't play the previous TR, buy the previous one.\nIf you played it, be aware, this is the same thing but with a bad/generic story with update gfx.\n\nYou will definitely like it if you have a compulsive collector syndrome and want to collect every loot you can find.\nBut don't play it expecting a story-rich experience or gameplay variation.\n","May 20","false","15.0"," 37 of 58 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","37","58","0","0"

I personally enjoyed going off the set path hunting animals for exp and crafting materials or simply looking for collectibles and caches: most actions and kills will reward you with exp that you can then spend on one of the three skill trees helping you tailor Lara to your chosen playstyle.\n\nA few downsides are enemy AI which is ok on Survivor but still somewhat exploitable, a few bugs (the one making the map appear blank being the most annoying) and a few glitches with jumping or using your grappling tools: all the issues are easy to forgive though as they don't impact gameplay too much and even a bad jump will see you back at a checkpoint very near your starting position.\n\nWhile you won't find an huge amount of innnovation in it the game is an absolute blast to play and will provide you with a lengthy, enjoyable experience through its story mode and (for those so inclined) through its score attack mode and DLC. I personally enjoyed every minute I've spent in it and heartily recommend it.","February 1","true","22.2"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","0"

I have not gotten so absorbed into a game for a long time.\nI immediately started to collect all of the collectibles in the zones as I started and really enjoyed running through the open world to find all these items and figure out how to get to some of them. The beautiful environment and the stunning graphics reallly helped in that regard as well.\n\nFor gameplay I felt the game had everything. A wide array of different arrows like poison arrows for those nasty guys with shields, fire arrows for either objects or your enemies, even explosive arrows to bring down a group of enemies! There were 4 different weapons (bow, pistol, rifle and shotgun) with several different choices for each one. All weapons had lots of upgrades as well, which made collecting resources in order to upgrade them quite fun.\nLeaping from trees and roof tops to assassinate targets, or doing a stealth kill from a bush felt really awesome, reminded me quite a lot of Assassins Creed. :p  And the stealth in general was really good. Could distract enemies with bottles and things to help you in that regard.\n\nThe exploration and platforming had quite a lot of variety as well how to reach items and places. You start off with the basic climbing axes, then get rope arrows, climbing arrows and some other stuff. And you unlock them at different points in the story, which makes exploration and collecting feel sort of fresh throughout the game as you get that new stuff.\nThe puzzles in Tombs and other places wasn't very hard, but I guess that is a preference how hard you want that to be. So even if they were not terribly hard on their own, I think there is plenty of those small puzzles or places you have to stop and think about how to proceed to keep it interesting.\n\nThe story was great and kept me interested throughout the game and the ending did not disappoint either. Plenty of documents that tell the story from different peoples perspectives, from different sides and from different times. So you gather small pieces of clues all over that adds to the mystery.\n\nI think I spent 50+ hours before I completed the story, but that was with doing 100% completion in all zones (besides the last one I have a few things left) and doing every achivement I could.\nAlso has Score Attack and Endurance mode (Endurance is from DLC) to keep you busy as well. So now I just need to pick up the last achivements I got in story mode, then I need to get all the achivements from Endurance and Score Attack, which means getting Gold Medals on all levels.. so should be very many hours of game time left for me.  :)","February 14","true","128.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","21","30","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/391220/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider's opening is pretty great. It starts out with a tutorial in Siberia to teach you the basic navigation controls, then you're moved into a beautiful green landscape with a decently large tomb with a few puzzles, a few texts to read, and a few artifacts to nab. For these brief moments, the game feels like they really did listen to peoples' comments about the first game, and were actually working to make the game feel more in line with the original games. Then the first of many explosions kicks off, and you realize that isn't the case.\n\nThe primary theme of Tomb Raider 2013 was survival, and in that sense the primary theme for this game is also "survival" because Rise of the Tomb Raider is essentially just a rehash of a reboot. It brings back all the obligatory cookie cutter modern survival game mechanics; you'll hunt a few deer, craft a few handbags, and scavenge a few glowing plants. They don't go much further than the bare minimum in mechanics despite most of the game taking place in frozen wilderness, so outside of having to gather firewood a single time you never have to worry about heat or hunger and are free to remove your winter clothes entirely and explore the frozen wastes in an ordinary shirt and pants if you so desire. The game retains both the stealth encounters and the explosive shooter encounters, each with AI bad enough that on the default difficulty you don't even really have to bother with things like cover or healing. The game was said to have more optional tombs than TR 2013, but I didn't notice, and if it did they're still to few and far between to feel like the game is actually about tomb raiding and not shooting up a private army. And of course, the Uncharted influences are as strong as ever, so you can expect plenty of thrilling "hold forward to not die" sequences and that one setpiece where lara slides down a slippery surface that they did like 50 times in the first game.\n\nThe problem with this game isn't that it's bad, it's just that it's incredibly uninspired. None of the gameplay mechanics really work together with each other, and even though each bit has had slight additions since 2013 it's not enough to actually make me care. The story is noticeably less interesting than the previous game, with very few characters to actually care about. Even though the game still poses itself as a survival game you never get any real sense of danger, and your survival throughout the entire game feels overly scripted. It quickly begins to feel less like exploring and searching for rare artifacts and more like running around with the map open collecting dots that lead to more dots, as if you're just doing Indiana Jones's grocery list instead of playing a video game.\n\nIf you loved TR 2013 and are okay with more of the same, this game might be worth it on a sale. If you weren't  a fan and were hoping this one would change your mind or if you're just a fan hoping they've made a fresh new game, I don't know that I could recommend it at all unless it goes to $10 or $15 eventually. Rise of the Tomb Raider is the most boring game I've played in at least several months, and even though these tricks might've worked in the first game they're going to have to think up some new ways to excite me if they plan on going through with the obvious sequel hook they placed.","January 30","false","18.7"," 290 of 526 people (55%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","55","290","526","35","16"

Lara translates: "Night won't prevent us from working". Dog tag with "Ж-897169" written on it, Lara reads a name and a surname. Really?..\n\nYou can clearly see how much effort and dedication went into perfecting the main character. The way Lara squeezes out her ponytail, the way her hair color changes depending on the lighting, all those small girly movements that were only possible thanks to motion capture... I bet she'll leave an empty feeling for a lot of gamers after you'll pass the game to full completion. She is one of the most realistic game characters I've seen, if not THE most.\n\nAt the same time, there are some downsides, and the perfect protagonist makes them stand out even more. The ones that disappoint me most are optimization issues, shallow secondary characters and the lack of new game mechanics. I'll expand on these a bit when I'll finish the game.\n\nMaybe Rise won't offer the most thrilling plot in the industry, but I'm pretty sure I'll be coming back for a replay or two, at least for all the sights and landscapes.\n\nFOR THE MAP GLITCH, until it's patched: the map will sometimes appear blank, especially if you are close to the egde of a level.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/391220/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","Let’s get right down to it, Rise of the Tomb Raider (RoTR) is undoubtedly a gorgeous game, graphically pushing the envelope offering richly detailed environments, quality character animations & visual effects. Everything you look at is superbly crafted together, from the camera direction, animal animations to the smallest plants or rocks. This really brings the locations to life. Going hand-in-hand with this is the competent narrative that is always well voiced & engaging cut-scenes from the main story arc that seamlessly bend into the gameplay. RoTR's well-polished presentation is an entertaining experience.\n\nYet by the end of my play through, there were some elements of the game I found disappointing; such as, finding the plot a bit predictable after the main reveal or that there was some grindy gameplay mechanics.\n\nOne of the big things I was looking forward to in this sequel was the 'Return to Tomb Raiding' with bigger & better tombs. The nine optional tombs on offer in RoTR had some crafty puzzles, but regrettably they are relatively short & quick to complete. They primarily centre on an entrance/discovery section followed by a main room with a short series of puzzle steps to get to your prize. Not as elaborate or engaging as I was hoping for.\n\nThe same can be said for the open world exploration sections where I found most easy to figure out how to navigate around or find hidden locations. There were a few tricky bits that took me some time to find, but overall not too difficult to progress. Everything you need is always put right where you need it, and shown on the map so you rarely need to actually hunt around for much. There are some open sections such as Soviet Installation or Geothermal Valley where you have some freedom to do missions or challenges, and go Easter Egg hunting, ahem, farming to upgrade your kit, but much of the game levels are more linear or scripted in nature.\n\nI did get the feeling there was less combat in this verses the first reboot, which I prefer, but would have liked to see more mission/tomb/challenge content instead of the massive amount of collectibles (murals, strongbox, documents, coin cache etc.) you need to track down if you want to 100% complete the game. Hunting & gathering is also required for some crafting, so you get lots to do, but does become a bit mundane after a while. Much of this is optional content so can be avoided though if you just want to progress the story.\n\nAs with the previous instalment the controls are forgiving and controlling Lara's wide range of abilities is intuitive. It’s situational based so it’s easy to traverse a cliff face or square off in a gun fight. The further you progress the game will add more moves, weapons & abilities. Some are useful like larger storage space, but others like show all traps do make an easy game even easier.\n\nThe AI ‘Henchmen’ are not the brightest bunch still (not sure if they improve on hardest difficulty or just are tougher to take down). Seem to be prone to line of sight issues allowing Lara to get away with a lot before being discovered, and in combat tend to follow the same attack patterns, making most fights feel fairly generic. Although there is stealth Lara can deploy in most locations to varying degrees, I would have liked to see better utilisation. There are also places that it seems you cannot avoid a fight using stealth.\n\nMultiplayer has been dropped in this sequel, but a new replayable system has been introduced called Expeditions. These have various challenges like Score Attack & Chapter Replay. Each challenge can be modified with up to five Expedition Cards. Cards are unlocked by playing the campaign, coins can be converted into card packs & also cards are unlocked in Expedition mode itself. Cards can offer all manner of buffs/debuffs to change up your gameplay, from Big Head mode, to weapons/gear, to other game mechanic modifiers. Certainly more appealing than multiplayer was to me, but I am not sure how many times I would find replaying the same levels fun. Regardless, for those wanting further replayability it a nice addition.\n\nRoTR ticks a lot of the right boxes that kept me wanting to play it through to the end, it’s an enjoyable ride for the most but over time the lack of challenge & overall casual nature of the game mechanics and level design left me feeling it was a bit lacklustre. Story was a tad predictable, linear, puzzle tombs were a bit of a letdown & collectibles system is a little excessive. Still .. I find myself recommending RoTR. I had a lot of fun in my play through, entertaining, despite some dislikes in the gameplay department it is one slick action-adventure game.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","February 4","true","39.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","3"

The system is now completely broken and everyone should pound at steam to fix it up.\n\nVideo review\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plpwSPVKQKk\n\nPros\n+ Mostly improved version of the same formula but better, bigger and more exciting.\n\n+ Great storyline and flow of story.\n\n+ Great sound effects from environments adding immersion, voice acting and music also well done.\n\n+ Graphics and attention to detail, from Lara's wound, blood and sweat to even the snow sticking to her hair, deer leaving blood trails when shot etc The little details are surprising and those small animations you can catch her doing such as swimming out on water and wringing her hair out.\n\n+ Environments from desert, to snow and more snow and dangerous caves and ancient tombs galore\n+ Everything crumbling around Lara (Reminds me of Uncharted) but not above that level but still good.\n+ Good amount of open areas with hidden tombs and caves to explore and items to find.\n\n\n+ Emphasis on the crafting system in this game to upgrade items, weapons and skills.\n\n+ Bonus tombs for upgrading skills which is worth if for more efficient killing\n\nCons\n- Difficulty scaling, even on the hardest difficulty it was still a bit easy but you can only heal via herbs\nand harvested materials.\n\n- Fxaa film grain setting is very ugly, only performance problem is when I set SSAA x 4 on which of course impact performance but SSAA x2 works fine for me\n\n- Optimization problems for folks\n\n- Specs can be quite heft for those who ran tomb raider before and expect the same, it isn't and the requirements are much higher.\n\n- Spamming survivor vision can be quite tedious because it can only be used while standing still to know what can be interacted with.\n\n- Some guns could use better sound effects and handling it felt a bit weak at first but improves later on as you upgrade them but you'll find other guns which makes the other one feels a bit obselete even upgraded fully so you never go back.\n\n- Lara changing her looks again  (Got use to it this is a preference but still, I perfer 2013 Lara)\n\n- Expedition is the only replayability in the game, running through the maps you've done already to see who scored the highest points no other multiplayer options, replayability is low.","February 1","true","11.7"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","28","46","0","10"

We have great time together playing this game.\nThe game looks great, feels great and the gameplay is somehow rewarding even if a Swan Dive has no tutorial and nobody on internet knows how to perform one. I totaly recommend buying it and playing it.\n\nI do have some critics to make about this one though:\n1. Being unable to loot weapons from enemies. You have a chance to get 2 pistols so you can fight a bear, but instead you go into the fight with a bow, armed with some arrows poisoned with mushrooms that you do not know if will have any effect. She clearly knows how to handle a pistol, previously she had one with infinite ammo in Syria. But let's all jump with joy when we find part 1/4 of a pistol in an ancient tomb.\n2. In game micro transactions: You can flip some cards that can give you some changes when you try to replay the levels . A Challenge, a perk, an outfit. Normaly you can buy the pack of cards using the credits you get in game, or you can pay 2euro to buy a pack. Very unnecessary feature. (to be ignored)\n3. Day 1 DLCs and season pass: 3 outfits (3 euro each), 1 extra mission with a Baba Yaga that costs 10 euro and will take 1h or so to finish. (to be ignored)  But look, they have a 10% discount, so clearly they are not greedy.\n4. No game+ mode, once you have finished the main story, you can return to the areas to find rest of collectable items and eventualy unlock some outfits, but there is no point in having that because when you start a new game everything resets. (You can use your character progress in the Expeditions.)\n5. Steam Community manager with 91 games on her list and zero played time. That explains why this game was launched in the same day as Fallout 4 before the PC Launch. Some people are just not into gaming.\n\nI will not go in depth with the story and the clichees and the absurdities, this is still fictional character with fictional story and i did have a laugh at some of the finds.\n\nDespite all the aspects mentioned, i still recommend this game. I feel that those that are working in the development team did a brilliant job and deserve 11/10 for their work. I recommend they take some time off to play Witcher 3 and get inspired for next Tomb Raider. And maybe some Dying Light. You get the point :)","February 1","true","32.9"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","21","33","0","1"

With a simple 2 minute SLI profile update, a set of two GTX 980 Ti cards in SLI can run this game at 4k resolution with absolutely everything maxed out (beyond "very high" in game), and it never dips below 60 fps.\n\nGo here and follow the simple instructions if you're using an SLI setup:\nhttp://www.dsogaming.com/news/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-sli-fix-found-offering-95-sli-scaling-on-two-nvidia-gpus/\n\n____\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nWhile this is basically an updated rehash of Tomb Raider 2013, that is not at all a bad thing. If you liked the previous installment, you'll like this one for the same reasons. In other words, RofTR offers great game play, great visuals, a suitable story, and an overall great experience that's quite different from most of the other open-world games on Steam.\n\nOne thing to be aware of is that it requires a beast PC to run maxed out at high res. With a heavily overclocked 2x 980ti SLI and 5 GHz 6-core Haswell-E i7 5930k setup, I can't quite run max settings at 4k resolution. I either have to turn down the quality or go down to 1440p to maintain a stable 60+ fps. A single GTX 980ti can't even max out 1440p and always stay above 60 fps!

It feels like a playable movie at times (in a good way), but the cinematic aspect does not overshadow gameplay. It's pretty much a perfect balance.\n\n- Superb graphics. And I'm not just talking textures, particles, lighting, and shadows. The facial expressions Lara and others give while talking are hands down amazing. The way Lara's hair blows in the wind, or just jiggles ever so slightly as she talks blows me away. It's almost to the point where I can forget that these characters are nothing more than CGI. Futhermore, the way snow gives way at your feet and your legs leave dents, it's remarkable!\n\n- Fast paced gameplay with respect to exploration, combat, and puzzles. It's really wonderfully paced all around.\n\n- The amount of content is spot on. There is plenty to do: side quests, resource gathering, crafting, hidden tomb exploration, etc. Also, to expand a bit on tomb exploration, unlike Tomb Raider 2013, there are A) more tombs, and B) the rewards are MUCH more lucrative; so much so that it is worth finding and exploring every tomb you can.","January 28","true","30.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Why did Crystal Dynamics turn Lara into a total pshycopath? She is a killing machine more than an adventurer now and I think it is entirely the wrong direction for the character and games.\n\nTomb Raider Anniversary will remain my favourite because it was a remake of the first and both were mainly about solving puszzles in tombs - a lone character exploring the mysterious unknown, not some Hollywood style action fest.\n\nStill, like the Tomb Raider reboot, this is a fun game to play.  The mechanics are great.\n\nThe graphics this time around are impressive but not enough of an improvement over the last game to justify such steep system requirements. And the last game had amazing stereoscopic 3d, which this one lacks.\n\nSome of the supernatural elements of the story feel like a copy paste of the last game, which is a bit dissapointing.\n\nI debated whether to vote yes or no on this game and decided on no because of it's price. The campaign just doesn't feel long enough and the ending is stilted and rushed. At half this price, it would be a definate yes - at the current price I suggest that interested players that haven't jumped in yet hold off.","February 9","false","35.4"," 120 of 222 people (54%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","54","120","222","14","20"

It certainly doesn't disappoint. Rise of the Tomb Raider improves in most, if not all, of the areas that players wanted improvement from Tomb Raider (2013) including more actual tombs! I'll get to that in a bit.\n\nPROS\n\n- Beautiful environments. Graphics were really good generally.\n\n- Voice acting was good, It definitely helps the game.\n\n- The story, overall, is immersive and enjoyable.\n\n- Side quests are a welcome addition that add a bit more length to the game and include some interesting rewards\n\n- Tombs are definitely improved on the 2013 version, there are more of them and they're suitably challenging.\n\n- Character progession offers choice to players. 3 different skill trees with a wide variety of skills that will help personalise your playing experience and augment your play style.\n\n- Plenty of collectibles for people like myself who like that kind of thing. It provides a great reason to explore more of the world as well, which is well worth doing. It's not open world, but it's still fairly expansive in some areas.\n\n- Level design, especially toward the latter stages, is very impressive.\n\nNEUTRAL\n\n- I personally found key bindings on keyboard to be a little awkward, you'll probably want to rebind them.\n\n- The story, although really enjoyable overall, gets a bit cliche toward the end and I found myself beginning to pick holes in it, which ruined the immersion somewhat.\n\nCONS\n\n- Enemy AI just isn't that bright at times.\n\n- Controls when playing with a mouse and keyboard seem a little clumsy. Sometimes you'll randomly miss zip wires and jumps for no reason. I feel like this is a product of the game being exclusive to Xbox initially.\n\n- Definitely some bugs around. I found one type of craftable explosive to be paticularly buggy. As one example, n the final boss battle, it exploded next to the boss, who then just disappeared through the floor meaning I had to reload.\n\n\n","February 1","true","23.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

So if you liked the predecessor then you will like this game too.\n\nNow the downsides:\n\n- The "AI" is not just stupid... this is advanced stupidity, Enemies are only a threat when in great numbers, but not even then....\n- The difficulty is a joke, the game is far too easy. Even on the higher diffulty settings\n- The puzzles in the tombs and other parts are also too easy... how stupid do the designers think we are Oo (It is worth mentioning that the puzzles are more elaborate than in the predecessor)\n- The focus is too heavy on shooting than on exploring (of course this strongly depends on your preferences)\n- The jumping and climbing passages are not well done, it is always plain obvious what you have to do\n\nI didnt finished the game yet, the game says I have completed more then the half content. Since this is also counting collection optional stuff i assume I am at the last third of the story. Thus, I think the price is too high, because most of the play time goes into completing collections and gather crafting materials.\nIf you are unsure maybe wait for a sale.

Definately a treat to look at if you have a higher end setup.\n\nQuite a few new mechanics are introduced giving multiple new ways to engage enemies as well as adding replay value.\n\nTombs and puzzles are definately more challenging than the 2013 reboot and require a bit more thought, but they are not nearly as difficult as some of the earlier games.\n\nStory is great. There is always that feeling that you want to see what happens around the next corner.\n\nNew characters definately add to the Tomb Raider universe while giving great possibilities for a sequel\n\nCons:\n\nOverpriced DLC. The DLC for this game is really over priced. Pick the extra content up on a sale if you really want to try it out.\n\nAI can act in strange ways sometimes.\n\nAnti aliasing isn't that great.\n\n\n\nOverall a great game, definately pick it up if you are a fan of the franchise.

In this game you can see that our beloved protagonist Lara Croft has evolved from a fragile survivor into a seasoned raider (which is coincidentally the difficulty in which I completed my playthrough).\n\n\nWhat I loved most :D\n\nWhat I truly love about this game is how lifelike Lara is. Lip movement and facial expressions are spot on. Couple those with the great voice acting of Camilla Luddington and you got yourself a very believable character. This allows the player to really feel Lara's emotions as she is forced to face all kinds of difficult situations and attempt to overcome them.\nThose seamless cutscenes that blend nicely with the storytelling. No wonder the description on Steam includes the phrase "cinematic survival action adventure".\nI also loved how the environment affects Lara and vice versa. Snow accumulates on her jacket and hair. Her breath is visible in the cold and she shivers. She gets blood and wounds on her skin after a nasty fight with a beast or human foes. Lara makes footprints in the snow. Her clothes gets dirty over time but you can always change to clean ones at camps.\n\n\nWhat I liked :)\n\nAdditions to types of upgrades from the previous game for weapons and skills. It's quite satisfying to acquire a skill and using it like performing a jumping kill from above.\nMore tombs! It's Tomb Raider after all, right? While the puzzles are not too challenging, it is fun to discover tombs and complete the raid which will unlock a new skill.\nMany outfits to unlock. And they actually look well-designed and practical (who wears a tanktop and shorts for climbing in the icy cold?) or just cool like those ancient outfits.\nCombat can be intense especially with a bear, a pack of wolves or multiple armed human enemies.\nLara looks really, really good! Your screenshot button will be abused!\n\n\nWhat I didn't really like :/\n\nLooting in order to upgrade your weapons and equipment feels tedious towards the end of the game.\nSide missions/challenges which I felt more compelled to do rather than willingly. If I want to do a side mission, I need good reason like perhaps a small backstory of the person I'm supposed to help which will convince me to lend a hand.\nMost NPCs are not very memorable.\nAction is at times too dramatic. I cannot count the number of close calls like how Lara finds purchase at the last second and preventing a fall to her demise, or how everything collapses right after Lara passes the area. Well, some may argue that's what makes the game exciting. Oh well :P\nHow come in every Tomb Raider game there are ramps or bars conveniently set up in some ancient tomb that is supposed to be undiscovered for like a thousand years? Just for once I wish they make it in such a way that there is no obvious way to progress and players must really study the area for a climbing path or to use tools or objects to create a path.\n\n\nSo... to summarize:\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nWhat you would expect from a Tomb Raider game. Lots of climbing, exploration, fighting and surviving.\n\nStory: 7/10\nGood story.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nImpressive graphics. Excellent detail on characters.\n\nSound Effects & Music: 8/10\nOverall good especially during suspense scenarios but I wish they make it feel more uncomfortable in tombs. Adding creepy music and sound effects for tombs could have made it awesome.\n\nVoice Acting: 9/10\nI feel voice acting is a lot better compared to the previous game\n\nOverall Score: And... I guess that makes it 8.2/10! But hey, I've been a TR fan for quite some time. Never missed a TR game since Legend so I have higher expectations. Others may very well give this game a 9 or 10!\n\n\nRecommendation:\nI strongly recommend Rise of the Tomb Raider to anyone who likes action adventure games with a good story, gameplay and graphics.","February 23","true","22.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

So as a  TR game I really enjoyed this game a lot! It has the feel and the exploration and platforming of a TR game that I love.\nThe graphics are spectacular with great effects and immersive beautiful environments everywhere! Its really very very well done visually.\n\nWhat I didn't like though is the difficulty of the game. I played it on the hardest difficulty and it was far to easy! Compared to the last game the combat was just a cakewalk. In fact it was so easy to headsshot every enemy that I  NEVER even saw the close combat dodge/quick kill mechanic till the VERY END OF THE GAME when the final boss fight forced you into it as part of the battle. Because of this I had no idea wtf to do LOL like seriously I had no idea wtf was going on since I never saw that screen the ENTIRE game due to the enemies being so easy to headshot with the bow. Even when the enemies get armor and helmets its still a cakewalk.\nI remember when they introduced the harder enemies/mercenaries. They play a small clip where they walk out and look all badass.....2 poison arrows later they are dead.... I seriously thought I was being trolled it was so easy.\nYou will not run out of ammo unless you try to waste it and run out.\nNow Im not saying combat isn't fun, cause it is fun...but It just isn't satisfying when you see a room setup for you to use all these perches and such to take out enemies but there is no point in doing all that when you can end a fight in 5 seconds against 10-20 enemies so easily.\n\nThe previous games combat was MUCH more satisfying and felt like you earned every victory in battle. People complained so much about the combat that the devs dumbed it down tremendously in this new game. To me I would rather just play a game without the combat if its going to be this easy...just Saying.\nEither make a TR game with proper combat or just make a TR game without it entirely next time.\n\nOverall the game is WORTH playing 100%. Just be prepared for easy peezy fights if you are the least bit skilled at shooting games at all!\n\nAlso I didn't bother with the endurance or survival modes or whatever they are called. To me that stuff is just hamfisted attempts at making the microtransaction valid.","February 25","true","34.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","7","9","2","2"

I just got the credits, and the steam time counter says 15 hours. In the beginning I did a lot of collecting, but after about the half way point I couldn't really be bothered, so take the length of the game as you will.\n\nMain reason I can't say yes to the recommendation is the writing.\nFrom start to finish I couldn't really care less about the situation Lara was in, who she was fighting and what she was doing.\nThey did a really poor job of introducing the situation and giving you reasonsto be engaged in the story. Which was nearly opposite in the first game. You wanted to find your friends and know what was going on, it was mysterious in a very good way.\nIn this one, you're just told Trinity are the bad guys, they're really bad, and your father knew something so you should know it too.\n\nThe second main part is the feel of the platforming. Lara seems to constantly jump whereever she feels like, quite often to her death. Which really drags the game down since you feel frustrated at the technical aspect of playing the game, and not a challenge in the game itself. (counter point would be the Rocksteady Batman games, which usually feel really fluid and in control)\nAdmittedly I did play with a keyboard and mouse, which could be part of the problem. Not having an analog direction to push to might cause issues for the game to know what to do.\n\nI was such a fan of the first game that this feels like a major step down, which is a shame.\nIf you can get it for half price or some such at a sale, I'd say it'd be worth it just to fool around and shoot bad guys, and to see what little there is of the story.\nOne example is that at the end credits, the writing team was shoved pretty much at the end.\nWhen the User Interface Art  people are before the writers, you have some serious issues to deal with in terms of priority.\n\nWhich brings us finally to "Do I wish for another game?" If they could just give the writing team more time, or whatever they need to make it a good game. Then yes. I definitely would like to see Lara have some proper adventures again.\n\nninjaedit:\nThe actual "tomb raiding" can be fun, though the puzzles are either way too easy or require some incredibly annoying physics bs, which combined with the bad controls makes it frustrating at times.","February 9","false","15.3"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","56","104","4","5"

Others, like me, won't.\n\nSensationally, this game is extremely well done. The visuals are beautiful in a realistic sort of way, animations are mostly smooth and life-like, and the sound/music complements the adventure-outside-of-civilization really well. The exception to all of those rules is the gunplay. Shooting a bow feels great. Shooting a gun feels lightweight and flat, and the gunfire sound effects are nowhere even close to realistic.\n\nNow, for the material shortcomings. The game is dumb. It's stupid, and it wants to believe you are, too. Lara will literally tell you what she needs to do to get through a puzzle. The region's natives speak in that pseudo-Queen's-English that Hollywood swears sounds sophisticated, even though these natives have lived in isolation in the Siberian mountains for thousands of years. Every character over pronounces every word and avoids contractions like leprosy in that way that the worst Sci Fi movies try to make characters sound noble. "We must not fail!" says the military grunt from the US, instead "Don't ♥♥♥♥ this up," or "We can't lose!" or something else more natural-sounding. Good guys are unflinchingly righteous, virtuous and self-sacrificial. Bad guys are unflinchingly selfish, short-sighted and viscious.\n\nAll of that amounts to a story/game that's not fooling anyone. Lara's character is a piece of baloney that couldn't possibly exist in real life. Even if she did, she'd be someone you'd want to tell to crawl out of her own ♥♥♥ as soon as she's able. The same goes for the villains. Puzzles aren't puzzles in Rise--they're scripted adventure setpieces. Platforming is the same. Follow the onscreen prompt and look for the inexplicably white edges or the bafflingly placed ziplines (in the middle of a Siberian mountain range!) and press either "A" or "X" to use the appropriate contextual animation trigger.\n\nI'd recommend this game if you were someone looking for setpieces, explosions and visual beauty. If you're looking for something intellectually worthwhile, or a story that even resembles something novel, then don't bother.","February 14","false","16.7"," 56 of 104 people (54%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","54","56","104","7","3"

On one hand, it's extremely beautiful and the combat and climb-mechanics are very well done. On the other hand, it's plagued by performance issues and a shallow, cliché story.\n\nLet me eleborate on those points. Just like Tomb Raider 2013, the game is visually stunning. The Byzantine ruins, the tombs and the ice looks fantastic. When you discover a new place, you really are in awe and get that mysterious treasure feeling (for want of a better word). Also, the mechanics are intuitive and the controls are context sensitive, i.e. in different situations, the controls have a different result. For example, right click is aim, but also dive. "C" is dodge when attacked, but also letting go of a wall if you are climbing.  You can get very much done with just a few controls.\n\nHowever, what displeased me is that the story is essentially the same as the previous part: Lara searches for an artefact; the bad guys search for it as well. But Lara and the baddies discover first hand that the artefact is guarded by undead warriors from centuries ago. Mayhem ensues. Then when everything explodes, you have to fight the boss of the bad guys and kill him, end of story. The dialogues are also very cliché. "I can't leave you here Lara! No, I must go on, alone!" The emotional engegement is low; I really don't care if some of the cardboard characters die. I don't get the feels, as they say :p. A game like this must be very expensive. Too bad there wasn't any money left for a good story. It could have been so good, and a good story hasn't to be expensive at all.\n\nThen the performance issues. Granted, I don't play this on the latest and greatest, but I feel I should play modern games reasonably well. I play with an 3870K APU at 3,3 Ghz and a Radeon 7870 Black Edition. Even on lowest quality I  experience stuttering. Still, I heard AMD would patch the driver for this game. The previous game was smooth as butter however.\n\nAll in all a nice experience, really really beautiful game. Too bad of the story and performance. Would I pay 44 euro for it again? No. I would just wait until the summer sale and grab a cheap copy.","February 4","false","20.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

It was OK, not something which could throw you of your chair with an OMG effect. Wasn't also sure to place it in the negative side. But the story in the 2013 game was slightly better and could stuck better in your mind.\n\n● Game performance 🚀The game runs really bad on an I7 and a GTX 680 - (I'm aware that the GTX 680 is already out of date, but the grafical beauty isn't as much better as the 2013 game.)\nHeard that it has also problems with a GTX 970 which is recommended for the game.\n\n● Weather ☁Lara is going through rough temperatures below -40°C most of the time.\nSnow, some rain here and there and that's all.\nMissed the +35°C from the syria mission for the whole part of the game.\n\n● Price € £ ¢It came out with a fixed price of 50€. It's a lot, even tho the game came out 2 months earlier on the Xbox one. Spoilers could be found anywhere on the internet before the release on PC.\nAfter the release the gameprice dropped on 45€, which was not a really good move by the devs.\n\nPositive side:\n● Environment 🌅The bigger open world!\nThere is way much more to do and to explore.\n\n● Bigger and more complicated tombs\n\n● Lara's look (Ofcourse dependent by your preference.)\nThe 2013 version of Lara was too young looking. Now we have an older looking Lara. 😍\n\n● More clothes (Mostly clothes for cold/rough temperatures) - Tank Top is unlocked by the end of the story.\n\n● Slightly better graphics\n\n● The purehair (better known as Tressfx 1.0 on PC) is now better optimized.\nHaven't seen big performance drops, even with set on very high.\n\n● More weapons, modifications, skills etc .. 🔫\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a really good game, especially if you're a Tomb Raider / Lara Croft Fan.\nI liked the design of the open world and the story of the 2013 game more.

Even though the story is linear, the maps are quite nice and you can go back any time, explore some more and find new stuff. Enemies respawn randomly as you revisit maps, so no place is ever empty.\n\n✓ Visually stunning\nI know we're only in february, but so far this is the prettiest game I've played in 2016. It's as gorgeous as it is demanding. The "recommended specs" aren't wrong at all! Keep that in mind before buying or you might end up like the poor fellows in the negative reviews.\n\n✓ Way better than the last one\nBetter maps, more replayability, new mechanics, more tombs, better gunplay, more weapon/enemy/environment variety, and unlockable outfits! And of course, action-packed from start to finish.\n\n\n✗ It holds your hand a little too much\nYou can disable items from glowing when you use your survival instinct, but you can't disable the annoying on-screen tutorials. There is no way to silence Lara from telling you hints to solve puzzles either. It'd be really cool if all of this filthy casual-friendly stuff was automatically disabled on higher difficulty modes.\n\n✗ Pre-order cancer\nSquare Enix, being the money-hungry c***s they are, pushed their s***ty business practices into RotTR, infecting an otherwise perfect game. These practices include: Day 1 DLC, pre-order bonuses that can't be obtained anywhere else, microtransactions, and the worst part: Crystal Dynamics being forced to cut off the Baba Yaga campaign from the main game to sell it separately in the incredibly unnecessary season pass. 28€ for a 3 hour campaign, a difficulty mode an 3 skins? What are you smoking, Square Enix? CD Projekt Red charges LESS than that for 30 hours of gameplay. THIRTY.\n\nVerdictA must-have if you like: adventure, scavenging, third person shooters and puzzles. It took me 45hrs to achieve 100% completion.\n\nThere's a number of unobtainable skins (pre-order bonuses) that will probably be available later in a bundled/GOTY edition, so unless you're really on the fence to play RotTR, I recommend you to wait for it.","February 3","true","54.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","1"

Its every flaw of the first game magnified by 10 in a severe case of sequilitis minus any character growth for Lara or any sort of decent plot ( The story is basically Tomb Raiders of the Lost Ark. ).\n\nAs opposed to continuing the first game's arc of Lara going from naive college student to seasoned veteran; You start the game as a remorseless superhuman killing machine and end the game as a remorseless superhuman killing machine that can climb a bit faster. Unless its a cutscence or scripted sequence, then Lara becomes a clumsy, bumbling idiot. Things will explode around you to give a false sense of urgency but there's no actual threat from them. Half of all the surfaces you touch will dramatically crack, crumble or give way. ♥♥♥♥ so overused and predicatable there is no suspense or excitement involved whatsoever.\n\nOn top of that the game will yell at you constantly about things being nearby ( OPTIONAL things it stresses ) and about items you don't have yet ( there's no surprises, it will yell at you exactly what item you need that you don't have yet. ). Every surface you can scamper up inexplicably has white paint on it even if its a centuries old tomb. Everything you can find is eventually marked on your map. So there's no real point in exploration and no sense of discovery. Just walking to map markers and pressing x.\n\nInvesting in skills actually makes the game worse as the majority are convenience options or things that add even more indicators the game can yell at you with. Or make the gunplay and press Y to instantly win easier.\n\nYour gameplay boils down to thus:\n\nPress X to not die.\nPress Y to win every fight.\nCollect a cynical amount of pointless things with no purpose but to pad out the game.\nRun through a sequence where everything around you falls apart like its made of paper mache.\nPress x to not die.\nKill critically endangered wildlife because Lara needs a new purse.\nCollect a huge variety of pointless weapons you will never use.\nPress x to not die.\nPress RB to turn any random piece of garbage into an IED.\nRun some more as everything comically crumbles around you.\nFall and slide into water several times.\nDrown a couple of times.\nSuffer at least two concussions.\nPress x to not die.\nGet waylaid, incapacitated, caught off guard or otherwise taken down because the plot says so.\nRun some more.\nPress Y to kill the end boss.\nUninstall game.\n\nAnd yes, you kill the end boss with a quick time event. Don't expect any sort of epic battle. Just press Y and win the game. Its a dissappointingly low note to end the game on. There's basically no real finale. You just go through another extended run/climb panic sequence then press Y to win the game. Woo. Every plot twist is telegraphed a mile away and half the plot is lifted from Raiders of the Lost Ark, so don't bet on a gripping story to carry you through the game.\n\nAlso, Lara did not bring a knife or a compass and at one point she willingly drinks 50 year old insecticide. Lara is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n","February 23","false","31.4"," 66 of 124 people (53%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","53","66","124","21","8"

Short version:\n\nThe game should have focused more around the design of the optional tombs. Instead, most of the game is running, grabbing onto ledges, and climbing....over and over again without too much increase in challenge. Puzzle elements are few, but at least some of them are well done. The materials and crafting mechanic that was expanded for this game is underwhelming aside from the creation of throwable weapons while in combat. Stealth combat is fun but gets mostly thrown out the door near the end of the game. So. Much. Just. Running. Around.\n\nI'd reccomend this game if you catch it on sale in the future.

Because from these two options... sorry, but "No".\n\nFirst (2013) TR was more emotional. You really worry about Lara - always badly injured, always in danger, always breathing, screaming, crying. More lively.\nNew RoTR is... a shooter. "Lara. please, let's dive into war against bad people!" "OK! Why not?!" And after that you start playing Hitman or Splinter Cell. 5 enemies? 10 enemies? Why not? Take shotgun and kill them all! But it isn't "Lara Croft and Many Puzzles and Sometimes Stealth Killing" or something like that. It is third person shooter. In the TR I use only a bow because it was only opportunity to break through the game. Right now bow in general only for open doors, knot ropes and jumping.\nI think this is story writers fault and this is, for me, big huge mistake. Very detailed graphics, good level design, updated animations... and shooter.\nWaiting for the next part with more emotional, inexperienced in killing, deep breathing, solving puzzles, hurting, screaming, crying bad Lara.","February 6","false","22.4"," 27 of 49 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","27","49","3","3"

Crafting is much more enhanced and there are now many resources available to collect and farm, really enhances the survial aspect of the game. The tombs are also MUCH MUCH better than the reboot, more complex,  challenging and worth exploring. The game actually deserves to be called Tomb Raider now.\n- Graphics...OMG\n- replayability. The reboot suffered from a lack of replayability IMO. Instead of giving us a mediocre multiplayer, CD made the right call by giving us several new SP modes that greatly enhanced replayability. I really love the "card" features of the game that allow you to replay the game or just a chapter with modifiers, for example you can replay a chapter with maxed out gears and try it on the highest difficulty. There are also player created missions with different objectives.\n- Finally there is the Endurance mode (which, unfortunately, is sold separately for 10$). If you like a survival type of game mode that desperately tries to get you killed you will love this (Frostfall in Skyrim anyone?). The game basically gives you a small openworld to roam around, but different from the main game, Lara has a warmth and hunger meter that will decrease with time. You need to hunt and create/find fire to keep yourself alive, while trying to find relics in ruins and crypts and fight off/elude enemies. The slogan of "woman vs the wild" truly comes to life and shines in this mode.\n\ncons\n- the game is VERY VERY demanding. If you enjoy playing games on high/max settings with smooth performance, but doesn't have a high end PC, FORGET ABOUT PLAYING THE GAME, at least for now.  You would be better off playing this on XBONE. The game seems to be very unoptimized for PC, or just unusually demanding. So many people with 980 and even 980Ti are complaning of FPS dips. The game consumes a whooping 6.1 GB of VRAM in 1080P at max settings!\nI'm NOT saying that you shouldn't buy the game if you don't have the high-end gears. The game will be playable on even lower-end PC, but just note that you WILL suffer performance issues. You've been warned!\n- Apparently a lot of people are experiencing stability and crashing issue. So beware of that...\n- microtransactions for the expedition cards. It's pretty slow to earn in-game credits that are used to buy the cards that modify the game. The game is still perfectly playable without the cards. But it's clear that the devs intentionally made earning $ a lot harder so people will feel enticed by the microtransactions.","January 30","true","58.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This time round Lara Croft is driven by obsession, not survival, and for the first time we see her in shades of grey. Unlike 2013’s Tomb Raider, Instead Lara has learnt how to handle pain, command an arsenal of weapons and kill droves of enemies. She’s now a formidable fighter who inflicts more than she takes - but I did see the cracks in her moral compass.\n\n\nStory  NO SPOILER, only the story key.\nIn 2013's Tomb Raider reboot, developer Crystal Dynamics puts Lara into danger against her will, straying her on a strange island with even stranger secrets. But she's since gained agency. In Rise of the Tomb Raider, she's running headlong into the fray at her own pace, seeking the key to eternal life.\n\n\nGameplay  This isn't a sandbox, though--subsequent areas are gated by ability unlocks. Now more than ever, you have territory worth exploring. By going back to older environments, you can venture off the beaten path in search of useful abilities. Several of Rise of the Tomb Raider's areas are open hub zones, hidden environmental challenge, replete with resources, NPC side missions, and secret passageways.\n\nBacktracking to old areas is rewarding, too. Especially if you are a perfectionist—gamer who likes to finish game in 100% progress. It is rewarding because in Rise of Tomb Raider, every single collection/findings (mural, document, relics, etc) will boost your XP to upgrade your skills and coin caches to buy equipment and outfit. I knew exactly where that cave was I couldn't enter without the rope arrows. Unlike scavenging, scavenging does not reward you XP but worth to modify your weapon and craft your arrows and bullets.\n\nThe way the combat combines evolving weaponry and a choice of gameplay styles – you always have the option to go in loud or stealth and cover tactics – means that sequences are always tense. If you’ve forgotten to pick up some more wood, you’ll run out of arrows mid-fight and curse your laziness.\n\nAnd as the traversal becomes more varied and complex with your increased abilities, the world becomes your playground and more like the Tomb Raider games I’ve always cherished.\n\nIn the interest of building Lara to fit your unique playstyle, Rise of the Tomb Raider incorporates three skill trees: hunting, brawling, and survival. Each contributes to their respective fields in disparate ways, by making certain aspects of the game less challenging or more rewarding. One allows Lara to shoot two arrows at a time, for instance. Another grants her more ammo when looting enemy corpses. The wide array of skills works well because each feels worthwhile. Pursuing them adds another layer in an already nuanced system.\n\nThe most fun parts are finishing the Secret Tomb. It boosts your XP a lot and rewards you with one Lara’s skill. Unfortunately, most of the Tomb puzzle is easy to solve but hard to find the entrance door. It feels like, finding the hidden Secret Tomb is harder rather than solving the puzzle.\n\nFinishing the challenges, rewards you points to buy cards as well as to achieve 100% progress. Challenges in Rise of Tomb Raider are just like side activity to do to boost up fun. Burn the propaganda poster, cut the flags, find dark areas, etc.\n\nFor me the gameplay in Rise of Tomb Raider is very fun because it always keep you busy. You have so many things to do and touch up. If you enjoy the game and want to finish it in 100% progress, you will feel the same way as me. Anywhere you go, you find things to collect, finding new hidden map to reveal the hidden area or collection stuffs, finding new documents to follow the story plot, scavenging, fight with enemies or animals, find a new hidden areas, learning new languages continue main missions and do side missions and many more. You will even come back to previous place just to collect and finish up things you miss out.\n\n\nWhat is new    The New Crafting System   – Makes Lara’s scavenging and hunting in flora and fauna more intuitive. It enables Lara to craft or to upgrade her weapons which will help her a lot along her journey.\n\nCombat has also been revamped  - There’s now a much greater element of stealth so now, as well as engaging in close quarters combat, Lara can creep up and kill the bad guys using her new hunting knife, or even avoid combat altogether by diving into water or climbing up into trees and across rooftops. She can even create explosives with which to create chaos.\n\nNo longer will plants and animal carcasses  - Instead you’ll be gathering feathers from birds’ nests, poison from specific mushrooms, hide from a deer partially digested by a pack of wolves, and of course wood from saplings. These are just examples, but you’ll need them all if you want to be well-stocked for each mission.\n\nThere’s no multiplayer option this time around, instead you’ve got Expeditions  - Accessible via the main title menu, Expeditions let you replay missions within the campaign without affecting your main save game. They also let you tackle each mission in a variety of ways. This new single-player option allows you to replay chapters, jump into hub areas with new objectives or just go for a classic score chase. Each of these challenges can be modified in interesting ways.\nAs you progress through the story, you'll earn points that can be spent to purchase card packs. Cards can have gear or upgrades for Lara, or they can have other modifiers — tweaks that make enemies harder to take down or turn Lara into an unstoppable killing machine. Each modifier can have a major impact on how any one run through expedition mode plays out.\nNote:  Packs of cards can also be purchased with real money. However, just playing expedition mode earns more points with which you can purchase more packs, so it doesn't seem like people will be forced to spend real money at any point.\n\nGraphic  As for the graphics, the majority of the game takes place in Siberia, where the weather veers from fierce snowstorms and avalanches to bright, clear days. And regardless of the weather conditions, the world of Rise of the Tomb Raider is never less than stunning. The environments are often breathtaking, with some of the best snow and running water effects I’ve ever seen. Honestly, it is one of the best graphic video game. The detail of the character design is remarkable. Lara Croft's hair dancing smoothly, her facial expression is so believeable and cute, her skin feels alive, and her movement gives an impact.\n\n\nConclusion  Once again it’s Lara herself, however, who steals the show, her complex ambitions and hardened resolve showing new sides to a character who has well and truly grown from survivor to the most fascinating action hero in video games today.\n\nIf you love adventure, full of danger story, stealth, guerilla combat, acrobatic move, crafting weapon, upgrading weapon, bow, scavenging, collecting mysterious items, discovery, deadly land, wildlife, unique mechanism, exotic theme, challenging tomb puzzle, breathtaking view, woman, detail of Lara Croft that can make you c.u.m within 5 seconds. Buy this game! All those elements combined have just created an unforgettable game ever.","February 5","true","22.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atilex/recommended/391220/","atilex","Atilex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atilex/","718 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is an improvement over the previous game on almost every aspect and should not be missed by fans of the series.\nThe story takes place one year after your adventures in Yamatai (previous Tomb Raider). This time, the opening level is in Siria with the rest of the action taking place in Siberia. Although most of the levels are set on a winter background, there is a lot of variation throughout the game, so it is not all cold and snow. I found the story to be more engaging with great cut-scenes and voice-acting to complement it. Characters are also well-written with back-stories and details that can be discovered by reading the documents found in the game.\n\nGraphics are a strong point for this game and it shoes that Crystal Dynamics collaborated with Nvidia to bring the best visuals and optimisation for PC. The nice graphics also require a lot of horsepower, so no wonder that this title has been bundled with the latest GPU's from Nvidia.\n\nGameplay is very similar to the previous title, but the animation quality is better especially with the stealth movement and sneaky attacks. I disliked how Lara's stealth movement is auto-triggered whenever enemies are close. I would prefer a button to toggle this behaviour and discover the next enemy location on my own.There is more emphasis on exploration and hunting, as you need crafting materials to upgrade your equipment and weapons. Optional tombs are part of the game and unlock some of your best skills after completion. Unfortunately the tomb puzzles are very easy (same as in the previous title).\n\nLevel design is liniar in most zones with the exception of 3 areas that are more open and can be approached in different ways. Range combat still feels better than melee, but this time the levels provide more opportunities for stealth attacks. Expect some level sections that just throw waves of enemies at you and some sections in which you just run and jump for your life. However, I like that quick time events are fewer now and Lara is still in your control most of the time. There are lots of collectibles and challenges to be discovered, but please note that some can only be found after you finish and return to that level.\n\nThere is no multiplayer, but some replaybility is offered with Expeditions. This mode is basically a scenario creator where your enemies, objectives and character modifiers are represented in the form of cards. Load any level with your custom cards and play it or share it with the community. Upon completing an Expedition, you receive coins used to unlock different cards.\n\nOverall: Rise of the Tomb Raider is a nice looking game and I can recommend it to anyone who likes 3rd person action/adventure. Offers good pacing between story, exploration and combat so that you don't get bored or overwhelmed at any time. It takes about 12h to complete if you rush the story or over 30h for No Stone Unturned (100% achievement).","March 4","true","34.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Yes it can run it , quite well too, while playing & not recording I can run it on high settings at 1080pp with a steady 50 to 55 fps. When recording I have lowered the settings (check my Videos below) with a steady 45 fps it still looks great IMO.\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider, the sequel to the 2013 reboot of the TR franchise is it a good game to play?\nAnswer : Yes\nI was expecting Rise to pick up where TR left off - that didn't happen but yet again Lara is thrown into another action packed start to her new story. Lara's appearance has changed a lot from the March 5 2013 launch, not too happy with that but she is very pretty & alot shorter in stature lol\nPros\n1. The main story is good not great but it is enjoyable.\n2. There is so much to do on the map itself - this is where ROTTR really shines.\n3. The optional Tombs are better puzzle wise and fun with a reward at the end, better than just "a gasp of awe" or "a slight gasp" !\n4. Lara can now sprint & swim .\n5. lots of new equipment & weapons to have fun with.\n6.  A new crafting system.\n7. Side quests that give rewards once completed.\nCons\n1. Really no need to play TR 2013 before playing this.\n2. Tomb Puzzles are too easy & are optional again.\n3. AI are so stupid -but do have the ability to spawn beside you and attack lol.\n4. Equipment from TR 2013 only available by collecting coins and buying from an ingame shop.\n5. A new crafting system - the amount of hides needed for a tiny ammo pouch or an outfit is ridiculous - but whatever floats your boat!\n6.

Not as much as other people, but I do have fond memories of playing it when I was much younger. The 2013 reboot, although flawed, made me remember and relive some of those memories, and as a result, I was excited for the release of this game. After playing through this game, I feel like that this game was pretty much the same as the last game, except more refined and far more exciting in my eyes.\n\nGraphics\nOkay, I'm going to keep this as straightforward as possible: this is one of the prettiest games I've played in years. Everything looks absolutely gorgeous, and from the first second to the end, my jaw was on the floor with the visuals. You might think that the graphics are "bland" because you're spending most of your time in Siberia, but trust me, this game is far more pretty than it seems, and besides, you'll be at other places, too.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay, more or less, is the same as the previous game. Shoot bad guys, do the occasional puzzle, climb over to this place, raid that tomb, whatever. You get the point I'm trying to make here. However, in most aspects of the things I listed, Rise of the Tomb Raider polishes these. The combat is entertaining, climbing from point A to point B has had my heart racing a few times (especially at the beginning) and there are more tombs in this game than in the last. However, here's where the problem is: There are a lacking of puzzles to the game, which isn't a good thing for a game like this. When there are puzzles, they're usually very simple and also anticlimatic. Uh oh, the bad guys are after you are very close to your position! You're cornered by another evil that lurks below you, bows in hand, and it's a race against the clock! BLAM. Puzzle. Oh, you're trying to run away from that helicopter? Here, let me give you a puzzle. And as I said before, these puzzles are usually pretty simple, so as a result, you can get back to that epic chase scene or whatever, but in that short period of time, I was just thinking "Oh, no, the bad guys are back. Yipee." after I finished it. What rush of fear I may have had beforehand would be immediately killed when one of these anticlimatic puzzles popped up. Plus there's some bugs that really got in my away, and a few of which crashed my game. But, the non-crashing bugs were actually pretty funny. I did get a good laugh out of one guy that was trying to grapple from one side to the other, and I watched his body stretch and teleport to my position. Not only that, but the game is still really fun to play. Like, really really fun.\n\nStory\nThe story was much better in this one than the last in my opinion. Trinity has a lot of potential to become really awesome in the next game, and I really enjoyed Konstantin, although it felt like he did borrow some cliché villain tropes. I won't spoil the story, but it kept me hooked from start to finish. While the 2013 reboot dragged out towards the end, I felt that this one told their story and didn't overstay its welcome. There were the anticlimatic puzzles, of course, but when the game wasn't at one of those parts, I was on the edge of my seat, cheering Lara on. Also, don't get me started on how AWESOME that opening sequence was. I think I almost had a heart attack a few times during it, and that alone told me I was in for a wild ride. Overall, Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like an action movie with an interesting storyline that sets up for the next game. If you like action movies, you'll probably love this game.\n\nAudio\nFinally, some good voice acting. Camilla Luddington was awesome as Lara Croft (again) and I was also a fan of Charles Halford, who played Konstantin. When he was around, he felt like a terrifying villain, and he nailed his role. The others were also pretty solid, but those two stuck out for me. As for the soundtrack, it was exciting. I critcized the 2013 reboot's soundtrack for not being very fitting, saying it felt more like something you'd see in a horror movie. However, Rise of the Tomb Raider is not like the last, and I loved the soundtrack, especially at times where my heart was pounding and ready to leap out of my chest.\n\nReplayability\nActually, the replayability for this game is much higher compared to the last. There's more content to it, and with some extra expansions to keep things interesting, you'll be playing this for a little while longer. I would guess that the main storyline is about 10-15 hours (depending on how much time you take doing other quests or going through tombs) but you should be able to get about 20-30 hours with the DLC probably. That was more of a guess, as I don't own the DLCs, but you might be able to get some fun out of it.\n\nVerdict\nI think the best way to view Rise of the Tomb Raider is that its a sequel to that one really awesome and polished action movie. It might not do much different, but it's still incredibly entertaining and has improved on many aspects compared to the last. Rise of the Tomb Raider is incredibly pretty to look at, has a very exciting storyline, a fitting soundtrack, and much more. If you enjoyed the 2013 reboot, then you will love this game.\n\nGraphics - 10/10\nGameplay - 8.5/10\nStory - 9.5/10\nAudio - 8.5/10\nReplayability - 7.0/10\n\n.:8.7/10:.\n\n+Gorgeous visuals\n+Incredibly enjoyable gameplay\n+Interesting storyline\n+Great voice acting\n+Awesome soundtrack\n\n-Lack of challenging puzzles\n-Placement of puzzles can kill the atmosphere\n-Some annoying and (very rarely) game breaking bugs","April 10","true","10.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluephire1/recommended/391220/","bluephire1","BluePhire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bluephire1/","46 products in account","FINAL EDIT: (about 5 hours of gameplay):\n\nSince my original review, I have tweaked several different things with the game. I updated my Nvidia drivers and moved the game to my SSD. I think that moving the game to the SSD has fixed the bugs I have been experiencing. Therefore, I AM recommending this game (since it has been a lot of fun after getting past the bugs).\n\nTo elaborate, I originally encountered many bugs in my first 30 minutes of gameplay. This included:\n\n- Cutscenes not triggering\n- Graphical glitches and lag during cutscenes\n- Large areas of the map not loading (allowing me to fall through the world)\n- Music glitch (repeats same note over and over)\n- VERY long loading time for campfires\n\nAfter updating my Nvidia drivers, I still experienced most of these glitches. However, after moving the game to my SSD, I have experienced none of them. My guess is that my HDD loaded textures/cutscenes/parts of the world so slowly, that it was causing many issues with the game.\n\nNow for the actual game:\n\nPros:\n\n- Crafting is a really good addition and makes battles more fun\n- Cutscenes have amazing graphics/animation\n- The storyline is interesting and immersive\n- Fighting mechanics have been improved slightly, but are still very familiar\n- Graphics - the best I have seen in a game, personally\n- Puzzles! (some are pretty hard)\n\nCons:\n\n- Collectables are more of a chore to find than anything else. They are fun if you want to 100% the game, though.\n- Some sections of the the world are too big. I find myself wandering around a lot and ending back in places I have already been. This may be a pro for those who enjoy open spaces.\n\nIgnoring the initial glitches and issues, I would give this game 9/10. Definitely recommend.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEDIT (about 3 hours of gameplay):\n\nI restarted the game and have gotten past that first game-breaking bug in the cave. The problem seemed to have arisen from the order in which I activated objects in the cave. After that part, I had no more game-breaking bugs, but just little glitches here and there.\n\nOne such glitch involved major amounts of lag and graphical glitches during the first cutscene where the Trinity shows up, despite no graphical glitches or FPS drops during any of the gameplay.\n\nAnother involvs long loading times when activating a campsite. The UI (inventory/weapons/etc) of the campsite does not show up at first and took up to 4 minutes once to load.\n\nBesides the aforementioned two glitches, the game has been much less glitchy after the first twenty minutes. If the game continues to run smoothly after a few more hours of gameplay, I will most likely recommend it (despite the rough beginning).\n\nFor those interested, I have a GTX 980 and am running on Windows 10.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW (about 1 hour of gameplay):\n\nI currently do not recommend this game. Note that I have only played about an hour, but I am running into many bugs tht I did not experience in the 2013 Tomb Raider PC version.\n\nIn just the first hour I played, I have experienced the following bugs:\n\n- Sound looping glitch - This has happened about 4 times in the hour I have played. The sound track is great, but there is a glitch where it repeats the same note over and over again and will not stop until you die/go to the main menu.\n\n- Cutscene would not trigger - In the first major ice climbing scene, I got to the part where there should be a cutscene, and there never was. After about 20-30 minutes of tinkering, I finally managed to trigger it. Nonetheless, this caused a lot of frustration.\n\n- Story progression bug - I am currently stuck in the first cave that Lara visits where she is reading all the Greek writings and murals on the wall. The objective is to go to this wall and inspect it (which I suspect will progress the game to the next part), but I am unable to inspect it, leaving me trapped in this cave with no way out. This bug is currently game-breaking for me.\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Graphics are fantastic. The hair and eyes are especially great.\n- The cutscene animations look and feel very natural. It truly gives it a cinematic experience.\n\nBesides that, I can't say much for the gameplay. I have mostly just pressed forward and inspected items so far in my playthrough. Unfortunately, due to game-breaking bugs, I cannot recommend this game as of yet. I will update if things are fixed.","January 28","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","7"

It's a good game in its own way for people who don't know or aren't as knowledgeable of Lara Croft's journey in the game industry, but imo it's not quite what it could be for diehard fans. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed ROTR more than the reboot; it's just still lacking in certain areas that - based on the improvement thus far - I'm mostly confident they'll, well, fix for a lack of better words.\n\nFor starters, they captured the sense of adventure better than the reboot by providing better incentives to explore the land as well as expanding said area. Aside from collecting resources, collectibles (ugh), and challenges (double ugh), there's the bonus of a group of people you can interact with who give you missions to carry out. This, on top of the newly designed challenge tombs, makes the world feel more alive through the past and the present. It definitely helps that the entire game is more colorful and vivid than the dull colored maps of the reboot.\n\nAs for the action, they added a few more mechanics to spice up the combat a bit. There's an array of weapons to choose from rather than one weapon that's either swapped for a better one or upgraded to look different, and most of the weapons now have specially crafted ammo. In addition to this, they've added on the move crafting to allow different approaches to combat encounters; you can now craft throwables to either damage or distract, both of which can also be upgraded to do more damage or add damage respectively. There are more skills as well, but quite a few of them were hit or miss for me. All this combined with an enhanced survival instinct that allows you to see when an enemy is in view of another gives way for better stealth tactics if that tickles your fancy. I mostly played the game in this manner on the seasoned raider difficulty, so I don't know if that affects my opinion differently, but I'm almost tempted to say that the game seems to push for stealth more than guns blazing - which brings me to my next point.\n\nThe game unfortunately still went with the endless amount of men trying to kill one female, and I'll never understand why. This isn't a SJW or feminist point, this is from the standpoint of a longtime fan who wishes to see more adventure and puzzle solving than an illogical one woman army. It literally kills me inside when even the game acknowledges this with its "oh so witty" comments from said men who can't believe they're getting their asses kicked by Lara Croft. Yes, Lara Croft is a badass but she's a badass because of her intellect more than her ability to kill someone or something. In all the TR games she has killed to survive, but this just feels so forced.\n\nThat being said, the puzzles could use more difficulty still. I remember reading an article about how the devs were going to bring back nested puzzles, which they did for the most part, but then they turned around and said they didn't want to make them but so difficult that it would turn players away. I could understand that mentality back when Tomb Raider was first established because players still relied on physical guides or perseverance to get by, but in today's world where in less than a minute you can google the solution if you get stuck, I will never buy that as an excuse to not make your players think. I think there was only one puzzle that took me a second to figure out, and that was only because I got confused about one of the objects and how it was used. I also wish the puzzles existed outside of the challenge tombs.\n\nQuick note about said tombs, I can't express enough how much better they are visually. They're just grand and take the appearance of settings from the likes of Tomb Raider I-III with today's graphics. Though they could use some diversity of the physical secret discovered, they did a superb job nevertheless. The rewards gained are actually worth the raid even if the tombs are still optional.\n\nLast but certainly not least - the plot. It was certainly more compelling than the reboot in that the main enemy is more than a title; there's a backstory, there's emotion, there's a reason why that unfolds and intertwines with Lara's story. I can't say anything was truly shocking, but at least it's not Mathias...a potato is better than Mathias as an enemy. If it wasn't for my need to explore everything, the game would probably be short, so I guess that's a bit of a problem. I long for the days of, as another reviewer put it, globetrotting; I'm pretty sure if there were multiple countries with these kinds of maps the game would be much longer and have more depth but it doesn't seem Crystal Dynamics wants to put that kind of effort into it. The fact that they pretty much recycled the supernatural enemies (yay more undead men /s) and the final climb from the reboot speaks volumes of what kind of effort they put into the plot. I've seen some minor complaints about the overarching enemy, but since I grew up with Natla constantly having a vendetta against Lara it doesn't bother me as long as it's planned out well.\n\nPerformance wise, the game worked fine for me. My recent boot up of the game, during a loading screen, it crashed for the first time. There's a few moments where my fps will drop from the 60's-50's to the 30's and one time even 15 fps, other than that the game ran smooth. I have a gtx 780, a locked i5, and 16gb of ram so most of my settings were set to high/very high, and I refused to compromise on the pure hair at least being on because it looked weird off.\n\nAs I said, overall it's a good game. There's still room for improvement but it's already quite the upgrade over the reboot. Buy it when you can!\n\nP.S: What happened to Croatia?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/recommended/391220/","baenlynn","Bænlynn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baenlynn/","298 products in account","Hands down the present incarnation of Lara Croft is the best-written Triple-A protagonist I have ever seen. Even if that seems like a pretty low bar to clear, Crystal Dynamics' writing clears that bar by a very wide margin, and sets less of a benchmark than they do write the book on how to do good characters and character development in gaming.\n\nThe thing I have enjoyed about both titles in the Tomb Raider reboot is that more than any other Triple-A titles their character stories carry the game through more than any single element of the graphics or gameplay. Lara Croft is strong, determined, and single-minded, but she is by no means perfect or indeed unaffected by her previous trials because by the same turns she is proving to be obsessed, brooding, and also reckless.\n\nThe beauty of all of Lara's character nuances lie in the subtleties. She has survived the Dragon's Triangle, but not without being changed. Lara's view of the world has been tilted, the illusions that everyone carries around with them are sliding away from her, and this comes out in her growing obsession with her Father's research, which is driving a wedge between her and everyone else she knows. This is a character story that is heading for a huge confrontation with the demons Lara keeps accumulating, and that story is going to be one hell of a battle.\n\nWhen Lara washed up on Yamatai she suffered through her ordeal as any of us would: fearfully, desperately and at times through tears and hysteria. This time around I was expecting a more mature Lara, I got it. I was expecting a tougher Lara, I got that too. I was expecting a Lara that was a little more suspicious, more attuned to threats, and I even got that. What I wasn't really expecting was a Lara who had gone past the point of confidence and in the other direction. I was expecting the stakes to be higher, and they are to an extent, but Crystal Dynamics have managed to largely sidestep this potential pitfall in the way the story of Lara's search is told through her father's old audio logs and Lara's own fireside diaries.\n\nLara Croft: survivor, archaeologist, Jill of all trades. She is still out her depth, but this time it's not the environment or the crazy cultists who have her overwhelmed. This time Lara Croft is overwhelmed by Lara Croft. Held hostage and pulled ever onward by an obession she may not be able to handle. This is how Rise of the Tomb Raider succeeds at avoiding the standard escalation trope through making the story about Lara, rather than simply about its gorgeous vistas, paramilitary groups, and ancient conspiracies. All the standard fare that has been part of the Tomb Raider cannon for two decades is there, but the element of realism that comes from placing the ideas of mental toughness and psychological/emotional vulnerability on separate scales adds so much extra depth to the storytelling without crowding out the current game's plot.\n\nThe core gameplay vis-a-vis Lara's movement and actions hasn't really changed from the reboot, but if you've played the original the storytelling makes this feel exactly like slipping into the same old patterns, so from the getgo Lara is ready to outrun black helicopters, tidal waves, crumbling temples and even collapsing mountainsides. The opening scenes recall all of the expertise Lara had accumulated by the end of her trial by fire on Yamatai, and the landscape and pacing also recall Lara's final panicked scrabble up the temple mountain to rescue Sam from Matthias. A walk down memory lane has never been so subtle, so visceral, and so accessible. Without a single black and white vignette, followers of Lara's previous adventure will find all of their memories being triggered, all while newcomers are getting their feet wet.\n\nAll the gameplay updates take place in the weapons, apparel, traps, and crafting mechanics and this too adds more weight to the story: Lara has been busy since Yamatai, she's refined her bushcraft and her jury-rigging skills, and become more proficient at living off the land. Her climbing axe, a firesteel, a length of rope, is all Lara needs to survive. I was worried that I would be taken back to square one in terms of Lara's skills, there is still a difficulty tree to climb after all. But rather than simply take us back to square one in terms of abilities, Lara gets a few extras from the getgo that she didn't have before. Being able to 'death-from-above' enemies or ambush them from the bushes from the very beginning, reminds us that Lara is a well-heeled adventurer, and the skills she is still to develop are a level above her current expertise. So all in all, the gameplay changes make sense.\n\nI was a little worried that all the resources and crafting would be overwhelming and time-consuming, but after a half hour getting to grips with accumulating resources I found it quite simple. Crystal Dynamics have taken the highlighting element that illuminates useful objects from their first offering and simply expanded on the number of different items one can collect, moreover most of the resources stick out normally anyhow, and there are enough of them on your way from A to B without feeling like you're being sidetracked. The amount of complexity is just right and unlike other titles with similar elements, I have yet to feel as though I am dividing my time between crafting and advancing the story. Once again Crystal Dynamics are writing the book on how to do things right.\n\nIf you like good character stories, but every once in a while you like to play a run-and-gun-hack-and-slash game to unwind with, Rise of the Tomb Raider manages to cram in the best of both of these worlds without sacrificing on either, and the story really does leave its fingerprints on everything. Do yourself a favour and buy this game, dive right in and get lost in it.","February 5","true","26.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skipp86/recommended/391220/","skipp86","Skipp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skipp86/","190 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider pretty much takes everything from the 2013 TR and adds some extra stuff. It's the same type of gameplay with less quicktime events but with the same action packed, everything-is-falling-apart-around-me feeling you get during the whole duration of your exploration with Lara.\n\nEven though RotTR requires a bit beefier rig, it still runs perfectly smooth even with all the eyecandy turned on. Also - the new hair physics look awesome and natural with no bugs or random clipping like the TressFX had back in TR2013.\n\nThe game takes you on a journey to find an artifact of power that grants immortality. The same artefact Lara's father was searching for, and in the end - died for. Driven by her father's last words you take Lara on her first journey through the snowy areas of RotTR.\n\nYou get the same, a bit upgraded, arsenal of weapons and skills that you unlock through gameplay as before - but this time you can do extra side missions and optional tombs to unlock special skills and abilities otherwise unavailable.\n\nThe only bad side of the game is the usual half-dumb AI of the guards Lara encounters (although I was surprised to notice how the shielded guards actually move the shield up/down depending on your aiming), and the fact that you will spend most of the game in a snowy area. A bit of diversity would be nice.\n\nOne other thing that kinda stood out was occasional situations where Lara goes into Rambo mode. I understood her killing rampage outburst in TR2013 (being all alone and inexperienced on an island full of lunatics), but in RotTR she does the same thing once or twice when she could easily do it stealthy...\n\nApart from that - the game is bug free and pretty much a perfect sequel to the TR reboot.\n\nAlso - the game ends in a cliffhanger obviously suggesting a new TR that will directly continue Lara's story from RotTR!","February 4","true","20.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkooziBoo/recommended/391220/","SkooziBoo","shane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SkooziBoo/","344 products in account","To be honest right up front , the 2013 reboot of Tomb Raider was the first  TR game I had ever played. I thouroughly devoured that game, beating it multiple times and on different platforms and difficulties. I came at this game with high hopes, probably a little unfairley high, but that said overall I Enjoyed Rise of The Tomb Raider .\nThe aspects I loved about the reboot are still in place, the crafting (satisfyingly improved), the challenge tombs, Lauras inner dialouge and interaction between her loved ones,and the exploration of the games beautiful environments.\ncombat also feels very similar but subtly refined , I noticed in order to thrive in combat patience is key and movement around the terrain is key to successfully conquering some of the more frantic feeling encounters. Which in the late game seem constant.On that note I'd recomend bumping the difficulty up one notch over normal for veteran action fans. Combat can be a bit repetive on the normal difficulty.\nMy main complaint with Laura's latest adventure was the lack of personal relationships that were a key aspect of the reboot. The plot of this game seems a bit forced and hard to relate to Laura as we see very few close relationships between Laura and the other characters. That said the story did present entertaining and somewhat intricate bit. Not saying the 2013 reboot was perfect but I was rooting for Laura more in her last adventure. The issues i had with this games story i have with most game stories. Theres a bad guy and you better beat 'em!\nSo overall i really liked this game it is a graphics powerhouse, it has a deeper crafting element than the previous title, the landscapes are lush and varied, the enemies seem very similar to that which we faced before but i can live with that, and there is alot of meat to sink your teeth into in Lauras latest adventure (both figurativly and literally,you can slaughter hundreds of animals for them precious hides). The thrills come frequent and the down time offers interesting exploration opportunities.\nI cant recomend this game enough for fans of the previous title or just action adventure games in general . THIS GAME I SOLID !\n\n4/5 stars\n","March 24","true","67.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jueis/recommended/391220/","jueis","eou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jueis/","385 products in account","This is truly everything that Tomb Raider (that is, the 2013 version) failed to be. It's not a spectacular game, but it's a huge step up from the previous entry in the series.\n\nWhen the previous game was released, it was showered with praise, particularly toward the evolution of the main character, Lara Croft. Having played Tomb Raider, I think such praise is quite odd. It was blatantly bad, consisting of bland gameplay, level designs, story, graphics, and an unbelievably lifeless cast. Worst of all, the title "Tomb Raider" appeared to have no significance, as the tombs were 100% optional, and were as relevant as the bleach bottles tossed at you as "puzzles".\n\nFortunately, Rise of the Tomb Raider is completely different. This time around, the game does indeed center itself upon a tomb, and all the areas the predecessor lacked in it shines. For example, the formerly laughable writing has turned into something more solid. Although still nothing groundbreaking, the dialogue flows smoothly and the characters are all very fleshed out and intelligible. We even manage to better understand just how important Lara and the Endurance crew's relationship with each other, or at the very least, her and Jonah's.\n\nThe gameplay of the game has also been improved quite a bit. Although still featuring the inane "Survival Instincts" button and unnecessary character skills, it's not as stupidly simple as Tomb Raider's, whereas you could just right trigger through enemies' bodies. Unlike the predecessor, I actually found myself enjoying and making use of the alternate forms combat, as well as the need to preserve certain items in order to make sure I would stay alive incombat. The stealth system also feels quite improved, with there being more to it than just "shoot everyone in the head from afar".\n\nFinally, the most important part of Tomb Raider is the "adventure" of it, which does indeed exist in Rise of the Tomb Raider. Every area feels very fresh, and all colored very vividly and beautifully, and every moment where you are on the run actually feels like an action sequence, rather than a five second QTE.\n\nOf course, all of that doesn't mean to say that there aren't flaws to this game that existed in the previous. The enemies still know your location at every moment, the game is still focused on telling a story rather than being a game, many of the tombs in the game are still 100% optional, and the ridiculous, waste-of-time collectibles are still here. There's even a "language skill" that you improve by collecting some of those collectibles, but even that just feels completely unnecessary. Alongside those collectibles is the collection of natural and man-made resources, which may or may not hinder your enjoyment of the game, seeing as those resources are mandatory to your "survival" throughout the game.\n\nAll-in-all, it's quite easy to say that Rise of the Tomb Raider isn't a great game, and probably isn't even the the best in its genre, yet it manages to be a very complete one, regardless of the somewhat-short length of 12-15 hours. It may not be perfect, but at the very least, it has definitely "risen" out of its predecessor's mediocrity and become something of its own. It's a very enjoyable game, and I recommend checking it out, especially if you haven't played the original.","April 30","true","15.1"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

It is literally a must-play for Tomb Raider fans. It might be one of the best TR games yet. Do you remember TR 2013's stunning visuals? This one is even better. Visuals are stunning. Crafting has got lots of equipment to craft from outfits to weapon additions. Crafting sure did improve a lot! Gameplay? Simply amazing. Gameplay manages to keep you entertained for endless hours. I can't really say anything about the story as I haven't finished the story yet but I can safely say it goes very well for now, it is definitely better than TR 2013 story-wise and also character-wise. Stealth was also improved in this game. It is a master piece for a TR game and it is definitely a must-buy.

This was using the latest 16.11 crimson driver. I wasnt happy with this so I decided to rollback to driver version 15.11.1 and I gained about 20fps in almost every part of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maveron/recommended/391220/","maveron","ㄨ.Maveron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maveron/","67 products in account","A solid third-person-action game, but with little tomb raider identity and heavy performance issues.\n\nTechnical:\nThe game looks stunningly good and the background design is georgus. However, as soon as i translated to the wide open areas, big framerate drops occured. Especially in the valley during the stormy rain time. Im talking about going from solid 60-85fps down to 15-25fps. i played the game with a Strix GTX 970 stock clocked at 1080p. changing grahpic settings had little to no impact, even going from all topped out to medium, always got the same fps. Also, during the beautiful realistic setting and graphics, i suddenly encountered the worst looking avalanche...ever..in a video game, a animation, a movie...no idea who goofed this one up.\n\nGameplay:\nJust as the first reboot title, it has good controls, nice climbing sections with diverse climbing mechanics, good gunplay but too much over-the-top-action sequences and so many collectibles, that is was most times just disctracing from the game.\n\nWhat it does better from the precessor, is that they included 9 Optional Tombs with nice riddles. However, its only exactly 1 riddle per Tomb, completed in about 3-10 Minutes each. As if this wasn't dissapointing enough, Lara keeps talking, not just giving hints, but telling you almost exactly what you have to do, taking out every challange of the puzzles whatsoever\n\nIf the hole game was like this, than i would call it a great Tomb Raider game, but unfortunately the main story, is just a linear movie like third person action game. Thanks to the good diverse climbing and well done stealth passages, this game can somewhat hold up to the fanbase. If it weren't for those two things, this game would have gone the completly same route as modern Resident Evil titles, leaving all identity behind, going from a puzzle game to a action-movie like expirience.\n\nThe game features great weapon upgrade and customization system, as well hidden strongboxes, wich grant you different weapons models with different mechanics, like a full-auto-shotgun instead of a pump-action one.\nThe strongboxes are sometimes pretty obvious, and sometimes well hidden. As you progress, secrets are getting revealed on the map. Combined with the possiblities to fast travel back to earlier areas of the game, it is absolutely possible to get 100% collectibles in the game.\nHowever, it's almost impossible to get every weapon upgrade in the game, as some parts are dropping off enemy soldiers. Some of them respawn, but it would take dozen of hours to get enough materials for alle the upgrades.\n(I played on the hardest difficulty, wich makes upgrading require more parts)\n\nHowever, there is one problem with the huge amount of collectibles. They are very distracting since there are so many. If you want to get them all, you will find yourself activiting the survival instinct mechanic every 5 steps, which got myself so annyoing, i wished there was nothing to find, so i don't get this flashy sound anymore.\n\nBeside that, the over-the-top action in the games, was way too much. Starting from the first minute in the game, i kept aking myself "how the hell would Lara survive that" ever 10 minutes. This game just trys way too hard to be entertaining like a michael bay movie.\n\nAlso, this game features the most usless attack helicopter in history.\n\nTL;DR:\nA very solid third-person action game (7/10) with nice climbing, stealth and climbing mechanics.\nHeavy Technical issues in certain open areas (don't trust reviews that only feature the first hour of the Game)\nGreat voice acting, fluent diverse gameplay and cutscenes.\nStill lacks heavily of Tomb Raider identity, having only 9 greater Puzzles to solve. Fans of the original series will be dissapointed, as the new inclued "Tombs" are just an optional sidekick.\nBut still, a very enjoyable single player game.\n\n..also, the worst, pathetic attack helicopter...ever","February 4","true","20.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Lots of platforming and combat? Check. Collectibles? Check. Middling story? Check. Villains I wish I had killed but didn't? Check. Most of my deaths happening because the game didn't do what I was intending? Check. The list goes on like that.\n\nBut honestly, it's fine. I didn't have any trouble running it, and the game itself is functional and competent, if perhaps somewhat unremarkable. If you liked the first TR reboot and want to play more of the same, then this should suit you just fine. If not, well... then don't. XD. However, in any event I'd wait for a sale because this game is, like alot of AAA releases, shorter in hours than it's pricetag. Wait for sales to come eventually.\n\nStill not sure what the hell those cards are all about though. :o","March 13","true","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Highly recommended if you are interested at all in single-player or puzzle games.\n\nNote that this paragraph is highly subjective and I can fully understand if people feel differently: I like the fact that lara is even less sexualized than 2013 Tomb Raider. The focus was on the storytelling and the action, not the fact that the main character is female. The immersiveness isn't detracted from by love interests or other nonsense.

The game looks absolutely stunning, especially in the cutscenes but also while normal gameplay. Thanks to motion capturing, insanely high end models and highres textures the characters look very lifelike and feel beyond real. The areas each have an unique feel to them and are very detailed. Only downside are the resulting fps, especially in some outside areas.\n\nI also really enjoyed the story since it's solid, fun to follow and the characters feel authentic. Scattered around the map are countless letters and audiologs to find which tell tales of long gone individuals, like the man who chased the prophet. It felt very rewarding finding a new part of his story every now and then, since it also gives you more insight into the current storyline itself.\n\nThe gameplay recieved some upgrades as well, so it's even more fun to explore the relatively open maps, climb mountains, hunt for animal loot and decide for yourself which quests you want to do next. The game rewards you for exploring the area by finding weapon parts to unlock new weapons, single weapon accessories and so on. Gathering ressources enables you to modify weapons, improving their respective stats. By leveling up while playing and collecting stuff you can unlock skills which improve various general and weapon specific aspects of Lara, which is also rewarding.\n\nThe game offers at least 20 hours of gameplay without looking for all the collectibles. At this point I played it 25 hours and reached overall progress of 86%, so there are many more collectibles to find\n\nI highly recommend Rise of the Tomb Raider.

Sadly, I have to say that I had similar problems but nothing that extreme. Stuttering was fixes simply by lowering textures on HIGH (even tho i run two OverClocked 970s) and everything else on Very High.

But of course I tried not to be hyped since the last years many games were overhyped - when you played them or saw actual gameplay footage they were just bad or not close to what trailers showed.\nBut this title just surprised me. First, I was overwhelmed by the graphics (I didnt play too many new AAA Titles the last year, but if you did, i guess you'll still find it pretty). Then I saw how big some of the areas are and again was surprised. Beautiful landscapes and if you look close enough, they are full with collectables. As you may want to know, I played the game on 100%, got all of the collectables. And I was never really bored by searching the map. Gameplay was really good - Mechanics worked well and control input felt natural. I don't want to spoil the mechanics, which are augmented during the game. It's hard to describe, but I really loved the experience I had playing this game.  The story however is ok, a little bit flat and predictable (No trash plot  though).\n\nConclusion\nIf you played Tomb Raider 2013, you'll love that game. Some things are similar, but Rise of the Tomb Raider is better in many ways. I highly recommend this game to everybody who enjoys adventures, singleplayer, nicely designed game worlds and collecting (Also recommend the game when you don't like the last aspect since you can play it without searching for all the little things and sidequesting).

I was more impressed with Baba Yaga instead of the main villain\n-The ending to me was somewhat disappointing, for obvious reasons not going to explain why but it was a tad anti-climactic\n-The game feels a bit too easy even when played on Survivor (which is the hardest mode)\n-The season pass is very barebones for what you pay for: Baba Yaga (which is like 3 hours, 4 if you stretch it with 100% completion), a horde mode & a survival mode. I'd rather have them make more 'story' content than tacked-in survival or horde mode stuff which is, lets be honest, pretty boring in nearly every game and serves as pure filler for the pass.\nRegardless I bought the season pass knowing what was in it to support the developers for creating this game but it really is not worth the money asked for - Baba Yaga is good but short and also the only content that really interests me\n\nRegardless of the cons, this game is fantastic and should be played by anyone interested in the genre or the IP (scratch that, everyone should play this, period), this game brings the new standard and it will be immensely hard to be knocked off its throne.","February 6","true","27.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The optional missions even though some of them were fetch quests I felt in some way they actually complemented the story.

It's a great adventure, which is able to convey the feeling of loneliness and anxiety to survive in an environment completly free of any comfort and full of big treats.\nAll of this is surely about the excellent work done by the technical sector, which has made every details in the best ways, enabling the succes of the title.\n\nFirst of all you have to admire the addictive Lara's expression, which is able to express every mood. Another point in favor is given to the movements, which can perfectly delineate every situation, it's a indoor climbing, a race in the midst of deep snow, or a gunfight. All this is surrounded by a scene worthy of note, with the shots that make perfectly the climate.\nAlmost all of the game concentrates in Siberia; the deep snow, the wind, the thick icy mountains generate an ambient that is at the boundary between game and reality, also the perfection of film shoots, giving a further touch of class.\n\nThe sequences less hectic are excellent too, especially the one linked to the Tomb. All the puzzles are designed in a very perfect way and they make the game free od monotony.\nUnfortunately some flaw has to be assigned to the storyline, even it is to admit that improves compared to the previous title. The premises are very attractive; after the death of his father, Lara follows the footsteps of his father,she is looking for an ancient artifact that, according to legend, would give eternal life. Unfortunately, despite a dynamic and interesting start, the story gives way to the action part of the title. It is certain to say that if you don't like the first chapter, TR2013, perhaps you don't like this too, but in any case I think it is a great and funny adventure title.\n\n\nPro:\n\n- Better story than the previous title, but not the best story ever\n\n- Fantastic graphics, even better after the patch\n\n- Excellent cinematic impact\n\n- Excellent playability\n\n- Big areas and true Tomb to raid\n\n- Good crafting system\n\n- Several levels of difficulty and challenge\n\nCons:\n\n- The combat are not excellent\n\n- Small difficulties using a mouse + keyboard in some places","February 7","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Less gruesome deaths for our lady protagonist (there is still some, and still just as cringe-worthy), really nice plot (while keeping it as realistic as possible), beautiful graphics, and Lara Croft's character development is nice. I like how the game is focused on puzzle-solving and exploration (which I personally enjoy in games), with some elements of stealth/shoot-em-down at certain points of the game. This variety of activities to do in-game prevents the game from getting too dull. The story's pace is nice, and the maps have many hidden caves and activities to do, living up to the name of "Tomb Raider". Lastly, I like how Lara Croft is not some buxom lady with revealing clothes, but instead a young adult whose adventures I really want to follow. The game does not try to give her a love interest, which I really appreciate. They keep the focus on the exciting challenges and good plot, while giving Lara Croft enough character to like, and yet not using sex appeal or unnecessary romance to keep us interested in the game!!\n\nIf I am to rate this game, I'll give it 9.5/10. that missing 0.5 point is because I still can't figure out how to multi-shoot with my bow.haha","February 12","true","30.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","1"

Something seems less fun about the combat from 2013 I'm not sure what it is.\n\n-A few areas the frame rate just plummets. These are bigger areas and a ton of detail went into the world so it's tolerable.\n\n-Forced back tracking to explore some areas and collect relics and weapons. Gear is acquired level by level, which opens tombs and crypts from previous levels which were unavailable due to missing gear.\n\n-Short story. Not that short, but if you just play the game for the story without doing anything off the beaten path, I can guess this game can be completed under 15 hours.

I was a huge fan of the first game where you get stranded on an island and you discover all of its secrets and you find weapons. Rise of the Tomb Raider is different with new weapons,outfits,map and a general storyline. The plot is very firm and everything is organized. The fighting is harder and I think the story is a bit longer than the first game. This series became one of my favorite series because it doesnt fail to bring you excitement and adventure.The game does not include multiplayer which might have been a nice addition with a different map but still loads of fun. The series sort of reminds me of the batman series which is probably my favorite series. Now the ending, is a cliffhanger which definitely implies a direct sequel. Some people may not like that because it makes people want to spend money but it was definitely a good way to end the game.

I play at my native res of 1440p with no vysnc so framerates are uncapped and the above is just an average. All settings accept AA are maxed or enable (including Pure Hair ) .\nSo if you have a similar system thats a pretty good idea of what you can expect performance wise as of the posting of this reveiw.\n\nGamePlay:\nSimilar to TR 2013 in that its action focused around big set pieces and intense up close interactions (like a Giant Grizzly popping out on you!)  It takes 2013's formula and pumps it up on steroids, better graphics. More intricate ruins/tombs to explore.  The crafting/upgrade system offers a ton more. Now instead of just  collecting scrap you will find actual resources, such as wood,berries,minerals,cloth and animal hides just to name a few. You can make different types of arrows, as well as upgrading your stuff. The collectables have a cool progression to them too, you will need to find artifacts releating to different ancient cultures to increase your proficieny in reading stuff (ie learning greek,mongolian etc) which helps to unlock the games more powerfull upgrades.  Laura's costumes come with different stat bonuses, giving you an excuse to wear a variety of them for more than just aesthetic value.\n\nThis game offers a real globe trotting feel compared to TR2013, which took place on one large island. In RotTR you will be zipping around to Syria, Siberia along with cutscenes that show life back in London. The main search is for some artifact that grants immortality, which was the undoing of Laura's father who was obsessed with the subject.  Very Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade like, but thats not bad imo you can have worse things to base you game plot around.\n\nControls:  Much like TR2013 controls are tight allowing for easy switching from ranged to melee in combat. This is enhanced by upgrades to have more melee or better shooting/bow skills.  There is a greater focus on allowing stealth gameplay which opens up how you attack a level.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you liked TR 2013 you will love RotTR because it follows the previous game's modis of operation, but it bigger, better and more intricate in just about every way. Just make sure you have the HW to run it first and take the time to find the right settings in the graphics menu that will be appropriate to your hardware.","February 2","true","33.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Something seems less fun about the combat from 2013 I'm not sure what it is.\n\n-A few areas the frame rate just plummets. These are bigger areas and a ton of detail went into the world so it's tolerable.\n\n-Forced back tracking to explore some areas and collect relics and weapons. Gear is acquired level by level, which opens tombs and crypts from previous levels which were unavailable due to missing gear.\n\n-Short story. Not that short, but if you just play the game for the story without doing anything off the beaten path, I can guess this game can be completed under 15 hours. I have over 40 hours and I'm 50% roughly. It's worth taking your time.","February 14","true","59.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I was a huge fan of the first game where you get stranded on an island and you discover all of its secrets and you find weapons. Rise of the Tomb Raider is different with new weapons,outfits,map and a general storyline. The plot is very firm and everything is organized. The fighting is harder and I think the story is a bit longer than the first game. This series became one of my favorite series because it doesnt fail to bring you excitement and adventure.The game does not include multiplayer which might have been a nice addition with a different map but still loads of fun. The series sort of reminds me of the batman series which is probably my favorite series. Now the ending, is a cliffhanger which definitely implies a direct sequel. Some people may not like that because it makes people want to spend money but it was definitely a good way to end the game. Strongly Recommend if you really liked the first game.","February 1","true","17.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

But of course I tried not to be hyped since the last years many games were overhyped - when you played them or saw actual gameplay footage they were just bad or not close to what trailers showed.\nBut this title just surprised me. First, I was overwhelmed by the graphics (I didnt play too many new AAA Titles the last year, but if you did, i guess you'll still find it pretty). Then I saw how big some of the areas are and again was surprised. Beautiful landscapes and if you look close enough, they are full with collectables. As you may want to know, I played the game on 100%, got all of the collectables. And I was never really bored by searching the map. Gameplay was really good - Mechanics worked well and control input felt natural. I don't want to spoil the mechanics, which are augmented during the game. It's hard to describe, but I really loved the experience I had playing this game.  The story however is ok, a little bit flat and predictable (No trash plot  though).\n\nConclusion\nIf you played Tomb Raider 2013, you'll love that game. Some things are similar, but Rise of the Tomb Raider is better in many ways. I highly recommend this game to everybody who enjoys adventures, singleplayer, nicely designed game worlds and collecting (Also recommend the game when you don't like the last aspect since you can play it without searching for all the little things and sidequesting).

A game that gets you so involved and attached to the main character (Lara), should try to make you feel like part of the main story, I almost felt like a bystander that was "in the way", granted, I've not yet finished to story, but I intend to.

The optimization is not wonderful, and I found my frames tanking to 20 fps at some points. (To be fair, I have a low-end gaming laptop, so it's not necissarily surprising)\n\nThe gameplay is good, and I found it challenging enough, while not inducing rage on my part due to frustration. There is a ton to do, which I love, and just exploring the world can be pretty fun. Certainly the crafting and weapons system has come a long way since the 2013 Tomb Raider game (which is still great, and I would recommend playing it, too.) with different weapons and different types of ammo available to be crafted, as well as several attachments to the weapons.\n\nActually, in my opinion, the game's weakest point is the storyline. It's passable, and it keeps the game moving at a nice pace, but there are few surprises and it feels like the stock storyline from a lot of action movies.That said, I still found myself intrigued by the story, and it definitley improved the playing experience.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game.","May 25","true","24.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

It generally relies on the same mechanics with new twists here and there, improved progression, more varied and more challenging combat etc. etc... The result is unsurprisngly a very good game, and if you have enjoyed the 2013 Tomb Raider, you will certainly enjoy this one even more. For your money you'll be getting around 35 hours of singleplayer gameplay for one complete playthrough, and then of course you can enjoy the multiplayer which is geared towards playing in a smaller group of friends. Over all I'd say the purchase is well worth it.\n\nI'll elaborate on a few things below if you're interested:\n\nPUZZLES: People say they're too easy. In my opinion, yes and no. They're not gonna send you looking for a youtube guide, that's for sure, but on the other hand, they're not gonna send you looking for a youtube guide. You're faced with solid, multi-stage puzzless you can solve yourself in 10-20 minutes and have all the sense of accomplishment for yourself. I rate that as a good thing, it's a nice middle ground. Although I would have preferred if these kinds were confined to the main story so as not to hinder progress where everyone has to go through them, and then the optional tombs should perhaps be a head scratcher.\n\nTHE WORLD: It isn't really open as is often said, it's handled the same way it was done in the previous game, a series of areas, some very big, some very small. But none that would take more than a couple minutes to traverse from side to side. There is of course collectibles and little climbing sequences and what have you scattered all about and I have actually much enjoyed doing them. part of this has to do with the fact that they're often blocked off until you acquire specific gear to access them by progressing the main story. I wasn't too sure about this, in the end deciding it's a good thing, since it forces you to do portions of scurrying about and doing missions, thus giving you a balnced portion of both, and preventing either from becoming mundane. The downside of course being that you have to come back to areas you've already been to multiple times.\n\nTHE STORY: Not much to be said about that, nothing stellar, but decent enough to keep you wanting to learn more, though the characters often lacked depth and unless you go through the trouble of collecting and reading the documents scattered around the world it might even feel a bit lackluster and bare bones. But seeing as I did, I have no real complaints.\n\nTHE SEQUEL: This to me is my biggest fear. RotTR was nodoubt a good game. But you could feel they were afraid to experiment. They polished and improved, carefully put in a new idea here and there, but all in all not that much has really changed. The Assassins Creed is an excellent comparison here. We've had AC 1, and now an AC 2, so let's hope to god the next TR game the devs will be allowed some creativity and we won't have an AC 3.\n","May 23","true","31.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","2"

If you liked Tomb Raider, you are going to like this one as well.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game delivers a very nice atmosphere, combining fast elements directly, evolving out of cutscenes, with puzzles, which are a bit more complex than LEGO Game puzzles, but not to hard at all. There is also some sort of open world playstyle with different things to explore. Furthermore, there is a simple crafting system which I enjoyed alot (I don't like crafting at all^^).\n\nAll in all it is a very good game, 5/7 would buy ;)\n","June 2","true","18.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It's kind of an open world game , but still , is not a huge open world game , so dont expect a huge map which needs lots of hours to fully explore (In comparision to other maps)\n\nThere are some pretty interesting weapons starting from a bow , and then we got rifles and guns and they are also fully upgradable which is very good.\n\nThe storyline is not the best , but still It gets interesting and well , I like it so far. The secondary missions and sites are usefull for your items , you can get diffrent parts for your weapons from tombs and missions , so you should have a look at them , I personally love the puzzels in this game. But the bad part is that the puzzels are too easy , so yeah if you are thinking of hard puzzels that needs some good time of thinking , well those are not like that...they are easy puzzels.\n\nAlso the AI is too bad....Well I am playing on medium difficulty (Tomb Raider) and some of the enemyes cant see me if I stand in front of them (about 4 m) , also their shooting is weird , they shoot few bullets and then they stop and look at you and then they shoot few more bullets.(This is something that it's weird for me)\n\nThe parkour is inspired from games like Assassins Creed , well I like the parkour , is pretty nice , you can air assassinate tragets from trees that you climb , so this is a new thing that I like\n\nYou also have a skill tab where you upgrade your character.\n\nBut , I felt like I played a Tomb Raider (2013) which was a bit modified , then it had some better graphics , a diffrent story line , but with the same kind of subject / idea. You play as a girl , you must kill the enemyes which are set in diffrent camps , you explore caves and stuff , and the list goes on.\n\nAnyway to sum up , yeah this game is not a bad game , but the thing is that the puzzels are too easy , the AI could have been a bit more smarter and stuff aaand I understand that this is like a Tomb Raider 2 , but still it is not something special and diffrent , sooo I am not very sure about this game , I am enjoying it but is not what I  expected , it could have been better tho....","February 2","true","35.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

You wont get it now with the same purchase. If you feel fooled, refund it?\nThe so called "microtransactions" that some people noticed upon launching the game are barely special. Also they are bought with in-game money you get loads by playing, real money is not needed. Marketplace has just some cards for challenge gamemode with x% dmg boosting to certain weapons. Or "making the game harder" cards like taking more fire dmg. It is singleplayer game plus the stuff is random you buy.\nRecommended system req are not, and have rarely ever been, for "ultra" settings. Its for high. You will need better rig to play it ultra and above (30-60+) fps.\nOn Low the game looks like medium TR 2013, or like xbox 360 version of Rise TR game so there is nice scaling on graphics there. Youtube search comparision vids with 360 and Xbone!\nFirst hour or so has lot of QTE's but thats mainly as way of tutorial. Later on you will not get major "press E to climb wall with axe" - you just press it or fall off. No prompts. There are some "cinematic" scenes with "press F to FITE" obviously.\nSo far into the game I have not felt any major issues. The game plays like TR2013 but obviously lot of new features.\nThe game, at start at least, has more depth and on crafting ammo, materials and healing bandages. You will have to craft poison arrows, arrows, get new gun parts (4 parts to new pistol etc). This has moved away from the TR2013 where you had almost no reason to collect materials.\n\nCombat..\nIs similiar to TR2013. You have your bow for silent kill, pistols and other guns for loud bang bangs. Stealth kills, distractions with bottles, explosions, oil + lantern = boom etc.\n\nTombs..\nhave been vastly improved, have clever tombs right from start. Plus theres about 4 of them in first 4 hours, depending how you count. So there is def. more now.\n\nPC "port"\nFor me the game runs at 35-55 fps with high settings (i5, gtx 670).\nThe game has lot of scaling on settings. On lower settings the game looks like X360 version, on very high one of the best looking games so far.\nThe devs have been clearly been working properly on PC version.\nSo far I have not encountered major bugs either. First "quest giver" have been known to disappear into earth but thats probably being patched soon. Fast travelling between camps makes game reload and that also works.\nNote: Stuttering happened to me when I changed graphical settings IN-game. After that it reloads textures and that makes it stutter if you try to play at same time (which is possible)\n\nOne of the major cons of the game is publishers decision to make game-changing and very intresting sounding "Endurance gamemode" paid DLC..and 10e!? I really want to get it but its really annoying decision from Square. Again.\n\n9/10","February 4","true","11.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

All those ancient flavours are present here. I feel like a kid playing this game, and is ♥♥♥♥ing great.\n\nWhat a game!! The game is an improvement of all the things its predecesor had in every single way possible, so if you like the first one this will blow up your mind. Like the first one is more Lara Croft meets Sam Fisher in the wilderness. Lara feels more grown-up, the story is far more interesting and it's very well written (will catch you). The game is more dark and violent (even gruesome sometimes). Now the characters are really interesting too. nice exploration, in fact now exploring is really interesting because it rewards you with weapon upgrades, skills... a better narrative, bigger escenarios, puzzles, tombs (great ones and more well designed. The tombs are really big, you even forget that are optional), the combat is very fun and well made, better stealth moments (with specific skills), crafting (make ammo, new equipment, outfits, different stuff...), a lot of weapon (four different categories) with different stats and improvements, new skills, there are sidequest now, those missions reward you with special upgrades... and the game is visually astonishing. Evocative, amazing, beautiful and incredibly dynamic. Best action-adventure in a very long time.\n\nAs a final note, the character of Lara is amazing, strong, capable, determined and tenacious. Her evolution over previous game was amazing, and even more in this one. We need stronger and   REAL  women in video games, and not those stereotyped who always need a man to rescue them.","March 27","true","14.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I'm not completely against pre-ordering, but when it comes to games like these, I certainly pre-order. Sure, I had thought about the game being a massive huge flop, but I was more than willing to take the risk with this game because of the previous game (2013).\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610525783\n\nI strongly support developers who take the time to ensure that their games work outstanding on the PC. That was the main reason why I pre-ordered.\n\nThis game certainly isn't for everyone, and if you didn't like Tomb Raider 2013, you might be able to enjoy this title a little more because of the reduced quick time events (QTE).\n\nRise of the Tomb Raider is an action game, in a third person view. The camera angles during cut scenes and swimming provide unique and interesting asspects on the ♥♥♥-ets in game (I mean aspects and assets, yes...).\n\nWhile some won't like the actiony feel of the game, I always found that the stealth options to be my calling. The whole gun blazing way of playing the game doesn't really appeal to me. It would feel like you are making the game easy. Combine the stealth approaches with either the seasoned raider or survivor difficultly levels, and the game should be very appealing.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=610443306\n\nThe main story line isn't that challenging, but the optional tombs do provide relief towards the game feeling like a cake walk. I couldn't see myself playing with the difficulty set below seasoned raider.\n\nOne improvement from the 2013 game is that there are a lot more options as to customization and crafting. There are more items to craft, and more items used in crafting.\n\nAnother would be the very optional quests you can do. These would be familiar territory for any RPG players who are also looking to play Rise of the Tomb Raider.\n\nWhile there isn't much for the simple plot and limited game play time (about 15 hours), the graphics are leading edge. I've told a lot of people that this title is clearly a milestone as to computer graphics. We are getting closer and closer to being able to have movie quality graphics rendered in real time. On my system with a GTX 980Ti, it was very obvious when there were sadly still a few pre-rendered video cut scenes.\n\nFor some reason, these pre-rendered cut scene videos were not even 60fps, but rather 30. No idea why that was, because a few of the scenes my system would have been more than capable of handling the rendering them.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612452475\n\nThe main reasons you are going to end up playing Rise of the Tomb Raider are really going to be: you like the action of the latest Tomb Raider games, you like the graphics, and maybe you even enjoy Lara.","February 27","true","15.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","2"

There is one part where you have to carry supplies to a lower part of the map, then instructed to return to the upper part of the map to get more, then back to the lower, then once again back to the upper to turn in the quest.....

ROTR brings back a lot from the first game such as the action packed escapes & many of the old weapons but introduces a lot of new elements such as a lot more weapon/skill upgrades and a new focus on material collecting for crafting equipment\n- Level designs are large and detailed, lots to explore in each one\n\nCons:\n- The game becomes quite repetitive as you get into it, almost feels like the game cycles between running and killing enemies\n- Seems like there is a larger focus on combat and killing than exploration. For a Tomb Raider game I would've liked to seen a focus on puzzle solving\n\n8.5/10. Overall a pretty solid and well designed game, but definitely not better than the first one.

Honestly, the game itself Tomb Raider has been out for soo long with multiple sequels, but if anyone of you who love playing Tomb Raider like I do, would highly recommend it because of it's graphics performance as well as you get over 60FPS while playing it on ultra resolution (Depending on PC and Graphics Card). I really enjoy the story behind it, the challenges that you have to go through, there are multiple puzzles to solve and a lot more. I would also recommend buying a season pass for this game since you get extra modes and an expansion to the gameplay which is really interesting. But the only thing about the season pass is that you get outfits for Lara that you can already craft in the game. So, instead of purchasing the entire season pass, I'd recommend getting the expansion or the endurance mode.\n\nPurchasing this game was a satisfaction for me since I really love playing Tomb Raider, but you'll enjoy the most out of this game by, high resolution gameplay, challenges that Lara goes through and a really interesting story of the game as well.\n\nWould definitely give it a 10/10.

I admit I've never been a huge fan of tomb raider games. I'm not heavily into the story of them and I disliked the game before this one.\n\nFrom the second the game started, I was hooked. The opening sequence and movements felt right. The story has progressed smoothly and fluently. Not divulging too much or too little information. I'm intrigued with the history so far and it has given me that feeling that you never want the game to end. I want to stay up all night and explore every crevice and object.\n\nGraphics are beautiful and I don't get bothered by the camera changes. Sometimes things like that can turn a great scene into an annoyance. The combat has been fun and so has the gathering. I'm not yet tired of scoping out new animals to scavenge from. I like the levelling up system and crafting.

I had high hopes for this one. Does it live up to it? To me? No. "I have to do this, this this." Grunt noises every 5 minutes. 90% combat 10% puzzles/exploration. More of the same just in a different location. Is the game bad? No. Does it innovate or change from the last instalment? No. Is it more linear 3rd person shooter? Yes. Is the game worth the money? Buy it on sale, 7/10\n\nO i forgot the main reason to play this game. The graphics. The game looks amazing on max settings at 1440p.\n\nI still can't decide if I like the mechanic of unlocking things during the game that you have to go back later and open because you didn't have them at the time. This adds to replayability, but the mechanic is  a little annoying.\n\nWell the game has won me over.  In the latter stages of the game you realize that it's bigger than you vs. the enemy. There are others out there that make you feel a part of something bigger. That's a nice change to the standard new TR formula that I welcome.\n\nThe challenge missions are really fun. You can create your own or play community created missions, made up of various missions in the game. Tons of modifiers.

First are the visuals, which at times, even on high settings, can be breath taking.\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and the combat is fierce and quick.  Lara has many weapons at her disposal to dispach her foes; from a bow and arrow, to homemade grenades to an assortment of pistols, rifles and even a shotgun or two.  All of which are upgradable to deal extra damage, have a faster fire rate, or be more accurate.\n\nAction sequences are brutal and intense.  Enemies attempt to outflank the player while a team member provides covering fire, pinning the player down.  Lara is able to use stealth to overcome many enemies, but can also craft homemade grenades, molotovs and smoke bombs when the right items are nearby.\n\nThe sounds are well produced with each weapon having a different report that lends accuracy and immersion to the game. Voicework is well acted, albeit unrealistic with virtually an entirly American sounding cast for many Russian, Greek and other voiced characters.\n\nMostly, Im pleased with the new tombs.  They are very nicely done, giving the player simple, yet vast puzzles to solve through each tomb.  This was sadly underdone in the 2013 reboot and its a welcome addition to this sequel.\n\nThe game runs well for my modest AMD system, though some users are reporting studdering and frame drops.  Once a patch (or new drivers) are released the game should be near flawless.\n\nHigh recommendations, but not perfect due to some voicework and some techinical issues.\n8/10 Overall, fix the techinal issues and its a solid 9.\nJan 31, 2016","January 31","true","12.3"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","8","15","2","0"

I mean,first of all,Lara is SEXYYYY as hell. The sound when Lara is hurt is so deep and f***ing HOT,this for me is the best "premium subscription".\n--------------\nStory:\nWhen i started this game i was like: Jonaaaah! Ana!!! Woah,those are the same characters from the Tomb Raider 2013 and i thought that the story will continue,but nope,the story is totally new from the 2013 title. And,speaking of story,that's how a game should be made. The story is well written,with happy and dramatic moments,but sometimes it felt more like a movie for me. I would love to see that I can choose what I want to do,not what the game wants me to do.(you can,but there are so few choices you can make that I can counter those on my right hand fingers).Overall,the story is great,well done Crystal Dynamics!\n--------------\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is awesome.I played this game entirely on Seasoned Raider difficulty,and it was a little hard,I'm not complaining but when you play the entire game with an x 360 controller and than you switch on the keyboard and mouse you will see a big difference,because those higher difficulties will disable the "aim assist" options. But,for me,this game was right to challange me sometimes with the combat. The combat is well built,you have 3 fire weapons,1 bow and 1 axe that can help you in any situations. This game will challange you.You will need to search the map for special chests in order to unlock new wepons,that you can customize to fit your combat style. You will find "tombs",that will make your abilities better,containers that contains materials that you can use for crafting,and a different type of chests that contains some "old" objects that you can inspect. That's cool! Also,in some parts you can be stealthy,in some parts you better not be stealthy,that's up to you. And the cool fact about the combat is that it will make you think. In combat areas there are often placed "strategickly" some objects that you can interact with to make your combat easyer.\nThe puzzels are satisfying,they will make you feel like James Bond,and after solving them you will be so proud of you. :)\n--------------\nGraphics:\nThis game looks amazing,that's for sure. Even on "medium mixed with high" settings on 1080p,this game is a masterpiece. The characters,the environment,the animals and the whole f***ing world looks amazing.\n--------------\nConclusion:\nThis game should be owned by almost every "Action-Adventure" and well written story fans. Well,what are you waiting for? Buy this game! Well,right now you don't have another choice if you want to play this game,because Denuvooooo! Muhaahaha. Well...even if this game could be cracked I think I have bought it. :)\n-----------------------\nBoring review is shutting down.\nBoring review is installing updates.

It improves upon the fantastic formula from the previous game and adds some fun stuff to do on the side. The only downside is that there is no multiplayer. I rather enjoyed that in the previous one. There is a lot of value in this product. Even at full price it's worth every penny.\n\nTLDR: Just add it to your cart and buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ezah11/recommended/391220/","ezah11","Ezah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ezah11/","114 products in account","As Among Thieves was to Drake's Fortune, so this game is to the rebooted Tomb Raider.\n\nThere are just so many small things that I love about this game that, when put together, create a fantastic game. Perhaps my personal favorite is the introduction of resources and the crafting of crucial components, from a larger backpack to poison arrows to bring down a bear to weapon upgrades. I really disliked that hunting in the first game was useful for a grand total of maybe 20 minutes and then tossed aside, but this time they outdid themselves. Hunting anything from deer to bears to birds and rabbits is useful, and hides are in high demand. It also doesn't feel like a chore, but is actually a fun mechanic in the game. Resources are abundant if you are vigilant enough (and not just heedlessly sprinting through the game), and hunting is easy if you are patient enough to use a vantage point to snipe an unaware buck.\n\nCombat is more or less the same as the first Tomb Raider. You really don't want to end up in melee combat, but you do have the dodge counter available through skills, which can be quite useful. The ability to craft molotovs is extremely useful, as you can snipe somebody from a safe distance by grabbing a random whiskey bottle, lighting it on fire, and tossing it at him. The heal mechanic is incredibly nice, especially on the upper difficulties where there is no in-combat regen, as it allows you to manually heal yourself instead of relying on the *I just got shot, let me sit here for 5 seconds and pretend like nothing happened* method. It's still prudent to stealthily take out enemies, as Lara can be fairly easily overwhelmed.\n\nI can't put my finger on specifically why, but I like the collectibles (including tombs) in this game quite a bit more than the predecessor. For one thing, there are a bazillion of them, but they also seem to make more sense. The challenges for sure are better, while the tomb puzzles are fairly simple to solve, but also quite rewarding as you get a new skill for completing each tomb that is extremely useful (e.g. survival instincts will show trap placements). There are also coins that can be exchanged at a merchant (damn Russian sellout just wants his vodka), but anything that is worth purchasing is extremely expensive, even if you manage to get all of the coin caches as each cache has 7 coins and the important stuff costs around 150.\n\nSo far the story has been a lot better in this game. We get to learn about Lara's relationship with her father and what drives her in her quest for the Divine Source. The supporting cast of characters actually feel somewhat fleshed out, but they never overshadow Lara. This is, first and foremost, a game about Lara Croft (which the first game seemed to emphasize to the point of excluding any character development for the other characters), but you can actually come to understand both the villains and your allies.\n\nI seem to keep talking about this point despite claiming to put no stock in it as far as making or breaking a game, but the graphics in this game are just fantastic. Just watch Lara, whether in a cinematic or during actual gameplay. Her face shows so much emotion, her outfit glistens with snow or water depending on the weather conditions, her hair is detailed down to individual strands of hair. This game really is a pleasure to just look at, even though it definitely feels like they removed a lot of the sex appeal shots for Lara (she actually wears several layers while trudging through the snow covered mountains of Siberia... Who would have ever guessed?)\n\nA small thing that I am not entirely happy about is that the game still has some feaux linearity in the form of campfire fast travel. It feels like the game would go wonderfully with an open world scheme a la Far Cry 3, but it's still a great deal better than the Uncharted series as far as linearity is concerned.\n\nA side note outside of the game itself: I preordered the game, and as soon as it released, the price dropped by 10% for more or less the same content, and this Endurance mode, which sounds like something that should be released with the game, is instead $10 DLC. I wanted to support the developer by preordering the game, as i know that their sales have not been great despite the original game being fantastic as well as reviews for the Xbone version being high, but I feel like i was punished for doing so. I would advise against pre ordering, and just purchasing it on day 1. Even the pre-loading benefit was not much as it took about an hour to unpack after launch.\n\nOverall, this game has far exceeded my expectations. Tomb Raider was already a very solid game, but the improvements in this game have put it over that edge from a fun, solid game to a must play experience for me. I give this game a 9.5/10, and look forward to Crystal Dynamics' next game.","January 31","true","19.4"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","15","29","2","0"

Lara is now in search of the Divine Source, the relic of immortality, as is the illuminati-like group Trinity. The game is very similar in mechanics and playstyle, being a linear driven story with open world exploration with an almost absurd amount of collectibles, however being Tomb Raider that is part of the fun, exploring.\n\nThe combat is extremely similar with a new mechanic being introduced, the on the fly crafting and resource gathering for offensive and healing purposes. The similarities are not only in the gameplay and combat, but also in the tombs and puzzles, the only difference being the puzzles seem to have gotten easier to a point where figuring this optional tombs puzzle is as simple as shooting a rope arrow and turning a crank, congrats! you figured out how to use the controls.\n\nThe downsides being the overly simplified puzzles and the DLC is not great, an hr long story DLC, and two challenge  modes that arn't particular spectacular.\n\nOverall the game is amazing, fun gameplay and exploration, amazing combat finishers and the return of the brutal Lara deaths. Extremely cinematic with amazing visuals and extremely fun running sequences where everything is falling apart as you leap from crumbling collums to a swinging peice of scaffolding to land onto a cable, only after sustaining wounds that would kill any normal human, as Lara does. 9/10.","April 24","true","33.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

So well done, so fluid.... I still have dreams about them..\n\nAnyways, if you've played the other Tomb Raider game released in 2013 you need to get this one as well. It's a must.\nUsually, the second part to a game that comes out "quickly" is bound to be bad or not live up to the expectations. This one however, took my expectations to a romantic dinner and proceeded to **** them all night long. That's how good this game was.\n\nCompared to the first game this one is 10 times better. It's longer, there's more side quests (not that many though) and there's tons of little things to explore that add up to the lore of the game a little bit. I still haven't collected all the little things in the game or checked out the other game modes but I will soon enough :)\nGraphics are extremely good and the game is well optimized. They even added DirectX 12 support as of today which does absolutely nothing to my performance but whatever, it might work wonders for others lol.\n\nOverall this is a very solid game and great port.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/391220/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","The reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise in 2013 was met with pretty much universal acclaim from critics and general users alike. It was a fresh take on the series which really focussed on Lara’s origins and gave her a very real personality. The gameplay was overhauled too, and the story was intriguing to follow. So it was a very tough act to follow.\n\nI was hyped about this sequel, and will open this review by saying I felt Rise of the Tomb Raider lived up to this hype. If I may be so bold, I may even go so far as to say I enjoyed ROTTR more than Tomb Raider (2013).\n\nSo ROTTR takes off after the previous game and explores the circumstances surround the death of Lara’s father. The overarching story is about Lara’s quest for the key to immortality and involved exploring, or ahem, raiding ruins in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nI felt the story had more depth to it in ROTTR. It felt grander, bigger and just more of a journey. Core elements of the game from the previous game had been conserved, though I felt there was a greater emphasis on crafting in ROTTR. Difficulty wise, they’re both about the same. I enjoyed the additions to gear that provided new ways to traverse terrain in this game. I felt they added to the skill level required with the game as one is mixing up different button combinations.\n\nVisually, ROTTR was gorgeous. Perhaps. one of the better looking games of it’s generation, and  this is to be expected as we could say the same for Tomb Raider (2013). I think what the dev team did with this is take what made the previous game so successful and just add to it.\n\nMy big gripe at this point in time is with optimisation. At my first playthrough, before writing this review, My system was running Crossfired R9 290X, i7 4790k, 16GB RAM, game installed to SSD, and my frame rates weren’t particularly at amazing playing on high (though not Very high) settings at 1440p. I understand this is an NVIDIA title so perhaps that has something to do with it. At the time of writing, AMD is yet to push out it’s optimisation driver for this game so perhaps that has something to do with it. The open world regions would drop my frame rates to about the 30FPS mark, but most other regions seemed to hang around 50-60FPS mark, so a mixed bag overall. It wasn’t unplayable by any means, and the gameplay and story were enough to keep me going, but I expected better.\n\nHowever, ROTTR has strengths in most other categories. There’s a great mix of fast paced action and slow paced head scratching puzzles, which really contributes to the scope of this game. The combat is good, standard third person shooter tactics. The bow is an excellent weapon which is utilised well in the game, both for combat and navigation. The stealth combat was one of my favourite aspects. A lot of emphasis is put on this, and I felt it was mostly well executed. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of water based stealth kills, as well as death from above and just general sneaking behind an enemy to kill them. Really good.\n\nThe world building was top notch. Exploring the lore, through artefacts and journals really added to the story and the settings were beautifully designed. I am a fan of how it was not homogenous at all, with a good variety of settings and colours. One part of the game you’re exploring sandy Syria, later you’re in the snowy tundra of Siberia, and then you explore caves, ruins, mountains.\n\nAudio is fine. Ambient sounds were appropriate, voice acting was as you would expect from a modern AAA title. Controls were fine, I played with Keyboard/mouse. There was the odd time when I experienced some lag in controls, but I put that down to the same issues as frame rate as discussed earlier. But it wasn’t game breaking.\n\nOverall, some irksome optimisation issues for AMD users, but a good story, lovely to look at and just fun, engaging gameplay. ROTTR took the successes from it’s predecessor and for the most part expanded on them. Recommended.","February 19","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The "replay a mission" mode is very boring and the card system that integrates with it is very lack luster.\n\nAs for the DLC, I honestly can't believe they are selling "hardcore 1 death mode" for $10.99. There are essentially no good DLC items for this game, no good multiplayer (Gears of war style hordes, death matches, coop missions like GTA 5, etc)..\n\nProbably my biggest gripe with the game is that it's $70 for a game you'll finish in 10 hours with no replayability!","February 8","true","15.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A strong story with an old school iconic gaming character that still lives up to her name.  The developers have done good for the most part and have released the games third patch already this week fixing a lot of issues and bugs etc that players are experiencing.  It's nice that this game launched as strongly as it did even though it does have it's share of some mild FPS issues.  I think both graphics and gameplay rock in this one.

The graphics are absolutely amazing and the game is very well optimised (the port was done by Nixxes, these guys rock). There is a lot of content here as well. After 16 hours I finished the main story and I'm still at only 78% with lots of collectibles and tombs to find.

The visuals are absolutely stunning, and the snowy landscapes are often breathtaking.\n\nThe gameplay is more refined, offering satisfying gunplay, traversal and exploring. The skill/level system is very familiar from the 2013 game, but it's more in-depth and offers are greater variety of choices and upgrades for weapons and skills this time around. You can also craft different clothes, which is a nice touch.\n\nStory wise it's more complex and interesting than Lara's "first" adventure. The lenght of the game is perfect and if you want to aim towards a 100% completion, you'll have over 25+ hours worth of gaming time ahead of you.\n\nHigly recommended.

The game is much like the first in that it is a 3rd person shooter with RPG and platforming elements in the gameplay. Not to much has changed between the the 2013 remake and this new one with the exception of a few new added gadgets. These gadgets whether it be the rope, fire or explosive arrows are unlocked over time to both further progress the story along with allow you to be able to go back through various parts of Siberia in order to do a full unlock of the game.\n\nThe platforming of the game is much better than the first remake in that there aren't any silly bugs that cause you to miss your jumps or camera angles that through your jumps off. They also toned down on the quick time events, allowing for more player interaction during the game itself instead of an interactive movie. Also a return was the on the fly crafting system that allows you to craft explosives and ammunition for various weapons much like that of Last of Us. It is a pretty simple system that doesn't require too much resources to craft. I never really ran out of any crafting materials except when I needed to upgrade my weapons and equipment. Those were a little more difficult to get however that said you could get most of them by just running around the maps and hunting the different animals and supply caches.\n\nI would also like to mention though the gameplay was fun, it wasn't all that challenging, at least on the Tomb Raider difficulty. It might be a little more difficult on survivor mode but I can't see it being all that much more difficult as sneaking around, distracting your enemies with thrown bottles among other things made it incredibly easy to kill them and not get caught. But difficulty is never a requirement to make a game fun, as I said I enjoyed playing the game even though it might have only took me 23 hours to 100% it including all the hidden items.\n\nOne year after the events of Tomb Raider (2013), Lara is searching for answers for what happened on the island Yamatai and is looking to her father's research when she comes across what events pushed her father to the edge of “suicide”. She comes across him referencing the city of the Prophet, Kitezh and the Divine Source, some mystical artifact that supposedly gives those that find it immortal life. In pursuit of this artifact a secret organization of God called Trinity is also chasing it and killing all who oppose them or don't follow their beliefs. It ends up being a race to who can get to the Divine Source first. Overall the Story isn't anything special but the characters are interesting enough and it had enough to drive the game overall, making me want to find out more. What added a lot to the story, and I feel like a lot of people don't bother with it, is the various lore you find from the Mongolians that invaded the city first, the Greeks that followed after, the soviets that controlled Siberia looking for the city and Trinity themselves in their recorded messages. It was those subtle codex items that added a lot to the overall story and history behind Kitezh and the Prophet.\n\nI want to touch on something that it seems like I constantly see people complaining about Lara being a killing machine and don't seem to understand what drove her to do that in both games. Since these are both reboots we won't talk about the fact that in the games before she was a killing machine, we'll just focus on these two new games as their own series. In the first game there was no mysterious force chasing Lara and her expedition team, they were already on the island, that said she was already starting to be broken emotionally from leading her team into the Dragon's Triangle and marooning them on a deadly island. Once she found out a force of mercenaries were capturing and killing her friends she saw it as time for vengeance especially after she was almost ♥♥♥♥♥ and killed herself before she killed her first person. You could even see her progression through the game where she accepted who she was and what she had to do to stop those that were there to harm her and her friends. All that even led to this pretty often screen capped photo in game where, in my opinion, shows that she has lost what made her human.\n\nIn the new game it is much the same but this time she knows what Trinity is after and knows that they were the one that defamed her father that led to his death. On top of that she meets a new group of people that have lived near and defended the city of Kitezh for thousands of years. A people that she wanted to protect from Trinity. Lara may have a murderous tendency but it isn't without reason. Some would argue that she should be more likely to sneak around and avoid killing and Nathan Drake (of the Uncharted series) is more prone to killing. I disagree with that and argue that it is the complete opposite. A lot of times Drake has no reason to kill, he is a thief that doesn't really have a play in most of these enemy forces, he just happens upon them. I will take the exception of Uncharted 2 where they attack the villagers in Nepal but that wasn't until ¾ through the game.\n\nThis game is one of the most beautiful games I've seen, from the scenery all the way up to the particle physics and  facial animations. Crystal Dynamics did a fantastic job of making every little detail pop out and all while having it run great (at least on my PC, I've heard of others having problems but I didn't – 5820k, 780ti, 16g ddr4). I really noticed when Lara or other characters had looks on their faces, so the voice actors didn't have to sell the emotions as much, you could definitely see them. There are so many great screenshot moments in this game I don't really want to bombard you with all the pics I took while playing but to say the least some of the most talented screenshot takers are taking some of the most amazing photos (I have one friend that is very talented at this, but if any of y'all have some impressive photos feel free to put them in the comments below, I'd love to see them).\n\nOn to the sound too, the music really sets the tone and has a similar composition of the 2013 remake which was great in its own right but makes this game really feel like a continuation of a series. The voice actors are also really on their game and make the characters believable especially since a lot of game developers use motion cameras to capture even the voice actors as they are playing the role.\n\nOverall this game is fantastic continuation from the reboot that started in 2013, though I did 100% it in about 23 hours there is a lot of other content including endurance, score attack and if you decide to spend the money the DLC that is coming with season pass. Maybe not as much of a replay-ability as say an MMO or giant RPGs but definitely a great bang for your buck especially if you can find a sale for it at $40 like I did. The Graphics, Gameplay, Story and sound are all top notch with the only blemish might be not as strong story as some others but still very solid.\n\nStory – 8\nGameplay – 8\nGraphics – 10\nSound – 10\nFun – 9\nReplay Value - 6","February 12","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's all up to you.\nYour Weapons can also be upgraded, in the same way as your character.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Maybe because I have a huge thing for British girls.

On the higher difficulties it's actually a challenge now, the firefights are very strategic and satisfying and plenty of tombs to uncover. Be warned though it's like Crysis, you need an incredibly powerful rig to run it once you get to the lost city stages. My frame rate on an r290 fluctuates wildly from 60fps down to the teens on the high setting and tessellation set to 8x in crimson control panel, playing only 1080p. This is with the latest beta driver. I thoroughly disagree with the reviewers who say there's not much difference between the quality settings, there is a gulf. If you have the rig to run this congrats, I thought meeting the recommended specs was enough but it's sadly not at least on AMD. A g-sync or free-sync monitor is recommended to address the frame rate fluctuations. I am hoping they can add further optimisations to the frame rate because it really struggles in parts. Can consume up to 7gb of video ram on highest texture settings, even on high it's saturated my r290 4GB buffer. But boy it can look beautiful.\n\nUpdate: I have updated this section now that I have tested the latest AMD Driver 15.3.1 and the new Patch which both support DirectX 12. This game is incredibly single core heavy in DirectX 11 mode, even an overclocked FX processor (my 8320 is running @ 4.7Ghz) is not fast enough to smoothly run this game. However with the DirectX12 support now added, the game spreads the load evenly across all the cores eliminating the large frame rate fluctuations. Coupled with AMD's optimisations and the game can easily hold 50fps just about all the time and closes in on the golden 60fps on the default High game setting at 1080p. There are still a few demanding areas but these drop to the 40s instead of the teens now so they aren't are noticable unless you are looking for them.\n\nThe future of AMD and DirectX 12 looks quite rosy ;)","February 3","true","48.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

It certainly didn't let me down the graphics visually are stunning in my opinion, they have kept lots of the survival elements, and the siberian mountains (wilderness) setting is perfect. The storyline is packed with action and adventure and theres nothing more satisfying than a long range headshot with the bow and arrow. It has a very simple and easy upgrade system and provides lots of interesting challenge tombs and interesting side missions which give you bonus such as lockpicking.\n\nSo if you're looking for an action/adventure with survival and crafting elements, and enjoy stunning visuals in the heart of the siberian wilderness then this game is for you! Also made by square enix so I guess they are doing something right!\n\n9.5/10 - Visions","March 19","true","7.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/391220/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","The reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise in 2013 was met with pretty much universal acclaim from critics and general users alike. It was a fresh take on the series which really focussed on Lara’s origins and gave her a very real personality. The gameplay was overhauled too, and the story was intriguing to follow. So it was a very tough act to follow.\n\nI was hyped about this sequel, and will open this review by saying I felt Rise of the Tomb Raider lived up to this hype. If I may be so bold, I may even go so far as to say I enjoyed ROTTR more than Tomb Raider (2013).\n\nSo ROTTR takes off after the previous game and explores the circumstances surround the death of Lara’s father. The overarching story is about Lara’s quest for the key to immortality and involved exploring, or ahem, raiding ruins in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nI felt the story had more depth to it in ROTTR. It felt grander, bigger and just more of a journey. Core elements of the game from the previous game had been conserved, though I felt there was a greater emphasis on crafting in ROTTR. Difficulty wise, they’re both about the same. I enjoyed the additions to gear that provided new ways to traverse terrain in this game. I felt they added to the skill level required with the game as one is mixing up different button combinations.\n\nVisually, ROTTR was gorgeous. Perhaps. one of the better looking games of it’s generation, and  this is to be expected as we could say the same for Tomb Raider (2013). I think what the dev team did with this is take what made the previous game so successful and just add to it.\n\nMy big gripe at this point in time is with optimisation. At my first playthrough, before writing this review, My system was running Crossfired R9 290X, i7 4790k, 16GB RAM, game installed to SSD, and my frame rates weren’t particularly at amazing playing on high (though not Very high) settings at 1440p. I understand this is an NVIDIA title so perhaps that has something to do with it. At the time of writing, AMD is yet to push out it’s optimisation driver for this game so perhaps that has something to do with it. The open world regions would drop my frame rates to about the 30FPS mark, but most other regions seemed to hang around 50-60FPS mark, so a mixed bag overall. It wasn’t unplayable by any means, and the gameplay and story were enough to keep me going, but I expected better.\n\nHowever, ROTTR has strengths in most other categories. There’s a great mix of fast paced action and slow paced head scratching puzzles, which really contributes to the scope of this game. The combat is good, standard third person shooter tactics. The bow is an excellent weapon which is utilised well in the game, both for combat and navigation. The stealth combat was one of my favourite aspects. A lot of emphasis is put on this, and I felt it was mostly well executed. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of water based stealth kills, as well as death from above and just general sneaking behind an enemy to kill them. Really good.\n\nThe world building was top notch. Exploring the lore, through artefacts and journals really added to the story and the settings were beautifully designed. I am a fan of how it was not homogenous at all, with a good variety of settings and colours. One part of the game you’re exploring sandy Syria, later you’re in the snowy tundra of Siberia, and then you explore caves, ruins, mountains.\n\nAudio is fine. Ambient sounds were appropriate, voice acting was as you would expect from a modern AAA title. Controls were fine, I played with Keyboard/mouse. There was the odd time when I experienced some lag in controls, but I put that down to the same issues as frame rate as discussed earlier. But it wasn’t game breaking.\n\nOverall, some irksome optimisation issues for AMD users, but a good story, lovely to look at and just fun, engaging gameplay. ROTTR took the successes from it’s predecessor and for the most part expanded on them. Recommended.","February 19","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It’s made me reflect on the incredible veracity that modern mo-cap technology can bring to games, and how that now genuinely predicates a need for good casting and quality acting (the Big Bad in this one was brilliant). It’s made me cringe and cheer alternately at its plot developments. It’s tired me with its technical brilliance, worn me down with its approachability, and pacified me with its onion layers of choices and systems. Eventually, it made me want to play it when I wasn’t playing it, and not stop when I was. And finally, it took me on a proper ride, away from work and stress and stupid obligations and into a world of adventure, and for that I shall always remember it with a smile.\n\n(Read more at our friendly gaming blog: http://www.xp4t.com/review-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/ :)","February 22","true","47.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Was mostly bored and looking for something different from what I normaly play. Though I quikly fell in love with the game, looks amazing, and I run it smoothly at 60fps on Ultra settings, though I set texture quality down to High. (Think there where a unsignifisance moment, like during a cut scene, where the fps dropped slightly). The camera feels very smooth and I never felt it pointed in a way that was anoying or where I missed out on anything important which a lot of 3D platformers absolutely fail at.\n\nExcellent character development, the antagonists have motives for, and raelly seem to belive in what they are doing. I also wanted the best possible outcome for the protagonist and that there was a sense of that what the protagonist goes through has a impact on who she is to become. It really felt like what she went through mattered. And this is something a lot of games and movies fail at. If a character dies or are hurt I couldn't really care less. I still think Crystal Dynamic have to tread carefully here. Watched a playthrough of the Tomb Raider (2013) on YouTube. And the only character I really felt anything for when they died was Roth. Theres something similar happening in RotTR but going deeply into to it would spoil a major plot twist. In the end, if we care about characters that die, we would understand the protagonist more and really get the feeling that we too want revenge.\n\nDuring the game you will be able to craft equipment and ammo by collecting resources. You can also use the resources to upgrade your weapons. I never felt that I had to get better equipment or upgrade my weapons more to progress in the game, they where just nice upgrades that can be tailored to each individuals playstyle. The same really goes for the skills in the game. As you kill things, collect resources, discover hidden staches, complete challenges and explore tombs you get XP and the more XP you get the more skills you can unlock. Again I never felt like I needed anything in particular to be able to progress and thus I never felt that the game was grindy.\n\nFinally but not least the tombs. Starting off early the tombs are quiet easy and get more dificult as you progress. Though most tombs are optional. Most tombs has a puzzle you have to solve before you can get to the end and get the reward. They certainly are entertaining though on a very few ocations I felt there wasn't really enough clues as to what I was supposed to do, but I figured them out eventually. I also feel like most tombs involved using ropes in some way or another.\n\nIf you would like to see some gameplay of the game I would like to refer to my Lets Play videos on YouTube.\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UgKC3wvF3yI\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/WBDw0bAHe-o\n\nMy Lets Play videos contain no spoilers of the story.\n\nFantastic game!

Or the inability to use any of the enemies weapons, even though their ammo is perfectly useful for the weapons you do get, again when you have shown you are worthy.

The boss battles executed differently but it felt like the same action ending and it bugs me.\n\nWas it worth the $40 I paid for it?  16.3 hours to complete the main story with minor deviations to break up a speed run and kinda explore so yeah? I guess? I have a bit of animosity because of the ending but I think I can get over it. The graphics were amazing, the glacier as a back drop to some cold tundra and muddy living areas was pretty stellar. The audio drew me into the game like none other. When ♥♥♥♥ started breaking under you as you're running across certain things the sound was impressive, scary. The gameplay was what I expected, action adventure game with a bit of RPG elements (perks/weapon upgrades). The story was kinda meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It was kinda campy on the eternal life bit just seems like thats all that comes out of archaeologist fantasy.\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nAudio - 10/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 5/10","February 6","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, this is more of the same - or rather more of the good things of the reboot. Less QTE's, more tombs and caves and exploration. Still some silly problems with bining keys to mouse on PC. It shows to press the [] button for various actions, but if you have two thumbbuttons used - you won't know which ones until you tried - and most likely died a few times.\n\nThe story is slightly tighter this time around, more focused - and that is both good and bad. If you're a completionist than it will feel like you leave people to die to be able to go off the beaten path to explore and find treasure. You also have to leave certain tombs and treasures behind since you will lack certain gear and features that you lock up later on in the story line.\n\nThe expeditions are fun DLC and really should come in more flavours since this is what most will be doing after they beat the game - or well only be doing since this is the real challenge.\n\nThe game has some technical flaws and hickups. There is a hguge FPS drop in expeditions that occurs with a few minutes regualr intervention that makes it feel like something is going on that shouldn't be happening. The single player part runs with most things on on my spec flawlessly. I don't use occular and lens flaires and depth of field - but other than that - I have most things on except the hair. And I have a steady 80-110 FPS regardless of fights in firelit places.\nGameplay issues range from minor nitpicks as to how the camera works and you have little control meaning that forward moves your character sideways end vice versa in some parts of the game. Sometimes you can't see where you are going, meaning that you have to die to your death hoping you are on the right track and then redo some climbing/jumping routines - I had rather seen more difficult pathfinding as an obstacle than the camera itself as your biggest problem.\n\nHopefully coming patches will make the expeditions better optimized since that is really something nice - oh and that's were most of your pre-order and DLC extras will come into play.\n\nThe card system is to beef out and tweak your expeditions adventures.\n\nEDIT notes: after finishing the game and Baba Yaga DLC.\nSo, the game is ended and for that I have to give cred. I don't finish all my games but this one I did. The game gets slightly tedious at the end, trying to sweep the areas looking for missing documents, loot and item chests. But all in all - a nice game. Baba Yaga wasn't a hit though - if you think you're missing out due to this one - rest easy - it is not worth the time. I got a bit disapointed here with the season pass so far. Hopefully something that adds to replayability will come out because I have no intention of playing this again on other difficulties etc. In the end, you do get more of the tedious fights from the first game. This time around it is easier to either sneak past - or have some cat and mouse game out of the fights - but still, a few too many to my liking.","February 1","true","32.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It’s made me reflect on the incredible veracity that modern mo-cap technology can bring to games, and how that now genuinely predicates a need for good casting and quality acting (the Big Bad in this one was brilliant). It’s made me cringe and cheer alternately at its plot developments. It’s tired me with its technical brilliance, worn me down with its approachability, and pacified me with its onion layers of choices and systems. Eventually, it made me want to play it when I wasn’t playing it, and not stop when I was. And finally, it took me on a proper ride, away from work and stress and stupid obligations and into a world of adventure, and for that I shall always remember it with a smile.\n\n(Read more at our friendly gaming blog: http://www.xp4t.com/review-rise-of-the-tomb-raider/ :)","February 22","true","47.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Was mostly bored and looking for something different from what I normaly play. Though I quikly fell in love with the game, looks amazing, and I run it smoothly at 60fps on Ultra settings, though I set texture quality down to High. (Think there where a unsignifisance moment, like during a cut scene, where the fps dropped slightly). The camera feels very smooth and I never felt it pointed in a way that was anoying or where I missed out on anything important which a lot of 3D platformers absolutely fail at.\n\nExcellent character development, the antagonists have motives for, and raelly seem to belive in what they are doing. I also wanted the best possible outcome for the protagonist and that there was a sense of that what the protagonist goes through has a impact on who she is to become. It really felt like what she went through mattered. And this is something a lot of games and movies fail at. If a character dies or are hurt I couldn't really care less. I still think Crystal Dynamic have to tread carefully here. Watched a playthrough of the Tomb Raider (2013) on YouTube. And the only character I really felt anything for when they died was Roth. Theres something similar happening in RotTR but going deeply into to it would spoil a major plot twist. In the end, if we care about characters that die, we would understand the protagonist more and really get the feeling that we too want revenge.\n\nDuring the game you will be able to craft equipment and ammo by collecting resources. You can also use the resources to upgrade your weapons. I never felt that I had to get better equipment or upgrade my weapons more to progress in the game, they where just nice upgrades that can be tailored to each individuals playstyle. The same really goes for the skills in the game. As you kill things, collect resources, discover hidden staches, complete challenges and explore tombs you get XP and the more XP you get the more skills you can unlock. Again I never felt like I needed anything in particular to be able to progress and thus I never felt that the game was grindy.\n\nFinally but not least the tombs. Starting off early the tombs are quiet easy and get more dificult as you progress. Though most tombs are optional. Most tombs has a puzzle you have to solve before you can get to the end and get the reward. They certainly are entertaining though on a very few ocations I felt there wasn't really enough clues as to what I was supposed to do, but I figured them out eventually. I also feel like most tombs involved using ropes in some way or another.\n\nIf you would like to see some gameplay of the game I would like to refer to my Lets Play videos on YouTube.\nPart 1: https://youtu.be/UgKC3wvF3yI\nPart 2: https://youtu.be/WBDw0bAHe-o\n\nMy Lets Play videos contain no spoilers of the story.\n\nFantastic game!

It certainly didn't let me down the graphics visually are stunning in my opinion, they have kept lots of the survival elements, and the siberian mountains (wilderness) setting is perfect. The storyline is packed with action and adventure and theres nothing more satisfying than a long range headshot with the bow and arrow. It has a very simple and easy upgrade system and provides lots of interesting challenge tombs and interesting side missions which give you bonus such as lockpicking.\n\nSo if you're looking for an action/adventure with survival and crafting elements, and enjoy stunning visuals in the heart of the siberian wilderness then this game is for you!

When I finished, I had completed roughly 70% of the content.  I missed a few of the tombs, but saw enough to know what they were like, and some of the weapon components.\n\nAll in all, this was a solid game, but not something I would recommend buying at full price for two reasons: 1) There isn't all that much gameplay to be had and 2) Though it's well done, there's nothing life-changing here.  The most I'd pay, if I could do it again, is 40 dollars.\n\nThis is a nonexhaustive review, I listed the things that I've most commonly seen commented on and anything that jumped out at me.\n\nTLDR: Good graphics, but mundane setting.  Decent story, but a bit short.  Average overall mechanics (crafting, combat).  Enjoyed my time played, but less than the former title.  Though i recommend it, I would not pay more than 40 dollars.\n\nPros:\n\n- Graphics.  The graphics are extremely well done.  There is a lot of polish, nothing too clunky (the occasional visual glitch)\n\n- Tombs.  Tombs were pretty solid; simple enough that they wouldn't totally frustrate you, but not so mindlessly easy that they had no value.\n\n- Story.  This would probably be more appropriately listed in the "neutral" category.  I didn't find the story particularly thrilling.  It was extremely straightforward, there were not any exciting twists.  However, it was good enough to keep me playing and did not detract from my experience at all.  Given that I wanted to see how it ended, even though the end was predictable, I suppose I have to consider it a "pro".  Though, I'll finish a terrible book just to validate my own opinion, so this might not be a legitimate criterion to use.\n\nNeutral:\n\n- I found the gathering/crafting to be fairly mundane.  There are a lot of different supplies to collect throughout your journey, but all recipes are standard: X, Y, Z, press button, new item.  It did not detract from my experience, but - other than the weapons - it did not add much either.  Given that the crafting felt like an afterthought, the game could have benefitted from fewer crafting components (I cannot believe I'm typing this).  I spent a fair amount of time collecting things and killing random animals, but still could not craft a lot of items because I was frequently missing a component.  Again, this did not hurt the experience, but it did not improve it either; it's possible I would have felt a greater sense of achievement if I were able to craft some of the items more easily.  Either way, it probably does not really matter.\n\n- Combat was average to me.  I have read a lot of reviews that think it was better than the last Tomb Raider, but I don't understand why.  The combat itself played the same, with a few minor changes.  There was significantly less of it, which seems to be why people prefer combat in this game more than in the last.  The reason I disliked it is because it was so damn scripted.  Maybe a tomb raider game shouldn't have a lot of combat, but the reduction resulted in a gameplay style of: explore for awhile, cut scene, scripted encounter; explore for awhile, cut scene, scripted encounter.  For me, it felt entirely too forced.\n\nCons:\n\n- The setting.  Graphically, I found the game mesmerizing.  Unfortunately, the setting rarely gives the graphical depth a chance to shine.  Most of your time is spent in a colorless, snowy scenery.  Don't get me wrong, I love the snow, but there are only so many shades of white before it all just looks the same.  When I finally made it to a setting with color, I was blown away.  Sadly, very little of your time is spent in areas where the graphics truly get to show off.\n\n- Linear.  This might not be the best way to describe this, because there is definitely room for exploration.  However, much of this game just felt too linearly scripted for me.  You frequently bump into "gates" (ie haven't unlocked an item that you gain access to later) that break up immersion.  Initially, it did not bother me much.  I figured, "well, that's realistic, I guess".  Unfortunately, it happened so frequently while I randomly explored that eventually it dissuaded me from continuing to explore.  Not necessarily the game's fault as some of that is of my own volition.  The game doesn't do itself any favors in this category, though.","March 14","true","12.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","3"

A modest sequel and a refinement of Tomb Raider formula, a formula I had a lot of fun revisiting. There are new areas to explore, plenty of side activities to do, myriad of things to collect, and a new group of enemies ready to be headshotted. There is also a brand new story, this time centering around the Divine Source, mythical artefact that supposedly can grant eternal life.\n\nOptional tombs were also improved. They are more memorable, make much more sense in the game world, and no longer award you with experience points but rather teach Lara new abilities. It was a joy to find and clear them all.\n\nMultiplayer was thankfully neutered and replaced by Expeditions - new set of modes, allowing you to replay chapters, play score-attack or return to hub areas with new objectives - all while competing with other players on leaderboards. I'm also happy to report that ridiculously brutal death scenes have been seriously toned down.\n\nMy biggest problem with RoTR is that it is too similar to its predecessor. On the next instalment (and I'm sure there will be one) I'd like some serious game play changes and not just a paint job.","March 25","true","31.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inlimuniter/recommended/391220/","inlimuniter","inlimuniter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inlimuniter/","245 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider improves on its predecessor in almost every way. Tomb Raider's evolution from a third-person adventure/platform/puzzle game to a slickly produced third-person action shooter with less focus on platforming and puzzles continues here.\n\nVisuals + Performance\nThis is one the prettiest games I've ever played. The facial and body animations are simply amazing. The reflections, textures, lighting effects and details in the environments are absolutely stunning. This is a very high requirement game and as such requires a high end computer if you want to run it at the highest settings and high resolutions. That being said Nixxes made sure to include a very good range of scalable settings. I can run the game on my really quite old system[imgur.com] at mostly high settings and get a very consistent 30fps, 25-45fps if I unlock the framerate. One of the main things affecting framerate and performance in this game is texture quality and if you want to run it on very high textures and get 60fps you need a fast 6GB VRAM card, coupled with a modern CPU and a good amount of fast RAM. Although I have no problem running the game with medium textures which my 2GB VRAM can handle just fine. I would complain about not being able to get 60fps (even lowering settings to the lowest possible settings doesn't really get me a consistent 60fps), but my CPU is just not up to the task so I can't complain really.\n\nThere is an uncanny feeling to it at times. You almost get the feeling of being there next to the people in the game as if it was real to a degree that few other games manage to achieve. Little details such as the footprints you leave in the snow, the way Lara fixes her hair and brushes her hand against walls as she passes them, her breath in the cold Siberian air condensing and Lara's little facial twitches and expressions are just incredible.\n\nSound effects are mostly great. The voice acting from Camilla Luddington is particularly good. She does a great job of delivering Lara's lines with subtlety and emotion. All the bad guys and other characters are quite well voiced too, although some of the writing of the dialogue could be better and is often quite stereotypical.\n\nIt would be remiss of me to not mention some issues. The AA options in the game are not the best and it is hard to get a nice sharp image. There is some slightly ugly issues with textures/objects loading in on distant objects and reflections on water in the distance can look blurry sometimes. Some of the NPCs are not so nicely modelled. Also, there are a good few bugs and glitches that I encountered, not so much that it broke the experience for me, but they are definitely there. I've heard mixed things about how this runs for those with high end systems trying to push the settings to the max, some seem to be able to get a consistent 60fps others seem to suffer from occasional drops.\n\nGameplay\nThe visuals are this game's strength, but I found it to be a highly enjoyable game to play. Although the game is not exactly the hardest game ever made. In fact it's mostly rather easy, even on the highest difficulty mode. That's not to say there is no challenge at all. But if you are looking for a highly challenging difficult game then you may be disappointed.\n\nI do enjoy how they have refined Lara's movement set. They brought back the abilities to run, dive and swim underwater from the older games. Stealth mechanics have been built upon. You can sneak around and watch the enemy in survival instinct to see who is being watched by another bad guy and carefully take out isolated bad guys one at a time. Or you can carefully sneak behind enemies and stab them in the neck or jump on them from up high.\n\nShooting and killing people is largely the same, I enjoyed it in the last game and I enjoy it here. It's not the most complex gameplay in the world but it is a lot of fun. You have a good deal of options to dispose of bad guys this time. You can blow them up with grenade arrows, you can poison them, you can set traps on corpses, you can craft makeshift molotovs or bombs on the go and burn or blow up bad guys to your hearts content.\n\nThere is platforming and puzzle solving, along with finding stuff and upgrading things, to go along with this. You get 9 optional challenge tombs, along with a few extra secret ones. They are definitely an improvement on the ones in 2013 Tomb Raider. They are bigger and a fair bit more challenging to solve. Although they are still not the most challenging puzzles ever made and they don't take a massive amount of time to solve. It's a good step in the right direction, but I would like to see these puzzles being brought into the main story line and not put as optional side things. There is some environmental puzzles to solve to get through the main story line but more would have been welcome.\n\nStory (Slight Spoiler Warning)\nAbout the stereotypical dialogue and writing. I particularly found the main bad guy, Konstantin, to be frequently quite laughable. He's your typical angry guy who wants power and has a personal army of stereotypical bad guys helping him. There's a mystical power type storyline going on here. Lara wants to find it because she wants to prove that her father wasn't a fool chasing after fairy tales, the bad guys want it because they are bad guys. There is a bit of soap opera with Lara's personal relationship with one of the baddies and a whole personal betrayal thing is going on.\n\nI liked Lara's character in this game. I felt that she was very like-able. She's a strong, intelligent, confident but relatable woman on a personal mission to prove something that matters to her. It's just a shame that everybody else around her in this story is so stereotypical and lacking depth. But I felt as I played the game I cared about Lara and what she is doing. The story may be a bit lame but it is done with a lot of style and is a fun ride.\n\nExtra Modes, DLC, and Lasting Appeal\nYou get Score Attack, Chapter Replay/Elite and Remnant Resistance modes as part of the standard game and you get Endurance Mode, Baba Yaga and Cold Darkness Awakens as season pass/individually purchasable DLC modes. Score Attack and Endurance modes are the highlights of these for me. In Score Attack mode you can replay through the missions from the main game with an arcade like score meter and you compete against yourself or friends to try and get the best score possible. You can use up to five cards which you unlock with currency earned from playing the main game. These allow you to make the run either easier or harder. You can have enemies with more armour, or have only one life, or you can change your equipment and so on. Endurance Mode is like a survival mode in an open-ended environment where you have to survive for as long as possible.\n\nThese modes are a lot of fun and give the game a lot more lasting appeal if you enjoy them. Endurance Mode is particularly enjoyable and can be quite challenging. It's a bit of a shame that they don't allow you to alter the main game like you can these modes as that would have made it much more challenging, dynamic and lasting in appeal.\n\nBaba Yaga is overpriced for what it is, only really offering 1-2 hours of gameplay, maybe 4-5 if you really stretch it. I enjoyed it whilst it lasted, but it's really nothing special and I feel likewise about Cold Darkness Awakens.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI like the new Tomb Raider games a lot and am a big fan of this new Lara, I think she's wonderful. But I am also a big fan of old school Lara and do miss her and the way those games were made. It's a little bit of a shame that they don't offer something more substantial to old school Tomb Raider fans such as a skin of old school Lara. More challenge, integrated puzzles, customizability and deeper story/writing would have been nice. But overall this is a great game, I enjoyed it a lot and highly recommend it.","March 29","true","119.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I guess it's because of the heightened expectations of a sequel to what was to me a fantastic first game (TR2013). Another thing that fell flat was the choice of story. I won't spoil it for you but (IMO) it lacked the needed punctuation and the ending had me go 'so what?'. Maybe Crystal Dynamics should have gone left wing and write a more mystical story than the one they used in this game. Some new characters introduced felt one-dimensional. Like Sophia. Her mistrust on Lara at the beginning turned to respect and silent awe like an on/off switch. I also felt that the antagonists were designed in the same vein.\n\nApart from that, whatever that was good was carried over from the previous game to Rise of the Tomb Raider. Graphics were great and gameplay stayed true to the original. However, I felt that level design was dumbed down a bit.\n\nThe RPG mechanics were good. In a way that I could level up Lara's skills based on how I played and never had to feel like I wasted a point. At about 80% through, I felt like I could get away without upgrading any more Skills but did so anyway so I could kill some baddies in a different way. But the game wasn't long enough to allow me to try new ways of killing/ambush once I got the skill upgraded.\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game a 7.5/10. Lara's still the girl we know and love. But this seemingly MOST important quest she's on is a tad boring.","March 2","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

The gameplay and mechanics are mostly the same, with minor but well done improvements to the crafting and upgrading gear. My only gripe with the game is the plot. Illuminati plot lines havelong since saturated media, and large chunks of the plot are poorly done and heavy handed. To make it worse, it seems they've chosen to tie this directly into the plot of all future installments.","February 20","true","39.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

And I can safely say that the people at Crystal Dynamics have succeeded in this endeavor. Rise of the Tomb Raider is just as good as its predecesor, if not better.\nIn this new adventure we follow Lara as she tries to clean her father's name. The story is filled with fantasy and adventure, and is supported by the usual document collectibles that you find throughout the game. Learning how people felt and how they survived is a thrilling journey that will make you want to find all of them so you can learn the whole story.\nFrom the gameplay point of view, there are no complaints what so ever. It is as good as the previous game and there are some new mechanics that make it compelling to go back to previous areas just to kill some enemies in various creative ways. And also there's the threat of nature, as wild animals will fight you as you trespass into their natural habitat. Everything feels smooth and not forced upon you, and this is rare to find in a AAA game these days.\nNow, from the graphical point of view, let me say that if you assume you can run this game with a rig that could manage the previous one, then you are mistaken. The environments look gorgeous and every detail is breath taking. But if your PC is not prepared for a highly demanding game, then you won't be able to enjoy said environments because you will barely be able to run the game. Specially if your graphics card is AMD. The folks at NVIDIA made sure that any AMD user that plays this game does not get to enjoy it at its full capacity. The optimization is terrible, and even the newest AMD cards can't handle some of these options without dropping frames like hot potatoes. Be aware before you buy this game: you need a powerful processor, lots of RAM and an NVIDIA graphics card to play it without DPS issues. You can still play it with an AMD card just fine if you don't care about the sudden frame drops in big places and the occasional crash. That's about the only negative thing I have to say about this game. And it seems to be happening with every game powered by NVIDIA these days. It's annoying as hell.\nTL;DR: This game is amazing in every aspect except its graphical optimization. If you can run it, buy it. You won't regret it.","March 6","true","31.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Some features (Like the crafting throwables) felt tacked on, not really fun to play with and littered the playing field with rubish. Overall, some plus and minus which leads to a slight improvement imo.\n\nBiggest let down is the story. First one is fantastic where Lara is shown, sorta a damsel in distress at the start. As the story progresses, Lara was shown gradual transformation by surviving life threatening events and some very rude awakenings. One of the best part of the first reboot is the almost at the end where Lara has become such a badass her mere presence sent her enemies scampering and she was shouting, intimidating and taunting them.\n\nOn the sequel? Not so much. It tries to create drama on her relationship with her dad yet it rarely show ANYTHING about her direct interaction with him. Very few dad/daughter scene and we were asked to just take it in faith that she's driven by her dad's past. Right. And the ending? ugh........ I was expecting more from the team.\n\nAnother minus is that I beat this game in 12 hours in hard mode :(\n\nI still enjoyed the game though, so take this recommendation with a grain of salt.","March 5","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Fortunately, it was a good one, with enhanced graphics and thrilling story. Developers went even further and gave us in this title also exploration and survival challenges in harsh Siberian nature. Game, what may calmly aspire to the Game-of-the-Year title. Lets see in detail, what went good and what might be better.\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\n+ Respect to tradition\n+ Thrilling story\n+ New platforms and puzzles\n+ Good locations allowing non-linear gameplay\n+ Exploration possibility\n+ Completable achievements\n+ DLC serve their purpose, purchasable with in-game earned credits\n+ RPG elements and multiple tactics\no nVidia cooperation\n- Sometime controls are clunky\n- Game is less intuitive\n\nIt is always hard to release a title in such famous series as Tomb Raider. Developers from Crystal Dynamics succeeded to give us a stunning story and yet perserve the spirit of previous titles. Furthermore, we can see, how it all begun, de facto, it is a restart of the whole serie.\n\nRotTR respects platform and puzzle presency and incorporates them well. This features present challenges, without them it would not be possible to enjoy this title. There simply have to be traps in tombs, but they are spottable and you have to try a bit to solve them, after that, the player is rewared with success.\n\nWhat is also positive, that the gameplay is non-linear, gives the player possibility to explore and set own tempo in progressing the game. It is underlined with human vs. nature challenge, your enemies are also beasts and harsh nature, yet resources for weapons, equipment and crafting are taken from vasts of Syria and Siberia.\n\nRPG elements are a great addition, you have three skill trees - Brawler (melee), Hunter (long-range), Survivor (hunting and endurance), which allows you choose your best tactics from plenty available.\n\nAchievements are completable and they serve as another motivation to play the game and advance your limits higher. Here we also go to some negatives.\n\nControls are sometimes clunky and game should be more intuitive and correct minor deviations. E. g. you are facing milimeter to the side, you will fall and challenge might be broken or not completed.\n\nCooperation with nVidia was a perfect idea, game runs with an amazing graphic, but sometimes Steam and graphic overlay were causing unexpected crashes of the game. This should be temporary, so far disabling of this feature helps.\n\n\nCHARACTERS\n\n+ Lara Croft\n+ Jonah\n+ Jacob\n+ Sofia\n+ Constantin\n+ Ana\no Trinity and Remnant Resistance\n\nMany characters are undergoing a huge transformation in the game. Lara was shy and naive in the beginning, after all of her adventures, she became determind and devoted to do the right thing. Jonah serves as an excellent companion. Mots surprising is Jacob. From the chief of Remnant Resistance forces he became the biggest plottwist, which can surprise even after so many stories told from Lara Croft's universe. Not to forget Sofia, who turned from rebel to person, who might lead the whole resistance.\n\nConstantin and Ana were pefrect opponents, even between them struggles occured. What is sad, the rest of both forces were just to add enemies and allies to give the players immersion of something bigger. Little more improvement and it would be unbeatable.\n\nVISUALS\n\n+ Sceneries\n+ Lara's behaviour\n- Minor glitches\n\nSceneries are amazing, either desert Syria or winter Siberia, I could feel the atmosphere in each of my steps. What I like more that after getting from water she did up her hair and when she was cold, she was shivering (not good during the hunt :-D) and holding her arms around her. To sum up this idea, each screenshot might serve as a wallpaper.\n\nThere were several minor glitches, fortunately nothing disturbing, so I did not count them to evaluation.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\n\n+ Fitting to the game\n+ According to the atmospheree\n\nAnother great composer work, songs are changing accordingly, atmosphere is kept in the level, that player is always amazed. Also, change of music sometimes warns you before you actually encounter enemies or beasts.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nTo sum it up, RotTR is a great game, that might catch even players out of this genre (my example), is really customizable and players are able to enjoy it in their own tempo. Story is perfect, enviroment as well, it is up to you, whether you choose to explore or to progress.\n\nIn case you want to examine your survival activites, try Endurance mode, or uncover the truth behind the myth in Baba Yaga. It is up to the players, which tactic they choose and how they do. Challenges are motivating to go even further, replayability is great.\n\nThe prize might be a bit higher (49,99 EUR + 27,99 EUR for Season Pass), but it is completely worthy. Compared to the content and other games, it is really rich in what to offer.\n\nStrongly recommended, and in my humble opinion, perfect aspirant for the Game of the Year.","March 4","true","399.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The story wasn't bland and boring "get loot get out" like I feard it was going to be. I felt there was a purpose. The acting also was on point. I actually felt for the characters, their emotions pulled me in and breathed life into this game.\n\nAnd this game doesn't get boring or repettitive which i feel like most games recently suffer. The large map makes up for the different land scapes. One minute im in a tundra. The next im in a desert. Then into a luscious forest. Plus the bonus dungeons you can explore was the most fun and exciting part in my opinion. I loved discovering a new dungeon to explore and solve puzzles that were actually quite mind boggling at times. Then i get an ACTUAL reward for my hard work. Not some collectible that means zilch (unless you're a collector). No. I got upgrades for an arsenal of weapons.\n\nThe game play was probably my biggest (and pretty much my only complaint) i felt as though the combat was kinda meh. Hide behind cover, pop up, gun down a few baddies, rinse and repeat. And i constantly ran out of ammo in the middle of fights and had to run around like a mad man to collect some more WHILE im being shot at. Coulda been me not being efficient with my ammo, but i felt like there was nothing i could of done to improve that. Not only that, the parkour part of this game where i can run/climb up walls and use rope to scale down the terrain was pretty buggy. There was WAY too many times where i can't climb up a wall cause i wasn't pixel perfect on the climbable part of the wall. Or when i jump to slide down rope onto another platform and i completely miss the rope cause again, i wasn't pixel perfect with the jump.\n\nOverall i thoroughly enjoyed this game. Much more than i did to the first one and i LOVED that game. Easily one of the most fun games i played in years with a breath of fresh air for gameplay and captivating story. I can easily give this game a 9/10 and would recommend to both fans of the series and newcomers!","April 7","true","31.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

The additions don't bring much to it, but don't ruin anything either. The graphics are outstanding and, despite the FPS drops experienced in the larger outdoor areas the game, the engine seems well optimized and makes quality use of the available hardware.\nThe story however is weak and mostly fails in its attempt to mix "The Descent"-inspired aesthetics & violence from the reboot with the kind of cheesy narratives found in the earlier games from the series.\nOnce again, there are not that many Tombs, but what is there is ambitiously executed and a lot of fun to play through.\nA lot of the Expeditions content is disposable, but the Endurance mode DLC is probably the single best way to play the game, so you definitely want to get that.\nOverall it is a very solid game, but as it is overly careful to replicate everything that was good about the previous title, it is somewhat disappointing too.","February 14","true","64.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/recommended/391220/","specialneedsforces","Special Needs Forces","http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/","245 products in account","This game does not give off a good first impression. The beginning is heavily scripted. Walk forwards, watch something bad happen, press X to not die, etc. Follow the linear path, watch the cutscenes. Please, give me gameplay already. Fortunately, after a short attempt to impress players with gee whiz cutscene action, it does start delivering the goods.\n\nThe gameplay mixes platforming, traversal (climbing and the like), combat of both the direct and stealth variety, puzzle solving, and exploration and discovery. There's a lot of good to be found in these elements.\n\nLara's jumping is fluid and fun to control. You can actually aim her jumps a little bit in mid-air, and her climbing is also quite fluid. She can "double jump" up walls, climb trees, launch herself off walls, and can climb icy and rocky walls with her pickaxe. You have a ton of control over these elements, as opposed to the stiff movement of the later Uncharted games, and combining these moves together is a lot of fun.\n\nCombat tends to allow for many options. For example, at one point I was hiding in water and I grabbed an enemy who was unaware, and drowned him. Then I snuck up behind another enemy, strangled him, and then planted a poison gas bomb on his body, then hid. Another enemy examined the corpse, and got a face full of poison gas for his trouble. Three enemies down, still not spotted yet. I knew I was going to have to inevitably fight, so I lit a fire arrow and ignited two enemies at once, and that blew my cover. Well, almost. The enemies started searching for me, and I was able to surprise one more before everyone spotted me and it basically turned into a standard cover shooter at that point.\n\nOne problem, as I see it, is that there's too much open combat in the game that just takes place in linear areas. I think the game is at its best when you have many options at your disposal, but sometimes, you're just forced into standard shooty setpieces before you can move on.\n\nThe level design is a mixture of open areas, and linear setpieces. Open areas are sometimes huge, and loaded with things to do: characters to talk to (such as villagers or rebels in hiding), wild animals hanging around their turf, caves to explore, trees to climb, hidden stuff to find, and your eventual goal that takes you to the next area. These areas are fantastic, and I really wish there were more of them.\n\nThe pacing changes up a lot; sometimes you're progressing through a linear area and fighting through enemies, then you have to climb and move through to the next area, then solve a minor puzzle, and eventually you're out in the open where you're hit with tons of things to do.\n\nSometimes, though, the pacing doesn't quite work out. One area of the game had a village full of people preparing for a huge battle against invaders. There was a lot to do there, and their upcoming battle was played up as if it was going to be epic. I was really excited about the idea of fighting enemies in such a massive, open forest with trees, towers, caves and houses... but when it came time for the battle, it was just a linear cover shooter segment. When it was all over, the villagers were talking about the heavy losses they suffered over the past 10 minutes. I was left thinking, "That's it?!" It could have been epic, but it failed.\n\nYou'll encounter some brutally tough puzzles, many of which are optional (the "challenge tombs"), some of which are required to progress. They involve things like transporting an explosive to its destination, moving a boat around a rapidly flowing river with the help of ropes and pulleys - some puzzles require timing, while others don't.\n\nThe game provides hints in several ways, such as music that changes depending on how close you are to solving the puzzle, remarks Lara makes to herself, and the ability to "examine" things using "survival instincts" (which makes important and interactive things glow, while also revealing objectives).\n\nThere's also tons of hidden secrets to find. The game outright alerts you to nearby "challenge tombs", with the sound of wind chimes playing when you're in their general area. The tombs are essentially multiple puzzles: first you have to find them, then you have to enter them, then you have to solve the puzzle inside. Successfully raiding the tombs earns you special abilities, such as the ability to detect animals' hearts and kill them in one hit if you shoot them there (animals are very nasty and harder to kill than most humans, so this helps a lot in encounters with them).\n\nYou can backtrack to find secrets and hidden things in locations you've been to before, using your new abilities. Any campfire you've previously visited serves as a place to upgrade weapons and spend experience points (obtained via collecting items or killing in special ways) on skills, as well as warp to any previously visited campfire, so you can backtrack that way.\n\nThe skills you can obtain are things like the ability to turn gas cans into bombs, the ability to craft certain kinds of new weapons (such as explosive arrows), and more. Some of these skills really open up your combat options, and there are also special abilities that can be obtained only by completing challenge tombs.\n\nThat said, this game has some things that hold it back quite a bit. A lot of the cover-based combat just feels, to me, mostly like it's just there for the sake of being there, and isn't well thought out, while stealth combat is a lot more fun but doesn't quite go on for as long as I'd like at times. There are scripted moments that are just really unnecessary, but at least it's not as bad as the previous game when it comes to that (save for that awful beginning).\n\nAnd the ending feels rushed and generic. Lots of ghost-like enemies shooting at me with blue fire arrows that are just easier to kill and do way less damage than you'd expect. I felt like I didn't have much opportunity to do much creative fighting, and it just felt like a waste of time. And the final area even goes for that annoying orange/blue color scheme Hollywood is obsessed with (Google it to see what I mean if you haven't noticed that trend already). Indeed, rushed endings are a problem I've noticed in other games I've really enjoyed lately, such as Axiom Verge and Life is Strange. It's like companies just feel the need to make their game end on a big note, but don't know how to do it in a way that paces well.\n\nFinally, and this is more of a mild complaint, enemies can be total morons at times. At one point, I was hiding behind cover, and there was a fire burning next to me. An enemy was walking towards my hiding spot, about to turn the corner to where I was hiding, and he walked right into the fire, ignited, and died seconds later. I've seen other behavior that's not quite that stupid, but still really dumb.\n\nStill, other than some issues with pacing and scripting, overall I think this game is pretty good, and a major improvement over Tomb Raider 2013. If you're looking for an adventure with a lot of different types of gameplay, I'd recommend this one, since I think the good outweighs the bad.\n\n(Finally, ignore my number of hours on record. I tend to leave games running the entire time I do other things)","February 15","true","925.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/391220/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","The reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise in 2013 was met with pretty much universal acclaim from critics and general users alike. It was a fresh take on the series which really focussed on Lara’s origins and gave her a very real personality. The gameplay was overhauled too, and the story was intriguing to follow. So it was a very tough act to follow.\n\nI was hyped about this sequel, and will open this review by saying I felt Rise of the Tomb Raider lived up to this hype. If I may be so bold, I may even go so far as to say I enjoyed ROTTR more than Tomb Raider (2013).\n\nSo ROTTR takes off after the previous game and explores the circumstances surround the death of Lara’s father. The overarching story is about Lara’s quest for the key to immortality and involved exploring, or ahem, raiding ruins in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nI felt the story had more depth to it in ROTTR. It felt grander, bigger and just more of a journey. Core elements of the game from the previous game had been conserved, though I felt there was a greater emphasis on crafting in ROTTR. Difficulty wise, they’re both about the same. I enjoyed the additions to gear that provided new ways to traverse terrain in this game. I felt they added to the skill level required with the game as one is mixing up different button combinations.\n\nVisually, ROTTR was gorgeous. Perhaps. one of the better looking games of it’s generation, and  this is to be expected as we could say the same for Tomb Raider (2013). I think what the dev team did with this is take what made the previous game so successful and just add to it.\n\nMy big gripe at this point in time is with optimisation. At my first playthrough, before writing this review, My system was running Crossfired R9 290X, i7 4790k, 16GB RAM, game installed to SSD, and my frame rates weren’t particularly at amazing playing on high (though not Very high) settings at 1440p. I understand this is an NVIDIA title so perhaps that has something to do with it. At the time of writing, AMD is yet to push out it’s optimisation driver for this game so perhaps that has something to do with it. The open world regions would drop my frame rates to about the 30FPS mark, but most other regions seemed to hang around 50-60FPS mark, so a mixed bag overall. It wasn’t unplayable by any means, and the gameplay and story were enough to keep me going, but I expected better.\n\nHowever, ROTTR has strengths in most other categories. There’s a great mix of fast paced action and slow paced head scratching puzzles, which really contributes to the scope of this game. The combat is good, standard third person shooter tactics. The bow is an excellent weapon which is utilised well in the game, both for combat and navigation. The stealth combat was one of my favourite aspects. A lot of emphasis is put on this, and I felt it was mostly well executed. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of water based stealth kills, as well as death from above and just general sneaking behind an enemy to kill them. Really good.\n\nThe world building was top notch. Exploring the lore, through artefacts and journals really added to the story and the settings were beautifully designed. I am a fan of how it was not homogenous at all, with a good variety of settings and colours. One part of the game you’re exploring sandy Syria, later you’re in the snowy tundra of Siberia, and then you explore caves, ruins, mountains.\n\nAudio is fine. Ambient sounds were appropriate, voice acting was as you would expect from a modern AAA title. Controls were fine, I played with Keyboard/mouse. There was the odd time when I experienced some lag in controls, but I put that down to the same issues as frame rate as discussed earlier. But it wasn’t game breaking.\n\nOverall, some irksome optimisation issues for AMD users, but a good story, lovely to look at and just fun, engaging gameplay. ROTTR took the successes from it’s predecessor and for the most part expanded on them. Recommended.","February 19","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Improves on mostly everything, including a much bigger open area, side quests, much better weapon customization and upgrade trees as well as more options on how to approach combat. As was the case with the previous game, the story had me engaged enough to care about some of the characters but it did have a rather abrupt and disapointing ending which again culminated in a quick time event. I feel like this one was setting up a sequel rather than being it's own standalone thing but i did find some resolution.\n\nLara seems a lot more confident in her abilites this time, with not as much emphasis being put on her constantly falling over and getting caught in traps. She is now quite the capable killer and ruthlessly slaughters hundreds of trained mercenies throughout the campaign. She comes across as a bit cold in certain parts of the game which i wont spoil but she is driven by her father to discover an artifact that drove him to his suicide, which makes her somewhat relentless in her pursuit of an ancient treasure.\n\nI did have some frame drops in big areas on my GTX 970, but the game as a whole did run fairly well. it looks like one of the best games on the PC to date, and it is being patched fairly reguarly so any bugs seem to get fixed rather fast. The game lasted me a lot longer this time, around 300 hours and i still don't have all the collectables. My only gripe is the game is rather easy and only a few badly timed jumps led to my death.\n\nIn a nutshell, if you enjoyed the original game, this is an improvement is basically every respect. Make sure you have a fairly strong rig however or be prepared to lower settings quite a bit.","March 1","true","33.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Never ran out of ammo once entire game\n- Cannot stock throwables\n- There might be memory leak but it might be just me\n\nStory related bs\n-   Someone please explain me what was the purpose of Jonah other than being a damsel in distress for his little bird\n\n-  The main difference between this game and the 2013 one that became a thing back then is in that game adventure and the need of survival found Lara while she was just a normal girl but in this game the story is similar to almost every old Tomb Raider games out there where there's ultra powerful OP artifact that Lara herself goes after and there are always bad people (lara's evil twin, organizations, lara's old friend, lara's new friend, literally anyone who has enough money to create an army of his own etc.)  wanting that for their own reason which is mostly bad because they're bad people,  except Square Enix knew that'd make it too cheesy so they tried to create a relatable character called Konstantin who's doing it all for his dying sister.  Unfortunately he gets killed directly or undirectly by our "hero".  All in all story is not too cheesy but still not as good as the reboot's..\n\n-  Only person we see from the prequel is no one but Jonah. Whatever happened to Sam who we worked our asses off to save in the first game?\n\n-  Both in Uncharted and Tomb Raider games every artifact they try so hard to find always needs to be destroyed because "Humanity isn't ready :'(" . This is why if there's an artifact involved as the key point in a story, almost always lara gets nothing but the shaft in the end but the feeling of "doing the right thing"  making the story more easily predictable.\n\n-  Speaking of the Divine source, at the end Ana opens the golden whatever but while she's gaining her immortality she drops it because uuh? Does she get flashbanged from the shining artifact or what?\n\n-  Deathless= zombie japanese samurais in the first game\n\n\nThis is all I can think of for now. I might edit this after DLCs. All in all, it's a good game for a good price. Go get it\n\n7,5/10","February 4","true","18.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

Sometimes the story skips me ahead while I wasn't particularily done exploring an area and this can get irritating. The camera doesn't always cooperate (and sometimes removes your control to install a sense of amazement when you are nearing a cool structure), and I found that the controls sometimes don't do what I want. The DLC is a bit scummy. You don't really need (most of) it, and the game plays fine without.\n\nWith that said, those are the few critiques I have. Rise of the Tomb Raider is a step up from the previous installment and in general is really fun to play. The price point may be a bit steep at launch but I have confidence that it will go on sale for a 20-er within the year just like Tomb Raider 2013. If you didn't like Tomb Raider 2013, you probably won't like this one either.","February 2","true","21.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Although you'll need a powerhouse rig to run the game anywhere near 60+ fps on max settings, the game is visually gorgeous.\nWith my GTX 780 the game frequently fluctuated from a rare 30 fps to a more often 40-50 fps. Sunken city's and Icy cliff faces really come to life with astounding detail and the character models have also taken a step up with Lara sometimes being on the verge of photorealistic.\nThe gameplay remains much the same as the previous game with weapon upgrades complimenting the gunplay and some quite brutal melee finishing moves. This time around you can also craft weapons from bottles and cans left around the environenment to help in the game arena style battles with enemies.\nMy only gripe is that I didn't enjoy the story as much as the last game, and although the final sections ratchet up the action it still felt like a retread of the original games final section.\nOther than that it's a great game but be wary about the games high requirements.","January 30","true","19.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Well, this is more of the same - or rather more of the good things of the reboot. Less QTE's, more tombs and caves and exploration. Still some silly problems with bining keys to mouse on PC. It shows to press the [] button for various actions, but if you have two thumbbuttons used - you won't know which ones until you tried - and most likely died a few times.\n\nThe story is slightly tighter this time around, more focused - and that is both good and bad. If you're a completionist than it will feel like you leave people to die to be able to go off the beaten path to explore and find treasure. You also have to leave certain tombs and treasures behind since you will lack certain gear and features that you lock up later on in the story line.\n\nThe expeditions are fun DLC and really should come in more flavours since this is what most will be doing after they beat the game - or well only be doing since this is the real challenge.\n\nThe game has some technical flaws and hickups. There is a hguge FPS drop in expeditions that occurs with a few minutes regualr intervention that makes it feel like something is going on that shouldn't be happening. The single player part runs with most things on on my spec flawlessly. I don't use occular and lens flaires and depth of field - but other than that - I have most things on except the hair. And I have a steady 80-110 FPS regardless of fights in firelit places.\nGameplay issues range from minor nitpicks as to how the camera works and you have little control meaning that forward moves your character sideways end vice versa in some parts of the game. Sometimes you can't see where you are going, meaning that you have to die to your death hoping you are on the right track and then redo some climbing/jumping routines - I had rather seen more difficult pathfinding as an obstacle than the camera itself as your biggest problem.\n\nHopefully coming patches will make the expeditions better optimized since that is really something nice - oh and that's were most of your pre-order and DLC extras will come into play.\n\nThe card system is to beef out and tweak your expeditions adventures.\n\nEDIT notes: after finishing the game and Baba Yaga DLC.\nSo, the game is ended and for that I have to give cred. I don't finish all my games but this one I did. The game gets slightly tedious at the end, trying to sweep the areas looking for missing documents, loot and item chests. But all in all - a nice game. Baba Yaga wasn't a hit though - if you think you're missing out due to this one - rest easy - it is not worth the time. I got a bit disapointed here with the season pass so far. Hopefully something that adds to replayability will come out because I have no intention of playing this again on other difficulties etc. In the end, you do get more of the tedious fights from the first game. This time around it is easier to either sneak past - or have some cat and mouse game out of the fights - but still, a few too many to my liking.","February 1","true","32.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Especially the bits in Syria and early on in Serbia on the mountain felt really awesome, great introduction set pieces. The puzzles are a bit too simple honestly but I was fine with it as is.\n\nMy biggest gripe was how several times while far into the game I had to restart it. There are bugs here, nasty ones at that. Probably not everyone experience them but sometimes events weren't triggered, especially towards the end. The trebuchet stuff was downright frustrating, I had to restart the game several times. Not because of death mind you, simply because NPC's would be stuck inside walls and keep throwing stuff at you but you couldn't kill them. Or I couldn't remove debris that was in the way because it didn't get removed even though I was doing what I was supposed to do to progress. So really the last bit was really annoying for me. However these are bugs that will probably be fixed or may not occur for everyone. Though I really hated the trebuchet stuff in general, going back and fourth between these felt like pure filler to try and make the game longer.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it's quite stunning and has an engaging story. Some pieces are quite cool, where you had three factions fighting each other at the end and you're just trying to make it across to the other side with things blowing up infront of you.\n\nI must admit though I was expecting more, Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like the other Tomb Raider game from 2013. I guess more of the same is good?  But I would have liked to see them open up the world a bit more, I understand that is difficult.  Especially when there are events sometimes in tombs that block off areas as you progress.  It's not a big thing but the only time I really felt like I was exploring was when I found tombs scattered around the map for the side missions. These are done very well and I highly recommend doing these, most of the time they are a lot more engaging than the main mission stuff.\n\nI'll end with that it's a solid sequel that needs some bug fixes and next time around maybe opening the world up more.","February 3","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Well this one is even better. They improved on just about everything: the platforming, the combat, the graphics, the tombs, the story telling, everything. They even got rid of most of the annoying quick-time events and gratuitous death scenes.\n\nIt runs quite well; I only had to turn a few settings down or off (Hairworks, HBAO+) and I had playable framerates on my aging GeForce GTX880M at 1920x1080; they did tank into the 20s maybe twice in the game in some graphics intense situations, but never never during cutscenes or combat. PC controls work fine (I chose to play with KB/M; only tiny issue is a mislabeled button in the map tutorial: it says press space to mark an objective, but you actually have to press enter). All in all a good port (or perhaps a parallel development?).\n\nSeriously, though, if you enjoyed Tomb Raider 2013 but felt it lacked in the tomb raiding department, then you'll want this game.

This one is very similar to the previous 2013 release, so if you liked that you'll enjoy this one.\n\nI really had fun with this game, the tombs are fun to raid and the enviroment is really beautiful and fun to explore, the shooting feels solid enough, although the pistol is as useless as the previous game once you get a silencer for the rifle.\n\nThe writing is ok, the story isn't as interesting as the previous game in my opinion, but I enjoyed what they tried to show in it.\n\nOverall I'd recommend it just for the fun factor, there's a lot to do in the game too, so you'll get a lot of money/time if you value that sort of thing too.","March 8","true","27.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The additions don't bring much to it, but don't ruin anything either. The graphics are outstanding and, despite the FPS drops experienced in the larger outdoor areas the game, the engine seems well optimized and makes quality use of the available hardware.\nThe story however is weak and mostly fails in its attempt to mix "The Descent"-inspired aesthetics & violence from the reboot with the kind of cheesy narratives found in the earlier games from the series.\nOnce again, there are not that many Tombs, but what is there is ambitiously executed and a lot of fun to play through.\nA lot of the Expeditions content is disposable, but the Endurance mode DLC is probably the single best way to play the game, so you definitely want to get that.\nOverall it is a very solid game, but as it is overly careful to replicate everything that was good about the previous title, it is somewhat disappointing too.","February 14","true","64.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/recommended/391220/","specialneedsforces","Special Needs Forces","http://steamcommunity.com/id/specialneedsforces/","245 products in account","This game does not give off a good first impression. The beginning is heavily scripted. Walk forwards, watch something bad happen, press X to not die, etc. Follow the linear path, watch the cutscenes. Please, give me gameplay already. Fortunately, after a short attempt to impress players with gee whiz cutscene action, it does start delivering the goods.\n\nThe gameplay mixes platforming, traversal (climbing and the like), combat of both the direct and stealth variety, puzzle solving, and exploration and discovery. There's a lot of good to be found in these elements.\n\nLara's jumping is fluid and fun to control. You can actually aim her jumps a little bit in mid-air, and her climbing is also quite fluid. She can "double jump" up walls, climb trees, launch herself off walls, and can climb icy and rocky walls with her pickaxe. You have a ton of control over these elements, as opposed to the stiff movement of the later Uncharted games, and combining these moves together is a lot of fun.\n\nCombat tends to allow for many options. For example, at one point I was hiding in water and I grabbed an enemy who was unaware, and drowned him. Then I snuck up behind another enemy, strangled him, and then planted a poison gas bomb on his body, then hid. Another enemy examined the corpse, and got a face full of poison gas for his trouble. Three enemies down, still not spotted yet. I knew I was going to have to inevitably fight, so I lit a fire arrow and ignited two enemies at once, and that blew my cover. Well, almost. The enemies started searching for me, and I was able to surprise one more before everyone spotted me and it basically turned into a standard cover shooter at that point.\n\nOne problem, as I see it, is that there's too much open combat in the game that just takes place in linear areas. I think the game is at its best when you have many options at your disposal, but sometimes, you're just forced into standard shooty setpieces before you can move on.\n\nThe level design is a mixture of open areas, and linear setpieces. Open areas are sometimes huge, and loaded with things to do: characters to talk to (such as villagers or rebels in hiding), wild animals hanging around their turf, caves to explore, trees to climb, hidden stuff to find, and your eventual goal that takes you to the next area. These areas are fantastic, and I really wish there were more of them.\n\nThe pacing changes up a lot; sometimes you're progressing through a linear area and fighting through enemies, then you have to climb and move through to the next area, then solve a minor puzzle, and eventually you're out in the open where you're hit with tons of things to do.\n\nSometimes, though, the pacing doesn't quite work out. One area of the game had a village full of people preparing for a huge battle against invaders. There was a lot to do there, and their upcoming battle was played up as if it was going to be epic. I was really excited about the idea of fighting enemies in such a massive, open forest with trees, towers, caves and houses... but when it came time for the battle, it was just a linear cover shooter segment. When it was all over, the villagers were talking about the heavy losses they suffered over the past 10 minutes. I was left thinking, "That's it?!" It could have been epic, but it failed.\n\nYou'll encounter some brutally tough puzzles, many of which are optional (the "challenge tombs"), some of which are required to progress. They involve things like transporting an explosive to its destination, moving a boat around a rapidly flowing river with the help of ropes and pulleys - some puzzles require timing, while others don't.\n\nThe game provides hints in several ways, such as music that changes depending on how close you are to solving the puzzle, remarks Lara makes to herself, and the ability to "examine" things using "survival instincts" (which makes important and interactive things glow, while also revealing objectives).\n\nThere's also tons of hidden secrets to find. The game outright alerts you to nearby "challenge tombs", with the sound of wind chimes playing when you're in their general area. The tombs are essentially multiple puzzles: first you have to find them, then you have to enter them, then you have to solve the puzzle inside. Successfully raiding the tombs earns you special abilities, such as the ability to detect animals' hearts and kill them in one hit if you shoot them there (animals are very nasty and harder to kill than most humans, so this helps a lot in encounters with them).\n\nYou can backtrack to find secrets and hidden things in locations you've been to before, using your new abilities. Any campfire you've previously visited serves as a place to upgrade weapons and spend experience points (obtained via collecting items or killing in special ways) on skills, as well as warp to any previously visited campfire, so you can backtrack that way.\n\nThe skills you can obtain are things like the ability to turn gas cans into bombs, the ability to craft certain kinds of new weapons (such as explosive arrows), and more. Some of these skills really open up your combat options, and there are also special abilities that can be obtained only by completing challenge tombs.\n\nThat said, this game has some things that hold it back quite a bit. A lot of the cover-based combat just feels, to me, mostly like it's just there for the sake of being there, and isn't well thought out, while stealth combat is a lot more fun but doesn't quite go on for as long as I'd like at times. There are scripted moments that are just really unnecessary, but at least it's not as bad as the previous game when it comes to that (save for that awful beginning).\n\nAnd the ending feels rushed and generic. Lots of ghost-like enemies shooting at me with blue fire arrows that are just easier to kill and do way less damage than you'd expect. I felt like I didn't have much opportunity to do much creative fighting, and it just felt like a waste of time. And the final area even goes for that annoying orange/blue color scheme Hollywood is obsessed with (Google it to see what I mean if you haven't noticed that trend already). Indeed, rushed endings are a problem I've noticed in other games I've really enjoyed lately, such as Axiom Verge and Life is Strange. It's like companies just feel the need to make their game end on a big note, but don't know how to do it in a way that paces well.\n\nFinally, and this is more of a mild complaint, enemies can be total morons at times. At one point, I was hiding behind cover, and there was a fire burning next to me. An enemy was walking towards my hiding spot, about to turn the corner to where I was hiding, and he walked right into the fire, ignited, and died seconds later. I've seen other behavior that's not quite that stupid, but still really dumb.\n\nStill, other than some issues with pacing and scripting, overall I think this game is pretty good, and a major improvement over Tomb Raider 2013. If you're looking for an adventure with a lot of different types of gameplay, I'd recommend this one, since I think the good outweighs the bad.\n\n(Finally, ignore my number of hours on record. I tend to leave games running the entire time I do other things)","February 15","true","925.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Well this one is even better. They improved on just about everything: the platforming, the combat, the graphics, the tombs, the story telling, everything. They even got rid of most of the annoying quick-time events and gratuitous death scenes.\n\nIt runs quite well; I only had to turn a few settings down or off (Hairworks, HBAO+) and I had playable framerates on my aging GeForce GTX880M at 1920x1080; they did tank into the 20s maybe twice in the game in some graphics intense situations, but never never during cutscenes or combat. PC controls work fine (I chose to play with KB/M; only tiny issue is a mislabeled button in the map tutorial: it says press space to mark an objective, but you actually have to press enter). All in all a good port (or perhaps a parallel development?).\n\nSeriously, though, if you enjoyed Tomb Raider 2013 but felt it lacked in the tomb raiding department, then you'll want this game.

Especially the bits in Syria and early on in Serbia on the mountain felt really awesome, great introduction set pieces. The puzzles are a bit too simple honestly but I was fine with it as is.\n\nMy biggest gripe was how several times while far into the game I had to restart it. There are bugs here, nasty ones at that. Probably not everyone experience them but sometimes events weren't triggered, especially towards the end. The trebuchet stuff was downright frustrating, I had to restart the game several times. Not because of death mind you, simply because NPC's would be stuck inside walls and keep throwing stuff at you but you couldn't kill them. Or I couldn't remove debris that was in the way because it didn't get removed even though I was doing what I was supposed to do to progress. So really the last bit was really annoying for me. However these are bugs that will probably be fixed or may not occur for everyone. Though I really hated the trebuchet stuff in general, going back and fourth between these felt like pure filler to try and make the game longer.\n\nAs for the rest of the game, it's quite stunning and has an engaging story. Some pieces are quite cool, where you had three factions fighting each other at the end and you're just trying to make it across to the other side with things blowing up infront of you.\n\nI must admit though I was expecting more, Rise of the Tomb Raider feels like the other Tomb Raider game from 2013. I guess more of the same is good?  But I would have liked to see them open up the world a bit more, I understand that is difficult.  Especially when there are events sometimes in tombs that block off areas as you progress.  It's not a big thing but the only time I really felt like I was exploring was when I found tombs scattered around the map for the side missions. These are done very well and I highly recommend doing these, most of the time they are a lot more engaging than the main mission stuff.\n\nI'll end with that it's a solid sequel that needs some bug fixes and next time around maybe opening the world up more.","February 3","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Never ran out of ammo once entire game\n- Cannot stock throwables\n- There might be memory leak but it might be just me\n\nStory related bs\n-   Someone please explain me what was the purpose of Jonah other than being a damsel in distress for his little bird\n\n-  The main difference between this game and the 2013 one that became a thing back then is in that game adventure and the need of survival found Lara while she was just a normal girl but in this game the story is similar to almost every old Tomb Raider games out there where there's ultra powerful OP artifact that Lara herself goes after and there are always bad people (lara's evil twin, organizations, lara's old friend, lara's new friend, literally anyone who has enough money to create an army of his own etc.)  wanting that for their own reason which is mostly bad because they're bad people,  except Square Enix knew that'd make it too cheesy so they tried to create a relatable character called Konstantin who's doing it all for his dying sister.  Unfortunately he gets killed directly or undirectly by our "hero".  All in all story is not too cheesy but still not as good as the reboot's..\n\n-  Only person we see from the prequel is no one but Jonah. Whatever happened to Sam who we worked our asses off to save in the first game?\n\n-  Both in Uncharted and Tomb Raider games every artifact they try so hard to find always needs to be destroyed because "Humanity isn't ready :'(" . This is why if there's an artifact involved as the key point in a story, almost always lara gets nothing but the shaft in the end but the feeling of "doing the right thing"  making the story more easily predictable.\n\n-  Speaking of the Divine source, at the end Ana opens the golden whatever but while she's gaining her immortality she drops it because uuh? Does she get flashbanged from the shining artifact or what?\n\n-  Deathless= zombie japanese samurais in the first game\n\n\nThis is all I can think of for now. I might edit this after DLCs. All in all, it's a good game for a good price. Go get it\n\n7,5/10","February 4","true","18.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

The story of Tomb Raider 2013 was already REALLY bad and had nothing but forgettable characters. Rise of the Tomb Raider also has nothing but forgettable characters, the story is also really bad, but what ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off the most is how extremely serious this game is. There is NO humour AT ALL, even though the topics and the story of this game are extremely silly things.\nBecause of this the Uncharted series will always be better.\nAfter the boring prologue I had a lot of fun with RotTR and I thought this might be a strong contender for GOTY, but the more I continued the more I got dissapointed and the terrible story just left me with a dissapointed feeling at the end. Still, the game has a lot of good things about it, which could easily make it a 9/10 just by have LESS story, because it is SO bad.\nWhat I liked the most about this game is how much bigger the areas are, how much more encouraged you are to explore and how much more puzzles you can do. This also makes this game feel much more like the first generation of Tomb Raider games. Combat is also improved, but not by much. Unlike TR2013 though, you don't get thrown into a combat situation and then get attacked by waves of enemies. Here in most situations the enemies won't know that you are there, so you can always plan your attack first and go stealthy. Problem is that the game is so ♥♥♥♥ing easy even on the highest difficulty, actually it's simply broken. You get waay to much ammo and resources for everything which allows you to craft as much poison/fire/explosive arrows as you want, which are by far the most overpowered weapons in the game. With 1 poison arrow you can take down a group of the most armored enemies in the game. Not only that, but you will have millions of healing material, so you can always heal yourself in combat. Especially because of the level design there is always cover which you can use and quickly heal yourself. It gets even more ridiculous when you upgrade your healing ability, which they added because apparently it wasn't easy enough already. With the healing upgrade you can heal yourself almost instantly. I actually didn't die a single time in combat in this game on the highest difficulty. The combat was still fun, and the good thing is there wasn't THAT much combat as in TR2013.\nWhat dissapointed me about the second half of the game is that there weren't these big hub areas anymore, where you can freely explore, do side missions and stuff like that. The second half was completely rushed and you were always attacked by enemies. I completed the game in 12 hours and I did almost all side missions and all tombs except one. 12 hours is really short.\nVisually the game was really impressive, it had some really nice places, good variety and panoramas. But I had some frame drops in some places on my GTX 970 which was annoying (without AA, textures no high).\n\nI think if the story and ending wasn't so bad, I wouldn't be left with such a dissapointed feeling and like the game much more. I don't recommend buying at full price, because the game is too short.","February 5","true","15.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is worth every penny for any proper Tomb Raider fan!\nBut boy is the game taxing on the highest settings!

Sometimes the story skips me ahead while I wasn't particularily done exploring an area and this can get irritating. The camera doesn't always cooperate (and sometimes removes your control to install a sense of amazement when you are nearing a cool structure), and I found that the controls sometimes don't do what I want. The DLC is a bit scummy. You don't really need (most of) it, and the game plays fine without.\n\nWith that said, those are the few critiques I have. Rise of the Tomb Raider is a step up from the previous installment and in general is really fun to play. The price point may be a bit steep at launch but I have confidence that it will go on sale for a 20-er within the year just like Tomb Raider 2013. If you didn't like Tomb Raider 2013, you probably won't like this one either.","February 2","true","21.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Although you'll need a powerhouse rig to run the game anywhere near 60+ fps on max settings, the game is visually gorgeous.\nWith my GTX 780 the game frequently fluctuated from a rare 30 fps to a more often 40-50 fps. Sunken city's and Icy cliff faces really come to life with astounding detail and the character models have also taken a step up with Lara sometimes being on the verge of photorealistic.\nThe gameplay remains much the same as the previous game with weapon upgrades complimenting the gunplay and some quite brutal melee finishing moves. This time around you can also craft weapons from bottles and cans left around the environenment to help in the game arena style battles with enemies.\nMy only gripe is that I didn't enjoy the story as much as the last game, and although the final sections ratchet up the action it still felt like a retread of the original games final section.\nOther than that it's a great game but be wary about the games high requirements.","January 30","true","19.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Amazing scenery and dramatic playable cutscenes are abundant throughout the campaign, but never leave you feeling like the gameplay is bogged down or linear. Explosions and lascerations abound, and really make you feel the resilliance and determination of Lara Croft as she attempts to outwit her hostile surroundings.\n\nThe narative of Lara Croft, although at times a bit too emotional for a character that has long been a silent badass, leads well into the story of the games that would follow. This game is great as a standalone entity, or even coupled with it's 2013 predecessor, however for a real fan of the series it makes Lara feel far too soft and under-confident at times.\n\nThe combat is smooth, and the control scheme is seemlessly meshed into a few buttons, making the player feel the power of all the tools at ones disposal without an overcomplicated control scheme. It does not, however, do anything to improve or innovate on the standard 3rd person "over the shoulder" shooter that we've come to know. In that sense it falls short of the rest of the overwhelming accomplishments this game makes, and feels more like an "if you've played one..." scenario.\n\nThe graphic demands of this game are high, a fact that was not lost on me when it (surprisingly) defaulted to "High" settings on my pc. I was very pleased to find out that my somewhat dated machine could run this game at reasonable specs. However early into the first cutscenes I realized that the game had made a bit of an over-estimation, and my frame rate became more of a series of still shots. This isn't the games fault, except for the fact that after seeing just how pretty the game COULD look, I was forced to lower the quality and settle for how it should look. It's my opinion that, had the game defaulted to "Medium" instead, I would have been pleasantly surprised with how far up I could push it, rather than being dissapointed at having to drop it lower.\n\nLastly, my biggest grievance with Tomb Raider 2013 was the difficulty. Even on hard mode the game was little challenge, and didn't offer an achievment for completion on a more difficult setting. Rise of the Tomb Raider has absolutely fixed this problem. Even on normal, the combat presented significant challenge at times, and the puzzles in the game are far improved, which goes even further if you turn off survival instincts leaving you to figure out all the maps and interactable objects for yourself. The bad part is that, you have to FORCE the game into not helping so much, which made me feel as though the developers assumed I'd be needing so much help. But solving the puzzles with all the help can make one feel lazy, like you could've done more, had the game allowed you the time to think before showing you the way. The tutorials that will occasionally pop up on the screen, telling you how to use equipment or dodge attacks, somehow never go away, and can telegraph the solution to a puzzle without warning or warrant.\n\nOverall, Rise of the Tomb Raider does in fact rise above its predescessor. There are several clear improvements over the last game, which are immediately apparent, and last throughout the campaign. But with a dusty combat system, and a babysitting tutorial system that makes thinking almost unneccesary, I'm left wanting a little bit more. A great game nonetheless, I'm giving Rise of the Tomb Raider a solid 8/10.","February 7","true","24.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Also, still only 25% into the game. Will update the review as I progress further if required.\n\nPros:\n1. Beautiful graphics if your system can handle it, especially in areas without Sunlight (see first point under cons below).\n2. A somewhat difficult game as it throws many enemies at you in spurts. Note that I am not used to shooting or FPS games so this might not be valid for you.\n3. Interesting story line.\n4. Tombs with nice puzzles.\n5. Voice acting is nice but even though the setting is Siberian/Russian, voice acting is in English with what feels like American accent to my untrained ears.\n6. The Skill tree seems interesting and it does not look like you will acquire everything by end game. So its a question of "which" rather than "when" which is good.\n\nCons:\n1. In areas with sunlight and shadows (parts of Soviet Installation in the early game), things are not optimized and actually the game doesn't look particularly good as well in those areas.\n2. Few bugs which should be sorted in the first few patches.\n3. A high end PC required as the game is graphically demanding and not exceptionally optimized.\n4. The game gave me 0 credits for completing the first tomb instead of 10000 credits I should have earned. Actually, got a popup saying "Earned 0 credits" :). Nothing major but still no answer from technical support after multiple tries.\n\nFinal Verdict : 9/10. Recommended buy if your system can handle it.","February 8","true","26.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The game is much like the first in that it is a 3rd person shooter with RPG and platforming elements in the gameplay. Not to much has changed between the the 2013 remake and this new one with the exception of a few new added gadgets. These gadgets whether it be the rope, fire or explosive arrows are unlocked over time to both further progress the story along with allow you to be able to go back through various parts of Siberia in order to do a full unlock of the game.\n\nThe platforming of the game is much better than the first remake in that there aren't any silly bugs that cause you to miss your jumps or camera angles that through your jumps off. They also toned down on the quick time events, allowing for more player interaction during the game itself instead of an interactive movie. Also a return was the on the fly crafting system that allows you to craft explosives and ammunition for various weapons much like that of Last of Us. It is a pretty simple system that doesn't require too much resources to craft. I never really ran out of any crafting materials except when I needed to upgrade my weapons and equipment. Those were a little more difficult to get however that said you could get most of them by just running around the maps and hunting the different animals and supply caches.\n\nI would also like to mention though the gameplay was fun, it wasn't all that challenging, at least on the Tomb Raider difficulty. It might be a little more difficult on survivor mode but I can't see it being all that much more difficult as sneaking around, distracting your enemies with thrown bottles among other things made it incredibly easy to kill them and not get caught. But difficulty is never a requirement to make a game fun, as I said I enjoyed playing the game even though it might have only took me 23 hours to 100% it including all the hidden items.\n\nOne year after the events of Tomb Raider (2013), Lara is searching for answers for what happened on the island Yamatai and is looking to her father's research when she comes across what events pushed her father to the edge of “suicide”. She comes across him referencing the city of the Prophet, Kitezh and the Divine Source, some mystical artifact that supposedly gives those that find it immortal life. In pursuit of this artifact a secret organization of God called Trinity is also chasing it and killing all who oppose them or don't follow their beliefs. It ends up being a race to who can get to the Divine Source first. Overall the Story isn't anything special but the characters are interesting enough and it had enough to drive the game overall, making me want to find out more. What added a lot to the story, and I feel like a lot of people don't bother with it, is the various lore you find from the Mongolians that invaded the city first, the Greeks that followed after, the soviets that controlled Siberia looking for the city and Trinity themselves in their recorded messages. It was those subtle codex items that added a lot to the overall story and history behind Kitezh and the Prophet.\n\nI want to touch on something that it seems like I constantly see people complaining about Lara being a killing machine and don't seem to understand what drove her to do that in both games. Since these are both reboots we won't talk about the fact that in the games before she was a killing machine, we'll just focus on these two new games as their own series. In the first game there was no mysterious force chasing Lara and her expedition team, they were already on the island, that said she was already starting to be broken emotionally from leading her team into the Dragon's Triangle and marooning them on a deadly island. Once she found out a force of mercenaries were capturing and killing her friends she saw it as time for vengeance especially after she was almost ♥♥♥♥♥ and killed herself before she killed her first person. You could even see her progression through the game where she accepted who she was and what she had to do to stop those that were there to harm her and her friends. All that even led to this pretty often screen capped photo in game where, in my opinion, shows that she has lost what made her human.\n\nIn the new game it is much the same but this time she knows what Trinity is after and knows that they were the one that defamed her father that led to his death. On top of that she meets a new group of people that have lived near and defended the city of Kitezh for thousands of years. A people that she wanted to protect from Trinity. Lara may have a murderous tendency but it isn't without reason. Some would argue that she should be more likely to sneak around and avoid killing and Nathan Drake (of the Uncharted series) is more prone to killing. I disagree with that and argue that it is the complete opposite. A lot of times Drake has no reason to kill, he is a thief that doesn't really have a play in most of these enemy forces, he just happens upon them. I will take the exception of Uncharted 2 where they attack the villagers in Nepal but that wasn't until ¾ through the game.\n\nThis game is one of the most beautiful games I've seen, from the scenery all the way up to the particle physics and  facial animations. Crystal Dynamics did a fantastic job of making every little detail pop out and all while having it run great (at least on my PC, I've heard of others having problems but I didn't – 5820k, 780ti, 16g ddr4). I really noticed when Lara or other characters had looks on their faces, so the voice actors didn't have to sell the emotions as much, you could definitely see them. There are so many great screenshot moments in this game I don't really want to bombard you with all the pics I took while playing but to say the least some of the most talented screenshot takers are taking some of the most amazing photos (I have one friend that is very talented at this, but if any of y'all have some impressive photos feel free to put them in the comments below, I'd love to see them).\n\nOn to the sound too, the music really sets the tone and has a similar composition of the 2013 remake which was great in its own right but makes this game really feel like a continuation of a series. The voice actors are also really on their game and make the characters believable especially since a lot of game developers use motion cameras to capture even the voice actors as they are playing the role.\n\nOverall this game is fantastic continuation from the reboot that started in 2013, though I did 100% it in about 23 hours there is a lot of other content including endurance, score attack and if you decide to spend the money the DLC that is coming with season pass. Maybe not as much of a replay-ability as say an MMO or giant RPGs but definitely a great bang for your buck especially if you can find a sale for it at $40 like I did. The Graphics, Gameplay, Story and sound are all top notch with the only blemish might be not as strong story as some others but still very solid.\n\nStory – 8\nGameplay – 8\nGraphics – 10\nSound – 10\nFun – 9\nReplay Value - 6","February 12","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You have a breathtaking graphic, insanely fluid movements, wonderful voiced characters and of course the cutest and sexiest girl in the gaming world: Lara Croft.\n\nThe game is linear, even tho you are kinda allowed to roam around and do stuff, you basically wanna follow the red string of the story. You will occasionally encounter some special hidden quests which are fun to do and give you a good reward. You solve everything in typical Lara Croft style, climbing walls and jumping off roofs. And all of that doesnt only ♥♥♥♥ing feel awesome, it also looks awesome.\n\nYour character can level up, and you can invest points per Level into abilities, which are divided into 3 main groups. It allows you to customize the way you wanna finish the game. Do you prefer shooting around, stealthing around or building traps? It's all up to you.\nYour Weapons can also be upgraded, in the same way as your character.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Maybe because I have a huge thing for British girls.

They are called "challenge tombs" for some unknown reason, as they are as difficult as making toast (quite hard if you don't have a grill or toaster, granted). Again, don't bother playing unless on the hardest level, as it is way too easy, and overkill as usual with the weapons. You can easily get through the whole game with stock weaps and ammo. Story is lol, but it tells you small snippets about the Crofts. Combat is silly and AI even sillier.\nThankfully, you can switch off on screen clues/prompts, because with it on, in the age of hand-holding computer games, it takes all the thought out of any puzzles in the game, (which are few and far between and simple).\nGreat for a blast, bad for Tomb Raider die hard fans expecting much improvement. As i said about the last outing, can only get better, it has, and i hold hope for any others, but maybe next time, like our good 'ole Tomb Raidings of old, let's have some more global locales to explore, as one large "open world" area is not in the vein of Lara's adventures overall, really, oh and some vehicles wouldn't go amiss either.\nEnjoy it at a lower price, but worth playing, especially if you like a mix of Far Cry, Asscreed, TR. Quite low on combat tho', it comes in bouts that are yawn, and by the time i got to The Lost City, i was just crying for it to end.\nAll in all, a fair attempt, but again, room for improvement.","February 7","true","51.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well, this is more of the same - or rather more of the good things of the reboot. Less QTE's, more tombs and caves and exploration. Still some silly problems with bining keys to mouse on PC. It shows to press the [] button for various actions, but if you have two thumbbuttons used - you won't know which ones until you tried - and most likely died a few times.\n\nThe story is slightly tighter this time around, more focused - and that is both good and bad. If you're a completionist than it will feel like you leave people to die to be able to go off the beaten path to explore and find treasure. You also have to leave certain tombs and treasures behind since you will lack certain gear and features that you lock up later on in the story line.\n\nThe expeditions are fun DLC and really should come in more flavours since this is what most will be doing after they beat the game - or well only be doing since this is the real challenge.\n\nThe game has some technical flaws and hickups. There is a hguge FPS drop in expeditions that occurs with a few minutes regualr intervention that makes it feel like something is going on that shouldn't be happening. The single player part runs with most things on on my spec flawlessly. I don't use occular and lens flaires and depth of field - but other than that - I have most things on except the hair. And I have a steady 80-110 FPS regardless of fights in firelit places.\nGameplay issues range from minor nitpicks as to how the camera works and you have little control meaning that forward moves your character sideways end vice versa in some parts of the game. Sometimes you can't see where you are going, meaning that you have to die to your death hoping you are on the right track and then redo some climbing/jumping routines - I had rather seen more difficult pathfinding as an obstacle than the camera itself as your biggest problem.\n\nHopefully coming patches will make the expeditions better optimized since that is really something nice - oh and that's were most of your pre-order and DLC extras will come into play.\n\nThe card system is to beef out and tweak your expeditions adventures.\n\nEDIT notes: after finishing the game and Baba Yaga DLC.\nSo, the game is ended and for that I have to give cred. I don't finish all my games but this one I did. The game gets slightly tedious at the end, trying to sweep the areas looking for missing documents, loot and item chests. But all in all - a nice game. Baba Yaga wasn't a hit though - if you think you're missing out due to this one - rest easy - it is not worth the time. I got a bit disapointed here with the season pass so far. Hopefully something that adds to replayability will come out because I have no intention of playing this again on other difficulties etc. In the end, you do get more of the tedious fights from the first game. This time around it is easier to either sneak past - or have some cat and mouse game out of the fights - but still, a few too many to my liking.","February 1","true","32.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The boss battles executed differently but it felt like the same action ending and it bugs me.\n\nWas it worth the $40 I paid for it?  16.3 hours to complete the main story with minor deviations to break up a speed run and kinda explore so yeah? I guess? I have a bit of animosity because of the ending but I think I can get over it. The graphics were amazing, the glacier as a back drop to some cold tundra and muddy living areas was pretty stellar. The audio drew me into the game like none other. When ♥♥♥♥ started breaking under you as you're running across certain things the sound was impressive, scary. The gameplay was what I expected, action adventure game with a bit of RPG elements (perks/weapon upgrades). The story was kinda meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't good either. It was kinda campy on the eternal life bit just seems like thats all that comes out of archaeologist fantasy.\n\nGraphics - 9/10\nAudio - 10/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 5/10","February 6","true","16.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/391220/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","The reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise in 2013 was met with pretty much universal acclaim from critics and general users alike. It was a fresh take on the series which really focussed on Lara’s origins and gave her a very real personality. The gameplay was overhauled too, and the story was intriguing to follow. So it was a very tough act to follow.\n\nI was hyped about this sequel, and will open this review by saying I felt Rise of the Tomb Raider lived up to this hype. If I may be so bold, I may even go so far as to say I enjoyed ROTTR more than Tomb Raider (2013).\n\nSo ROTTR takes off after the previous game and explores the circumstances surround the death of Lara’s father. The overarching story is about Lara’s quest for the key to immortality and involved exploring, or ahem, raiding ruins in the Middle East and Russia.\n\nI felt the story had more depth to it in ROTTR. It felt grander, bigger and just more of a journey. Core elements of the game from the previous game had been conserved, though I felt there was a greater emphasis on crafting in ROTTR. Difficulty wise, they’re both about the same. I enjoyed the additions to gear that provided new ways to traverse terrain in this game. I felt they added to the skill level required with the game as one is mixing up different button combinations.\n\nVisually, ROTTR was gorgeous. Perhaps. one of the better looking games of it’s generation, and  this is to be expected as we could say the same for Tomb Raider (2013). I think what the dev team did with this is take what made the previous game so successful and just add to it.\n\nMy big gripe at this point in time is with optimisation. At my first playthrough, before writing this review, My system was running Crossfired R9 290X, i7 4790k, 16GB RAM, game installed to SSD, and my frame rates weren’t particularly at amazing playing on high (though not Very high) settings at 1440p. I understand this is an NVIDIA title so perhaps that has something to do with it. At the time of writing, AMD is yet to push out it’s optimisation driver for this game so perhaps that has something to do with it. The open world regions would drop my frame rates to about the 30FPS mark, but most other regions seemed to hang around 50-60FPS mark, so a mixed bag overall. It wasn’t unplayable by any means, and the gameplay and story were enough to keep me going, but I expected better.\n\nHowever, ROTTR has strengths in most other categories. There’s a great mix of fast paced action and slow paced head scratching puzzles, which really contributes to the scope of this game. The combat is good, standard third person shooter tactics. The bow is an excellent weapon which is utilised well in the game, both for combat and navigation. The stealth combat was one of my favourite aspects. A lot of emphasis is put on this, and I felt it was mostly well executed. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of water based stealth kills, as well as death from above and just general sneaking behind an enemy to kill them. Really good.\n\nThe world building was top notch. Exploring the lore, through artefacts and journals really added to the story and the settings were beautifully designed. I am a fan of how it was not homogenous at all, with a good variety of settings and colours. One part of the game you’re exploring sandy Syria, later you’re in the snowy tundra of Siberia, and then you explore caves, ruins, mountains.\n\nAudio is fine. Ambient sounds were appropriate, voice acting was as you would expect from a modern AAA title. Controls were fine, I played with Keyboard/mouse. There was the odd time when I experienced some lag in controls, but I put that down to the same issues as frame rate as discussed earlier. But it wasn’t game breaking.\n\nOverall, some irksome optimisation issues for AMD users, but a good story, lovely to look at and just fun, engaging gameplay. ROTTR took the successes from it’s predecessor and for the most part expanded on them. Recommended.","February 19","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's still quite linear though and the optional challenge tombs aren't really all that challenging. Still I think this kind of gameplay in a high profile title is definitely a good thing.\n\nThe story isn't very strong though, and doesn't seem to develop Lara's character at all in regards to how much of a change the original reboot was. There are some semi-decent scenes involving her relationship with her father but I can't help but think the narrative is a bit of a step backward.\n\nOverall it's really worth 15-20 hours of your time, especially if you played the original reboot.","February 10","true","22.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackwolfpt/recommended/391220/","Blackwolfpt","Blackwolfpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackwolfpt/","568 products in account","Rise of the Tomb Raider is an action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and the sequel to Tomb Raider.\n\nSome time after the events of Tomb Raider, Lara Croft turns to her late father's research in an attempt to find the mythical city of Kitezh. Unfortunately for her, the Trinity organization is also in its tracks. While the reboot established her origins, this time her character is being more developed and fleshed out. The game takes place in Syria, and for the most part in Siberia. While the plot feels a bit formulaic, I still greatly enjoyed it.\n\nThe overall structure is pretty similar to the previous installment, but with some clear improvements. This time, hunting actually makes sense, as you need specific resources to craft certain consumables, gadgets and ammunition. Combat received a few notorious changes as well, with the ability to clear entire areas stealthily, which can break the monotony and add some tension. There are also more tombs to explore, with them being generally more expansive, but still entirely optional.\n\nOtherwise, you still level up, gaining skill points to invest in three distinct categories, and are able to craft weapon upgrades. While not really open world, there are large hubs, where you have plenty to explore, do side quests and complete challenges. The platforming sections are similar and still satisfying, but with a few new gadgets to spice things up.\n\nThe graphics are very impressive, with the Siberian landscapes being particularly good, in par with the voice acting, which is outstanding. The multiplayer has been dropped, which I personally don't mind, as it was pretty generic. In its place, there is an expedition mode, where you can replay chapters in different game modes, such as time attack. You can also use cards, which will affect gameplay in these modes. While not extremely good, I find the expeditions to be a nice addition.\n\nIf you disliked Tomb Raider, you should probably give this one a miss, as it's fairly similar. On the other hand, if you enjoyed it, you should definitely give Rise of the Tomb Raider a try.","February 14","true","43.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay is relatively the same, which is not a bad thing since it already was really great, and in ROTTR they've added new movements and abilities to this already great gameplay. Graphics wise.... it's jaw-dropping, this game looks so good ( maxed out atleist ), it's the best graphics i've ever seen in a video game and it runs great ( apart from the texture quality settings, if you have anything less than 4 Gb of VRam, don't bother going ''very high'' you'll stutter ) and there's a lot of options here as well. Story now, it's great. I mean, it's Lara's first Tomb, following her dad's footsteps and showing her determination... it's just really well made. My only complain is the game's length, being really short. i was expecting it to be atleist a little longer than Tomb Raider 2013, but both games took me exactly 10 hours each to beat on ''Tomb Raider'' difficulty ( normal i guess ), which is a little sad to be honest... But hey, it's not the end of the world, replayability is there, though i don't think it's really something that i'll do.

This game takes the formula set by the previous game and adds a few flourishes but ultimately plays out the same.\nGraphically one of the best looking games ive seen its a visual treat to see Lara running and exploring her way across forgotten corners of Syria, and later Russia.\nThe level design is great with huge open areas with multiple routes to reach a goal, and often side quests can be obtained to further reward additional backtracking/exploration.\nStory wise, its a solid entry - Lara is searching for an artifact that is rumoured to grant immortality with a shadowy cult also trying to get the artifact for more nefarious reasons .\nThe gameplay is solid, and the levelling up process straight forward. Crafting gets more of a heads up this time round and parts need to be collected and created in order to make new weapons and ammo to further assist Lara on her journey.\nIf you enjoyed the last Lara Croft outing this will also appeal but ne thing the game developers need to get their heads around is the fact that Lara Croft is known for raiding Tombs and very little of that happens in this game and indeed the last game. You could swap Lara out for Nathan Drake and call this Uncharted and noone would question it as they are both now very similar games. Get Lara back to raiding Tombs!!!!\n","March 15","true","23.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

She gets dumped in a wilderness with nothing more than a makeshift bow to start out with. With meager resources you help her survive cold and hunger and make her way forward for the sake of curiosity and redemption. For those are Lara's primary motivations: to discover secrets out there that can benefit the world. (Lara actually has the well being of humanity on her mind: make a note of that) and to redeem her disgraced father who was bold enough to assert that there was a thing out there that gave life eternal. And the scientists, being the jerks they are, banned him for it, cause that is the way the coven of scientists operates of course: if you are not for us, you are against us. Disgraced, father Croft killed himself. Or so we are told.\n\nSo Lara sets out to vindicate her father, and her own name, by finding that divine source located in a lost city in the outback. This time around her boots take us to Siberia, after a little detour to Syria for the trail she follows starts with a prophet who preached his brand of Christianity in those regions around the 10th century AD in a country people nowadays mostly recall for the headlines: it is that place where everyone is fighting and bombing everyone because of reasons..\n\nNow it is time for the Illuminati to step in, but since that trope has been beaten to death far too often(for instance in the movie Lara Croft: Tomb Raider) they renamed the nefarious organisation to Trinity and make them out to be a band of religious fanatics, of the christian kind to be on the safe side.\n\nThe evil boss is a guy named Konstantin who does evil because of reasons. "Embrace the suffering," he whispers to one of his minions who has failed him while he pushes his fingers into his victims eye sockets. He is the brother of Ana, who is Lara's stepmother. Since we all know how stepmothers are we  also know that it is just a matter of time before the proverbial poisonous apple surfaces and the hunter will be sent after the princess.. eh Lara..: treason.And so the story proceeds along a beaten track..\n\nThe real gem in the game is Lara herself. She is so well done and so believable that you suffer through the story just to see what she will do next, what she will discover next and how she will develop next. You get to steer Lara through the world, unearthing treasure, solving puzzles, seeing marvelous sights, stalking wildlife and humans alike. And the game underscores this all with good music most of the time.\n\nBut then, in the end, the makers of this game get a brain seizure and trample over Lara's personality and motivations. They make her conclude that some things are not meant for humanity and have her reject to benefit mankind or to redeem her father's reputation.\nWhy?\nBecause of reasons.\nThere could have been many reasons to destroy the big secret but now Lara is set up as judge and jury over mankind. 'Humans are not meant to live forever, ' she says suddenly. How she got from "unearthing secrets to benefit mankind" to "it is not meant for mankind" is not developed. It just happens. Like you wind vane she suddenly twists around when the wind changes.\nThis is called poor writing: having a character make a decision in the end that is at odds to her starting opinion and which isn't worked towards in the story line.This is the deus ex machina of decision making.\nBut there is more.\nIn the epilogue yet another another u-turn is made for we are blatantly told next that discovering stuff for the benefit of humanity is what motivates Lara. Hold on. Did she not just destroy something that would benefit mankind because she was of the opinion that it wasn't meant for it mankind? How did she get from a to b and then back from b to a?\n\nThis flip flopping of Lara's personality takes the whole experience down several notches for the end apparently did nothing to her personality. In other words: she went through some kind of personality change instantly and reverted back instantly.\n\nMy 10 thus dropped to a 7. It is a captivating game, but has a seriously broken character development. And the latter is something mankind can do without.","April 11","true","94.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I got this game for free with my graphics card, and hoping that they would have improved on TR2013 I decided to play it to see if they made any improvements to the reboot (instead of giving the code to someone that acutally wanted to play the game), but there was nothing new to be found. It felt like it could very well have been an expansion pack to the original TR2013. The shooting is still bad. The guns still sound like BB guns, and the controls are as bad and unresponsive as they were in TR2013. I can not comment too much on the story since I only played three hours of it, but what I got was boring and not very original. The one improvement I found was that they had cut down on the QTE's, but they still used them to much for my taste.\n\nGraphics wise the game is great. Nothing more to say really. The game went for a photo-realistic look instead of having an unique artsyle, which means the game will look old in an year or two. I always prefer when a game chooses to have a nice artstyle instead of going for photo-realistic graphics, since games that have a nice artstyle age way better. Just look at Wind waker. That game still looks great to this day.\n\nAnd tombs. Tombs where boring. I got trough two of them before I decided to uninstall the game, and they were both way too easy. The game holds your hand way too much. If you are presented with even the simplest of puzzles, the game will have Lara comment on what she needs to do to solve it, which completely ruins the whole point of having a puzzle. This segment will represent the process of getting trough a tomb in this game:\n\n''Hmm, I wonder what I need to do to get past this part?'' I wondered as I was presented with a puzzle.\n\n''Why not do that and then that to solve it?'' Lara then said and the puzzle had solved itself for me.\n\nI hate when games treat their players as if they are two years old, and this game does it exceptionally well.\n\nThis is very subjective, but I don't Laras' voice actor. I don't know what it is, but I find it unbearable to listen to her for more than 5 seconds at a time.\n\nIf you liked the original TR2013, you will like this. But if you did not, you should pass on this glorified expansion.","February 11","false","3.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It feels like half the game time, if you were to do everything, is just boring side stuff. The Tombs are still only optional and not part of the story, geez. It's called Tomb Raider. The graphics looks good, but the game is horribly optimized. The cutscenes are stepping way too deep into the uncanny valley and the dialogs are horrible. The voice acting and directing for Lara is so cringy and just out right bad. Her characters is anything but likeable aswell. The gun/bow play is improved and you now have a crafting system, TLOU-style but much faster. It speeds up the killing and it all feels a bit to easy. As before everything is made of graham crackers and kids glue and gets destroyed just from having Lara lookt at it.\n\nI only recommend this game if you have a beast of a computer (980Ti or better) or can settle with capping at 30fps. Still, look up vids about how well your system would do. Because damn, this game is dropping framerate all over the place in big areas. About the price. I feel like spending 45 bucks, which I did, was way too much for this experience. I'd say wait til winter 2016 and buy it sub 20 bucks.\n\nCheers!","February 7","false","12.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game offers lot of things to do and most of the side missions are "Optional" which lets the player choose if they want to go trough it or come back later for nice rewards. Enemies and the gunplay seem to be little off in a way where you might find the AI raining grenades onto you and not letting you take cover on anything and making the combat little frustrating and not exactly enjoyable eventho using special arrows/ammo can be quite entertaining troughout the game.\n\nGood:\nStory Rich (The game offers a great main story and the extra little notes and collectibles offer more insight to the whole plot making you feel like an actual tomb raider who seeks for treasures)\nVoice acted Notes (As a person who doesent read a whole lot, i find the voice acted notes and papers in the game to be a huge plus cause you can just sit back and listen it trough)\nCrafting (Special ammo and weapon upgrades)\nGreat DLC (As i played trough the Baba Yaga: Witch DLC it really felt like a good content that one would be willing to pay money for)Bad:\nUnpleasant Gunplay (Eventho not all that bad i just really dont like the combat all 100% as it doesent really feel satisfying to go trough groups of enemies and sometimes it feels way too easy)\nIf you like the first tombraider from 2013, this game is a mustbuy since it only improves over the solid concept of the previous game and offers an interesting story.","January 30","true","23.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I would have to give it 7/10 but would still recommend it.  I had lots of fun playing it, but the more I played the more glaring issues came to light.  While they aren't game breaking they are there.\n\nPros:\n\n-Graphics are amazing\n-polished gameplay\n-great voice acting\n\nNeutral:\n-Story is a typical tomb raider.  While interesting it is sort of underwhelming.  The villains are very well done and well acted but I have issues with Lara's motivations which make no sense at some points and ridiculously selfish.  The twist with one of the charaters is seen hours before it is revealed.\n\nCons:\n- Way to easy.  I played on the second hardest difficulty and Lara is a roiling death machine.  While fun every now and then I breezed through the campaign.  The only time I really died was my own fault when I missed a jump or screwed up a quick time event.\n- The last act of the game is very similar to the final act of the first game.  Both involve fights on very similar arenas and levels.  A force of undead that sound very similar even while speaking different languages.  A long climb up a fortress.\n\nAll in all I would still recommend but I don't agree with other online reviews that gave it stellar reviews.","May 22","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

The new gameplay and item additions are fun to utilise, the main problem is experiencing glitches when climbing or trying to interact with certain items but these aren't game-breaking - just frustrating! The controls are otherwise simple.\n\nThe game does, however, feel super long. Compared to Tomb Raider 2013, there seems to be a lot more to do in regards to challenges, things to collect, optional missions etc, so the 100% can be tedious to some. I liked the story, but it does seem to feel less 'Tomb Raider-y' than its predecessor, built largely around conflict and not exploration. The 'evil organisation mercenary group' enemy also feels recycled from the last game.\n\nI also recommend the Endurance DLC if you like the survival-type tactics for a quick game, the score attack replays are also nice as they give you new objectives to complete - some extra stuff to play until the next game!\n\nOverall, great game.

The only problem I had with that game was that it gave the impression of survival, while also wanting to be a high adrealine action game - so in the early game, it was survival, then it quickly ramped up to action movie.\n\nThis game has the same problem - however I can look past it because we have already been through the first game, So Lara should be, as is a bit more hardened.\n\nSo - gameplay. What do I think? Well I honestly think that this game improves upon everything that Tomb Raider had. You now get to be sneaky in most combat situations, so you feel a bit more free in how you approach things. The optional dungeons are massive - and it generarily feels a lot more like a Tomb Raider experience.\nThe story feels  a bit dull - not exactly amazing. I really enjoy the whole "Language" thing - "You can't read this until you've learned more about the language".. Nice to see language play a role in a game.\n\nMy only downside really so far is that you can't change up the difficulty, at least not from Seasoned raider (the second hardest) to survival. Which is dumb; So if you're uncertain, start the game in the highest diffuclty, and then go down if it's too hard.","January 30","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeerTrivia/recommended/391220/","DeerTrivia","DeerTrivia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeerTrivia/","562 products in account","In a word: eh.\n\nAt first glance it's not much different than the 2013 reboot. And I'm always up for a sequel that's "More of the same, but a little bit better." While Rise of the Tomb Raider is definiteely more of the same, the problem is it isn't a little bit better. It's actually a little bit worse.\n\nMy main gripes:\n\n1. The story. It's not bad, it's just boring. Run of the mill. You will likely guess every plot twist well in advance, at least one of them hours before it happens. The characterization is all over the place - at any given moment, Lara's motivation might be to clear her father's name, to make her father proud, to make a difference, to make the *right* difference, revenge, she needs to give up everything to protect Jonah, she needs to abandon Jonah to go after the Source, on and on and on, pinballing all over the place. She goes from "Imagine what incredible scientific breakthrough the Divine Source might lead to!" to "It's not meant for humans, it's too dangerous!" almost instantaneously, with no real development between point A and point B. The supporting cast is bland on a stick. And there are lots of annoying little inconsistencies - "The Deathless Warriors" can be killed with a knife to the throat like anyone else. Despite having MIRV grenade arrows, you can't blow up ice - you can only jerry rig a trebuchet to swing a counterweight into the ice to break it.\n\n2. While the fundamentals of the gameplay are the same as the 2013 reboot, they're not really balanced all that well. I don't think I ever actually used any of the skills I unlocked, because I never needed them. I crafted one ammo pouch, which I ended up not really needing. Upgrades are borderline meaningless - it feels like the game was built from the ground up without them at all, and they just got tossed in. Never upgraded an outfit, never fully upgraded a weapon, only unlocked 5 different gear options... I guess maybe if you were to New Game Plus on the hardest difficulty, it might be worth it? I played on the Default difficulty, and the upgrade system might as well have not even existed.\n\nSimilarly, some of the gameplay the game suggests seems wholely unnecessary. "You can trap bodies to incapacitate guards who investigate." What? Why would I ever need to do that? I can stealth kill everyone in the room faster than it would take to even rig up one body. It would also be a terrible idea because the developers apparently think it's still the year 2000, and that when you break stealth, every enemy in a 5 mile radius should know your exact location, even if you break line of sight and hide from them. The one time I tried to kill a guard with a booby trap, I was in stealth when he died from it. Thirty freaking seconds later, enemies run around the corner (I'm still in stealth) and immediately see me and start firing at me.\n\n3. On the whole, I found the setting itself to be incredibly dull. Your mileage may vary on this one, but I thought the Syria prologue was frikkin' rad, and I couldn't wait for more like that. Nope! Your choices are snowy forest, glacier, less snowy forest, glacier, and ancient castle under glacier. From a technical standpoint the game is gorgeous, but artistically, I just kinda shrugged.\n\nAll of this said, it's not a *bad* game. There's nothing particularly broken about it, and the main mechanics work just as well as they did in 2013. It's just... meh. There's nothing particularly interesting about any of it. At its best, it's perfectly functional but a bit dull, and at its worst, it's mildly irritating.","February 5","false","9.1"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

Lara's face change. I mean, come on. TR 2013's face was so much better. I don't like the new round-face Lara one bit.\n3. Instead of $70, I would recommend to pay $40.

The story, no matter how long it is, is a little cliched. We've seen it all before.\n6. The best parts of the game is post-campaign when you're trying to 100% it.\n\nAnyway, I recommend this game.

I would have to give it 7/10 but would still recommend it.  I had lots of fun playing it, but the more I played the more glaring issues came to light.  While they aren't game breaking they are there.\n\nPros:\n\n-Graphics are amazing\n-polished gameplay\n-great voice acting\n\nNeutral:\n-Story is a typical tomb raider.  While interesting it is sort of underwhelming.  The villains are very well done and well acted but I have issues with Lara's motivations which make no sense at some points and ridiculously selfish.  The twist with one of the charaters is seen hours before it is revealed.\n\nCons:\n- Way to easy.  I played on the second hardest difficulty and Lara is a roiling death machine.  While fun every now and then I breezed through the campaign.  The only time I really died was my own fault when I missed a jump or screwed up a quick time event.\n- The last act of the game is very similar to the final act of the first game.  Both involve fights on very similar arenas and levels.  A force of undead that sound very similar even while speaking different languages.  A long climb up a fortress.\n\nAll in all I would still recommend but I don't agree with other online reviews that gave it stellar reviews.","May 22","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

The new gameplay and item additions are fun to utilise, the main problem is experiencing glitches when climbing or trying to interact with certain items but these aren't game-breaking - just frustrating! The controls are otherwise simple.\n\nThe game does, however, feel super long. Compared to Tomb Raider 2013, there seems to be a lot more to do in regards to challenges, things to collect, optional missions etc, so the 100% can be tedious to some. I liked the story, but it does seem to feel less 'Tomb Raider-y' than its predecessor, built largely around conflict and not exploration. The 'evil organisation mercenary group' enemy also feels recycled from the last game.\n\nI also recommend the Endurance DLC if you like the survival-type tactics for a quick game, the score attack replays are also nice as they give you new objectives to complete - some extra stuff to play until the next game!\n\nOverall, great game. My only complaint is 'what happened to Lara's face?' ;.;","May 22","true","45.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Players control Lara Croft through various environments, battling enemies, and completing puzzle platforming sections, while using improvised weapons and gadgets in order to progress through the story.\n\nThe game features a crafting system, allowing players to create items like different arrow types (poison, climbable, fire, grenade, rope) by scavenging materials from plants and animals in the game's harsh environment.\n\nThe in-game environment includes a weather system that both human and animal characters can react to and a day-night cycle. For example, to create a hardier winter coat Lara must hunt a wolf which only comes out during a specific time of day and specific weather condition. Lara can swim which will add to her mobility and combat tactics.\n\nCombat has been redesigned with more options for stealth and sneak attacks. Lara can confuse enemies using the environment, hide behind bushes or in trees, shooting bows on objects, throwing molotov cocktails and fog bottles or avoid combat altogether by climbing trees or traveling across roof tops. The bow and arrow return from Tomb Raider. The grappling hook, now known as a wire spool comes back for rope swinging after being absent from the series since Tomb Raider: Underworld. Options for multiple bows can be fashioned from specific animals and materials that Lara can hunt and salvage. Other weapons such as her pistol, shotgun, assault rifle and climbing axe make a return, plus an added hunting knife for melee or sneak attacks, a breather, and she can use a lock pick to open locked crates and doors.\n\nPlatforming also makes a return as mechanics like jumping forwards against a vertical wall and shimming and jumping from ledge to ledge as well as swinging on trapeze make a return. Quick time events and dodging also return to avoid deadly traps in the game and perform finishing attacks and counters.\n\n10/10","May 21","true","29.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

It's greatly improved from the first game while adding in great addictions that make it feel fun but not too new.\nPROS-\nLara Croft is now just a badass! Action happens pretty quickly in comparison to the first game, which doesn't make the game feel like it's repeating the same routine.\nTombs actually matter! You get perks for completing tombs, which I can't actually remember if it was a thing in Tomb Raider 1, but it definitely made raiding tombs feel a lot more necessary than before.\nHunting is actually fun, what with more types of animals and it being rewarding with crafting.\nSpeaking of which, crafting is oddly extensive and cool. You can make multiple different sets of clothes, ammuniciation, and other cool things.\nLooting is still fun.\nGun play is still exciting and somewhat tactical. I always prefer using the bow and arrow over everything else\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous. One of the best looking games of the year, easily.\n\nCons-\nThe game is extremely graphically demanding. 980's are still having trouble running this at a stable 60 max at 1080p. I'm running a mid range rig, so I had to scale the graphics down to high and lower the res. Game still looks amazing regardless.\nThe regular difficulty of this game is insanely easy so far. Way easier than it was in the original tomb raider.\nThe assault rifle/semi seems kinda bad compared to your trusty bow and arrow, shotgun, and pistol/revolver. I hardly bother with it compared to every other weapon.\n\nOverall, I'm really enjoying Rise of the Tomb Raider. It's a great sequel to a awesome game. Hopefully there's more patches in the future that'll give this game even better optimization, as I feel this game should be playable at 1080p with even mid range rigs. Regardless, I highly recommend this game.\n8.5 out of 10.","February 1","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only problem I had with that game was that it gave the impression of survival, while also wanting to be a high adrealine action game - so in the early game, it was survival, then it quickly ramped up to action movie.\n\nThis game has the same problem - however I can look past it because we have already been through the first game, So Lara should be, as is a bit more hardened.\n\nSo - gameplay. What do I think? Well I honestly think that this game improves upon everything that Tomb Raider had. You now get to be sneaky in most combat situations, so you feel a bit more free in how you approach things. The optional dungeons are massive - and it generarily feels a lot more like a Tomb Raider experience.\nThe story feels  a bit dull - not exactly amazing. I really enjoy the whole "Language" thing - "You can't read this until you've learned more about the language".. Nice to see language play a role in a game.\n\nMy only downside really so far is that you can't change up the difficulty, at least not from Seasoned raider (the second hardest) to survival. Which is dumb; So if you're uncertain, start the game in the highest diffuclty, and then go down if it's too hard.","January 30","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/recommended/391220/","grenadeh","Grenadeh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grenadeh/","961 products in account","Great sequel. Anyone who knows me knows I get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and rage at games very easily and this is probably the least I've raged at a game. It's not that it's absurdly easy - it is, for the record. It's that the puzzles and tombs and platforming in this game were all very organic and logical and there is never a moment where you're wondering where the hell to go.\n\nCD seems to have taken a lot of inspiration from other games like Last of Us with the realtime crafting of explosives and ammo, and all of the new game mechanics mesh wonderfully with the old without feeling like they were added just for the sake of not trying to repeat TR2013 again. For example you collect magnesite to craft exploding arrows, or you can craft them with grenades, and the generic supply system of 2013 has been replaced with one that actually requires specific items from the environment/animals to make certain items or upgrades.\n\nStory is about as good as it gets with a Tomb Raider/Indiana Jones storyline and again Crystal Dynamics has put some work into making Lara feel like a relatable, actual person as opposed to the original Tomb Raider franchise.\n\nThe graphics are spectacular, on par with Witcher 3 if not better - especially when it comes to the effects. The hair physics is still completely borked though. You'll randomly see Lara's hair fly off to one side for no reason when there isn't even that much wind, for example, or it will just start moving around at weird angles. It's not much more than a hilarious little detail.\n\nThe weapon arsenal isn't much to talk about but you get about 4 weapons per category and they can all be customized with multiple tiers of upgrades, to better kick ♥♥♥ with.  Skill trees from the last game are back too with some slight changes, overall it feels like the same game but with a lot less time spent whining and crying around an island, and more time getting to the action.\n\nThis time around the awesome CG intro has been swapped out for a playable prologue that has some of the best visuals in the game, and everything stays entertaining from there until the end.\n\nMy only realy complaint is that they said there would be more tombs in this game. The only way that statement is true is if you count every tiny little alcove and cave as a tomb, because I can't remember any of them being longer than any tomb in the previous game, or harder, except the part where you are climbing on the moving observatory parts. There weren't more tombs, it's that simple, but they at least shifted the focus off of murdering everything that breathes and back towards the story and exploring the environment. To the extent that they could.\n\nWould buy again.","February 6","true","39.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example, there are more weapons, gadgets, larger map, varried enemies including wildlife, varried ways to defeat enemies, and a great number of things to do aside from the main quest including Tomb Raiding (finally) and one dimensional side quests, and by one dimensional I mean one tier under Bethesda-level quests given that as of late Bethesda\'s quests have been rather inadequate by RPG standards.\n\nThere is great freedom to complete objectives in a many number of ways however the player sees fit. For example, when faced with a puzzle, the player can complete it in several ways (i.e there is no single way the puzzle can be completed, but there is a single correct answer, which is understandably limiting but still a touch of liberty on the developer\'s part). Another example is the player\'s choice to complete objectives stealthily by assassinating enemies, avoiding enemies, or slaughter anything that moves, while still mainitaing Lara\'s vulnerability and feminine stature, while not using her as a sex toy.\n\nThe only limitations is slight stuttering or framrate drop in some areas/cutscenes which detract from the brilliant story campaign, and a limited number of other modes aside from exploration (there is a challenge mode, but its rather repetitive)  but other than that it is a must play for adventure gamers.\n\n8.5/10","May 31","true","41.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I disagree. Yes it has one of the most stunning graphics ever made in a game but doesn't go much further.\n\nThe story is SO much worse. It's predictable with little to no mistery and the development has little pace differences. To make things worse, the scenarios and dangers that Lara goes through feels all the same: insane elevated areas that keep falling apart and too much shooting. I miss the intriguing puzzles from older tomb raiders. This scenario would be perfect for a lot of good puzzles.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty similar but actually got worse because they added so many scattered items all over. I usually enjoy crafting mechanics but the gather and craft gameplay feels like it doesn't belong in this fast paced adventure making it feeling like a chore. Overall, the only really intense part was fighting the bear. :(\n\ntl;dr\nGraphics,Performance - 9/10\nSound,Immersion - 8/10\nGameplay - 5/10\nStory,Narrative - 4/10","January 30","false","12.7"," 66 of 133 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","66","133","4","0"

The story is highly derivative of pretty much any adventure movie that has ever been made; from Lara's daddy issues to the absolute rip off of Lost Ark style ending and just doesn't do anything worthwhile.  I can't say the narrative promotes character growth for Lara either because there is a massive disconnect between the gameplay and the narrative.  The story wants you to see the Rise of the Tomb Raider, but Lara pretty much from start to finish is girl-Rambo.  She has sacrificed all of her distinctive style from the previous games to become a Call of Duty soldier, who without any real experience or training, can demolish entire armies on her own.  As an example, there is a historical depiction where the assassin sent by Trinity and chasing the prophet details how he managed to kill one of the deathless of Kitezh but barely survived it, however this comes after Lara has killed at least a half dozen of the "deathless" already.  So the story wasn't very good, and the gameplay didn't back up the story. Lara at no point struggled with becoming a mass murdering eff-head as the narrative wanted to depict.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics were also too loose and not well designed enough.  Often for no reason Lara would fall off of a ledge or wall she was hanging on to, or just not catch or grapple axe the target.  Combat was sloppy, with dodge counters appearing somewhat randomly when dodging instead of consistantly, but none of it really mattered as there was almost no real challenge in the combat anyway.  On a totally subjective scale, I didn't really find any of the combat mechanics; not stealth, not melee, not shooting, to be much fun in this game.  The stealth was very rudimentary.  Also the extreme overuse of set piece battles and overly specific ways of defeating anything except the basic footsoldiers just sucked all the creativity and fun out of combat.  As much as the game tried to feel sandboxy, it was railroaded in all aspects. The skill trees weren't even decisions, just check boxes, since you could get pretty much everyhting you wanted from all of them. The final battle was essentially a cutscene QTE against Konstantin.\n\nI don't usually care much about graphic stuff, almost everything these days I find to be good enough for my tastes, but there was something seriously wrong with the optimization, if there was any done, on the PC.  The game was in a near constant state of frame rate drop the entire time.\n\nThe game on the whole was just not very good.  There was a ton of hype about it, likely because female protagonist Lara Croft is super appealing with SJW's and liberal PC politics right now, which is cool, but not without a solid game backing it up, which just isn't present here.  Tomb Raider and Lara Croft have lost something of what made them both unique and interesting in this new series, I can only hope the devs can find there way back to making these properties great again.","February 14","false","63.0"," 27 of 55 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","27","55","2","0"

Infact, I think this game went a step backwards or two. The combat is still somewhat solid but the game is quite easy even on Seasoned Raider difficulty (Second-hardest difficulty in the game by the way). The story is bland and boring and the tombs are still ♥♥♥♥ing optional though they did improve them a little in this game.\n\nThe graphics when maxed out look absolutely gorgeous. Sadly, Nixxes (The ones who did the excellent PC ports of Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Tomb Raider 2013) dropped the ball for this pc port. Even when lowering it down to medium-low graphics, the game ran like ♥♥♥♥ for the most part. There's also two specific areas in the game that are so badly optimized that my FPS dropped down to the low 20s and stayed there and to be honest, the areas in this game aren't that much more detailed than in the 2013 game.\n\nSpeaking of the areas, Siberia was not as interesting as the island in the first game and wears out its welcome in the first few hours in the game. I honestly thought the prologue chapter starts off a little promising but then starts to lose it slowly when you get to Siberia. In this game, there are NPCs that give you quests but they are mainly just bland fetch-quests which give you some decent rewards that you might need if you're gonna get certain weapon upgrades and stuff. These quests also bog down the pacing greatly and makes the game a slog at times. Honestly, they should cut the metroidvania stuff since it doesn't work very well in these games and they should go back to the variety of different locations in the previous games.\n\nThankfully, they heavily toned down the QTEs in this game as there are only a few in the very beginning of the game and the very end and they finally fixed the button prompts so that you can actually see which button you are supposed to press. There's also much less combat this time around for the most part until the end which then they just drag on and ♥♥♥♥ing on and you just want it to end. Like the previous game, the combat is just your standard over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter that you've seen in the last couple of years.\n\nThere is still hand-holding even when you turn off survival instints and that show game prompts option or whatever its called. Lara doesn't shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and gives you hints while you're doing the puzzles and the puzzles themselves are not any harder than the ones in the 2013 game. The tombs themselves are slightly better designed this time around but most of them are still easy to do for the most part.\n\nThe platforming is still as simplified as the one in the 2013 game aside from a new tool or two that spices up the platforming a bit. There is quite a bit more exploration this time around but the areas themselves as I said before, are not that interesting to explore in the first place. Also, why are there no dual-pistol badass old-school Lara moments like they promised at the end of the first game? They just rehash the whole Lara becoming a survivor theme all over again but with no "OH MAH GOD, I KILLED SOMEONE" dialogue (Thankfully).\n\nOverall, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a disappointing sequel that doesn't really improve all that much from the first game. If you want more of the same stuff, this game will give you some enjoyment out of it but if you were expecting this game to go back to its roots and see Lara become the Tomb Raider we all know and love, then you will be pretty disappointed.","February 10","false","23.5"," 17 of 35 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","17","35","4","5"

READ THE TITLE OF THE GAME, IT IS.\n\n\nLet's start placing the game: we've a 80% snow adventure and a 20% of enviroment variation but we've to say that that's totally normal because we are in Syberia, Russia.\n\nWhat are we going to find? Our expected secuel? Yes, we are going to find an adventorous Lara SPOILER: 	looking for his father reason to "commit suicide" (F*CK YOU ANNA), that's the thing that Lara's to discover\n\nDoes this story has any kind of sense? Yes, totally yes. I'm agree with the fact of "Tomb Raider 2013 has a veeery stupid history, it's not bad but it's not great" but this story is different. Why? Because it's a perfect story to continue our actual storyline from the young Lara and then, become the classic and iconic Lara. There's no reason to hate this story because it has a lot of sense and it is very deep and fully of flashbacks that will help us understand the mind of Lara during the story. Also, I've to say that the characters are simply great and friendly, you're going to fall in love (or hate them) with them for sure.\n\nGraphics? I've played the game in custom settings but with a medium-graphic preset so yes, I've played it on mediums and dear reader, it's such a masterpiece. It looks simply great with all those INSANE character models and ilumination, also, you feel like you're in the middle of Syberia.\n\nIs still Lara inmoral? Yes, expected question. Sometimes you see an Idiana Jones or a Nathan Drake but guys, we know that Lara is better than those two c*nts (fanboy opinion :P)\n\nDoes it work fine? The game works fine but there's FPS drops in a few cinematics, but this is going to be patched for sure (I'm writting this the 1st of January 2016)\n\nIs it hard? For me it was easier than Tomb Raider 2013 and that's a little disgusting. If you were an active Tomb Raider fan in PS2, ... you're going to find it very easy.\n\nWhat about microtransactions? To everyone who says that you have to spend extra money on the game: you are a lier. You don't have to pay an extra money in order to play the game correctly, you'll only have to buy those two DLCs if you want to complete all the archievements on the game (bad aspect) but it won't interfere in the main storyline of the game. Also, you can buy cards in the extra gamemode (free gamemode, it's part of the game, not a DLC) with real money or CREDITS FROM THE GAME WHICH ARE RECEIVED JUST BY PLAYING THE GAME (there's also card that you get if you own, for example, Life Is Strange, another Crystal Dinamics game)\n\nHow long is it? I've spent 11'2 hours to complete the game with a 61% in one run. Now it's time to get all the archievements which are not easy as they look. It's not short but it's not as long as a game like Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain but we can't compare these two games.\nIt's long enough and, if you want to buy the Baba Yaga DLC, you'll have 3 more hours of game.\n\nFINAL NOTE: As a good Tomb Raider fan I'm going to give a 9'75 and consider it a must-play game in the videogame history because it's the continue of the reborn from the ashes of a mithic and an iconic saga.\n\nGood stuff:\nHistory\nGeneral optimization\nGraphics\nGame mechanics\nCharacters\nMap\nLong enough\nBad stuff:\nBad optimization only in a few parts of the game (most of them cinematics)\nDifficult?

The graphics are stunning, I am loving playing it on my monitor, and I have only noticed a few performance issues, but nothing that, so far, would make me refund the game.\n\nMy big problem comes with the story, and that the developers decided to make Christianity the butt of this entire game. I feel like, at least for some people, this will put them off from the game--and I find it ironic that, in our PC climate, people are told not to talk bad about religion unless it is Christianity: thus this game, while not representing what I believe, does in some ways mock what millions of Christians the world over believe (overtly in some respects.)\n\nI think, for me, that was the biggest letdown of this game--the fact that such beautiful graphics and user-interface mechanics are marred by such obvious anti-Christian bias.\n\nOverall, would I recommend this game?

But with a lot more adrenaline. You (a younger Lara Croft) are climbing snowy siberian mountains, dive into long forgotten ancient sewers (yikes) collect old relicts and fight competing mercenary-vault hunters in the search of eternal life. All the while it is mixed with some ( not too many ) quick time events. And if normal or hard difficulty is way to easy for you ...go try the survival mode. Yes, it's exactly what you think it is. Hunt deer and make shelters to survive. The controls are well designed and feel almost natural.\n\nGraphics 9 of 10\n\nThis makes the game really really shine. They are simply breathtaking, from the blazing sun in the desert in Syria to the glistening snow in Siberia. Old murky water actually looks exactly the way it should look. The rays of light, the little animals that surround you in Syria..it's just unbelievable how good and smooth it actually looks.

As an old school Tomb Raider fan, I found literally nothing to like here. I miss the saturday morning cartoon vibe, the sense of isolation, the epic multi staged puzzles which took hours to complete, and those daring risky jumps. What we have now is  gathering/crafting/looting/brooding killing machine, with really bad combat scenario design,awful weapon feedback and constant explosions for no reason. It's not a game anymore, its just a product. But it looks incredible .","February 28","false","16.9"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","2"

If you're okay with spending $60 for a 12 hour game, this game would be perfect for you, 8.5/10.\n\n\n\n\nThe game itself is great, however as for other single player games, this would be a hard fought victory to consider it worth your money. I played the game on the default difficulty, fully taking my time and completing some of the optional challenge tombs, and the game only took me 11 1/2 hours to complete. Hours may vary depending on the difficulty, however I do not see it exceeding 16 hours for the main story on even the highest difficulty.\n\nThere also isn't much to do in the post game to extend playtime. There are a few other side quests and challenge tombs to be completed, however the challenge tombs arent interesting enough to keep my attention and the quests are a bit tedious.\n\nI personally bought the game for $40 and thought that was an aboslute steal of a deal, however after calculating it myself, I conclude that although even that being 33% cheaper than the list price, it still isn't worth it, unless of course you plan on 100%-ing the game.\n\n\nMain story: 11 hours (plus extras 15-20 hours (100% 30 hours))\nGraphics: 9/10 (Feb 2016)\nStory: 8\nGameplay: 9/10\nBugs/glitches: -2 (can be retracted as bugs are fixed)\n\nMain Story: $11\nGraphics: $4\nStory: $4.5\nGameplay: $4.25\nBugs/glitches: -$2 (can be retracted as bugs are fixed)\n\nTotal: Worth $21.75 ($26-$41 based off hours)","February 5","false","14.0"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

I was somewhat disappointed after playing the game myself. While they point out the high ratings from IGN and Game informer, I myself cannot believe that these ratings were legit.\n\nThe story was decent, but I miss the danger that was thrown at you frequently in Tomb Raider (2013), Yet it doesn't really connect with each other, and it would've made more sense if you ask me. What even happened with the crew from the first game? The only one that seemed to return is Jonah, but where is the rest? Lara's immortality already gifted her for not freezing to death or surviving a dozen gunshots to the face. While in The first one you could easily die after being injured.\n\nThe upgrades and tools that have been added are fun to use, but I wish that there were more interesting ways to achieve them.\nThe game's ending was also very disappointing, and even after the credits, it just looks as if they are hinting towards another sequel. Whether or not this is real - I leave up to the others...\n\nBut again, the game's ending felt like a flop, not even an intense boss battle, oh no. Instead, you face off against a helicopter which is way too easy to destroy. While in the reboot you had to fight off a stormgarurd that was eager to smash your face in.\n\nThe open world is beautiful and it contains a lot of detail. But as luck would take it, graphic card only for the ultimate are able to enjoy the full extend. While we are forced to lower our settings for a stable fps, with no luck. Forcing me to play at a rough 50 fps, with a resolution of 1024x720. so if a GTX 750 TI 2GB doesn't help along, then I don't know what is wrong with games these days. Weird, cause Tomb Raider Reboot ran smooth as butter on high quality settings, but whatever, this is up to the developers.\n\nI guess I can say that I enjoyed playing, but at the same time I wished for a more challenging experience, instead of repeating the same things over and over again.\n","January 31","false","33.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","2"

They spent too much time making trillions of gadgets and forgot about other things. I can't believe the story of this tomb raider is the story of the year. It's full of genre stereotypes and flaws. It is simply boring.  Haven't played on consoles, but the pc version of the game is full of bugs, lags and artefacts. The previous part was almost perfect and they ruined this one. I greatly regret buying this game.\n\nFour high-poligonal asses out of ten.","February 19","false","10.0"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","4"
