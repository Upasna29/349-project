It takes about an hour to play through the game for the first time, and then much less since you know how to do everything. You have to replay the two final chapters at least two times to get all achievements, which is a bit annoying but not too bad if you know what to do. All in all, it takes around 90-120 minutes to get all achievements.\n\nWould I recommend BasketBelle? As a game, no. The gameplay is nice and a bit varied, but it is too short, Once you went through the game, you saw it all, there is no replay value.\nAs a piece of art, yes. Definitely play through it once, enjoy the (crazy but not too good) story, the art style and how the unusual visuals, the gameplay and the music fit together!\n\nRecommended: Play through it if you have it. If you don't have it, wait for a good sale or skip this title entirely.\n(I wished there was a neutral option on Steam, but so I vote yes!)","January 15, 2015","true","1.6"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","32","38","5","0"

One word I would use to describe it is charming. It's a short game, roughly 1 hour, give or take if you try for the final achievement, but it's very well made. This review is a short overview - there's not too much to cover given the game's length, but the execution and charm more than make up for it. Definitely worth playing if you already own it, or if you get on sale - the full price would be fine for people that don't mind game length so much.\n\nThe story follows a young lad trying to find/ rescue his sister after she is kidnapped. The story has lots of warm moments, and I was pleasantly surprised how in such a short span of time, such vivid feelings were conveyed. You'll see what happens when you play the game, there's not much to elaborate without giving away everything, but the story was sweet and warm.\n\nThe gameplay uses several mechanics of basketball, and the controls are fairly simple - run right and left, slide, and jump-shot. The simple controls are the basis of some puzzles in the game, and overall I found that it made sense that there weren't complicated controls. The levels all have some different settings and layout, and you'll get the general feeling once you play. Again I was impressed with how the devs progressed the levels and story, and they fit together nicely, in such a short span of time.\n\nOverall, I really recommend this game - it's short but the story is charming, the gameplay engaging. This is an example of an indie game made with love and care, and it conveys the feeling to the player well.\n\n~If you enjoyed this review, please check out the Completing the Backlog curator page, for other nice reviews by me and others!~","November 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","23","24","0","1"

BasketBelle is a charming, unique, and interesting game that does just that. Essentially a story of a young, dunk-obsessed boy searching for his sister, this short but sweet game offers gameplay that’s entirely its own. With a paper-cutout Paris as its backdrop and a collection of strange, surreal monsters and puzzles, this curious and charming game is truly original and deeply intriguing.\n\nBasketBelle opens with a short narrative bit showing our hero learning the basics of basketball from his father. After a new member of the family, Belle, is introduced, we see our young protagonist practicing his skills with her as she grows. A bizarre happening one day when their beloved orange ball rolls away from the family hoop leads to a mind-bending adventure against tentacle-like monsters, leading our champion on a quest to reunite with his lost sister, overcoming puzzles with his court-earned abilities and attempting to rescue her from the twisting grasp of these unearthly beasts.\n\nBasketBelle, while short, is broken into several chapters, each of which featuring a unique set of rules and challenges to overcome. The first chapter sets up learning how to play and getting the hang of the controls with straightforward basketball action. Later chapters feature everything from block-pushing puzzles to sky-soaring chases, each making use of these same skills and abilities. You’ll run, jump, slide, and shoot your way to the end of each chapter, getting ever closer to finding your lost sister, armed only with her cute yellow backpack and your father’s treasured basketball.\n\nWhat makes BasketBelle unique is, frankly, nearly everything. With a great, if simple, art style, curious mechanics, and soothing downtempo soundtrack, there’s nothing in the game that seems like anything else I’ve played. While the rules and play within each chapter are consistent, the constant shift from one chapter to the next keeps the play engaging and fresh as you progress. Throwing in a heartfelt story of family and love, this title brings a whole court of imaginative features that stand out as a truly special experience.\n\nWith its one-of-a-kind art and play, BasketBelle creates a fantastical, strange, and touching story. While it’s short, the 4,99€ price includes the game, soundtrack, digital sketchbook, and a making-of featurette by developer Bean. You’re not likely to get a ton of play, but by keeping the price low and tossing in these extras, you’re certainly not throwing away your money by picking this one up. A definite recommendation for those with an appreciation of games as art, my only disappointment here is that there’s not more of it to explore.","February 17","true","14.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","16","17","0","0"

Despite being extremely competitive and athletic there's just something about traditional sports that bores me to tears. That said, there's always been something almost ethereal to me about shooting hoops with a basketball, transcending my typical dislike of sports into something simply delightful. BasketBelle sort of taps into that sort of feeling, beginning as a basic basketball game but quickly veering into strange and imaginative directions with only an ever bouncing sphere to keep us grounded.\n\nThere's a very heartfelt elegance to BasketBelle, as if the adventure we're going on is as unknown and limitless to the developer as it is to us. Though it takes but thirty minutes to play through, every moment of the experience is so creative and sweetly framed that it conveys a far more meaningful and touching narrative than its brief length would have you expect. The relationship between the nameless protagonist and his little sister, Belle, is beautiful in its playful innocence, not needing to be complex or troubled to turn these faceless purple people into characters I could relate to and which made me smile.\n\nSure, BasketBelle's gameplay is fairly limited, its controls anything but smooth, and its length incredibly brief, but none of that really mattered to me. The imagination and love flowing through the constantly evolving journey was all I needed to allow me to sink into its gorgeous backgrounds as I dribbled with alien monsters, learned to fly, and bonded with my sister all in time for bed. I would have gladly spent much longer in such a delightful world, but what's here is an almost perfect expression of a developer's odd idea that turned into something rather lovely.

It's a short game, but there are three different endings depending on your score on level 7.

While the exact game genre varies depending on your current objective, it usually varies between a puzzle game with mild platforming elements and an action game in which you have to dodge obstacles.\n\nGenerally I'm not the biggest fan of art games, but the scenes of the main character with his family were well-done and clicked with me, and the plot steadily getting more and more over-the-top was pretty great, too. The music is also amazingly synchronized to the gameplay action, as apparently the game design started out as an experiment in, well, synchronizing music with gameplay action.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend BasketBelle if you're in the mood for a short and well-crafted interactive experience - the only real downside is that it doesn't have all that much replay value and is only about 30 minutes long, but on the other hand, that's exactly how long it should be.","December 9, 2014","true","1.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

As the name suggests, this one is all about basketball, which is reflected in everything in the game.\n\nThe creator managed to capture the essence of the mid-90s– often referred to as the golden age of basketball– without somehow invoking all the bad of that era. The art style is hip, but not obtrusive. The music is upbeat, but not ciphering. The dialogues are laid-back, but just in the right way.\n\nOne of the biggest complaints I have about BasketBelle is that it starts horribly as a game: the tutorial sets the right mood, but the next stage is just a boring and tedious puzzle platformer.

It has a beautiful art-style, a touching and engaging narrative and a wonderful soundtrack.  The basketball themed platforming gameplay is enjoyable, but I also don't think that the gameplay is what really drives this game, rather the narrative and ambience.  The game itself is around 30 minutes long, and I easily got all the achievement in the game within an hour.\n\nI can't recommend this game to everyone, as I know not everyone shares my values when it comes to games.  While the game has 3 endings, after seeing all of them, I don't think there is much replay value.  And while the game is very inexpensive (and in my opinion, well worth full price), others may not find the amount of gameplay justifiable for the price.  In my opinion, though, there are a few games (like Gone Home and Thomas was Alone) that allow you to look back and value the experience as a whole long after you have completed the game, and Basketbelle is another addition to that list.  So, if you are the type of person that resented Gone Home for the game-time/money ratio, than you may not be that into this game (although 5 bucks is hard to beat).\n\nMy other (somewhat) warning is that I think reading the genre as platformer may be somewhat misleading to peoples' expectations.  This game is definitely unique, and plays differently than any other platformer.  It is not a difficult game by any stretch of the imagination, and I think that with many games (like Super Meat Boy) the gameplay comes first, where as with Basketbelle, the gameplay is very much secondary, and is a vehicle for the experience.  The gameplay is good, but definitely secondary.\n\nAnyways, that is enough trying to appeal to people that are unlike me in a review, if you are at all an 'indie game nerd', this game is a no-brainer.  I loved the concept, the aesthetic, the story, and how all of these were carried out.  I also think that the price is worth it for the EP alone, this game has a great soundtrack.  There were also some neat little touches, like, when your character idled, the sound of him dribbling the ball formed a clave against the soundtrack.  I decided to play this game after really enjoying Soundodger+ (also by Studio Bean) and its sound track, and was not disappointed at all.  If you want to try something new and fresh, this is definitely a game to check out.","December 23, 2014","true","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I remember begging all of my friends to vote for this game on greenlight.  I had never played it before on Desura or otherwise until it came out on Steam.  I was hoping for an extremely unique experience and i was not disappointed.\n\nBasketbelle is a game of its own.  If it were to be categorized it would be....well it would be it's own genre.  One could say "music based", or "platformer", "puzzle",  or even "sports".   It has the basics of all of those, but in reality it is none of those in a complete sense.  Music plays throughout the game, and to the beat of your dribbles, but the game is not totally dependent on that.  There are platforming elements in the game, but those become more based on solving puzzles than the platforming itself.\n\nYou shoot baskets to complete levels and beat enemies, but those baskets are just as much about the puzzles and platforming as they are about the shots themselves.   The music also plays its role in how you play.\n\nThe graphics in this game are what you may call "minimalistic" but in the many many years ive been gaming i've never seen an art style/graphics quite like this.  The look it has is truly unique.\n\nThe game itself is a complete circle of multiple elements from multiple genres put together to create a totally unique game.  It is very short (I beat it in less than an hour) but if you like fresh, well made games this is well worth the price of admission for 5 bucks.\n\nPlease upvote this if you agree with my review and/or like this game!

You take on the role of a young, purple b-baller roaming the streets of Paris in search of his lost sister. Each of the game's scenes requires you to run, jump, slide, and dunk to beat your opponents, usually amorphous purple blobs standing in your way. The mechanics are simple but are tested in many different ways, sometimes in battles on the court, sometimes in platforming puzzles, and sometimes in high-speed flight sequences.\n\nTo describe the game any further would be to spoil the themes or the story. And that would be quite the disservice, considering the game is only about thirty minutes long. Most of the gameplay is very straightforward, and I only found myself briefly stuck on one particular puzzle. The art style is excellent and the sound design supports it well. Obviously BasketBelle isn't going to keep you busy for long or become your new favorite game, but if you get the chance to play it, it's well worth the time for the surreal journey and adorable story.","February 23","true","0.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The Indigestion chapter was one of the most clever puzzle platformer sequences I've seen in a while.  The flight chapters were thrilling and clever in execution.\n\nThe basketball mechanics throughout whether minimal or front-and-center in the level were intuitive and fluid.  Even the tutorial and source of title was melded into the narrative.\n\nWhich comes to the point that the story indeed steals the show.  The flashes of the boy remembering his sister, the loving father, the banter of siblings.  Even the enemies have a background that makes sense.\n\nBe prepared to feel for these characters.  Not what you might expect from a platformer that can take less than an hour to complete.\n\nStudio Bean made a sports game relevant in a platformer space with a touching story to boot.  Kudos.\n\nNOTE - For those who care about bang for the buck, this week there's even less excuse with IndieGala's Monday bundle that I bought for around $2. ;)","June 23, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also has a really nice music-basketball sound interaction.\n\nHowever, I'm not broadly recommending it. It has some really confusing spots, a less than ideal camera angle, and the basketball mechanic isn't introduced very clearly (even in the end I don't know how to win vs the "mirror" me - what blocks and what doesn't). It's also painfully short, only realy 5-6 puzzles and you're done, and a more than healthy dose of repetition in some of the most boring bits.\n\nIn summary, for 2d platformer fans this is an interesting curio, for everyone else, there are many better 2d platformers.","June 22, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
