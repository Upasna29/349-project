Lots of glitches (running through walls, character background not transparent) and an extremely limited, linear game 'world'. You have at best three locations you can visit. The boss fights are without any depth. Overall a very poor experience.

But as time moves along, pieces of this puzzle are revealed, drawing you in as the player. A very well told tale indeed with twists, turns, good humor, and emotion.\n\n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward, but there are many secrets to discover along the way ---- so a careful inspection of all areas is advisable.\n\n\nArtwork is very nicely done, and the music is pleasant and stays in the background, where it should be.\n\n\nBattle scenes are nicely done, with all the available options apparent and easy to use.\n\n\nThe characters in the game are so fully developed that it could be said that the game is character driven. As you go deeper into the game, it is quite easy to begin to care about Scarllet and Beatrice (the 2 sisters) and several other members of the various parties. And you don't always see that.\n\n\nI would heartily recommend this game to anyone of any age, especially to those (like myself) that enjoy the old school rpgs. It is a delight in all the important ways. Give this one (and any Aldorlea offering) a chance, and I think you'll be glad you did.","March 10, 2015","true","6.3"," 42 of 59 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","42","59","2","0"

I found myself playing this game for many hours at a time enjoying the battle system and story.\nThe game features 10 different playable characters (though only 9 will be selectable in the end), and a unique Crest System that allows you to customize 4 different spells per party member, in addition to their own built-in abilities.\nI was also happy to see that I could often repeat areas for battles, and in case I missed anything.\nThe game has a large world to explore, though you are mostly limited where you can go for most of the game.\n\nNow, I would like to speak about the negatives.\n\nThe RPG maker engine is old and tired. The limitations this engine has continues to disappoint me.\nYou can not use the Steam Overlay with this game, which means no Screenshots, Broadcasting, or talking to your friends without using Alt-tab.\nThe game also lacks seperate audio options for the sound effects and music for some reason, but this is a developer choice because I have played other RPG Maker games where this option was present.\nThe lack of enemy variety is not impressive. I found all battle areas to only have one or two different enemy types at best, and once you know the best method to kill them, the battles will be very quick and painless. Most battles will be over in 1-2 hits, which leads to a lack of strategy.\nThe music in this game is terrible, especially the default battle theme. I found every track to be far too loud and annoying, or just annoying.\nThe sound effects on the other hand are very quiet and for the most part barely even there.\nThe Crest System can be annoying, because this game likes to split party members often and if certain party members suddenly leave, they take the crests they have equipped with them. You can deal with this by saving and reloading often however.\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys these types of games, and expect some quality too. There are a lot of RPG Maker games that are terrible, but this is NOT one of them.\n\nThis game is one of the few that shines above the rest.","February 20","true","27.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

Most of the dungeons are fairly straighforward, and battles aren't exactly hard, even the optional ones. On the other had, this is probably plus for the less experienced players.\nSo, if you are looking for an easy-to-play "casual" game with good story, this is a game for you.","May 19, 2015","true","9.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

There they'll discover secrets better left hidden, both within the Brotherhood and in the world. While they'll remain separated for most of the game, the story still follows them as they join up with new companions.\n\nVagrant Hearts is, for the most part, your typical turn-based RPG title. The thing that makes it stand out most is the Crest system. You can equip 4 crests to one character at a time, though the most useful crests are definitely the Light/Dark damaging ones, and those that can cause Paralyze or Poison. Those two status effects are extremely strong and will greatly aid in taking down battles that might otherwise decimate you. Unfortunately with how much the party splits up, Crests will get left behind on the other team, meaning you'll have to balance out who has what.\n\nWhile I do recommend this title, I recommend trying to find it on sale (as it seems to be on sale frequently enough). The story is enjoyable enough, although there are numerous spelling and grammar errors. There are also a couple sprite issues that come up - two characters still have their white background, with one of them gaining it after not initially having the issue. As said, however, the game is still enjoyable enough, and definitely worth picking up and playing if you can get it on sale.\n\nJust be warned it does leave a major cliffhanger for Vagrant Hearts 2!","October 23, 2015","true","16.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Now the reason why when your fighting the monters or boss's there one or two things off in the battle mode the monsters are either out of place or half of it is off screen to not fully see the monster, and that they're overpowerd where you have to be at least 5 lvls ahead of the current boss ur facing. Also when facing a boss you might as well quit or get really lucky because I faced the necormancer at the keep and tried to mute her took like 30 times before getting her then with her she aoe's and mute's which get most of my party to where I can't do squat.\n\nThe second one goes hand in hand with the first for example if your playing the first time and spent all your money on the current party and then you flip over to the other uh oh you got nothing other then the items you have just bought or the items you just switched out that might be useless for the other, and that you burn through ur items to quickly and wont have enough saved for the other party.\n\nNow since I  adressed that the should have been encounter system like in ff series when your on the world map and when walking around you fight a monster. This idea should be implemented because it would at least solve the inventory problem and make it lvling up easier and you be more stronger at facing boss's.\n\nOther then that the only other things is like artwork hiccups where their is a white box over a character or as I said earlier dont see the monster fully.\n\nI still like the game either way and still playing it now, and if the problems I mentioned were fixed I will love this game even more.\n\n","April 29","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
