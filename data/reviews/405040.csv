"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/405040/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","Cold Dreams is a horror adventure game made with CryEngine. The game centers around a man, who is having a dream of a bright light. He soon discovers he is also being antagonized by a darker spirit, who's goal is to keep him in his dreams forever. He must uncover the reasoning behind his followings by following the path of the white light, and wake up from his dream.\n\nThe concept of the story is great, it's got a few scares in it, and has a beautiful atmosphere. The only downside to this game is it's very very short. If you follow the light the whole way, it can take you no longer than 20 minutes to complete the game. That being said, the asking price of $3 is very reasonable, or if not your cup of tea, you can also find it cheaper on other sites.","December 5, 2015","true","8.5"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","33","39","4","0"

As it apparently has no save feature, one would presume it to be a single-sitting game, and I’ve not had the opportunity to complete it after about the first thirty to forty minutes. But I’ve certainly enjoyed what I’ve seen so far and look forward to starting again, and playing through to completion while sitting in a dark, quiet room.\n\nThe premise to “Cold Dreams” is a man “waking” into a recurring dream. The dream is of a very cold winter forest during a snowstorm. His only guide is a moving ball of light. If it were that simple this game wouldn’t have much interest, but the light isn’t often seen, and the vast majority of the time there is no assurance the direction is correct, as paths are either too few, or too many. Soon a small village is encountered, as well as several bloody, brief notes to give a slight idea that something more is afoot.\n\nThe controls are very simple and basic, and the graphics, and graphics choices should satisfy anyone. The language choices are English and Russian. And that’s all there is, or that one should need.\n\nThe concept of the altered reality of a dream state is a great source of atmosphere, as is the weather, and cold which can very nearly be felt, and the carefully designed suspense of never being sure the correct path has been taken. The vagueness of any objectives, which can be anything is a dream, further adds to the creepy feeling. There are apparently several endings, and several achievements specific to discovering different endings, as well as objects. One of the reviews mentions that the voice acting gave him nightmares, which for a game of this type should be highest praise. Oddly, that review gave a negative view of the game without further comment, so perhaps it was simply the slight Russian accent that caused that gamer to respond with a personal prejudice. I found the voice acting to be fully adequate, and only WISH it gave me nightmares.\n\nHaving not finished “Cold Dreams” I can’t (yet) give a full review. For what I’ve seen, and for the price, I have no trouble recommending this game for anyone enjoying short, atmospheric, first person horror games.\n\nEDIT #1: Having played over 2 hours, I do have some minor issues to mention. The biggest is the controls. Players are notified that an object can be interacted with by the form of a hand, but the distance one must be seems to be very precise in order to produce interaction. It's difficult to be certain, since it is possible to interact without the hand appearing. Perhaps this could be simplified. Also, in some places the darkness is less atmospheric, and more frustrating as you find yourself opening and closing the same doors repeatedly, since the darkness prevents certainty as to which rooms have already been accessed. Two controls options not indicated are "c" for crouch and "space" for jump, though they may be unneeded, even worse than useless and actually interfer with other actions. Music of some type would be nice, and certainly add to the atmosphere.\n\nThe more I play, the more I enjoy "Cold Dreams".\n\n(As with most Steam games, "Cold Dreams" does not record offline game time.)","October 19, 2015","true","0.8"," 26 of 34 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","26","34","0","1"

You get lost for hours because the game gives you absolutely 0 direction once you lose track of the floating daughter-ball-of-light, and wander aimlessly looking for what you're supposed to do. Collect random junk for some reason, follow ball of light more with bad voice-acted conversation in between.

The details i love you see the short way is unique i never saw a winter forest, i had 1 hour fun better then 10 hours not even 10 min, but this game is only really for Walk Simulator Fans, that love areas with atmosphere like like Montagues Mount, sure its not the same level, its not so long, here are no big puzzles, but this feeling of beeing alone and get every 100 meters a sign of lost civilisation like a axe and then some buildings, wells, ruins, small cemetery. I can only say search every corner and get all achievements, this little details to find make the game even if for most non walking simulator fiends they are nothing. So who dont like/ hate WS ignore the game, people that like the pics and dont expect to much, try it or watch lets play for WS genre fan, buy it. The developer did sure many time to bring the many plants, trees and all the little details like light on a mountain in it and that make a not so bad feeling. Dont aspect to much for 3 euros and yes you can be done with a rush and luck in 20-30 min but explore the few areas in every aspect. So for WS Fans i would give this game 77 % because its so short. Wait for a discount 30 % or better 50-60 % and hopefully enjoy the short time.

I wanted some information. This time instead of totally crashing, when I went back to the game, the mouse look had become broken and I now had a cursor that if I pushed to the edges of the screen would make my character look in that direction.\n\nThat's about the point that I gave up.\n\nOverall: 1/10 - Skip it.

I saw.  I got lost.  I got trapped in a crevasse.  Unfortunately, I also got out of it - eventually - and wasted another twenty minutes of my time trying to work out just what the hell to do next...\n\nIn one part of Cold Dreams, I came across some gallows behind a blood-splattered church, which prompted my character to muse out aloud (in a suitably awkward Euro accent):  "What is this doing here?"  One could well ask the same question of this game being on Steam, except in all honesty, there are FAR, FAR WORSE atrocities of "games" which have been released to Steam of late.  ESPECIALLY horror ones.  Having said that, is this worth three dollars of your money?  Well, sure...if you thought that Dear Esther had way too much gameplay, and you're not much fussed on plot.   What passes for "plot" here seems to involve picking up toy horses for no apparent reason, and finding your way up into darkened attics for no purpose other than to provide scintillating insights such as:  "It's a pentagram.  Looks creepy."  (This is in direct opposition, of course, to all the NON-creepy pentagrams out there in the world.)\n\nIt all by-and-largely LOOKS great - at least when you don't get too close to the edges of the map, and see where the programmers haven't quite bothered to finish the graphics off - and does have an admirably spooky atmosphere.  But it completely fails to give your character any motivation to do anything other than, I suppose, wander around in circles for a while before unceremoniously dying in the snow from frostbite.  I do look forward to the day, however, when these devs actually decide to make a GAME, 'cause they've certainly nailed the "mood" rather nicely here.\n\n"WhatInGod'sGoodNameAmISupposedToBeDoingNext?"

My recommendation is soley based on price.\n\nI'd first like to say that the hate for indie Unity games is unfounded. Their stability, quality and optimization is left soley to the developer. It's not unfair to compare this to an indie game developed with Unity, it's just... pointless.\n\nThe Good\n\n- The game runs very well and looks attractive enough.\n- Even when it's not on sale, I think it's priced appropriately for what you're getting.\n- The level of detail on individual snowflakes was, for me, pointless and immersion breaking.\n- A good EFFORT was made on the voice acting, even though it ultimately fell flat.\n- There are multiple endings. With the short play time, it's easy enough to get them all.\n\nThe Bad\n\n- To jump, you have to release the space bar, not press it. So you don't jump on KeyDown, you jump on KeyUp. I had some difficulty adjusting to this, only to find out that I never needed to jump anyway.\n- There are some artificial/invisible barriers to prevent you from completing certain actions. In the first area near the house, you can climb on the roof of the little hut, but there's an artificial ceiling that keeps you from walking completely over it.\n- The voice acting is flat and emotionless.\n- The story is flat ane emotionless.\n- If you don't pay close attention to where that ball of light is going, it's easy to get lost... But only in the very beginning.\n- Game prompts (audio, visual cues) only seem to occur if you walk in a very specific place. If you're to the right of that place by a foot or two, you don't get the prompt.\n- The game is short. Though it has multiple endings, there's really no reason to play through it to see them all. It's just not that interesting.\n- The plot is weak. Very weak.\n- The interaction prompt does only appear at certain distances from an interactable object, but you can interact even if the prompt isn't there. This can get confusing.\n- WIthout that interaction prompt, there's almost no way to tell what you need to interact with. The keys, for example, are almost invisible and there's no indication that you need to pick them up.\n\nI'm recommending this because it's $3. It probably took several hours to develop this game. I make much more than $3 per hour to do what I do. I don't think $3 is unreasonable. It's not scary. It's not really even interesting. But this guy had a story to tell and he told it.\n\nKudos to him.\n\nEDIT\n\nThere are some subtle nuances here that I appreciate, mostly to do with the notes. I hate note finding in games, but in this one, there's a little added cleverness.","December 22, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","5"

Equipped with a decent price and a promising trailer, I decided to give this one a spin on an overly windy, chilly evening.\n\nFirst off, this game uses the Cryengine, so that is already a plus in my books. Far too many recent indie horror titles on Steam rely on the awful and notoriously unstable Unity engine. The graphics here are wonderful and the atmosphere is immersive; at one point I was actually getting cold whilst playing the game. However, disappointment soon arrived at my fingertips.\n\nI realized very early on into Cold Dreams that nothing was actually going to "hurt" me, and that there was no pressure to make storyline progression. You can stand around for hours looking up at the snowfall if you really want to. I came to the conclusion that this is yet another walking and key finding simulator, like so many other indie games that boast the tag of "horror" have ended up becoming. The "scares" are extremely predictable and provide nothing more than a little jump during the first couple of attempts. As well, the story is excruciatingly basic, with little to no inspiration.\n\nI have to wonder, when and why did horror games become so standardized? The genre is becoming a lost art. Developers need to realize that true horror does not come from jump scares, walking around 'creepy' forests only to solve puzzles, or natural sounds. Anyone can create a jump scare, but it takes a true artist to instill long-lasting fright.\n\nThe game lasts maybe an hour. There is no save feature. At this time there are still bugs that are being worked out. Sadly, I cannot recommend this title whatsoever. The graphics are nice to look at and the game is very stable, despite random framerate dips into the 40's on a high end gaming rig; check my profile for specs. The "horror" aspect of this horror title is just not there.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 20, 2015","false","2.1"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","3"

At some point i managed to move and follow this orb thing, came across an axe...no idea if i was supposed to pick it up but i tried every button and nothing happened.\n\ndue to lagg and other mal functions i cannot recommend this. i'll play this again over a year or so to see if it plays better.","December 27, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have found no bugs or glitches.\nI THOUGHT I did, a key I had didn't open a door. But there was another door!
