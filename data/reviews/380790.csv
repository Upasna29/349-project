I spent 15 minutes idling on the server list, only for no game to ever show up. This game's community - if it ever had one - is dead.\n\nA shame, because the graphics look nice and I like the idea of a chess game with a war in hell background.","August 1, 2015","false","6.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","0"

There is no provision for playing single player.\nThis basically ended my interest in what was an otherwise interesting-looking game.\n\nIt might not for everyone, but be warned; starting up the game, it asks you for\na server name you wish to be matched up with opponents on. It doesn't give you a list,\nso, unless you are a dev, you don't know what to write in that testbox, and you'll\nnever, ever actualy find an opponent to play with.\n\nBest of all, once you discover all this, there's no obvious indicator as to how to close\nthe program. You can't seem to do it once the program is running.\n\nI got sucked in by the cool-looking video and an introductory sale.\nLearn from my mistake.","July 28, 2015","false","0.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","3"

I should give it someone in a giveaway, at least someone would say to me "Thanks"... or hate me...\nOk i should gave it to someone i don't like.\n\nNobody playing this game!! And there isn't any single player mode, so there's no chance to get any achievements.\n\nBut you can say "There are cards!" - yes, you can read on steam that info, but you will get none cards after spending few hourers in this game. I don't know why  this game should had cards, but it doesn't.\n\nSo no game, no cards and no achievements. Great deal! I'm just waiting for next game from this developer to not buy it.\n\n1/10 it's to much....\n\nEdit: Wow they fix cards!","January 9","false","8.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"
