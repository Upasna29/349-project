It was a great idea, but since then, there’s been precious little that’s attempted to tackle the same subject.\n\n“Showtime!” isn’t on the same level of production as “The Movies” but it does take on the same concept.  Where as “The Movies” was all about the pretty graphics, “Showtime!” attempts to do it largely via text.  When you build a sound studio, don’t expect to actually see it; likewise, when you release a movie, you won’t be able to watch your masterpiece.\n\nSome people will already be turned off by that, because they think it sounds dull and boring.  And probably for some people it will be.  But if you’re checking out this game then you’re presumably interested in the concept, and considering there’s pretty much nothing else out there like it, I feel it’s at least worth a look just for that.\n\nYou can start your career from any year, back to 1927.  As the years pass, technology will progress, which means you’ll need to upgrade your equipment, or risk producing poor quality movies.  You have to hire a script writer (or perhaps buy an existing script), hire a director and producer, as well as actors.  There are many factors that go into deciding whether you produce a turkey, or a monster global hit.\n\nThe game isn’t perfect.  It’s a great concept, but it’s limited in scope, although that’s perfectly understandable considering the tiny independent developer.  There has also been bugs in the game, sometimes big ones.  But the great thing is that the developer is very eager to identify and eliminate the bugs.  For example, I reported a game breaking bug, and within 24 hours a new patch was out that fixed it.  How many developers, big or small, can honestly say something similar?\n\nAnother problem with the current build is that some technologies aren’t linked to the year of movie development.  For example, you can use CGI in your movies right from 1927.  Likewise, if you wish to purchase an existing script, one category you can chose from – again, right from the start – is video game adaptions.  The developer is aware of these limitations, though, and is apparently keen to try and find ways to address these concerns, once all the bugs have been squashed.\n\nI do think it’s worth buying this game, because of the concept and because the developer is very eagerly continuing to work on it.  However, I only recommend it if you understand that the game is essentially text based and that you’re okay with that.  You should be because it's actually rather addictive!\n\nUPDATE: Those technologies that were wrongly available right from the start have already been fixed, so now no long will you be able to use CGI nor buy a script based on a video game in the 1920's.  And the bugs are rapidly getting ironed out, and I can't applaud the developer enough for his diligence.","May 27, 2014","true","14.8"," 141 of 148 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","141","148","0","4"

I was very satisfied with this title.\n\nIf you are interested in a movie studio simulator and do not mind a lack of animations (gameplay is all text-based), then you will most likely enjoy this game. For some mindless, casual playthroughs, this is the game for you.\n\nThe aesthetics are decent - since the game is entirely text-based, you will encounter numerous menus and backgrounds. When you make a movie, you have the option of selecting an ad poster from a small pool of premade templates, however, you can also load any other image you have saved on your computer. You can customize the lettering on the poster a bit, like manipulating the font and color. There is no music, so I play my own. The sounds when you click things are okay, but can get repetitive fairly quickly (I turned all audio off after about 2 hours).\n\nYou will use the mouse to click on different buttons and menus, and the tutorial is very helpful at showing you everything you can do in the game. The learning curve is mostly minimal to (maybe) moderate, depending on your experience with management simulators. You can adjust the difficulty accordingly by changing how much money you start with and/or what year you start in (more modern years give access to the latest cinema technology).\n\nGameplay consists of you making movies and conducting research to give you access to the latest technology. When you make your first movie, you will have the option of customizing the scripts you'd like to use (or, you can buy scripts offered by hopeful prospects). You may change the themes you'd like in your movie, and this part is very interesting, because it will affect the target demographic, and is also sensitive to the time period you are currently in. For example, lots of adult themes and profanity will most likely give you a 18+ (or higher) rating, and lots of violence will be very, very controversial if done in the early 1950's.\n\nYou will need to fill your movie with actors, actresses, supporters, directors, and producers. You can hire accordingly, or you can sign contracts with people if you want them to be exclusively yours (for a time). The contracts will expire after x movies have been made with the individual, or after x years (whichever comes first) - higher values will cost you more money. If you are careful and experiment, you will realize that signing contracts is much more cost-efficient in the long run, but ONLY if you are intending to repeatedly use the individual(s).\n\nAs your movie is being made, you can invest your networth in things like better sound stages, more advanced technology (you will have to keep up as new technologies arise with time, or lose market share to your competition), and better working conditions.\n\nThe game plays a lot like Game Dev Tycoon, where you can select from a large number of movie genres (as well as sub-genres if you desire). From here, you will have to do a bit of matchmaking, as different individuals are more proficient at certain genres, and certain themes are better fit (for example, you won't necessarily want a lot of violence in a family film). Balancing these different elements will help you get better ratings, which lead to more viewers, and also more revenue.\n\nPretty frequently, you will be invited to attend various award shows, however, you do not have to attend (it can be a waste of time if you know with certainty that you won't be nominated). Getting awards bolsters your studio rating, and higher studio ratings allow you to hit a larger target market.\n\nAlthough your playthrough can get very repetitive very quickly, it is still worth giving this game a try if you are the least bit interested in movie studio management. The gameplay is very casual and not at all demanding, so it plays well for a time-filler, or as a break from your more intense games.\n\nRecommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","January 5, 2015","true","10.5"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","6"

I really like the game. Not only because I'm a big tycoon games fan, but because I've always loved text-based games, which is a strong point with Showtime!'s developer.\n\nDespite having released the game quite some time ago, the developer still keeps pumping out the occasional update, and he's EXTREMELY active around the forums. I've personally e-mailed him offering my help with whatever I can be helpful with for Showtime!'s sequel. I can only imagine what he'd be able to do with a team and a bigger budget at his disposal.\n\nEverything from my previous review is still true, and the only thing I'd probably add up is that I really recommend this game for any movie and/or tycoon lovers.\n\n----- Review from 20th January 2015 -----\n\nDon't judge this review based on my playtime, I just got the game on steam.\n\nI've been a "follower" of this developer and his games, and I really enjoy what he has to offer.\nIf like simulators, if you like movies, if you like text-based (despite having images, it's pretty much text-based) games, this is all of that, and much more.\nUnfortunately the game doesn't have the real names, like its demo does, due to copyright stuff, and we can all understand that, being the company small and what not, but that doesn't take the fun away.\n\nThe price can seem a bit pushy, I agree, I suggest waiting for a sale, or if my previews statements convinced you, and you are really the kind of gamer that likes simulators like this one, then go for it!\n\nPS. I really wish Myrtilus Entertainment would get a new and improved version of "Bestseller" on steam, really love that one.

If you ever wished you could make a movie, it's your time to shine. This game is highly addictive, once you start you just don't want to stop. I highly recommend to anyone who buys this game to visit the official site, where you even can find mods for Showtime!, in which you can download real life actors, producers, directors for your game, so there are infinite number of projects to try out here, if you are a real fan of films. The game even gives you Editor tool, which is really easy to use, (usually as someone who just likes to play and not get behind how everything work, I can't find a thing in most editors) so even if you can't find your favourite actor, actress (or you wish they would be) you can very easily import them.\nIn short, highly enjoyable and addictive game, it's price truly worth the money and the game devs actually listen to you (that's why I edited my first comment, so you can see it) and updates come out regularly. I can honestly say, this game was the best buy I made on Steam in a long time. Just don't start this game the day before one of your exams :D\n\nIt can be quite enjoyable, but after a while it gets very frustrating, mainly becouse of the screenwriting, which is just a huge pain in the ♥♥♥, becouse if you want to have a good one you just have to reselect every single month the "Script revision" till you get 5 stars everywhere. Now after I paused the game and went to do something else I just don't want to return to it, for this reason only. Otherwise, the director, actor, producer management is quite good and the poster feature is a nice touch too, so it really has potential and can be enjoyable, but the script writing part is really bad. I get it, why you can do it, but it completely ruins the experience, so while it stays the same I can recommend it only for the most obsessed movie-suckers. If the screenwriting part would be changed, I am sure I would just spend all day playing with this game, becouse every other part of it's just awesome for a person who loves movies as much as I do.","June 9, 2014","true","28.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","6"

No resolution options, it's windowed mode and just takes up a tiny part of a 1920x1080 screen.\n[edit] There is now a fullscreen option but the game is still locked to 4:3 ratio.\n\n2. No matter what time period you choose, it still talks about internet and social media buzz.\n[edit] Dev response: "That shouldnt be the case. I've deliberately made most of the news events decade-specific so you dont get those sort of news items. A couple might have been missed so for that I apologise- let me know what they say and I can fix them easily."\n\n3. Not enough feedback to base decisions on. I made a movie with top notch talent, rewrote the script to make sure the story was great, had 100% star quality, but the movie still bombed.\n[edit] I'm still not sure why the movie bombed, other than the fact that I only had 12mil left for the marketing budget and the recommendation was 22mil, which was double what the movie cost to make.\n\n4. When you make a movie, you're locked into your choices and then whatever you have left over you can use for marketing. But marketing is 2x-3x more than the movie cost to make! I don't think that's how it works, but I could be wrong!\n[edit] I still see this as an issue. The game doesn't tell you what goes into the recommended marketing budget, so it's almost impossible to tell how much money you'll need to set aside after production costs.\n\nI'm super impressed by the developer taking time to address my points, and also still supporting this game over a year after release. I think this game would be fun for people who enjoy tycoon type games, or who are fascinated by the business side of movie making.\n\nEver play The Sims 2, 3, or 4? You know how on that game you can write a novel or something, pick a genre, give it a name, and then send it off and start receiving royalty payments? Imagine a game based around that idea, except you're making movies instead, and you have a lot more decisions you can make. That's what this game is like.\n\nI'm changing my review to a thumbs up because I can tell this game is made with heart by a passionate, responsive developer, and that's too rare these days.","March 11, 2015","true","1.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","4"

Eventually, your studio will ascend to the point of relevance, and gradually become the top dog in Tinseltown ( if you're any good, that is).\n\nYou're not on our own. Other studios will try to bring you and your upstart studio down. The rival studios release films too, and more often than not will take home the awards at the formal ceremoies in place of your films.\n\nThe managing aspect of Showtime is quite in-depth , but not in an overwelming manner by any means. There is a wide array of buildings that will enhance yor studio's turnout, for a hefty sum, in most cases, and you really do feel like you own an actual stuio.\n\nThe game is rife with parodies of modern award ceremonies and studios ( Metro Silver Slayer, anyone?) and the writing is generally to a high standard.\n\nThe film making itself won't be everyone's cup of tea, unfortuantely. You hire actors, writers, directors, producers etc. to appear in your film, and this is quite in depth in itself. You create posters for the film and allocate a budget. However, you don't really have a hand in your film from there. You leave the guys to it, and they will be finished in a couple of months. Simple as that. You then wait for the money to roll in, and voila! On you go to your next film.  There is more to the system, but you get the idea. Although I don't find fault in it, I presume others might.\n\nFinally, the dev ( yes, just one) is extremely active in the community, and makes a genuine effort to listen to player's feedback. The game was released quite a while ago, yet only yesterday was another update released for the game. He really is interested in making the game the best it can be, which is more than can be said for an awful lot of other devs. He is also working on a sequel to the game, and is committed to implementing much-desired features.\n\nTo summarise, the game is quite enjoyable and very resonably priced, and although your mileage may vary, this is definately worth a purchase - if you're into this kind of thing, of course! :)\n\nVerdict: 8.3/10","March 15, 2015","true","10.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

If you're an old movie buff or were a big fan of the Lionhead Studios game The Movies, than I think you will find a lot to like here.\n\nIn the game, you are the head of your own movie studio. You can pick a starting date from 1927 up to 2013. As time passes bigger and better film and sound technology will become available to you but not always when you would expect it to (more about that later). You may choose the huge expense of upgrading to get the best possible quality for your movies or hang on to that outdated equipment to save a buck. You have a choice of buying existing scripts or hiring writers of various quality (indicated by star ranks and letter grades) to write original first drafts. Once written, scripts are rated for various categories such as pace, story arc, and characterization among others. The quality and experience of the writers in general as well as their ratings in these specific categories effects the quality of the script overall and for those categories. If you don't like the quality ratings of the script within a category or categoriesthen you can hire another writer to (preferably with better ratings than the one you hired before - at least for the problem categories) do a revision, a partial rewrite, or a total rewrite. Keep in mind, all of these take additional time. Once a script is ready, hire directors, actors (leading and supporting), and producers as needed. You may negotiate their contracts to help save money by tweaking the amount of up-front cash they receive and whether they get any percentage points of the gross film take. Actors can be assigned to direct or produce, directors to produce, and producers to direct all for the same salary to save additional cash at the expense, potentially, film quality. Once everyone is assigned their roles, you assign the production budget, special FX budget, CGI budget, hire stunt men and start filming. Random events can happen at anytime during the process such as writers needing additional time, actors dying by accident, tantrums, sickness, etc.. which is a nice touch and all of them  effect your production schedule. Once filming completes, you then set your films marketing and release budget and select whether to launch globally or to a limited market. Next you pick a release date and can even give your movie a custom movie poster from image files on your computer - which is a nice touch for those of us who like to REALLY get into a game and do a little RPG'ing. There is also a 7% revenue increase for movies with custom posters to act as an incentive to actually put one together, although I suppose you COULD use any old crummy image from your desktop instead of going through the bother of putting together mock movie posters(which is what I've been doing). After you launch, you either start raking in the dough or you start packing up for skid row. I'm glossing over the details for the sake of this review but there are a lot of variables that can effect the quality of your movie and the reception to it by the viewers.\n\nWhere Lionhead's The Movies was very graphics oriented, Showtime! is very text driven. There are very few visuals and only a few basic sounds - not even background music as of now but what is there is enough to make the game compelling and addictive. There is more depth in the movie production process with Showtime! over Lionhead's The Movies which was much more about putting together actual 3D movies. The developer for Showtime! has gone the extra distance to put in some nice features such as the ability to pick custom movie posters for each of your movies, the ability to create movie sequels and start a film series complete with devoted fans - you can even sell the rights to a movie series if your studio is short of cash, long-term contract deals with talent, a movie hall of fame, and internal game achievements (although why this hasn't been worked into Steam achievements is beyond me - maybe down the road?).\n\nThere are bugs and some odd time-period/linearity problems such as CGI being available in 1927 but the developer is very active with his community and seems to be right on top of getting our feedback and working it into regular updates along with all of the bug fixing.\n\nI do highly recommend this game if you're a fan of quirky mostly text-based games or old movies! It's very much worth the price and the developer is definitely continuing to work on improving it.","May 27, 2014","true","16.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

EDIT - there have been updates and it seems more stable...\n\nThe gameplay is fairly repetitive and some things - like how many roles there are in a series - don't carry over from one iteration to another in a franchise.  So every movie has to be adjusted or you will release endless rated G pictures with one actor.  A randomize button, followed by customization, would have been nice.  Or default recommendations.

While you don't actually get to watch your masterpieces (or flops) there's still plenty of fun in producing your own creations, using your own pictures as movie posters, selecting the cast, reading the different reviews of your films, competing with other studios to be top dawg, and much more. To anyone who loved "The Movies" I would urge you to give this a try. There are still many bugs but, like many have said, updates are fast and that's something a casual gamer should always appreciate.","May 28, 2014","true","20.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And if you're expecting something like Lionhead's "The Movies," you're going to be disappointed. It's pretty much a text-based sim. It really reminds me of Extreme Warfare Revenge, the wrestling promotion game.\n\nFirst, the bad stuff:\n\nThe interface is TERRIBLE and fairly unintuitive.\nSometimes you have to click (+) or (-) buttons or use a slider instead of just typing in the value you want.\nThe game will occasionally crash, so make sure to save.\nSpeaking of, after you select a save slot, the game will tell you that autosave is now enabled. It isn't. Go to the options and enable it manually. Oh, and you have to make your first save manually before you can do that.\n\nThen the good stuff:\nIt's just fun, and fairly addictive. Once you get the winning method down for producing movies, it's not a hard game.\n\nI released a series of big-budget action flicks that made me BILLIONS of dollars.

It seems that when you are making a movie it just comes down to the numbers you assigned to the movie. Generating a 5* script and tossing a big budget at a movie are both simple to do, and my experience, always lead to a profit. Game is as simple as clicking the button to re-write a script until it hits 5* (takes a few re-writes, but this is absolutely not something that is difficult to accomplish) and then tossing a giant budget at it. It's a simple as that.\n\nThere are also tons of bugs. Save often.

There are too many options available to the player at the beginning of the game and the tutorial only covers the basics.  You can start your studio as early as 1927 and the game has historically accurate film and sound systems that became available as time passes.  Unfortunately the rest of the game does not reflect the times and allows you to develop scripts that contain violence, nudity and other things that would not have been allowed in Hollywood at the time under the Hayes code.\n\nThe game allows you to hire specific actors, directors and producers but other production staff such as cinematographers and composers are not covered in the same detail.  The people are all ficticious, no doubt for legal reasons, so if you want real names in your game you will have to add them yourself using the editor.\n\nPotentially, this could be a good game but it needs more polish.","May 24, 2014","false","3.6"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","23","43","0","0"

It's inexpensive, and well worth the money. However, I do have a major caveat: it doesn't seem finished enough for full release.\n\nQuite a few of the NPCs are lacking portraits, and I don't care what their visual appeal stat is, I have a real block against hiring a leading actress when I have no clue what she looks like. It really bugs me. The backgrounds available aren't well themed or much use in creating memorable posters, and I just make too many movies to want to make them separately and import them. The tutorial really needs a grammar check, and numerous glitches in the awards ceremony (actors under contract to me getting nominations for films from other studios, the same film apparently competing against itself...) are mild irritants.\n\nSo.

As long as you're conservative advertising your first three or four movies, and don't build much in the way of facilities until you have spare cash, you're golden.  Rewrite till the script is perfect, cast decent actors, watch money roll in.  (Also helps to use your own plots, rather than buying adaptations.)   Starting in 1950 with $25 million, at the hardest setting, I maxed out every film studio aspect possible and amassed over $2 billion in less than five years game time, with 10 films in various degrees of completion.\n\nIt wasn't even necessary to pay attention to what kind of movie I made or what time of year I released it.  I made over $270 million on two documentaries, for God's sake.  Sequels are seemingly impossible to lose money on.  (I assume you have to cast at least one of the original stars; I never tried recasting everyone.)  I changed genres in sequels without alienating the audience.  My LEAST successful film--my first--still made $17.5 million.  Of course, it may be that I was born to run a film studio, but I have my doubts.\n\nAlso, a design bug:  If you put people under contract, you only have to pay them once for up to 8 movies, and then they do all the movies for free.  That doesn't SEEM likely.  And it is hardly necessary to make money in the game.\n\nI like this sort of game, and the designer is still working to improve it, so I will give it the most grudging of thumb's up.","October 9, 2014","true","37.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I even won best Costume and hairstyle for a 3D animation film...\n- The award doesn't give anything...no money, no reputation, nothing.\n- There should be more technology and tweeks to the facility to make a difference and when you update your technology, it should reflect on the interface or on the movie presentation screen\n- The sub-category doesn't seem to have a lot of impact.\n- The popularity of genres are almost always the same. I understand that this probably reflect the reality of thing where USA is always looking for action and adventure movie but at the same time, I would have love to see some clear spike in category and see it fall as a lot of film are getting out. Maybe have the reason for those pike\n- Love the "coming soon" screen... but it is useless as it is only for the next month. I would have love to see the next 5 months\n- Add an algorythme so that the name of the movie aren't always the same.

Luckily, after some time, I hit the steam Icon by accident, so Steam got started. This game, however, does not scale at all. There's a Window in the middle of my screen, considerably smaller than a CD Jewel case, which might or might not contain the game - I couldn't tell. And I thought scaling a window was something that pretty much every programmer in the world solved around the late 90's.\nFolks, if you want to write a game, and sell it, like 'professionals', use a professional framework that takes care of it or at least! seperate the rendering logic and make a quick call to determine dpi scaling support. Scaling can than be achieved via SetProcessDPIAware (from Winuser.h) or in Java by using JavaFX. If you don't know what that means, you're not ready to sell your game. If your framework does not support that, you'll need to change your framework (seriously). If that sounds like too much work, you're not ready to sell your game. Really? Really. Sorry.\nSo, what's the final verdict? I have a severe head ache now, and my eyes hurt. After trying to plax the game for 4 minutes. Last game that did that was the unfathomably bad X Rebirth (for different reasons, though. And to be fair, this game was € 61 cheaper).\nHowever, I still look forward to trying this game if it ever gets a working screen renderer.\n\nPS: So I had to start it again, since appearently you cannot write a review if you've used a game for less than 5 minutes (dumbest rule ever? Game doesn't start - never tell anybody). After another minute, I can verify that this game responds rather well to alt+f4.

It's simplicity allows a lot replayability.  And you get your money's worth.  There are better games out there, THE MOVIES, but that is nearly 10 years old, and has lacked support.  It also bogs down as it tries to do too many things.  SHOWTIME on the other hand let's you run a studio and make films using siple controls.  The decisions seem to make some effect on the game, yet I was surprised that one of my sequels made a gazzilion dollars.\n\nI would like to see the following features:  Being able to start in 1920 with silent pictures and a smaller studio system, having verticle integration (i.e., buying, running and owning distribution channels AND theater chains), and being able to choose a HOME city and territory.\n\nSome things though seem to make little difference.  The city chose to make a film or some of the film or sound quality do not make much difference.  It would be great to automatically retain case and director on a re-make/sequel. Also would be great to see how many films a particular actor has been in (one actor I used was a low level actor, after the first film he jumped to A-List status demanding 30+ million dollars, so I assume he also made other films, since mine was a mediocre success).\n\nOther than that I think overall the game is worth it.  You will probably burn out after 2-3 hours.  But it's a game you can come back to later.  Because of this it is within what I would classify a THUMBS UP game.","January 3, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I had started the company with a hundred million dollars and turned it into a multi-billion dollar company. I sat there smiling to myself. I was cocky, arrogant, but also humble as my many pictures of myself hung on my walls proved. I started looking over some ideas for future movies; perhaps more sequels were in order since the previous sequels of my several series had all done well. Just as I was thinking about it, my main writer burst into my office. Her name was Francis…something-or-other. I’m a busy man, I can’t be bothered to learn names.\n\nShe looked me dead in the eyes and said, “Sir, I have a slight complaint, if you would be so kind as to indulge me.”\n\nI nodded and motioned for her to sit down in the chair in front of my desk and she obliged.\n\nI smiled at her and said very sweetly, “What seems to be the problem?”\n\n“It’s your movie summaries, sir, or should I say lack thereof?”\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“Your movie summaries don’t make any sense. Take for example this one script you gave to me not too long ago. You titled it ‘Little Doggy Choo-Choo’ and your movie summary was simply, ‘Da fuq?'”\n\nI chuckled to myself, “Yeah, that’s because I had no idea where that title came from.”\n\n“Right,” she said, still perplexed. “But how am I supposed to write a screenplay when you haven’t given me anything? Is the dog’s name Choo-Choo? How little is he? What does he do? ‘Da fuq?’ is not very helpful.”\n\n“You’re the screenwriter, you make it up.”\n\n“Okay, but how about this one? The third movie in the ‘Deception’ series has the plot summary: ‘No one asked for it…so here you go.’ Do you actually want me to write something here?”\n\n“Of course. I gave you a title, didn’t I?”\n\n“Yeah, a pretty bad title. ‘Deception 3: Deceptiest’? There’s no such word as deceptiest.”\n\n“There is now!” I said, smiling.\n\n“I have another complaint,” she sighed.\n\n“Oh?” I asked, sitting up straight.\n\n“Yes,” she said, “Whenever I give you a script, you always give it to someone else to do slight revisions. Now I don’t necessarily have a problem with that, but, for some reason the entire script winds up being credited to this other guy even though he just did slight touch-ups and I still did basically the entire script.”\n\n“You still get paid, don’t you?”\n\n“I guess.”\n\n“Then why do you need the credit? Who cares if it’s credited to you or this other guy? Do you think people actually pay attention to who the screenwriter is?”\n\n“It would be nice to win the award for best screenplay for once, that’s all. When I see that my movie won for best screenplay, and this other guy who did barely any work on it at all is accepting the trophy, it kind of angers me a little.”\n\n“He doesn’t get paid nearly as much as you do, let him have the trophy.”\n\nShe sighed and I thought I was done, but just then another screenwriter burst through my door.\n\nFor the full review and the rest of the story, please visit: http://beingstephenkaplan.com/2015/01/15/its-showtime-a-video-game-review-and-a-short-story/","January 15, 2015","true","8.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","3","6","3","0"

However, it felt instead like a dumbed down version of those games that didn't offer nearly the same amount of features. Hollywood Mogul 3 has now been renamed "Hollywood Movie Studio" and it's not available for Steam, but it was a much deeper game than this with a much better interface and it came out in 2006. I simply cannot recommend this game; the gameplay is incredibly simplistic and causes it to feel repetitive almost immediately. Furthermore, I had to change the Display settings on my computer to even get the game running.","October 5, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

To be honest, it feels a little basic, clunky and outdated, but it does make for some fun. It is relatively easy as well, and not difficult at all to grasp what is taking place. I would recommend this to someone who takes up a lot of interest in the idea of the game, but do not hold your breathe or hope for any miracles. I appreciate the effort and time it took to create the game, and it is fun (for a bit), but there is room for improvement.","October 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While the game is playable I probably still would not recommend it. I didn't walk into it expecting a "the Movies" clone but I did expect since I would be a text heavy game that there would be more to the text experience. While there are a few flashes of humor they tend to be far and few in-between and recycled. It seems to be like being an accounting simulator more than anything. While the game is playable there really isn't much to keep you hooked, no satisfaction in progressing, no entertaining text to keep you reading, no real changes based on your upgrades. As is, I wouldn’t recommend the game. Sorry.\n\nI was really excited to try this game but it's bugged to the point that I can't use it! Whenever I try to start a new game the right hand side of the screen and the bottom are cut off by this big reverse "L" of white" that has two check boxes in the bottom. I assume this is a bug because it covers the screens text and I assume also covers the stat button because I cannot find it!\n\nIf this bug gets fixed I'll re-review and I'll keep trying to find a work around but as it it isn't worth the less than two dollars I spent on it.","September 7, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

I like these kinds of games if they're done well, like Rockstar Ate My Hamster back on Amiga or Game Dev Tycoon, but after the initial enthusiasm this just felt empty and repetetive. I didn't experience the crashes some people have been reporting, but for me the game itself lacked substance.\n\nIn 4 years (abt 50 turns) of game time on my first try, I had bought every possible upgrade to my studio (3D movies in the 1930's...), had several top #1 movies and more money I could use. All that was left was to keep churning script after script, rewrite after rewrite, movie after movie by doing the same few things over and over. There was nothing left to aim for except maybe if I'd wanted to chase every possible award show nomination (that don't seem to have any real effect on the game), which would've required me to do even more of this repetetive process.\n\nThe idea of the game itself is pretty good, but it needs something more to have appeal that lasts longer than a few hours.","May 29, 2014","false","143.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","5"

I'm not even kidding, read the patch notes, this is literally running on the VB6 runtime. For a game released in 2013.\n\nEvery line of this game is self-evident crap, from dead-eyed Poser model thumbnails used for the randomly-generated "characters", to the bag-of-random-values simulation logic (it's common to be presented with directors over 80 years old with no experience), to the error-ridden flavor text (the plural of comedy is spelled as "comedy's").\n\n"Special Effects were not invented until the mid 1970s" is an actual assertion this game makes. Apparently, previous versions of the game allowed all special effects (like "CGI") to be accessible from 1920 onward, and this was the only fix the developer could think of - declaring that films like "Metropolis", "King Kong", "2001: A Space Oddysey", and Ray Harryhausen's entire career could never have existed.\n\nThis game wouldn't make the bar for inclusion in Microsoft Plus for Windows 98.

Basic idea was you created a film studio from the ground up, and ran every aspect about it from the screenwriting, acting, and release.  It was pretty much a god game only instead of workign with people, you work with movies.  This game tries to do the same thing, with mixed results.  On one hand, having everything mainly be text based, makes it easy (for the most part) on your machine, but leaves what models there are, less appealing.  However, there is a big issue with this game, which is why I do not recommend it.  Around the time of this game's release I was rather harsh.\n\nI still stand by the notion that, at release, the game was broken, and barely working.  However, credit does go out to the developer, for working with the community to help resolve the bigger issues in a timely manner, and now a days the game works pretty well.  Granted, we then get into that grey area of a broken game getting released and fixed later.  However, once again, with those issues resolved we can get into the meat of the game itself.\n\nBeing mostly text based, the game looks alright, with really the big issue being the placeholder models used for actors, producers, and directors.  It might be more of a personal taste, but I would have perferred no models than what is used.\n\nEven though the game becomes rather tedious after a while, that does give the player a bigger freedom to try and experiment, but with limited results.  Either dump all your money into a project, and because one thing was right it'll make every dime back, or fail miserably still makes the game difficult to fully recommend.  Yet, at the end of the day, it's a cheap simulator game, for a subject area not many games do, and isn't trying to boost its bugs as part of the game, so...plus there.  There is content in this game, and for a film buff, it's hard to not try and enjoy at least.\n\nIt's more of a quick burst kind of game.  Not to expense, you load it up--which being mostly text based does make the game load and run smoothly when it works--and play for about an hour.","June 6, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
