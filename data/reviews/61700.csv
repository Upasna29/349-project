Not a conventional match-3 system; it took a while to get the hang of the battle system. Campaign playthrough took 20-24 hours. I enjoyed the Campaign play-through; I don't expect to replay it.\n\nEven after getting the hang of the battle system, the randomness inherent in the battle system resulted in fairly frequent bad luck for me and sometimes very good luck for my opponent. Some of the set battles are rough, even with leveled units.\n\nI needed to fight side battles and do bounties to level my units up enough to complete the Campaign. Some of the set battles are rough, even with leveled units. Just gotta be persistent in retrying. The Campaign mostly doesn't punish you for death or retreating. Even when it did, I just lost a bit of my excess currency-- no big deal.\n\nI like the art style. Very stylistic. No blood or gore. I felt that the females were clothed tastefully, certainly better than most games treat female characters these days.

Every character have different special units and artifacts which adds diversity to gameplay. Graphics are smooth and easy on the eyes. Story is a little cliche but not boring.

We always are afraid of spinoffs: not living up to franchises fame, riding the name for some cash and things like that. But sometimes we get jewels in such piles of disappointments. And Clash of Heroes is such a jewel. No, it's nothing like any M&M game, but in this case it's not a bad thing, as CoH is an original and interesting game, giving us fresh gameplay and some nods to M&M there and here. It doesn't overstay its welcome and is well paced, by dividing a game in parts that take place in different worlds and offer different perspectives. Basic gameplay remains the same, but units, strategies, enemies and puzzles are new in each world.\nRecommended to all M&M fans and not fans.

It`s not exactly a turn based strategy like Heroes series, more like a tactical puzzle game with simple RPG elements and without typical town management from others Heroes games. Battles itself are original and have a lot of depth, but at the same time they are quick and very easy to pick up and play. Nevertheless, later levels and multiplayer matches require a lot of planning and knowledge about various units and races. One problem, though, is the lack of information about tactics and unit's abilities in mid game.\nPlot follows a group of young heroes, who tries to save the world of Ashan from the mystical enemy, as it killed their parents, rulers of Ashan. Story is fairly interesting, but personally I didn't liked it as much as similar, episodic story from Heroes VI.\nMusic is always terrific in Heroes games, but I liked this one the most, soundtrack equally shines in both: battles and story cutscenes.\nOnline mode doesn't require to level up, as special units and artifacts can only be unlocked in campaign. The result is balanced and skill dependent battles, without long, off-putting grind.\n\nOverall, M&M: Clash of Heroes doesn't lose originality or depth despite it's simplicity and for such a tiny price I can't remember another game, which offers so many hours of gameplay... Bloody fun gameplay.\n\nReDiR's rating: 9.4","March 17, 2014","true","52.5"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

The game balance is well-done, providing some battles that were morale-boosting with their ease, but others that were right down to the draw. Even though the gameplay is the same throughout, the variance in Hero abilities and unit abilities keeps the game from feeling too repetitive. The story is simple and easy-to-follow, enough to provide a context to your progress, but not too much that you want to click through without reading.\n\nHaving finished the single-player campaign, I've tried a few multiplayer games -- and gotten my hat handed to me. I'm a level one multiplayer player, and the others are level 10 and 11. This is likely because I'm a late-comer to the game, and those who continue to play multiplayer are veterans (and much better than I am.) Still, I'm willing to try to gain experience via multiplayer, provided I luck out with an occasional win.

You form columns of like-colored creatures to form an attack or rows of like-colored creatures to create a wall.  Different creatures have different characteristics (e.g., Elven Archers attack very quickly but do modest damage, while Human Swordsmen attack much more slowly but hit harder).   Heroes level up to gain HP and stronger walls, and each hero has one unique ability (plus a second unique ability that can come from any particular magic item you find along the way).\n\nIt's not one of the deepest Match games I've ever played (nowhere near as deep as Ironcast, say), but it's a fun little game.

It seems like it's gonna be a casual match 3 type (kind of like puzzle quest) but it ends up feeling more like a srpg just because of the style, narrative, and so on.\n\nThe animations are cute, the plot is lightweight and fairly standard but not offensively done and doesn't seem to take away so far. Will probably revise after getting in, but I already feel like I've got my money's worth already in one enjoyable evening.","June 9, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The mechanics are very well-designed, the in-game assets and UI look great at any resolution, and the single-player content will likely be satisfying until completion. Being able to kick-back with a 360 controller is also a plus.\n\nDespite being a genre hybrid and having RNG, strategy and tactics actually plays a significant role, as you can customize your unit/hero/item loadout before every game, and can try-out different things once on the field. For example, you could use units/heroes that are quick to charge-up, and have them all constantly bombard your opponent from multiple points, making it difficult to defend against. Or you could focus on using strong hero units (which a player has a limited number of) that take a while to charge, but have a lot of damage-output once its turn comes and if it hasn't taken too much damage from your opponent before then. Or just about any loadout combination and tactics you can think-up.\n\nThe game also uses high-resolution art assets and an automatically-scaling UI, so the game will look great at any resolution. And the unit animations themselves (especially the Hero attack animations) are both well-done and expressive, but won't make the field difficult to grok at any point. I run the game at 1440p without any issues.\n\nAs far as the single-player mode, I thought it was well-done. While the story and characters are kind-of garbage, and I didn't like starting a new character for each chapter, the game's difficulty sloped-up very satisfyingly, and every boss was a novelty that forced you to change your tactics. I believe the reason for this is because of each character's level-cap, where the later bosses/mini-bosses in each area were all crafted for you to be at that cap, so that you couldn't just grind your way out for an easy victory against them. Aside from the bit-too-easy battles at the start and the huge difficulty ramp at the final boss, the single-player was satisfying and challenging enough to pull me the entire way through.\n\nIf you've been looking for a puzzle-RPG hybrid and want a chill game to kick back with, I'd recommend M&M: CoH.

It is nothing like the M&M series, outside of the fact that you have some familiar monster names.  You set up three of a kind vertical to attack, and three of a kind horizontal to defend.  The turn-based aspect limits how many moves you have per turn, so every action has severe consequences.  There is a bit of luck involved when requesting more pieces, and expect to get frusturated from time to time where luck can sometimes overthrow the best strategist.  Developing combos is a must for advancing in the game.  The AI will be relentless, so make sure to never hold back.\n\nAs a person who loves puzzle/strategy games, this was really up my alley.  If you aren't a puzzle enthusiast, you might find it a little overwhelming, as there are no random encounters to build up the level of your heroes and armies.  There are optional encounters to help build up your level, but every battle win helps build up the levels of your units.","June 19, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I, myself, tend to not stick with puzzle games for long as they tend to feel old pretty quickly.  However, Clash of Heroes has a pleasant mix of puzzle and strategy that really can pull you in.  For someone like myself, who tends towards strategy games, Clash of Heroes has enough strategy in it to keep me interested as well as a good amount of puzzles to mix it up.\nAdd on a campaign that is fun and pulls you in.  I find the storyline to be enganging, not incredibly violent, like most games these days, with some humor thrown in.

The combat is very strategic in a...how shall I say it...well it's like tetris where when your army comes on the field they are in rows, you can move around only 1 unit at a time and the idea is to match a set of 3 for that unit to attack. you also get more powerful units that require two core units of the same colour then really powerful ones that require four.\n\nThe story is pretty standard with the "Oh no, we're being attacked by monsters" then it being revealed early on that there is more to it than that, but the gameplay is quite addictive. Anything with quests you get from bountys gains points in my book. There are also the puzzle challenges where you are given units to defeat the enemies units and the idea it to beat all the units in a single round action, which is harder than it sounds. I managed to do 6/8 without using a guide and it's a nice brain teaser that rewards you when you've completed it.

Everything about it screams "smartphone port". The UI is clunky and ugly, although the artstyle is nice. Everything about it is designed to be operated with a big fat thumb, one handed on the toilet. Except.. the match length... the average match took me about 30 to 45 minutes to complete, all credit due to the RNG.\n\nMatches are won by sheer luck where your and the opponents reinforcements end up. If you are lucky, they will be opportune and you can get ahead with your 3 moves, if you are not... well then the opponent will stack up on walls, making it impossible to get units through. At this point you end up chipping away with minimal damage at the enemy, praying your big beefy units make it through, because the match is dragging on and on. Each match i won, was a stalmate until RNGesus finally decided to create an opening for me by giving the opponent an inopportune reinforcement draw.\n\nThere is no way to react to the loadout of the enemy, other than save scumming, and with 3 moves there was no way to make big sweeping changes to the positioning. You are focused on using whatever RNG gives you, than wasting time trying to set up big attacks. Why? Because the AI is constantly combining whatever it can.. which forces the player to do the same, trying to ward off the attacks long enough until there is an opening created by RNG.\n\nBut what really makes me not recommend the game... are some of the story encounters, where the game isn't just content with forcing you to somehow beat an enemy. No, the game throws objectives in the encounter at you. RNG moving 'allies' in the enemy ranks, which you aren't supposed to hit. Or having to protect a unit. Or hit two target at the very same time. All the while the AI is playing as it always does... basically handicapping the player.\n\nThere is an interesting formation and fusion system in the game, but under the constant onslaught of the AI pulling one off is more luck than skill. And i can only imagine that playing against real players you either have a chess game or someone is playing like the AI, combining whatever they can and thus forcing you to do the same.\n\nIts a shame. It has a pretty artwork and it could have been a really nice game, if it either let you decide where your reinforcement went, or gave you more than 3 moves, so you could actually make changes to your rows. So, its 90% luck and 10% skill.","June 17, 2015","false","8.1"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","14","29","3","6"

You should have a reset button on the puzzles. it's not much but it would make for a quicker and smoother gameplay.\nYou should get XP for failed battles, just a little. At the start of the game every mob is a few levels higher then you and you can't farm XP.\nTier 1 mobs gain max level way to fast, either increase their cap or tweak their stats to alow for more XP. More XP is _always_ better.\nSome of the loading-screen, talk/text are not optimally designed, they could go faster and smoother.\n\nRant over. it's still a very enjoyable game!

Hint, DO NOT SKIP THE DEMON BATTLE THAT COMES UP EARLY IN HIS CAMPAIGN. I repeat, do NOT skip it, or you will flat out not be able to advance. There are no random battles, no puzzles, no side missions, NOTHING. Just a story battle you will absolutely not be able to beat. I tried literally 20 times, and the best I can say is that I held my own for a bit. Her champion units are WAY too powerful to be left undefended (they can kill a wall, a unit, and you in one attack), and using your champion units (of which you can only afford 2) will either see them killed, or will reduce them to such low attack that they don't do any damage either. If this is the game developer's idea of a fun challenge (retrying & retrying & retrying & retrying until I can charge 2 champion units with my 1st turn), fire them and hire someone in touch with reality.

Plus, the gameplay is incredibly linear, so if you get stuck at some point, you're basically just stuck there. I enjoyed it until about half way through, when the tedium begins to settle in.

All presented with handdrawn cutscenes and suitable epic music.\n\nBattles will draw you in with the beautiful, easy to understand mechanics that do offer more tactical freedom than similar puzzle games as you can actually plan ahead for a few turns. Combined with some light rpg elements (leveling up units and equipping your hero with artifacts) it is certainly possible to develop a personal playstyle and come up with your own nasty strategies to obliterate your foes.\nBe warned, the luck-factor can be high at times - as units are spawned randomly and timing is everything in this game.\n\nThe visuals are beautifully executed, especially the animations deserve praise - all rendered in sharp hd-resolution - combined with the excellent soundtrack you get a very well presented package.\n\nOn top of it all there is an excellent (maybe a bit barebones)  multiplayer-mode that will make sure you keep this beauty on your harddrive for a few quick matches with friends every now and then. Overall a very enjoyable title that has tons of contents and very addictive core-mechanics that will keep you entertained for a long time.","January 23, 2013","true","44.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

An example, like I place up to make a Linked attack, but instead it makes a wall even if it shouldn't. Then the whole overpowered foes in the start of the game, where there is no way to farm exp, gold, ore or crystals for units (Elite Units costs to have).\nThe concept is a nice idea, but the story is not in the HoMM lorewise, and the whole idea of leveling up, is to make your units stronger, but hey if a lvl 1 can kill an elite lvl 4 then what is the point in leveling up the units? Same as the combat is based on luck on how your units lands.

If you like strategy RPG or puzzle games you will absolutely love this. Might & Magic Clash of Heroes is a very unique strategy RPG where you have a battle system that resembles a puzzle game.\nThe art style looks like an hybrid between anime and cartoons (probabilly anime-style but drawn by westeners). I like this art style, it looks very smooth and pleasant.\nMoving around the map works by clicking nodes where you want to go to and talking to NPC's.\nAs for the battle system, you have your units placed on a grid and you can move and stack them. To attack, you need to stack 3 units of the same type & color vertically, to create walls you need to line up 3 units of the same kind and color horizontally. There are also special units for various special attacks, which I won't explain in this review.\nThis game is potentially competitive and fun in multiplayer, and I'm also loving every minute of the campaign.","July 16, 2012","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Really makes you think about how to set up combination moves.\n\nMinuses: Certain missions in the single player campaign simply come down to luck. You can have the best strategy in the world, but you are under a severe time constraint in some missions, and if the initial setup is bad, then you might as well just reset the mission and try for a new initial setup. (Which, thankfully is possible by "retreat" option from menu. Though it costs a bit of resources in some missions)\n\nAs far as gameplay, it's match 3, which various bonuses for fusing units, chaining units, gaining extra moves for multi-combo plays. Pretty simple, and yet there is a bit of strategy to try and squeeze the most from your units with the least amount of moves.\n\nVarious "Artifacts" also affect the gameplay, and choosing the right artifacts and unit combinations can make or break certain fights.\n\nAll in all, an acceptable fun, slightly casual, with a few hair pulling moments game which kept me busy for several days.\nIf the price is acceptable in your eyes, I'd give it a solid 7/10 buy.","October 13, 2014","true","33.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The mechanics are unique, but take very little time to get used to. The gameplay finds the rare perfect blend of action and strategy, making it gratifying to play on a puzzle solving level without becoming tedious at points.

The singleplayer is interesting enough to keep you going through the whole thing, and has things to unlock to play with in multiplayer, so you'll have to go through it if you want to compete!\n\nMultiplayer is a lot of fun and definitely has a large competitive nature to it. Some strange combination of about 70% luck and 30% skill governs the game, with an unfortunate loom of unbalanced nature to some of the strategies. It's become more of a meta-game in regards to choosing what overpowered loadout you think will counter their overpowered loadout. This unfortunately takes some of the spontaneous fun out of the game imo, I prefer to play with less popular and more entertaining strategies as it keeps the game fresh. This of course means getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by people who just want max efficiency unfortunately, though.\n\nAnyway, I'd strongly recommend this game, you'll definitely get your money's worth out of it, at the very least. Just don't expect anything related to any other Might & Magic game from buying it.","July 7, 2014","true","110.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While staying impressively true to the Might&Magic universe, it brings a lighter mood to the usually serious Might&Magic games. Even in it's "combat" you can see many similarities to past games of the series. Though don't be confused, this game is much different. It is more strategic than anything, and often requires you to think about your moves rather than just throwing units at the enemy. It is probably one of the most relaxed, fun, and challenging strategy games I have ever played. Not to mention the availability of co-op online gameplay, which brings in even more strategy than with just one-on-one gameplay.\n\nThere aren't many cons I can think of off the top of my head. If anything, it would be the role luck plays in many of the games. Sometimes you just get delt a bad hand, and that can ruin the whole game. Even with the Relics you get from playing the campagin, they often aren't enough to save you from a bad start. Or sometimes the enemy start is just so good, you can't come back from his initial moves.\n\nEven so, this game is great. Whether you're into hardcore strategy or just enjoy a relaxed strategy, this game might be for you. While you can play hardcore and think 5 billion moves ahead of the other player(s) you can also just think one or two moves ahead,and still have fun, maybe even win! This is a great game, no matter what side of gaming you come from!","July 8, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Much more Puzzle Quest than I expected. It was entertaining for one or two campaigns. It got pretty tedious by the end. The story is completely throwaway, which is fine... but the M&M branding had me looking for something more. Levelling heroes and acquiring units and artifacts is a very linear process and more of a facade than it is an avenue for any sort of strategy or decision-making. Boss battles always involve fusing in one or two particular columns. Once you've played a few rounds you've played them all. Jump at $5.

This is not Bejeweled and, in fact, cannot be more different.  It is closer to a hybrid of Plants vs. Zombies, Heroes of Might and Magic, and Ogre Battle.

Instead, while the strategy for each may differ, you can play them all the same and get away with it.  At $15 the price is a little high.

The singleplayer is interesting enough to keep you going through the whole thing, and has things to unlock to play with in multiplayer, so you'll have to go through it if you want to compete!\n\nMultiplayer is a lot of fun and definitely has a large competitive nature to it. Some strange combination of about 70% luck and 30% skill governs the game, with an unfortunate loom of unbalanced nature to some of the strategies. It's become more of a meta-game in regards to choosing what overpowered loadout you think will counter their overpowered loadout. This unfortunately takes some of the spontaneous fun out of the game imo, I prefer to play with less popular and more entertaining strategies as it keeps the game fresh. This of course means getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me by people who just want max efficiency unfortunately, though.\n\nAnyway, I'd strongly recommend this game, you'll definitely get your money's worth out of it, at the very least.

While staying impressively true to the Might&Magic universe, it brings a lighter mood to the usually serious Might&Magic games. Even in it's "combat" you can see many similarities to past games of the series. Though don't be confused, this game is much different. It is more strategic than anything, and often requires you to think about your moves rather than just throwing units at the enemy. It is probably one of the most relaxed, fun, and challenging strategy games I have ever played. Not to mention the availability of co-op online gameplay, which brings in even more strategy than with just one-on-one gameplay.\n\nThere aren't many cons I can think of off the top of my head. If anything, it would be the role luck plays in many of the games. Sometimes you just get delt a bad hand, and that can ruin the whole game. Even with the Relics you get from playing the campagin, they often aren't enough to save you from a bad start. Or sometimes the enemy start is just so good, you can't come back from his initial moves.\n\nEven so, this game is great. Whether you're into hardcore strategy or just enjoy a relaxed strategy, this game might be for you. While you can play hardcore and think 5 billion moves ahead of the other player(s) you can also just think one or two moves ahead,and still have fun, maybe even win! This is a great game, no matter what side of gaming you come from!","July 8, 2014","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is completely throwaway, which is fine... but the M&M branding had me looking for something more. Levelling heroes and acquiring units and artifacts is a very linear process and more of a facade than it is an avenue for any sort of strategy or decision-making.

The comparison is unfortunate, since the similarities are only superficial. This is a true tactical RPG with an interestingly different and very deep combat system.\n\nIn combat you work with a small army on a grid, moving your different units around according to some very limited rules and grouping them together to form attack and defence formations that face off against the opponent's grid on the other side. Attacks, once formed, take 1-3 turns to complete, at which point they do damage against any enemy units across from them and, one hopes, through them to the enemy commander on the other side (while of course the enemy is doing the same to you). Once an attack is complete the attacking units are removed from the grid; reinforcements can be brought back in as the battle progresses. There are a large number of ways of combining units that are introduced as the game goes on, and doing this effectively quickly starts to take a lot of thought. It ends up being far closer to chess than to a simple puzzle game.\n\nOutside of combat, this is a fairly simple RPG, quite reminiscent of a PS1-generation JRPG. There's not a lot of exploration, the quests are trivial, and the story is your typical "stop the bad guys from stealing the item that will let them take over the world" thing. Clearly the main focus of the game is the combat, as with many other tactical RPGS.\n\nIf you're in to tactical games, this is certainly a good one, and is well worth the low price.","February 21, 2014","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's part puzzle and part strategy, and whole lot of luck. You set up an army before battle selecting 3 core units (read: cannon fodder/fuel), and two specail units(either elite or ultimate). Core units can attack by making a vertical line of three same color unit(plus charge time). Walls are made by a horizontal line of three same colored core units(these absorb damage of course). The special units need to be powered by the corresponding colored core unit placed behind the special unit(elite 2 units and ultimate 4 units). You also get a special move that differs on the hero leading your army. In single player they're all are balanced, but in mutiplayer you gain access to some broken characters due to their magic skill. Items can be equip to give you an advantage. Story is standard fare, fun gameplay, and some very funny one-off characters. I liked it.","December 27, 2011","true","53.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahboyy/recommended/61700/","mahboyy","Alltruestreamerstrivefor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mahboyy/","150 products in account","A pretty simplistic game in appearance that reveals its complexity through a single hour of playtime.\n\nThe basic 3-units principle(to make an attack, three vertical units of the same colour, to make walls, three horizontal) gets immensely complex and varied once you add links(having groups of the same colour attack at the same turn) that reinforce your attack, fusions(two attack groups one behind the other fuse into one group twice as strong), and of course Elite and Champion units that require 2 and 4 units to activate them.\n\nAlmost every single unit from every single race has a specific capacity, poison, jumping over walls, magical defenses, immunity to attack while charging, hacking the enemy lines/enemy charging power while charging, the variety added to the basic 3-units system makes this an incredibly capable game with possibilities that never seem to be insufficient no matter the circumstances. You can literally be about to be killed by your enemy, call reinforcements, and find yourself gifted with a generous unit placement that allows you to build the walls and defenses you need to just survive and counterattack to victory. There is a freshness in this game that never dies out.\n\nIt's actually one of its greatest strengths and weaknesses, how random the battles can go. You can be gifted with a perfect line of units from the very start or have absolutely nothing to go on with. The game can be very frustrating when a perfectly planned attack is ruined by the sudden arrival of an enemy Champion just in the column you're about to use to finish off your foe. It can also be frustrating in the other way: you will call reinforcements to see one of your costly Champion units die immediately at the hands of some basic enemy attack with 2 attack because you couldn't get it moving in time.\n\nAs frustrating and unfair as the randomness is, it is also one of this game's best aspects. The only reason I speedrun this game is that it has the merit of never(apart from the tutorials) making me feel like déjà vu. Every battle is at least new enough, no moments in the game feel like I've been here before(except the bosses, of which there are only 4, along with quite a few unfair pre-prepared battles) and even when it does happen, the randomness of the reinforcements usually palliates that very quickly.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's simply excellent. Having played through the campaign quite a few times for speedrunning, I have yet to find this game to bore me at any point, and it's quite surprising to realise how a simple system can be at the same time constantly demanding and very free.\nA good example is the fusions: if you want one, with core, Elite or Champion units, you're gonna have to get rid of all your walls first, since you need six tiles to make any fusion and there are only six between the goal your enemy has to hit and your first line.\n\nBeyond that, every hero has got his own superpower which can range from somewhat poor(hello Cyrus) to ridiculously broken when you know how to use them(hello Aidan with lots of walls, Anwen with a clear opening, Markal with two uncharged Death Knights).\n\nBeyond beyond that, artifacts can be found in many flavors in the campaign and then used profusely in skirmishes or online battles. And the variety there is by no means inferior to the one in the units, although I'm sure everyone will end up using ridiculously strong artifacts like the Spider Cloak, Lion's Mane or Celerity Ring.\n\nOn a side note, the balancing of the campaigns is a bit poor. Why is Nadia not only ridiculously rich in HP(she starts at level 7 out of 10!), but also given enemies that play defensively, troops that make almost no damage, and is also generously dotted with Academy enemies, who can raise layers of superwalls like drinking a cup of coffee? It makes her campaign ridiculously long and just unpleasant. The times I get for Anwen range under 50 minutes, Godric takes less than an hour, Fiona has a rather long campaign that takes about 1h10 minutes, Aidan has a rather short campaign that also takes less than an hour, and Nadia ends up taking me 1 hour 40 minutes!\n\nContinuing on the bad side, the story is completely ignorable. It's not bad(no big plot holes, awful writing or terrible characters) but absolutely nothing about it feels in any way original. The characters almost feel stereotypical, you have the courageous and honorable big brother, the courageous but more sheltered little sister, the more angsty teenage younger brother, the huntress of the woods, the good student girl who fights the good fight...\n\nAll of their personalities can be written in a quick line and although they never made me facepalm(none of the main five anyway), the last thing I wanted was to be tasked with finding an interesting personality trait among them. I don't mind finding needles in haystacks, but this is just impossible.\n\nThe story is of the same type, it's nothing awful, but it doesn't convey anything even remotely amusing or deep. It ends in a happy note that works but doesn't really follow the somewhat tragic storytelling we had for most of the game. It's not really light on clichés and nothing about it is worth mentioning. I had a laugh once in the entire game. A giggle, really, at the demon who dies from the volcanic eruption he wanted to see. The rest is skippable. Special mention, though, to the villains: they range from comic relief(Azexes and his forgetful schoolboy behavior) to so obvious it hurts(Carlyle and his fashion for being a general ♥♥♥♥).\n\nVisually, I like the animé art style quite a lot, and the quality of the animations is certainly very helpful at making it a nice game to watch. I do have a serious issue about those: they're long. REALLY long. Sometimes it's ok, but seeing the knight twirl his spear around before charging for the 1000th time has really grown old. Less long animations would've really helped in making the game a lot more fun. The PLAYER TURN and ENEMY TURN screens are also ridiculous, they last something like 3,5 seconds! Talk about a needless loss of time! Those could've simply not existed and all would've been better.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the animé visual style for almost everyone, some races are totally failed: the good guys and necromancers are mostly fine, but the magicians' golems or titans look nothing like the machines they are, although that's nothing in comparison to the Demons and how every unit but the hound is failed. Even when lit with flames and about to strike, I find it difficult to take the immense Pit Fiend more seriously than a plushie. Demons look neither scary nor ugly, and that's a true minus for me.\n\nWith all that said, the last element is the music.\nIt sucks.\nNo other way to say it. This game has very poor music.\nOut of five campaigns, forests, a capital city of men, the land of the undead, Hell, and a mighty Magician tower, I remember exactly zero theme songs. Why? Because there aren't any songs. It's all ambients. BAD ambients, with no memorable sounds at all. Whooshing winds and shaking leaves, that's all.\nThe battle musics are thankfully very varied, however that would be a good thing only if they didn't all suck as well! Out of the eight or so battle themes, there is one I like. The final boss music is fine too. The victory theme(the first 4 seconds of it anyway) and the two former are the only songs I can say I appreciate musically out of the whole game. Having played HoMM5 before, I know that many of these songs were taken from the rest of the franchise and sort of put in this one. It doesn't fit, none of the songs are that good, so it's a game that is terribly uninteresting musically.\n\nA lot more could be said about bad minigames, Sonic 06-type loading times(two loading times into each battle), but I reached the limit.\nFinal word is that despite my complaints, this is an incredibly fun and varied game that always develops into more complexity and fun.

You can develop your strategies based on how many turns your units take before they attack and what particular strengths they have. Using different types of units can allow you to build up waves of attacks that complement one another.

Those could've simply not existed and all would've been better.\n\nAs much as I appreciate the animé visual style for almost everyone, some races are totally failed: the good guys and necromancers are mostly fine, but the magicians' golems or titans look nothing like the machines they are, although that's nothing in comparison to the Demons and how every unit but the hound is failed. Even when lit with flames and about to strike, I find it difficult to take the immense Pit Fiend more seriously than a plushie. Demons look neither scary nor ugly, and that's a true minus for me.\n\nWith all that said, the last element is the music.\nIt sucks.\nNo other way to say it. This game has very poor music.\nOut of five campaigns, forests, a capital city of men, the land of the undead, Hell, and a mighty Magician tower, I remember exactly zero theme songs. Why? Because there aren't any songs. It's all ambients. BAD ambients, with no memorable sounds at all. Whooshing winds and shaking leaves, that's all.\nThe battle musics are thankfully very varied, however that would be a good thing only if they didn't all suck as well! Out of the eight or so battle themes, there is one I like. The final boss music is fine too. The victory theme(the first 4 seconds of it anyway) and the two former are the only songs I can say I appreciate musically out of the whole game. Having played HoMM5 before, I know that many of these songs were taken from the rest of the franchise and sort of put in this one. It doesn't fit, none of the songs are that good, so it's a game that is terribly uninteresting musically.\n\nA lot more could be said about bad minigames, Sonic 06-type loading times(two loading times into each battle), but I reached the limit.\nFinal word is that despite my complaints, this is an incredibly fun and varied game that always develops into more complexity and fun. Try it.","January 8, 2014","true","63.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortuneatly it is plagued by bugs and doesn't seem to be getting any real support from the developers so far.\n\nMultiplayer is particularly bad. There is no penalty for people quitting games or constantly lagging out. There is no real lobby to browse all the open games, their rules, and the players hosting them. There is no way to see how many people are on and willing to play multiplayer, so you have no idea if you are likely to get a game soon or the only one online. Once you start looking for a multiplayer game, you can't do anything else. It would make a lot more sense to be able to go play single player until your multiplayer match was ready, but no one thoght of that and the game is basically abandoned at this point so unlikely to get any such updates (plus it was basically a console port as it was).\n\nAll of this works against building a thriving multiplayer community, driving people away, which creates a viscious cycle. The people that are left playing are the most hardcore of the hardcore, resulting in uneven match-ups of a level 7 player against a level 378 player, because there isn't enough of a player pool to do any fair matchmaking.\n\nIt's a real shame that it suffers from these basic UI and matchmaking design flaws, because the actual gameplay is fantastic. Despite all of these issues, I'd recommend the game, just make sure some of your friends get a copy because that's pretty much the only way you'll get to have any fun in multiplayer.\n\nThe story is also pretty lame, but it is set in the new Might & Magic universe so that's pretty much to be expected. Really miss 3D0's Enroth and Erathia setting for Might and Magic.","October 7, 2011","true","68.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The campaign lasts about 30 hours and there is a multiplayer mode. Outside of the battle mode there is very little to do, so if you aren't into the puzzle-esque battle system you won't like this game. The storyline is quite interesting and takes place before the events of HoMM V. Graphics wise the game utilizes manga-stylized characters and colorful environment. While i particularly wouldn't enjoy this in a Heroes of Might and Magic game, it works extraordinarily well here.","November 6, 2011","true","39.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Multiple storylines = lots and lots of grinding, and some missions have arbitrary goals that get really annoying due to the randomness of puzzle pieces. Frustrating at times, and the music is average, but the art and the interesting puzzle ideas make it a great game in small doses.\n\n\n\nMultiplayer is awesome though, as you lose all of the cons of the above mentioned story mode.","December 27, 2012","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to say it's a bad basis for game design, just that it was one I didn't think was for me. But Clash of Heroes took me by surprise with an intelligent twist on the whole "Battle Bejewled" formula with a design that gives a lot of meaning and tension in your choices. Describing it is a bit hard, but once you get a hang of the basic idea, the game then adds a bunch of ways to maximize your damage if you're patient and have some foresight. Playing optimally takes work, and it's a lot of fun once all the different tools and variations are in play.\n\nThe game also has a very modular design in pretty much every aspect: every unit has a different way to deal damage and a different timing on when they deal it, the items you equip and the spells you cast can have a significant affect on what your strategy will be going into the game. And on top of that, each army comes from six different races who all play very differently from each other.\n\nIn short, this is a thoroughly excellent strategy game that delivers much more than anyone would have rightly expected from it. It's often on sale for $2.50, and a bargain at twice that price.","May 2, 2013","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just like „Might and Magic Dark Messiah” this game doesn't have much in common with original series. It is more like „Puzzle Quest” rather than „Heroes”.\nGameplay is based on puting units in formations, which, depending on the arrangement will attack opponent or put defensive walls . When you put 3 units of the same colour in column, these units will join in formation and attack after charging time. And if you put three units of the same color in a row they will turn into the wall that will block the opponent's attacks .\nJust like in „Heroes: Might and Magic” we have various factions. We will lead units of elves, humans, undead, demons and mages. Each of these factions has its own units and various mechanics associated with them. In addition to the basic units we have all kinds of special and elite units. Special units activate by putting two standard units of the same colour behind them. Elite units activate by putting two rows of two basic units of the same color. Every faction have its own special creatures, for example ents, dragons or angels. Each one of them have their own special ability. For example druid's attack extends load time of opponent's unit, which gives you time to counter their attack. Not only the units have special skills, also your characters have their own powers.\nStoryline is not deep enough to impress me. The scenario looks like it was written for some children cartoon. Demons attacked unsuspecting kingdoms with intention of conquest. Psychological progress of characters is trivial. Most interesting character in this game is Aidan, with whom we play in demons campaign. If you were expecting interesting plot in this title, you couldn't be more wrong.\nSingle player campaign is well balanced and shows you the mechanics of the game very well. There is possibility to level-up by doing side-quests to make main story easier to progress. The campaign works great until it starts to “diversify” the game by introducing frustrating mechanics such as avoiding the guards by moving beyond their field of vision, which, when joined with awkward control cause only frustration and tend to think , "Why is it even here? ". In each of the new campaigns, we find such elements , which in my opinion are there only to make the game longer. Completion of the campaign was a route through hell. The longer I was playing, the more i was tired and frustrated with the game. It is full of mechanics designed to make your life as difficult as possible and do not allow you to fully enjoy the entertainment of solidly designed mechanics . Battles are getting so absurd that in the last fight I was forced to use only the basic units to defeat my opponent. It was quite sad because it gives a lot of satisfaction to strike with lightning by the magician or jump out of the sky with a titan . However, for some reason, the authors said "You know what, if a player wants to finish this game he will have to earn it", which I think turns having fun into the work and stops the pleasure of playing this game.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is still quite active. On the game in multiplayer mode I was waiting for a maximum of about 4 minutes. The problem is a small number of players, which makes you battle an opponent who has a level such as 307. From what I could figure out a higher level in multiplayer does not give you any advantage over your opponent , but you have to reckon with the fact that you could play with opponents who have spend on this title much more time than you do.\nSingle Player mode takes about 19 ​​hours to finish, me personally game took about 23 hours , where most of the time I was raging in the last campaign. The game provides a whole lot of fun with online multiplayer mode as well as the hot seats mode. The game is certainly worth its current price and will give you a lot of fun if you like logic games with a bit of character development.","February 15, 2014","true","23.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A beautiful, polished game with excellent presentation, surprising strategic depth and a simple but engaging story. The best Heroes of Might and Magic game for quite some time. 8/10\n\nStory: The story is simple and light but, married with the clean presentation, is still an endearing and somewhat engaging experience. Straightforward but nevertheless interesting characters will appeal to most people, and the big names to Heroes fans in particular. 6/10\n\nGameplay:  I should start this by saying that I hate Match 3 games with a burning passion. But it feels wrong to even call this Match 3; it feels more like genuine turn-based strategy. Each side takes turns moving units around to match three and create ‘formations’, which then attack the other side. This is simple at first but, as you unlock new units and combinations, it becomes much more complex and interesting. It’s a very well-balanced game with offensive, defensive and mixed strategies all being equally viable. 9/10\n\nGraphics: The presentation is excellent, colourful and polished, and the attack animations are powerful. It’s surprisingly fun to see classic Heroes characters rendered in an anime style. 8/10\n\nSound/Music: The sound is great and the re-mastered soundtrack will cause Heroes fans to reminisce like crazy.  8/10","June 1, 2015","true","31.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
