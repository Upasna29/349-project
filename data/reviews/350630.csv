I spent about 1 hr to finish the whole game and I will recommend this to my friends if they are not ragequitters. In fact I usually like such games to while away hours.\n\nFrom the name you can hazard a guess that it's kinda a game sharpening your reflexes, making you cry or ragequit, or whatever, only after giving it a try you will indulge in it. Basically it isn't too hard for me, I'd believe that comparing with Super Meatboy it's pretty much easier. I'd also like to emphasize my pithy advice that please do not equate the game's good or bad with your capacity...\n\nMoving square on a grid is challenging when there are lots of enemy dots coming over, with the black and white style you will think it's confusing but I'm fine with it anyway.\n\nMeanwhile Dodge can be expanded to 100 levels with randomized dot tracks, and randomized colors even in different levels, again I'm fine with the current game, it's extraodinaryly designed and I'm already fascinated by it.","June 25, 2015","true","1.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/350630/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1843 products in account","Review originally posted at Apoch's Metal Review[www.apochs.net].\n\nDespite all the advancements in gaming today, the indie development world still manages to turn out some fairly simple games for those looking for a breather from the big name franchises of today. This is the case with Dodge, an Action/Puzzle style title from independent publisher and developer named Yokcos. According to the official blog, it's a game that was "crafted in forty eight hours" through Game Maker, as well as SFXR to create the audio. The venture has received a fair deal of praise from users and the media alike for being an example of "minimalism" in a complicated world, but does Dodge have anything to offer gamers today, or is it actually something far more pointless?\n\nDodge is, by all accounts, a truly minimalistic experience. The core concept is simple: Avoid the incoming obstacles. You are presented a limited grid and are allowed to move frequently on it, as well as move off the edge to appear on the opposite side. There's also two different ways to play. The main allure is "Infinity", which is essentially a survival mode that pits you on a three-by-three field against various obstacles such as the bullets and random lines that can block your path to safety. There's also various short levels you can tackle, forcing you to stay alive until a rich block outline appears, which you need to let make contact with you in order to finish the stage. There is a total of thirty of those short stages.\n\nPretty much everything about this game screams the early days of Intellivision and Atari 2600 titles, just with a crisp presentation and a limited .MIDI soundtrack that sounds like a Punk song turned eight-bit against simple effects. The other dramatic alteration is more of a cosmetic one that lies within the Options menu, which manipulates the colors on screen. You have your traditional black and white/white and black appearance, but there's also a "changing hues", "rainbow", both of which are about the same thing, and finally "seizure", complete with a justified warning due to the intense strobe light effect it creates.\n\nBut, all this said, is it fun? Well, it all depends. Are you looking for something relatively simple but with a growing difficulty curve? If so, then Dodge is something you'll get a kick out of. The main killing point is that this release costs two dollars US at this point. While it does offer a good amount of replay value thanks to "Infinity" mode, the game itself does get incredibly repetitive pretty quick. Plus, knowing it was developed in forty-eight hours does make you feel as though you're being a bit overcharged. If you're tired of long, convoluted stories with complex controls and just want something simple you can pick up and play, Dodge is worth grabbing, though worth waiting for a sale on if you can't justify paying the full price given the aforementioned blog post description dismissing an extensive development regime.\n\nOverall Score: 6.5/10","April 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
