Under an hour to finish. That's more or less okay-ish if the enemies weren't that repetitive and easy to defeat. The bosses are well designed and story is surely funny, just there's not really a lot of meat on the bones of this game.\n\nIt feels like Golden Axe on a budget, but that's not a bad thing at all since it feels like Golden Axe ;) The camera could be more up close to the action and the game really needs more and more challenging normal enemies, but overall it's a fun ride for the money. Maybe wait for a sale as the game is really nothing more than an hour of gameplay.","August 12, 2014","true","2.3"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","41","52","0","3"

It has quirky humor mixed with blood and guts.  At times the difficulty is near Battletoads, which I feel is a great thing.  Challenge accepted for accepting my money Sucker Free Games.  The best thing about Dungeons is that it's 3 player.  So once I make 2 friends all of us can enjoy this epic adventure.  I'm a pretty lonely guy and most of the time I don't post reviews because I'm also very shy but I was compelled to post a review of this game.  Dungeons: The Eye of Draconus brought back childhood memories of visiting my cousins and playing Double Dragon with them.  It was one of the only times I got to play videos games with other people.  Sure I play games online with people but it's easy for people to accept you if they don't have to see you.

You tried so hard and failed so, so badly that I almost just feel sorry for you. Your poor hit detection and unsatisfying combat left me bored and frustrated, your looks shuffled between blurry sprites to clashing art styles, and your dialog...I can barely begin to describe what an atrocity it is.\n\nYou obviously were inspired by classic beat-em-ups like Golden Axe, but you miss the mark almost entirely by how week and clumsy your combat ultimately is. I guess it never occurred to you to balance enemies for different player numbers either, which I guess becomes a moot point when the online multiplayer is all but entirely broken anyway.\n\nBut back to the writing, I have to wonder if you ever made it out of fifth grade. It's almost like you were attempting to write the most unprecedentedly dumb and juvenile lines ever seen in a game, ranging from cringe worthy to being downright in poor taste (that mission where you fight a pair of sex obsessed homosexuals? seriously?). Maybe next time you could spring for actual voice actors too instead of a bunch of your friends recording in your mom's basement.\n\nI had high hopes for you, Dungeons, but almost as if in anticipation of this you came out of the gate extravagantly putting your worst foot forward before proceeding to become almost intolerably bad the longer I spent with you. I'm sorry, Dungeons, this isn't going to work. I regret spending the hour I did with you, and you won't be hearing from me again when you release your sequel.

It is simultaneously total trash.\n\nDungeons: The Eye of Draconis is a 3 player beat 'em up in the vein of the 16 bit era most closely emulating a satirical version of Golden Axe.\n\nThe reason I like this game is that its very well animated. It controls just how you expect and things die in a satisfying way when you kill them. There are boss battles. There is even a feint amount of variety in the attacks. You have 3 basic classes. The big guy with a sword. The ranged wizard (who can summon a ♥♥♥♥ing chicken that breathes fire for obvious reasons) and the slightly more speedy Valkyrie.\n\nThe bad parts are the voice acting ITS ♥♥♥♥ING ATROCIOUS. The overall 'satire' of the so called comedic touches are bland, unfunny, probably offensive to someone but not in the truthful observational kind of offensiveness. Its just regular offensive. I should reiterate that its offensive in that it affronted me in my ability to enjoy the game rather than some '#triggered' nonsense.\n\nI actually found myself enjoying the game in a sort of meditative way whilst listening to music (completely drowning out the game sound) smacking dudes or Orcs with beer hats on or what have you. See its funny, Orcs drinking beer. When you allow the sounds of the game to be heard  it induces uncontrollable cringing. Why did no one stop them during VO? --you'll ask yourself.\n\nTHE GIST\nI want to give the people that made this game another chance because it seems like they could make a good game but whatever reason, they chose not to embark on such an endeavor.","February 7","false","0.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

If you have not, it is a 2D fantasy brawler in which you control a character and slaughter waves of enemies before moving on to next stage and repeating this activity. It can be played in single player or local co-op (not sure if online co-op is available), up to three players, which is probably the most enjoyable way.\n\nWhat this game has, and Golden Axe did not, is lots and lots of blood and nerdy humour type jokes (wacky voice acting / fighter named Bolax / mage's special attack summons a giant fire-breathing chicken mount / orc frat boys / gay zombies / etc.), which may or may not work for you.\n\nThe game is quite challenging, although you get unlimited continues (at least on normal difficulty), so the challenge lies mostly in getting the achievements. I died a lot, and only got 2 of 12 in the end. Curiously, the first boss was the hardest for me.\n\nNote that The Eye of Draconus game is approximately 1 hour in length, so getting it at a discount or in a bundle is about the only way to get your money's worth. Might be worth a playthrough, if you enjoy slaughtering kobold children.\n\nI would give this game a neutral rating, if I could, but since Steam only allows me to reommend the game or not, I am going with not - because it is too short for its normal price.","October 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","0"

Boasting three playable characters, a multitude of adversaries to slay, and a lot of humor, does D:TED deliver?\n\nWell.....You saw the big fat thumbs down didn't you?\n\nFirst off let me start by saying I become a real jerk when it comes to reviewing beatemups, hack & slashers, and similar belt-scrolling games. Some children were raised by wolves, I was raised by arcade machines. I know what to expect out of the genre and I hate it when certain essential elements aren't properly handled.\n\nD:TED clocks in at less than an hour, potentially less than 45 minutes if cut-scenes are skipped. This is a good length for an arcade-styled beatemup. This isn't supposed to be Castle Crashers where there are dozens of stages, experience points, and tons of weapons that are +1 here and -1 there. A fair number of bosses have to be contended with, and they require different strategies in order for the player to succeed. Enemy variety is also pretty solid, which is rare for the genre and always welcome.\n\nThe three playable characters consist of a barely-clothed drunk who angers easily, a thief(harlot?) who swings daggers, and the cleric that throws fireballs and summons a fire-breathing chicken. I didn't know clerics could do that, but I guess it depends on what God they're trying to convince everyone to worship. Whatever the case, this line-up is diverse enough to satisfy any play-style.\n\nBut now we have to get to the main failing of D:TED. The complete lack of proper mechanics. The life-blood of the beatemup (or any game for that matter) is in the mechanics. It's a catch-all term that accounts for all the rules the game has to follow. Mechanics could be what constitutes the player doing or taking damage, the height and arc of the jump, or determining whether a sword that is swung at two monsters registers a hit on one or both.  When the mechanics are faulty, the entire game suffers, and all the good decisions and intriguing game-design in the world can't save it.\n\nBasically, all deadly objects don't even have to touch the player to do damage. I've been hit by everything from flying kobold toddlers to rainbow hearts, even though on-screen they weren't even close. I've killed orks despite the blades of my daggers missing them by several feet. A flying boss takes far longer than it should due to constant misses. These occurences add up and the game ceases to be enjoyable. If you're going to play this game I recommend the Cleric. Thanks to his projectiles I don't have to deal with the crapshoot that is the melee-based combat.\n\nD:TED has promise, good ideas, and its own unique story and characters, but the execution simply isn't there. I couldn't get any enjoyment out of the game. YMMV","September 1, 2014","false","1.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

First the game's activation key didn't work right, then I went to seek help on the Steam page, and it didn't exist. When, a few days later, I finally got the game installed and booted up, I played for about 30 minutes before the game crashed during the second stage boss battle.\n\nNeedless to say, I was not smitten with my first interactions with Eye of Draconus. I'll tell you my first impressions before I go any further. It immediately felt repetitive, the comedy felt forced, and playing as a single player in a game meant for three was *terrible*. The only saving grace is that you can keep continuing when you run out of lives, akin to the old arcade games like Golden Axe and TMNT (which is what this game reminds me so much of). It can be very challenging at times, which isn't a bad thing.\n\nThe game doesn't list online coop as available on its page currently, but it is clearly available as an option in the menus. I gave this game another try later on as a local coop (Two controllers) and it was a far less painful experience. It still wasn't great. The game plays better with more players, as I'm sure was intended. I also had problems with the sound in the game. It needs normalization... it was too loud when I booted up the game so I lowered it to about 40%. At that mark, the player's speech was a 2/10, music a 4/10, sound effects 6/10 and cutscenes 8/10 (Sound level). I definitely think some adjustment to the sound is in order.\n\nI really tried to like Dungeons: Eye of Draconus. I was a big fan of the games that it pays homage to, but I felt it just wasn't what it could have been. As mentioned previously, I feel like it really tried too hard on the humor, the graphics had some strange discrepancies (Rose was skinny in the hand-drawn images and a muscular amazon woman when you play her in-game?!), the music was alright when you could hear it, the gameplay was extremely repetitive (and I *love* Dynasty Warriors), and in general I just don't feel like it brings anything original (gameplay-wise) to the table. Except a chubby Barbarian in a speedo. That's genuinely terrifying.\n\nI know that developers go through alot of work to create games for us, and I'm not discounting that. As a friend told me, not every game is for every person. Unfortunately, as bad as I feel for submitting a negative review, this one just wasn't for me.

The game mentions playing like other classics such as old TMNT  games and other beat-em-ups, but this is nothing like those. There are 3 total characters. The steam page mentions variety of gameplay and attacks. Both melee characters have swipes in different directions, but that is the extent of the "varied" combat. Each character also gets a special that sporadically fills up and sometimes isn't very helpful. The game is super repetitive. You fight the same 3 guys: kobolds, orks, and something else I can't remember, all of which are modeled similarly, in countless waves while you mash the single attack button endlessly.\n\nThe game tries too hard be funny, but it completely fails. Poor dialogue, bare-bone story. It is also super short at around an hour, which I can't decide if it's a blessing or a curse, considering how the game plays. There is nothing in the environment to use or manipulate. Also the hit detection and ability to judge the same level plane of enemies is terrible, meaning you miss countlessly on bosses. Sometimes the attacking and buttons are finnicky. There is no leveling or character customization, just replaying using the same boring attacks on the same boring enemies, with terrible graphics to boot. Literally get any other beat-em-up out there instead and you'll be doing yourself a favor. 4/10.","July 4, 2015","false","9.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Love kick ♥♥♥ music from 80s/90s video games and music?  Do you love to wreck a mother ♥♥♥♥er?  Then read this.\n\nI didn't expect much since I got this in a bundle of games but it has knocked my socks off.\n\nThe art is totally like a comic book you'd read in the late 80s and the environments are so well designed, they almost look like illustrations from the "Heavy Metal" magazine, though the character designs are a bit more modern, and did I mention the music rocks ♥♥♥ and kicks your ears in the face?\n\nThis is a game made for older gamers or people who like older things.  The sense of humor is adult, hilarious, and full of references, with more than one to Monty Python and and a load of jabs at the games that inspired Eye of Draconus, the wit is just so great.  The voice acting is good too and the actors have great timing, they made me bust a gut.\n\nThe gameplay itself is your standard beat'em-up from the 80s and 90s, but leaning more toward Golden Axe.  You move all directions, have an attack move, a jump, and jump attack of course, a grab button to pick up food and power-ups, and you have a special ability button that does cool attack varying by character, the Wizard's special ability is especially funny but I don't want to spoil it.  You also come across enemies with mounts which you can steal and use for a while.  You even get the sword sign that says when to "GO", and the controls are sooo smooth.  Did I mention the music?\n\nYou get to pick from three characters:  The Barbarian, the Wizard, and the Thief.  Each character, of course, has unique abilities and their special moves are all varied and fun.  The characters themselves(and voice actors) as I said before are great, absolutely spectacular. The jokes are top notch, and did I mention the awesome music?\n\nThe game also boasts smooth local play but apparently the online COOP is waiting for a patch and isn't very functional at this point.  Like most beat'em-ups from the old days it get's pretty mindless and repetitive, but that's part of the fun.  The music is awesome too.\n\nThe game is pretty short but it makes for a lot of play throughs with all your friends, so it's kind of a good thing and kind of a bad thing, but the gameplay is well paced though and the difficulty dosen't jump from stage to stage.  Plus the awesome music helps to keep you in that mind setting of destroying everything on screen.\n\nSo, I would definitely recommend getting this game if you like the sound of what I described, and if you grew up in the 80s/90s you will definitely not be disappointed by the amazing nostalgia factor.\n\n9/10 (1 extra point for nostalgia)","September 1, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You can finish the game in about one hour.\n- nice humor, although that's certainly a matter of taste\n- the game is full of sexual allusions, I liked them but again, that's a matter of taste\n- early 90’s arcade style\n- full controller support\n- one to three players\n- co-op, players can simply join right in the middle of the game, you just need additional controllers\n- it's an indi-game, so it's far from perfect\n- good music, but again, that's a matter of taste\n- orcs are afro-Americans. Is that racism? Well, I guess it is, but it's funny in a way that I believe even black people will laugh about it\n- smurfs are Russians. Funny? Yep!\n- you get to kill Sigfried and Roy! Great, although the fighting sucks because they are flying in the air\n- full achievements can be reached even if you play alone, you just need three controllers for one of the achievements\n\nI do NOT! recommend buying this game stand-alone. I received this game because it was part of a bundle and as such, it's OK. I had some fun and it was enjoyable.\n\nAfter finishing the game I spent 0,26 cents for the missing steam trading cards and received an emoticon currently worth 3,20 Euros on marketplace.

So basically the best of this game are it's jokes and unusual characters.\nThe humour of this game is not for everyone, if you're expecting smart complicated jokes, this might not be the best for you.\n\nAs i played this game it felt like watching some adult swim cartoon (wich is good for me and that's why i like it and waiting for chapter 2).\n\nThe voice acting worked good, but in some scenes it sounded like the mic was causing some small echo\n\nSoo faar at last on this episode it does not shows much of a story, just a bounch of anti heroes doing what they do best:\nKilling stuff, looting stuff and messing things up before running away.\n\nThe gameplay is simple as it's story, but still, works as intended, just like the old beat em up games wich was the goal of the developers anywais, to have fun killing stupid monsters and stealing objects before your friends get them\n\nSadly the game is kinda short, it has around 8 areas with 7 bosses.\n\nThe game might be a good challenge if you're collecting achievements. 3 of them might be hard, as for example there is one that ask you to beat the game witouth jumping and the other needs you to not use the special attack and the another one ask you to beat the game witouth using any continue.\nThere are only a few, 3 i think, that needs you to play with other players to get to unlock them","January 5, 2015","true","3.3"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

Still not a solid enough game to make me want to play it again. After 20 minutes of playing, of bad jokes, of poor voice acting, we turned it off. Moved onto Distance Beta which while not a beat-'em up, is a great racing game, and we both started having fun again.\n\nIf you get it as part of a bundle, I'm sorry to hear that. If you got it via gift, that's even worse. But if you paid full price for it, if you ask me, is not worth it.","November 25, 2014","false","0.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The gameplay and game-length both leave lots to be desired though.

The background is hand painted and the characters during dialog scenes are great. The in game heroes and baddies leave something to be desired but whatever.\n\nThe gameplay is reminiscent of TMNT or Golden Ax as the developer says but the action is not as fluid or as engaging as those older games. Also it is obvious that this game is made for 3 players. Playing it solo is a chore and you will have to constantly continue arcade style to beat the game.\n\nThe story is pretty good and the college humor is enjoyable.\n\nIf you have money to waste and want a bit of a laugh then go ahead and buy this game.\n\nBut if you are a budget gamer like myself then stay away. The single player experience is not enjoyable and the gameplay is not worth the money.\n\nCheck out my video review here\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcFIcNR2CqQ\n\n\nAnd subscribe to my podcast (Steam on the Cheap) on Itunes\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/steam-on-cheap-discovering/id899847567?mt=2","August 13, 2014","false","1.4"," 6 of 17 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","6","17","0","0"

The dialog and characters are just one bad gay joke after another. The combat is slow and clunky. A 5 year old Autistic kid could slap together a better story while baning their head against a wall. That's pretty much what this game is like, banging your head against a wall, both because it's so bad and you've wasted your time and money on it. That's time you could have used doing something better like taking a dump. This game is so bad you should lose points on your steam profile just for having it in your library.","December 13, 2014","false","2.5"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

And lets not forget references that stopped being relevant 20 years ago- seriously, Smurfs as a communist society? That was edgy in '89. Still, not completely worthless, just not good.","January 18","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
