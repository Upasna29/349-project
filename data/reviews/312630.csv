I didn't realize it was a PC port of an android title until after I started playing, so at first I wasn't sure that it was a good choice. It turns out however that;\n- It's pretty fun and has some cool and sometimes pretty amusing features\n- After playing the standard edition, deluxe and OTT versions don't sound worth it at all\n\nhttp://youtu.be/mQPyJQA-BpQ\nhttp://youtu.be/k14gphrlbXY\nAt first maps looked like they were way too small and felt cramped. Tower placement is restricted to spots around the map marked with an X. Also you can't increase the speed of the game. None of these were really an issue in the end later maps were big enough and you just need to make sure you have a good combination of different types of towers in limited locations where you are able to place them. You also have a pool of up to seven heroes, three of which you can take onto the battlefield each stage. I unlocked five of them by stage ten. They can be ordered around the map to attack enemies and also have special abilities which can be upgraded as your heroes level up after completing stages. My favorite heroes were the recon and rocketeer. The rocketeer can periodically call in a powerful cruise missile strike anywhere on the map. The recon was able to mark targets so that the rocketeer and any missile turrets could fire missiles at them even if they were out of range. That was my favorite thing about this game. Not every tower defense game has stuff like that. Also you can buy weapon and armor upgrades for your heroes. This is how you spend your coins and medals. I just bought the standard version of this game so I earned all my currency just by completing stages. Some of the stuff is pretty expensive especially the armor, so I could only afford basic weapon upgrades. This didn't really seem to matter, I still kicked ♥♥♥ without better gear. I don't see why you would want to get the deluxe or OTT editions of this game just for extra coins and medals. 100,000 coins will only get you two sets of basic armor... You also use medals to resurrect fallen heroes between stages, but so far my guys hardly ever died. I don't seem have a shortage of medals. Again another reason why I don't see the point in paying more real money for coins and medals. Why would you pay for extra currency in a non free to play single player game?\n\nSome of the enemy models were really amusing. There are giant disfigured teddy bears that shoot laser beams out there eyes and obese green skinned cleaver wielding zombies that ride mobility scooters lol amd puke gibs all over your turrets and heroes. Also I really liked some of the dialogue, one the heroes sends up Batman 'my throat hurts... do you have a throat lozenge?' lol\n\nMaybe there are actually people out there who want the extra art and stuff. But the Deluxe and OTT editions are over double and triple the price respectively of the standard edition. This problem is easily solved by just getting the standard edition lol, which I recommend trying.","August 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 61 of 73 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","61","73","0","4"

Within a short period of me posting my review the developer personally responded to my criticism, thanked me, and then a week later released a patch that addressed the vast majority of my complaints.\n\nSeriously, at this point I'm incredibly impressed. The game is quite fun and the developer clearly cares about their product.\n\nOLD REVIEW BELOW.\n\nThis game is pretty solid, even with the little bit that I have played. At this point I am really wishing I would have bought this on iOS or Android though because the PC ports has some issues with the controls that leave me feeling frustrated because I feel like I am playing on a touch screen but I am forced to use a mouse as an intermediary. So much standard PC game design convention is thrown out the window just to make this a fast port.\n\n1) Everything is accomplished via left-click, including moving your hero. Let's face it, the standard PC control for moving your hero from point A to point B is to right click.\n2) The battlefield camera is incredibly myopic and should be able to zoom out a bit farther on larger screens.\n3) The battlefield camera doesn't auto detect your mouse position and start scrolling the screen over when you mouse gets to the edge of the screen. Instead you must left-click on an empty area of the map and then drag the screen over as if you were using a touch screen tablet.\n4) The scroll wheel does nothing useful. If it isn't going to zoom in and out very much, It should probably be set up to scroll through your heros in the same way as the tab key does instead.\n5) When you have a special ability queued up your cursor doesn't give any indication that you are in that context. If you're activating a special ability and are moving the mouse we tend to expect our cursors to reflect what is about to happen when we click.\n\nAs I said before, I really like this game. On mobile I would really, really enjoy it. Unfortunately the PC controls are just nothing more than a sloppy port from a mobile game. I'll tolerate the annoying PC controls because I'm enjoying it regardless","August 8, 2014","true","34.5"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","33","37","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dr_Dissonance/recommended/312630/","Dr_Dissonance","Durrdiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dr_Dissonance/","541 products in account","Fun, thoroughly enjoyable game, but doesn't feel quite right on PC.\n\nOTTTD is mainly a tower defence/rts/rpg hybrid. You build your towers in fixed spots, level up and unlock abilities for your characters, then mess up a bunch of enemies.\n\nFirst the positive. It is a very quirky, characterful game. I've smirked on a number of occasions when the next bad guy starts walking down the paths. If undead teddy bears, giant flying shark fortresses, and 'shanktopuses' are your thing, then get this game!\nMusic and sound effects are good, as is the voice acting. Didn't turn me off or make me cringe, which as a sound designer myself, is a really good thing.\nThe whole atmosphere is great, and whoever wrote all the little jokes on the items/upgrades/achievements needs a pat on the back.\nAnd of course, gameplay is smooth, easy to get the hang of, and quite intense in the later stages.\n\nSo, it all sounds really good, right? Well it's important to know that this is technically a port of a mobile game. I was aware when I bought this, and it certainly shows, but it's not necessarily a bad thing...in places.\nFor example, it is easy enough to get coins and medals (the respective currencies) in game, and the option for microtransactions is absent (or at least, I couldn't see it). This is obviously a big thumbs up, although it makes the fancypants versions for sale kind of obsolete unless you're into the extras.\nHowever, when a character dies, you have a time limit before you can use them again. You can speed this up at the cost of a medal. To be honest, I wasn't that bothered by it initially, as earning medals is easy, but that changed once I unlocked the first endless level. If your characters die, they gain 0 experience AND you have to wait for them to revive. Getting no exp from a 15+ wave run is one thing, but then having to wait 45 minutes (without using a medal) to revive is another. Not cool.\nNOTE: After playing it a little longer, this no longer becomes an issue, as you'll have a huge surplus of medals.\n\nAnother example would be that, in order to pan across the stage, you actually have to click and drag, like using your finger on a tablet. Not a bad thing, but I'm more used to the rts-esque camera-follows-the-mouse deal.\nThere's also little in the way of settings customisation, although if you bought this game with that in mind, then I don't know what you expected.\nA lot of these small things constantly remind me that it's a mobile port. Too many control/mechanic decisions feel a little foreign to the keyboard and mouse. It's unfortunate that these small issues glares over an otherwise fantastic game, because I've thoroughly enjoyed every moment of the actual gameplay.\n\nIf you can accept that, then you should definitely check this out. Definitely worth the current price (the standard edition anyway).","August 8, 2014","true","13.4"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","2"

I much rather selecting the locations by myself tho\n\n\n\nCONs:\n- The way to pass certain levels (after the middle of the game more or less) is leveling up your characters. No strat or micro is going to work. The game want you to repeat the same level over and over until you are strong enough. This is the main CON. Without it I would had probably recommended this game. Leveling up is fun when is not the objective of the game.\n\n- you CANT really try different characters for different approaches to the levels. Leveling up is too important and is a very slow process once you reach level ~20. You cant really progress with heroes under level 20 after the middle of the game.\n- skills trees are completely arbitrary and you have to spend skill points just to find out if the random box in the top of a column is worth it.\n- shortage of skill tree points to spend. They come from leveling up.\n- no way to fast forward. The money you get from sending the next wave in when is possible is negligible\n- no really level description. You have to suffer it at least once to know what is going to happen. In the first levels you can resell and readjust your gameplay during the game sucessfully if you feel something is not working out... this is not possible any more after a while\n- Its a phone port and it shows:\n-- when you select a hero, the screen centers in the hero. You cant really micro.\n-- wheel mouse is very slow\n-- you cant rebind keys\n-- you cant click in the same spot twice for movement (ex. select 2 heroes to go to the same place). You have to click to a  slightly different point.

This is tower defense done right. I have nearly every tower defense game on steam. It's my favorite game genre. I just played through the whole campaign of OTTTD, and it was the most fun I've had playing tower defense in a long time! I've already started replaying maps just for the fun of it. There's also Endless mode.\n\nOTTTD is an excellent mix of TD, RTS group tactical play, with the leveling elements of RPG. You have all of the classic tower types, plus you have several characters, and you can bring three of them onto the battlefield and control their movements and their special attacks. Each character is unique. The whole game is unique, with a style all its own, while still feeling like a classic tower defense game with lots of extras.\n\nEverything is extremely well-balanced. The maps are challenging, yet certainly doable if you make wise choices with your characters and towers. Each character brings something different, and some of their abilities play off of each other and the towers. There is a lot of variety in the maps. Some characters are more useful on some maps than others, and some work better in certain group combinations than others.\n\nThere's a lot of high quality game here for the money, especially with Endless mode.","December 15, 2014","true","67.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

The plot basically boils down to soldiers being out of work in a utopian society, so a company hires those soldiers to fight wars in other dimensions before the wars even happen. This means that the bulk of the game's plot sees you traveling to foreign planets and killing anything that moves.\n\nAs is somewhat typical with modern tower defense games, you unlock more towers and more tower upgrades as you progress. This ranges from the typical machine gun tower, missile tower, etc to eventually things more exotic things like death rays.\n\nThere's a sort of rock paper scissors aspect that starts to take shape in-game as some enemies are vulnerable only to specific attack, as well as introducing flying enemies etc. This means that you can't simply choose one type of tower and max it out to steamroll each level.\n\nWhat makes OTTTD different than a lot of other tower defense games is its sense of humor and the soldiers which I previously mentioned as part of the plot. For each mission, you can bring along three soldiers. They function and unlock similarly to the towers except that they can walk around the map. Additionally, each soldier has their own set of skills, with skill trees that can be filled out as they level up. It's honestly difficult to decide if you're going to take a soldier into battle with strong offense or take a weaker character who can boost tower abilities. It's extremely well balanced and each soldier feels different. You can also buy different equipment for each soldier that will change their stats and appearance.\n\nWhat really helps everything in the game feel different is its sense of humor. Each character has their own personality and set of dialogue that they will say as battles go on (though it will repeat somewhat frequently) with some characters talking about how the battle is boring them, how violence is bad, etc. It helps the characters feel a little more important than just walking towers. There are several planets to wage war on with a variety of strange enemies and unique environments. It kind of feels like if Starship Troopers was made into a 1980's cartoon in a lot of ways.\n\nThere are over 20 main missions in the campaign, with several boss battles scattered throughout. As you progress, you unlock stars which can be used to unlock levels in the "endless" mode.\n\nOverall I feel like the game is worth the money and doesn't suffer any major drawbacks from its mobile origins.\n\n10/10 Would invade alternate dimensions to create a war economy again.","August 9, 2014","true","10.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","4"

More info either in the following video or below that in written format. Choose whatever fits best for you.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBX8qHx5J08&list=UUft3ypJdQ_aiUT8h8_HzjYQ\nGraphics: OTTTD uses a comic artstyle with plain colours. Considering the low polygon count and the simple texturing, OTTTD still manages to look passable. The special effects and the lighting overall is visually outdated though.\n\nSound: The music is repetitive, the sound effects are flat and boring, and especially the commentary of the soldiers is very cringeworthy. The game tries really hard to be funny, but falls short and never came close to tickling my funny bone.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay shows the mobile roots of OTTTD clearly. It's overly simplistic with it's fixed positions for towers. In general there is barely any strategy to OTTTD except mixing towers due to the three different damage types (impact, electricity and flame). There is no timing involved when to upgrade and no incentive to hold back money if it is not needed.\nThe heroes in OTTTD gain experience and thus can upgrade their skills, which are sadly mostly boring stat upgrades and seldomly add any interesting ideas. With the earned gold from missions, you can also buy new weapons, which are heavily overpriced. This again comes from the roots of being a mobile game. In-app purchases and expensive items to push players to paying even more money than "only" paying for the game. This continues with timers on dead heroes, which can be skipped with the special medal currency and does not stop in the actual handling of the game, as everything, yes, EVERYTHING is just controlled by the mouse and the left button. No right button, nothing else. You can clearly imagine that clicking something else instead of doing what you wanted to do happens all the time.\n\nIt seems to me that the developer took the original mobile game, created a quick port (which runs like ♥♥♥♥, as the game drops below 15 fps sometimes on my machine that can run Skyrim at Ultra with 60...), even had the audacity of more than doubling the price compared to mobile without even adjusting the balance.\n\nDo not buy this game, save your money and instead play some of the great free Tower Defense games available (GemCraft for example).

It's along the lines of Kingdom Rush, but utilizes 3 deployable heroes (company employees) rather than just one. Thus you have lots of combinations of employees to try, and they have skill trees that have passives and clickable skills - you only get to bring two skills to battle, but the skill tree offers about 5 different active skills per guy. Upgradable weaps and armor round out the toons as well... idk if this was a micro app mobile thing at one point, but it seems they start you out with better than worst weaps & armor, which is a bit confusing. But you still have about half the weapons to look forward to (grind for).\n\nThe towers have a lot of variety, although mostly are just straight destructive... but I still haven't unlocked everything.

Seriously just use WASD....if fact compared to other PC based Tower Defence (OT) using WASD makes it far quicker and easier, invisible after a few rounds.\n\nI really like (TD games, especially the very awesome Geodefence series on IOS. Since then I've really struggled to find a TD that isn't insanely repetitious, and easily beaten. Most TD's have a pretty basic formula, simple upgrade paths and they're not very complex. Find a solution and it basically works the whole way through the game.\n\nOTTTD is fricken awesome. I've played 14 hours and the best thing is the diverse, dense and complex heros and towers available. Some levels you just need to stretch out and try combos of hero's and special's with certain towers at certain locations. Some levels the solution is right in front of our face and yet may take you an hour or two to work it out. The levels are filled with huge amount of detail and the waves are completely full on. This game is really challenging. Its not a walk in the park like Planets vs Zombies. This will actually get your heart beating when you've got 10 giant skulls pouring down a path and you've run out of area affect specials.\n\nSome of the other reviews are a bit meh and I don't get them. Levels 12-16 are utterly awesome and I'm really enjoying the ability to replay other levels to continue building up. Allot of replayablity, especially with the endless levels. I have perverse desire in destroy Tower Defence games, combing up with combos that utterly waste the waves before they leave the level.\n\nSure the first couple of levels were a bit too easy. But the game really gets going and I’m really surprised at how much I’m getting into it. I hope the devs keep addings bits and pieces if they're able to return to it some day.","August 13, 2014","true","47.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best way for me to explain this game is that it feels like a F2P game that had in app purchases to "quick buy" skill points and the better items, except, even if you wanted to do that, that option is not there and time is the only investment.\n\nAgain, a mostly fun experience that got really frustrating.

This is a challenging game that feels powerful and respects your\ntime.  The abilities of the heroes synergize well with their armor\nand weapons, giving the player the chance to build them the way they want.\n\nThe balance is fair, and requires you to be knowledgeable; you need to work (often by\ntrial and error) to win, and I respect them for that.  Humorous enemy characters such as the turtle tank and the pillow ghosts combined with well done music and exploding gore create a warlike,\nepic atmosphere that I found enjoyable.\n\nThis game was not without its flaws, however minor; while the level design is done well,\nthe artistic pathing can be repetitive throughout the levels, and unfortunately there is\nno way to speed up gameplay, leading to a lot of waiting around for the enemies to catch up.\nNot being able to move all troupes at once via click and drag, and not being able to target\nspecific enemies takes away from the fluidity of the gameplay, and adds a frustrating\nmicromanagement element.\n\nOverall, the large amount of variety combined with the powerful atmosphere makes for an\nenjoyable game that I can gladly recommend.

I was somewhat disappointed by the fact that there weren't any other dimensions to fight in, and just the two seems odd- you'd think there'd have been three or something. I am enamoured of OTTTD's varied hero classes and their equipment, the ludicrous gibs in-game, and pervading comical air, in particular, the Schwarzeneggar-knockoff, head-sticks-out-from-the-center-of-his-chest Assault and his one liners. However, the towers themselves very quickly become useless as you progress, not being subject to the same RPG-style progression as the heroes. The game is also extremely grindy, and stands out for this even in a genre known for brutal slogs, perhaps due to its origins as a cellphone game. The difficulty ramps up steadily over the course of the many levels, but your characters' progress quickly falls behind. I was forced to replay earlier levels many, many times to get enough experience and money to complete the grueling final waves, and by that point my heroes had long since run out of canned quips. Despite this, or perhaps because of it, actually finishing the game was immensly satisfying.","July 31, 2015","true","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Games like Plants vs. Zombies have bought Tower Defence games into the mainstream. They are normally simple to play, easy to understand and can be played in short bursts. I do like tower defence games, but mostly as a mobile gaming fix. They are perfect games to play during my daily commutes. When the PC version of OTTTD (also known as Over the Top Tower Defence) turned up at our office, I was somewhat intrigued as to what made it ‘over the top’.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly standard for a tower defence game... you build a range of towers to stop the invading horde of enemies from reaching your base. Money is awarded for killing the enemies in which you can use to build further towers, upgrade existing towers or repair damaged ones. The towers unfortunately can only be built on pre-determined sites. There are four different tower types , although each tower can be upgraded to various other towers, so that during the latter levels you have access to twelve types. Each of the towers has varying ranges, firing speed and reload times.\n\nAlong with the mix come the three hero characters that can also take the field. There are actually seven heroes to choose from, although some are locked at the start of the game. Each of the heroes offers variation in play styles. The Engineer, for instance, focuses on repairing and strengthening towers, whilst the Assault class is a grunt who does his best work up close, using his powerful weapons to dispose of encroaching enemies. The Rocketeer on the other hand is better suited to attacking from a distance with his bazooka and ability to rain down rockets on unsuspecting foes. Part of the fun with OTTTD is working out which of the hero characters suits your game style and was is required for each of the levels.\n\nAfter completing each mission, points are awarded to each of the three competing heroes. Score enough points, and the character will level up, granting three skill points. These skill points can then be spent on improving the sixteen skills available to each of the heroes. Most of the abilities are locked until the pre-requisite skill has been activated. All of the characters can learn passive skills that can upgrade their health bar, enable firing from a greater range or even have a quicker reload, but each of the different classes have their own four unique abilities that can be used in-game. Of these four they can only select two to use prior to a mission.\n\nI did find however that since new characters are added gradually, I was often deciding to play with those heroes who had levelled up and gained use of more of their special abilities. As they had been much improved, I was loathed to give up on them in favour of a new, as yet untried, hero. I did have to use a couple of them at some points during the latter stages of the game, as one of my first choice squad died in battle. This locks the character out for a period of time and I was forced to select another hero.\n\nI did test out each of the characters though, and each has their particular value. Their usefulness often depended on the attacking enemy though. Foes range from speedy, but lightly armoured fish, to heavily armoured, slow moving tank turtles. There are some hilarious nods to pop-culture with some of the crazy enemies. Sharks with laser beams attached to their heads and walking severed hands (like Thing from The Addams Family) are just a couple. Other standard enemies include zombies, giant teddy bears, helicopter crabs and motorcycle riding squids and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.\n\nA number of the campaign levels contain Boss characters. In these missions, gamers don’t actually have to complete all the waves of enemies, but simply defeat the bosses. Easier said than done though, as they are usually more heavily armoured than the standard enemies, and can pack quite a punch, often disabling the towers until you repair them again. The Kraken was particularly tough, as its tentacles would appear from various water holes and damage the nearest tower quite quickly.\n\nThere are actually two game modes in OTTTD - the 25 mission campaign and the five Endless mode games. The Campaign requires gamers to defend their headquarters against certain opponents over a set number of waves of enemies. As long as the headquarters survives the onslaught, the mission is completed. Having less damage to the headquarters earns a greater score and can give a maximum of three stars for each mission. The Endless mode places you on a particular map and then continues to send wave after wave of foes until your headquarters is finally destroyed. The more waves that you survive, the greater the score.\n\nOTTTD has a cartoonish look about it, made more comical by the variation of weird and wacky enemy invaders. The settings are bright and colourful, further adding to the cartoon feel. As enemies are destroyed they explode leaving bones and gore all over the landscape. Eventually, as the level progresses and more and more waves of enemies are destroyed, the ground becomes completely covered with viscera. This definitely looks cool, but it often completely covers the paths that the invaders follow. Towers and enemies variations are easy to distinguish luckily, and the interface is clear to read. All the important details are simple to find, making for an enjoyable experience.\n\nIt is not just the visuals that have a comedic touch. The hero characters come out with some hilarious one liners that had me chuckling to myself. The voice acting is actually pretty cool, with Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonations amongst others. The hilarity continues when you read through some of the weapon descriptions and mission briefings and de-briefings.\n\nTower defence games are a dime a dozen, but I found myself playing OTTTD for hours on end as I moved through the levels. The difficulty is set about right, with the early levels simple, whilst the later levels being fiendish tough. And even when completed there is always the opportunity to play through again and gain the full three stars available for each mission. The colourful visuals compliment the voice acting perfectly, setting a humorous tone. With the seven playable characters and the variation in towers, there is plenty of replay value - well, until you finally complete each level with three stars. But up to that point OTTTD is a heap of fun and worth checking out.","September 15, 2014","true","81.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is a solid turret defense game running on complete goofiness. Its not just turret defense, its also rts and RPG. Somehow it manages to juggle all these genres and fuse them into a smooth and satisfying experience.\n\nHOWEVER. As I said, the game is incomplete. There's a bit of an uneven increase in difficulty as you progress. The solution, of course, is leveling up your heroes and buying them better equipment. How? By grinding. Over and over. I hate it, but it doesn't ruin the game.\n\nI bought as part of a bundle. Wasn't expecting much. But I'll tell you this: had I spent $10, I would've gotten my money's worth for how long it hooked me. A little disappointed in the lack of variety (there's only 2 theme worlds) and permanently locked characters on the select screen, but it is what it is.

The major departure is that they have added permanent heroes that level up between missions. I found that the game was not really that strategic and there wasn't enough difference between the various towers.\n\nThe major issues are as follows:\n1) This is a mobile port - better than 90% of the garbage ports out there, but still very evident in UI and gameplay; they did bother to add hotkeys so that's a small positive\n2) The later missions are not "tower defense" levels, you place zero or only one or two towers. They are based purely on your heroes effectively.\n3) That would not be an issue if heroes leveled up properly, but you will probably have to grind to get your heroes to an appropriate level to finish it. This falls back to the grindy mobile aspect.\n4) You want to level up faster? Ok, pay $25 for the super deluxe edition with armor that lets you get XP faster - really? Pay to win = lose in game design.\n5) The above is exacerbated if you are a trophy collector since you need to hit level 99. For context, a normal player can probably beat the game between level 30-40, so you will spend a minimum of 5-10 hours grinding (that is if you want to do pure grinding by doing 30 second level clears and not actually playing). Of course you can work around this by buying the super armor... $$$\n6) The 'gore' is out of control with random fish guts and stuff covering everything including where the enemy path is. I didn't figure this out until later - but there is a setting to reduce this.\n7) The price - it is twice the price as on the Android store. Why? The devs say that redid some textures and because "PC gamers can appreciate gaming art more."\n\nOverall, while this is a solid tower defense game, I just can't accept that they have PC gamers as an afterthought and will gouge us for the privilege of playing a port. They have only added salt to the injury by keeping the grindy mobile aspects and pay to win aspects.\n","June 4, 2015","false","36.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It really makes the battlefield look like a disguting mess by the end, but I think it should. Also I don't mean "meat" like blood and mangled bodies : they turn into things like T-bone steaks. Its kinda weird, but keeps it lighthearted.\n\n* Characters : Your squad members are awesome. Each has a quirky personality and  relevant abilities that are unique and well thought-out. I especially like the Scientist's ability to clone himself and the laser head thing.\n\n* The Levelling System : A nice addition to Tower Defense - while towers don't "level up" in a persistent way, characters do. This allows you to train your characters up, improve their stats, and add new abilities. It adds a nice strategic dimension to the characters.\n\n* The Enemies : Somewhat inventive. I have to admit the sea creature army is much more interesting than the nightmare army. But things like Giant Turtles with cannons on their backs and Great White Shark airships aren't anything I've ever seen before.\n\n* Satisfaction : There isn't much more satisfying than seeing hordes of enemies being blown into meat by your giant cartoony turrets and drones and soldiers. Its just a very satisfying game in-general.\n\n* Sound Effects and Music : Really great epic score and the sound effects all "fit" nicely. I will say that battles are a bit loud, and you might have to turn it down if you still want to hear the music.\n\n---- THE BAD ----\n\n* Grind-tastic: This game is long, and not in a good way. For example the maximum character class is 99, I'm almost at the end of the game and none of my characters have reached 50. Often times you have to play a mission several times to level up your characters until they can win, but also some missions require a specific character. Since your characters only level up if you use them, that means youcan't just concentrate on an "elite" squad of soldiers - you need to level up ALL of your characters - which is painful, especially considering how slowly they level. Inevitably this means you'll play older missions over and over again to get your characters enough XP to use them in the mission you need them for.\n\n* Semi-Perma-Death : Your characters, if they are killed in a mission, not only receive no XP, but they will not revive for 40-someodd minutes. Like... real minutes, not some ingame clock that you can speed up. I feel like this was a terrible decision on the part of the game-makers, because there's nothing that will encourage me more NOT TO PLAY a game, than preventing me from using a character that I need for a particular (unskippable) mission.  If any devs are reading this: you should be encouraging players TO play your game, not leave and come back another time. They might not ever return.\n\n* Story : I suppose its not critical for a tower-defense game to have a story, but this game makes a token effort. However, its so bad that they probably would have been better off just shrugging and saying "Monsters are coming down a path to wreck your base, what more do you need? Go stop them!" Instead they do some silly corporate sniping at how corporations apparently are all bloodthirsty warmongers with high-tech hitsquads of sadists, opening dimensions to heavily-populated worlds of peaceful sea monsters and nighmare creatures so that we can slaughter them.... because that totally makes sense, right? Well... not really. Hence why they'd have been better without it.\n\n* Monsters :  While I also have this in the plus section, its also a minus, particularly with regards to the nightmare dimension monsters. A lot of the creatures seem like they were generic assets (ghost cactus? Really?), thrown in because they had blown too much of their budget on the more-interesting sea-creature characters. Also... I am a little surprised that there are only 2 dimensions that your soldiers fight. Its a strange number to use, because as soon as you add a second one, it kinda implies that there should be a third? I am guessing here, but I expect a 3rd dimension would have appeared if the game had done really well, or in the form of DLC. So I can't count this a major fault, since the game is still fairly new and we might see more content there. They definitely imply that more is coming by the fact that I have all the heroes, but there are a few open spots in the hero-selection menu. Hmmmm\n\n---- CONCLUSION ----\n\nFun, addictive, over-the-top tower-defense (hence the name: OTTTD) with some minor problems, one of which will probably be resolved in future DLCs. I do think this game needs a DLC to feel "complete". At the very least they should fill in the blank character slots in the menu, but also it needs a 3rd monster race. 8/10\n\n","January 27, 2015","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not even close to the solid titles like Defense Grid I or the old WC3 maps but it is funny and compact. Of course no one can release a TD these days without adding something new. In this case we have "heroes". Luckily (for me) you can just stick 'em at a chokepoint and let them act as a tower. Until level 20 (there are only 25 levels btw) the game does not force these heroes into a critical role which is nice (it is a TD afterall).\n♥♥♥♥ is bound to hit the fan of course, which happens around lvl 21 I think (though it might be earlier for the 3 stars). You'll need heroes equipped with the right equipment at fairly high levels. And this ladies and gentleman requires a genuine grind, especially when you like the wrong heroes.  The equipment is fairly easy as there are only a few tiers, but grinding the heroes will take you as long as the the actual game from level 1-20ish. I did try, so the game must be on par with waffles for a short time. And that it is. Worth picking up the main game for a discount (it's to short a limited for 10eu for my taste and the deluxe is just silly).\nIt does have potential though. Maybe in the future we'll get a DLC with more levels, heroes, tiers ... well everything really.\n\nElmo the grumpy lootmaster signing off","January 4, 2015","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/recommended/312630/","etherasfox","Etheras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/","325 products in account","Quite possibly the most fun I've ever had in a tower-defense game.\n\n---- THE GOOD ----\n\n* Graphics : Fun and cartoony, making it so you don't feel so bad about massacring waves upon waves of weird enemies and turning them into meat.\n\n* Meat : Enemies explode into meat, which is persistant. It really makes the battlefield look like a disguting mess by the end, but I think it should. Also I don't mean "meat" like blood and mangled bodies : they turn into things like T-bone steaks. Its kinda weird, but keeps it lighthearted.\n\n* Characters : Your squad members are awesome. Each has a quirky personality and  relevant abilities that are unique and well thought-out. I especially like the Scientist's ability to clone himself and the laser head thing.\n\n* The Levelling System : A nice addition to Tower Defense - while towers don't "level up" in a persistent way, characters do. This allows you to train your characters up, improve their stats, and add new abilities. It adds a nice strategic dimension to the characters.\n\n* The Enemies : Somewhat inventive. I have to admit the sea creature army is much more interesting than the nightmare army. But things like Giant Turtles with cannons on their backs and Great White Shark airships aren't anything I've ever seen before.\n\n* Satisfaction : There isn't much more satisfying than seeing hordes of enemies being blown into meat by your giant cartoony turrets and drones and soldiers. Its just a very satisfying game in-general.\n\n* Sound Effects and Music : Really great epic score and the sound effects all "fit" nicely. I will say that battles are a bit loud, and you might have to turn it down if you still want to hear the music.\n\n---- THE BAD ----\n\n* Grind-tastic: This game is long, and not in a good way. For example the maximum character class is 99, I'm almost at the end of the game and none of my characters have reached 50. Often times you have to play a mission several times to level up your characters until they can win, but also some missions require a specific character. Since your characters only level up if you use them, that means youcan't just concentrate on an "elite" squad of soldiers - you need to level up ALL of your characters - which is painful, especially considering how slowly they level. Inevitably this means you'll play older missions over and over again to get your characters enough XP to use them in the mission you need them for.\n\n* Semi-Perma-Death : Your characters, if they are killed in a mission, not only receive no XP, but they will not revive for 40-someodd minutes. Like... real minutes, not some ingame clock that you can speed up. I feel like this was a terrible decision on the part of the game-makers, because there's nothing that will encourage me more NOT TO PLAY a game, than preventing me from using a character that I need for a particular (unskippable) mission.  If any devs are reading this: you should be encouraging players TO play your game, not leave and come back another time. They might not ever return.\n\n* Story : I suppose its not critical for a tower-defense game to have a story, but this game makes a token effort. However, its so bad that they probably would have been better off just shrugging and saying "Monsters are coming down a path to wreck your base, what more do you need? Go stop them!"

A blend of towers and hero units gives that extra bit of interaction over others of this genre.  The game unfortunately suffers from a few balance issues and has poor conveyance with some skill descriptions. The lack of micro management also creates an artificial difficulty. If you notice, as an example, that physical resistant units are reaching your base constantly and build a tower of fire or shock you may still end up having those enemies reach your base. The new tower could target any foe in range. The player has no control over tower targets and towers will continue to shoot until that target is dead or moves out of range. There is a similar issue with the heros but being able to move them means you have some control on who they shoot. Although the game has issues it is still a decent tower defense game.\n\nI wish there was an in between answer.

If you're a fan of Tower defense games, then this is one you should defintely take the time to check out. It's a lot of the fun and the difficulty curve is pretty forgiving. With a handful of heroes and turrents to choose from and good amount of enemies with both different damage types and resistence types, there is a fair amount of strategy to this game. If you want to be successful at it, here is a top tip; read the encyclopedia after encountering new enemies.","June 29, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It features a few gameplay tweaks and lovable artstyle that make it different from traditional TD titles seen before.\n\nThe Pros\nOTTTD is strange.  Like, it felt like something someone far younger than I would have enjoyed, and yet I still played tons of it.  The characters are wonkey and different, playing is far more engaging than you'd think, and... just... somehow you end up sinking hours into it.\n\nThe Cons\nOTTTD is also a bit bipolar.  I can't quite figure out what it's trying to do from a gameplay perspective.  There's essentially one control source (mouse, arrow keys are optional and I didn't find them useful), which makes the gameplay really simple, right?  But the maps are huge, and without an indicator on turret status, it's hard to predict where mercenaries should be going.  Another note is that the early game is far too easy, while the late game's difficulty is based on who you've been leveling up.  I got to one of the later stages, and I've still been there after 4 hours, because I levelled up the wrong mercenaries.  I understand how the mercs are supposed to be varied, but I almost feel like there's a set of mercs that are must haves for certain situations.\n\nMy Verdict\nI haven't a ruddy clue.  I expected nothing great after playing Fieldrunners, and found it more enjoyable with a similar asthetic.  Then just, the time dissapeared until I hit a wall and prematurely ended my run with it.  I don't think it felt rewarding, the levels aren't particularly memorable, and the new game mechanics feel implemented, but not refined.  The game in and of itself isn't bad, I just don't think it was very special.  It's a "meh" out of 10, where I don't think my time was wasted but it wasn't used as well as I value it.\n\nI'm sure someone younger would have enjoyed it more.\n\n6.5/10","November 4, 2015","false","18.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's rare.\n- Mechanics work perfectly.\n- Excellent variety of units make you really want to level them all up and alternate.\n- Totally makes fun of the horror genre, a la Evil Dead 2.\n- Really challenging in parts - you need just the right ingredients, but it's not impossible.\n- Set ups (towers, options, variety) are fairly standard but still really interesting to tinker with.\n\nCon:\n- I often can't find my pointer (using a mouse).\n- The music gets old.\n- At some point you'll need to grind, and the levels can take a bit long for a repeat.\n\nOverall: 9/10","November 2, 2015","true","89.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The towers have set locations they can be built but the twist is you have hero unites you move around the game area with different abilities. Some can boost or repair towers others are almost mobile towers. The heroes can be leveled up between rounds to gain new abilites or increase existing ones. Fun graphics, music and story all work together to make it fun so far. I am pleased with this purchase.","February 9","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
