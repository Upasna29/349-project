I only have one complaint and that is that about ever tractor is the same model and even the big john deere 4255 6 cylinder had a 2 cylinder in he game. That does not make this a bad game though. This game is very addicting and has many parts to remove. I give this game a 7 or 8 out of 10.","May 6, 2015","true","5.6"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","16","24","4","0"

Ended up being Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 with tractors. The difference is that there is no "free play" in the sense that you are forced one job after an other and that's it while in Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 you can actually stack up jobs, choose the ones you want and ignore the ones you don't want.\n\nThis makes all the difference for me. Played it 30mins and uninstalled it.\n\nThat should be listed as a DLC for Car Mechanic Simulator 2014 and not have 2015 in its name which indicates it's the same basic principle as Car Mechanic Simulator 2015 and it most certainly is not.","May 18, 2015","false","0.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","0"

It plays just like it and not like CMS 2015. The graphics are detailed and look great. I continue to be impressed with PlayWays art department and their attention to detail. The gameplay is pretty much standard fare for the mechanic sim genre. I would've liked to have seen more parts to unbolt or disassemble. Some of the parts just click off and require no wrenching. I get the fine line between fun and tedium, but it is labeled as a “simulator” after all. If you're a fan of CMS 2014 and haven't played CMS 2015 yet, you should feel right at home with this one.\n\n"Farm" Mechanic\n+ Good textures, lighting and models\n+ Interesting niche idea, and a kudos to the dev's for branching the genre out\n+ Detailed parts and equipment\n\n"Harm" Mechanic\n- Some sounds and music can get a little annoying\n- Would've been better if built on the CMS 2015 engine\n- Doesn't come with a straw hat, overalls & cowboy boots!","May 1, 2015","true","1.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","7","9","3","4"

Note, this is my first-ever "3D mechanic" type game.\n\nIt's effectively an appealing 3D puzzle, heavy on the theme "farm equipment."  No issues to report, the game is (as of Oct 2015) bug free and looks great.\n\nWould appreciate even more depth though, such as:\n\n- More equipment to repair.  There are 4 tractor types and one combine, but the tractors all share the same parts on the inside.\n- More part types per machine (for instance, add electrical and hydraulic systems, which are ignored)\n- More of a challenge to wring every last dollar out of each repair.  You have the choice to replace a part with a new or good-condition new one from a catalog, or repair it.  Repairing it yourself is always, hands down, the best option.  There should be some cases where this isn't so.  I mean, is it truly possible to bring a damaged part to 100% economically?  Not in real life.\n- More textures.  Why should a new part come with dents and scratches just like a used part?  In reality the difference is often obvious.\n\nGreat fun, and not that expensive as it is today.  I also look forward to a future version of this game with more depth.\n","October 10, 2015","true","14.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Minimal help, poor economic model, tedious 'Where's Waldo' searching for defective parts on very small unprofitable jobs. Very little difference except color in tractors and combines. f you like boring, repetitive, frustrating games, this is for you. There is no reward for good work. You earn money by selling the used parts you take off the boring tractors and combines you repair.\n\nWith the fun of Car Mechanic 2014 and improvements in Car Mechanic 2015, I expected better from the publisher. This game is not a worthy successor to either game. If it was $5 US it may be worth it. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere. At job 75 it kicks you out and you're done. No replay value. Sandbox garages just more of the same.  It's your money, spend it wisely.","May 3, 2015","false","14.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","0"
