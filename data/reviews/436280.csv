I recommend this game for people who like puzzles.\nThis game makes you use your math skills and as you play you will notice it is teaching you to use basic Algebra.\nThe game becomes more difficult gradually until you come to a point where you notice you are actually challenged to solve the puzzle.\nI like this game, it’s nice, simple and rules are clear.\nSounds are fine, but I am prefer listening my music or something from YouTube.\nDo not expect this game for story, just enjoy Sudoku puzzle.\nFor the price, this is definitely worth getting.","June 4","true","3.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's nice that there are clues, but it would be necessary to sign them, not immediately clear what he was doing.

There are several modes in which increases as you progress through the complexity . For experienced players who like to boast of their achievements entered user mode . All Sudoku randomly generated , so you are unlikely to meet the same . Beginners also useful bonuses to players , they really reduce the amount of the award. Pretty colorfully made ​​achievements.

A lot of random generated levels with different types and difficulties. I haven't met any bugs or other stuff.\nIn campaign mode you dont need to feel all the space - only key boxes. And also you have limited health.\nBut I didn't noticed the soundtrack, only separate game sounds.\nPrice isn't low, but the game hasn't any competitors in store. So if you like sudoku - its only good way to play it on Steam.","June 5","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Puzzles here are abit on easy side (got to level 8 sofar, they probably get harder.) Lost most of my lives to controls, which is were the main annoyances lie. They don't explain much in controls, right click can move you about to see on the multi-board, gotta be careful on note taking vs entering to not accidently put in wrong number, and sofar I hit two boards that have multple answers but game takes a life if you don't enter the one it wants. And sofar havn't seen a way to recover life so that looks to be a major annoyance since losing all lives puts you back at level 1.\nGetting use to controls, if it wern't for the multiple anwser but you lose a life if you guess wrong I'd probably drift into the recomend area but with annoyances for lovers of sudoku .","June 4","false","6.1"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","2"
