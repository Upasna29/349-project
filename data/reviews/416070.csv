(Wish you could select your crew or have more crew members).\nLanding on the Moon sequence can result in Death for no reason.\n\nNow while it seems there are more cons than pros I do give this game a good chance as it is an interesting idea and if there is a bit more added to it then the game could be amazing. I know from talking to the developer that Sim mode (which is the current game) is still in progress and the Action mode is still being worked on. I'm hanging in there to see what the developer can do. Mars 2030 is defineitely something to keep an eye on","April 11","true","8.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","0"

IN SPAAAAAAAAACE!\n\nEDIT: I'm adding to my review to make it slightly more helpful to people who might be interested in purchasing the game, haha.\n\n\nReview:\nThe game itself certainly FEELS like an Oregon (or Organ) Trail in space. It plays out much the same way, too.\n\nYou begin the game by purchasing your starting supplies and very quickly are then on the trail toward Mars!\n\nMuch of the game currently consists of flying your ship, which is hurtling through space, dodging meteors and meteorites, solar flares, and other space-centric dangers (much like Oregon Trail's River scene). Every so often, you will be confronted with a situation... One of your people will have some issue or other, or some idea or other and you will be able to select what you want to do about it. The Oregon Trail theme continues. :D\n\nRecommendation:\nIf you loved Oregon Trail (or Organ Trail), then you'll probably love this. The art style is reminiscent of older games and fits right in with the mechanics. And really, it's only $8, so if you end up not liking it, you won't be out much. Give it a go!\n\n\nUrist McLlurendt","January 25","true","8.5"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","24","28","8","0"

There are periods that are uneventful, but still, I find myself watching my progress like a hawk...you never know when you will approach an asteroid field, and let's hope you allotted youself enough ammo!\n\nI keep thinking about the game in between play sessions, and I find that I keep coming back to try again and again. I haven't made it to Mars yet, but so far, I find the game compelling and interesting. I would like to have more options during the quiet periods, especially when I pause the game, but I realize Mars 2030 just launched on early access and more features are coming (including what looks like a toggle for "action" and "simulation."\n\nI also really like that the dev has been quick to make updates and bug fixes.","January 21","true","8.8"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","23","27","2","0"

There are a lot of things that can happen during the flight. I think it is realistic that some of the Problems can be the end of the game and are unrepairable. For example an Oxygen leak could be the end of the flight.\nSo i hope that the developer will move on and make it more complex. But time will tell us.\nI have also make a video about the game.

The graphical interface is cool and the spaceship feels like it actually works. Parts of the game still feel "Early Access" to me, and sometimes ship damage cannot be fixed, which is harsh.\n\nOverall, Mars 2030 is amusing to play with interesting repair mechanics.","April 22","true","5.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I ended up failing at day 230 (75% of travel done !), because my crew couldn't manage to repair an oxygen leak two times, and i didn't have the option to try to repair it again.\nSo yeah, i spend one hour looking at my beautiful vessel traveling through space with a massive oxygen leak, leaving an interesting trail behind him.\n\nAbout the game : there is juste nothing to do. After clicking the play button, you get an auto generated crew each with a specific job. But this has no interest : you can't do anything with them, you don't have to manage them or anything else. Sometimes they discover task to do (like, for example, repairing the f****** oxygen leak), which unlock a menu to tell them to do the task. It's one of the very few interaction you will have with them.\n\nIn the next step, you must choose what you embark. Not a bad idea, but it didn't had a real impact in the only one game i played. I just took 10 of everything and didn't had any shortage.\n\nNow, you click on continue, you have a nice cutscene showing your rocket launch, and then nothing. You just observe your ship traveling, waiting for some event to occur. During my 60 minutes of gameplay, i encountered the same 6 event again and again, with most of them having no impact on the game. You can view the second video of gameplay, it is exactly what i have done for one hour.\n\nBy the way, you better have viewed the "Help" menu before clicking the Play button, or your next step will be hammering your keyboard to find what your possibilities are. I will resume it : go up, go down, K to fire, 1/F1 to launch the minigame (??).\nI'm still questionning myself about the presence of the minigame. I suspect the dev had realized the game was quite boring, so he ended up adding a minigame to fill the waiting time between two events.\nI didn't played that minigame a lot, i was more concerned about finding a button somewhere to tell my crew to repair the oxygen leak.\n\n\nI'm a little sad because i can feel that many effort had been put in making this game. The graphics are not bad if you like the retro pixel style, the music/sound a little repetitive but still put you in the atmosphere.\nIn my opinion, this game is "just" badly designed. It lack of good idea of gameplay.","March 12","false","1.0"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","26","43","3","0"

Made it all the way to Mars after countless, repititious and unexciting mini-games. The game switched to what I'm guessing is supposed to be a cockpit view. I then watched for 10 minutes as we slowly approached Mars. Mars then disappeared and we were just looking at stars. No available input, no indication of what was happening. Went and had dinner, came back, still looking at stars with no input available.\n\nFun idea, horrendous implementation. A great example of the need for Steam's refund policy.","May 28","false","2.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"
