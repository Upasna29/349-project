One time, I got shot by an arrow. I ducked under cover, then pulled the arrow out. Then I stabbed my assailant to death with it.\n\nOne time, I was attacked by two dogs immediately after starting a game. I was naked (save for a thin hospital gown) and I had no weapons. As they charged me, I grabbed some shards of glass on the ground, and following a lengthy battle that I ultimately won, I used said shards to skin the dogs' carcasses and then made gloves out of them. Then I died of blood loss.\n\nOne time, I was attacked in the middle of a stormy night by two mutants trying to steal my shopping cart loaded with supplies. After I brained one of them, the other scattered. I gave chase, and dispatched it following a cross-tile pursuit. However, upon return to my camp, my cart was gone. The mutant corpse, mysteriously absent as well. Using my tracking ability, I followed the thief several tiles down, and discovered it was another mutant, slowly pushing my cart southwest, his deceased comrade most unceremoniously stuffed inside with the rest of the contents. I moved in and caved its skull in with one fell swoop. I felt no pity, no remorse. I really needed those 5 empty bottles.\n\n10/10 excellent post apocalyptic hobo simulator\n\nIt's worth noting that there are a lot of mods available that greatly expand the game's potential.","December 28, 2014","true","58.9"," 665 of 710 people (94%) found this review helpful 579 people found this review funny","94","665","710","579","0"

One of the best game I have recently played.\nKeep reading, or download the Demo and try it for yourself. Yes, there is a DEMO available.\n\nGameplayYou see stuff from above like, isometric map perspective: you navigate the lands from one hexagonal tile to another. All the time.\nThis costs points. When it's rainy or dark, it will cost more points.\nWhen you reach a city hex, you can loot the location. This, also, will costs you points. Sometimes you will find amazing stuff, and sometimes only scraps of paper. But even those could be useful. Actually, when you start to know the game better, every gôddåmn item is useful!\nYou will find more stuff if you use a crowbar, or have a light source with you. But beware as this will make more noise and attract people towards your location.\nLooting can also just hurt yourself... like roof collapse. Shït happens right?\nSo you loot, equip yourself with what you find, and stroll around. Until some dude approaches and gets to your hex.\n\nCombatThe combat is textual. You won't have the map view anymore. But instead, you'll be presented with an interface showing your dude's and opposition's status, and a list of actions you can execute. Everything you will do, like throwing a punch, will have a narrative text describing what's happening. So it's mostly READING ya hear? No explosions there.\nBut don't be fooled... you can trip on the ground and fall. While on the ground you can try and grab the hostile down, you can crawl back and try to escape, drop your stuff and run like hell, etc. A lot of realistic possibilities here. It is extremely hard. Your first encounter will probably be your last.\n\nDiseaseGetting hurt, bleeding, being cold, drinking shït water... these will have consequences. Try to disinfect your wounds, patch'em up and don't let 'em getting infected. Be careful of what you eat too... could be POISONOUS you never know muhahah.\nUnless you are a doctor, in which case you will have a clear descriptions of your symptoms like, "Cholera 3; final stage; certain death", you won't know what illness you just caught... you will have "stomach cramps", you'll be like "vomiting"...\nSo just act as in real life: grabs antibiotics, clean every wounds. Don't take any chances. Ever. Why? Because the game has...\n\nPermadeathYep. Die and restart the whole game. No save point, and that is intended. You won't bring stuff with you from your last play. Nope, nothing. It's up to YOU to level up. And this is where I disagree on the game mechanics. I am fine with dying and learning. But ya know the beginning of the game starts to be boring once you know it. And redoing the same stuff is just a waste of time. Hence I created a little tool[tacticalfreak.blogspot.com] to actually still save and, well, cheat. I advise players to die a lot first, and when you feel you are ready, just use my tool.\nBut even if you use it to reload an old save, it won't matter much, because...\n\nIt's randomThe map is randomly generated. But not when you first start the game, nope. It is randomly generated as soon as you discover a tile. So saving the game and loading an old save will still yield something different :D\nThis is why I am a little "against" the permadeath. Loading an old save is not THAT bad. You will experience a whole different game. I would've liked just... ya know, an auto-save every night or something.\nAnyway except for a few spots in the map that will never change, all the rest is random. Random but fair. You won't like be in a desert without cities for miles ever. They are spawned correctly.\nEven if you are a new player, you CAN make it. Yes because in the end, it's just logic.\nContrary to Faster Than Light (FTL) where there is NO WAY a new player will make it to the end because the randomization is too... random. In NEO Scavenger, the RNG is just right.\n\nCrafting stuffAs I said all the items there are useful. Somehow. Because you can craft and even "uncraft" stuff. If someone is giving you stuff, or if you finally found something of value... maybe you can try to "reverse engineer" it and discover HOW IT WAS BUILT. How awesome is that uh? Found a bow arrow? But you have no idea how to create one yourself? No problem!\nThere are also a lot of crafting recipes there. And many different combinations will work. Like you could use your crowbar to roast meat when you don't have a wood stick! Doesn't matter, both categorizes as a kinda "shaft." So it's extremely smart and flexible. If you are lacking you favorite saucepan to boil water... just think a second... can't anything else, more common, be used as a saucepan? Eh, when I found that out, I literally doubled my lifespan. No shït. Think hard.\n\nNarrationIt reminds me of Fallout 1 & 2. You had that little description box in the lower left which would describe what was going on. Here it's a bit the same. With random encounters or special places being very well described. There is a lot of dark humor too. If you are not averse to reading you will like it and also find that it's well written.\n\nStoryThere is a story. Your first goal will obviously be to survive, and so, to find something to cover your feet :) But after that painful initial phase, you will meet strange people. You will find places of interest. Or you will find new recipes that... use high tech items you had no idea were in the game.\nThe story is interesting and is closely related to the narrative part of the game: the only way to tell you stuff is through old newspapers and stuff. Those are funny as well...\nOX news reporting hoaxes ;)\n\nAudioEvery single one item has its own sound effect. Which is played when you grab the item from you inventory. That's it. But that's HUGE. There is a little music, but it gets a bit repetitive.\n\nConclusionIf you like Fallout, post-apocalyptic worlds, a good narration, turn by turn mechanics and a pretty realistic game then don't hesitate. It's a masterpiece.\nYou still unsure? --> try the demo and make your own opinion.","December 16, 2014","true","93.0"," 348 of 356 people (98%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","98","348","356","14","6"

I'm one of those undesirable ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that uploads the "11/10 uninstall function works great" review, but NEO Scavenger will be my exception. You have no idea how hard it will be for me to not write "I murdered a naked guy while wearing a clown mask", but I will get through it, for this amazing game.\n\nLet's start with the basics; you're some random guy (avoiding spoilers) that has just woken from cryogenic sleep during the apocalypse somewhere around the city of Detroit. After a friendly interaction with a lovely creature known as a "Dogman", you step outside to  experience the outside world of Michigan... and dang, it's cold. Like, "Oh my God I can't feel my feet and I'm feeling really sleepy" cold. After a few deaths and several hours of learning the basics (don't eat random berries or mushrooms you find unless  you know they aren't poisonous, that guy with the broken bottle really wants to eat your leg, and yes, it's cold, put some pants on) you really get into this game.\n\nAs others have said, however, an ungodly amount of time can be spent on this game, and it can never be taken back. In a sense, it's like DayZ. You spend 3 hours finding a weapon, finding your friends wherever they are on the map, and end up faffing around until some gruesome death by either a glitching zombie or a player that only speaks Russian. This, I believe, is another selling point of NEO Scavenger. In the beginning, you get used to dying. After a while, however, you end up living longer and longer, until one life lasts you hours of real life time. Everything is peachy until that one night you decide to sleep in a forest and forget to set up a noise trap or hide, and you're stabbed to death by some plague-ridden nutcase in your sleep. After a day or two of angry avoidance of the game, you decide to give it a second chance, innocently, you pour more hours into it, only to die in a similar manner. It's a beautiful circle of life (death)!\n\nWith such extensive content already and more updates to come, NEO Scavenger is one of my favorite games of all time. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hardcore survival games, and/or murdering innocents with his/her bare hands whilst wearing nothing but a Ronald McDonald lookalike mask and a hospital gown.

I confidently strode through the Michigan wastes knowing that I could never die. I came across some water in an urban location. I was a bit parched and decided to sate my thirst on the water. I didn't need to boil it, I was immortal! I drank the water, and a few hours later my charcter began to develop severe diarrhea as my skin turned a horrific shade of blue.

And with "permadeath" that means you will be met with a black screen unceremoniously alerting you to your demise, manner of death and hours you managed to keep this poor guy alive.  Now, don't assume that this is put forth as a criticism because that is the appeal to this survival game.  After succumbing to the countless manners of death you begin to appreciate the fragility of humanity in this post-apocalyptic world.  Every decision begins to weigh on the player as you try to balance all the needs of survival.  I suppose there IS a way to "win" the game, though I've never seen it.  For me the appeal is simply the test to see how long you can stay alive while dodging the raiders, bandits, the elements, wild beasts, disease, dehydration, famine - I'm sure you get the point.  Go ahead and eat that rancid hunk of meat you found because the immediate fear of famine out-weighs the ramifications of food poisoning you will have to deal with tomorrow.\n\nThis is an early access game so there will be problems.  The only bug I encountered was a turn bug that caused the time to keep clicking by until he just died.  Only happened to me once, but it was frustrating just the same.  The developer is aware of the issue and promises a fix.  There may also need to be a few play-balance adjustments because as I said it is really difficult to get deep into the game.  There are lots of interesting traits to choose when beginning the game, but honestly "toughness," "melee," and "strength" are the main ones you have to have or you will not survive the first night to even begin to utilize the other abilities.  Combat is unique and interesting once you figure out the order the text reads out, and how the interface deals with multiple enemies.\n\nThis is a flash game with tons of depth.","December 7, 2013","true","28.4"," 158 of 168 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","158","168","0","0"

Inside these an assortment of the finest junk ever seen by man: Empty bottles, cigarette lighter, a t-shirt, twigs, a sauce pan and even more crumpled plastic bags, in case the current ones rip apart. Let me tell you, plastic bags are the superior container for almost anything you might want to carry at some point in the post-apocalypse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2K3mihtzrA\n\nOh and don’t drink unboiled water – I did and it was a mistake. A few days later while trying to sneak up to a sleeping stranger at night (To rob him, obviously; I needed a pair of new shoes), I got diarrhea. Uncontrollable stomach cramps made me fall down and curl up into a ball. The moaning woke up the stranger who’s been in a very bad mood. I started to bleed from my nose – probably from a virus like cholera I’ve ingested by drinking the water from a pond days earlier. I was indeed particularly thirsty the last few days.\nThe stranger sprinted towards me and a few moments later, without asking questions, he clubbed me to death with the butt of his rifle – not because of my pain, but to conserve ammo. I think it was for the best, I would have died from internal bleeding anyway. My life was over before I even knew it.\n\nThe interesting part here is that all of this did not feel “unfair”; I made a mistake hours before (drinking contaminated water) and could have prevented it (by boiling the water). Even after the fact, the symptoms of dehydration gave an indication that something was wrong: I could have ingested medicine immediately, but I didn’t.\n\nIt’s great that games like this are made.","June 16, 2015","true","41.6"," 134 of 145 people (92%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","92","134","145","35","2"

I was hesitant due to the low res, pixel graphics, but man am I glad I took a chance on this!\n\nWhat stands out immediately is choice and consequence. You can't have it all. You have to build a character with weaknesses, and weaknesses can just be not having some of the skills you might like to have, or it can be actual weaknesses to give you points to get more benefits.\n\nYou might take Fragile for example, making you take more damage than normal if you get hit, and you might do this because you really want the points it gives you to take Trapping so you can make fire right away at the start of the game.\n\nYou might take Strong so you can carry more and Melee so you can close combat better, but this might mean you don't get Ranged skil and therefore cannot make arrows, and have limited range skill with guns and other range weapons.\n\nAnyway, you make your choices and take your shot. Into the game you go and immediately your character choices effect your first encounter, in terms of whether you survive, escape, get hurt or kick the ♥♥♥ of the first opponent.\n\nYou survived the fight (maybe) and now you gotta get fire, you gotta get a weapon, you need clothing, you need shelter, you need a supply of food and water, and you need to get these things without attracting too much attention from the local wildlife. How you do this is up to you and there is little to no help from the game. You gotta figure it out, and fast, cause you are getting cold and soon you'll be needing somewhere to sleep.\n\nRnG can help you or hurt you here, and at first I was like, well you need some good rolls to start, but later you learn it's more about playing smart, and persistently scavenging until you get what you want.\n\nYou have to be concerned about the noise you make, the tracks you leave, and even your scent, as you get through those nail biting first turns until you finally get to the point where you are not struggling and can start to carve your way through the world.\n\nNow you start to get pleasantly surprised because you find there is depth in the game. Depth in the combat system, depth in the crafting system, and it's challenging because you are gonna die if you are not careful. You might kill that wolf, but you took a scratch that is gonna get infected because you didn't find or craft any clean bandages, and haven't managed to find something to act as a dis-infectant. Left untreated this may progress to septis, and ultimately death.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are not careful in combat, being tactical, the wolf just may kill you outright.\n\nItems decay, so in the long game you need to be able to get a backup supply... and then you start to find that there is actually a story here... WHAT YOU SAY?!?!?!?!\n\nI thought I was just enjoying a really great survival game, and BAM... all of a sudden I ran into some story elements and again realize this modest little game is actually filled with depth and fun, and a reason to keep playing, try to live longer, try to figure out just why and how you came to be here, and what you can do to go beyond surviving.\n\nThere is a reputation system, and good versus evil behaviour. You can save the damsel in distress or throw in your lot with the bandits. It can be dark, really dark. You don't just kill stuff... you murder it... you rip people apart in scenarios where it's either you or them... fight or die... and sometimes you win just to find out later, you lost.\n\nIf you give Neo Scavanger half a chance, you'll find a real gem here. A game which has been clearly and cleverly thought out to provide many hours of entertainment. I'm about 168 hours in as I write this, and still haven't seen 60% of the map.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/248860/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","NEO Scavenger is a turn-based, post-apocalyptic, survival roguelike with perma-death. I also now sometimes fondly call it a Procedural Death Michigan. It's mean, immersive, annoyingly addictive and seems to strongly dislike players wearing right boots (left boots are fine).\n\nBasically, you scavenge around (and die after the building crumbles on you), fight other people scavenging around (and die valiantly with monkey wrench in hand) or try to talk to them (and die a turn later by drinking a celebratory made-it-through-the-turn sip of poisoned water), try to kill creatures that would like to eat you almost as much as you'd like to eat them (and die hungry), craft items to help you survive (and die warm because your fire alerted every deadly thing around), keep track of your hunger, thirst, diseases and injuries (and die very informed) or try to get to the seemingly last big hub of civilization (and die trying to get there; or trying to get in; or after you get in; or on your way back out).\n\nIn short this is a game where you try to make it through the day while figuring out what has happened to your hero and the world - and die trying. I really don't want to spoil this too much for you, but rest assured, whether you prefer dying by traumatic brain injury, blood loss, cholera, dehydration or an angry mob, there are enough options there to suit everyone's tastes. And if that doesn't sound fun to you, go away, I don't like you.\n\n\n\n\n-----\nWant more details?\n\nNEO Scavenger is the chess of survival games. It's all about making tactically sound moves, about the constant weighing of risk-reward decisions. The gameplay mechanics, while seemingly unforgiving, are actually there to remind you that you are not a badass superhero, just an average person thrown into a huge mess. Going in situations guns a-blazing will rarely be rewarded, running away and hiding your tracks from a bunch of stray dogs may. You are never allowed to feel safe. You are never allowed to hunker down, build a huge base, put fences around it and kill everything that dares come through. Throughout the game, the mechanics drive you to keep moving on, keep surviving day to day, keep doing mundane inventory management, and keep trying not to die. And failing.\n\nBut dying here isn't always a bad thing. Since you can't really improve your skills, (though you may be able to add to them, by playing your cards right) you need to die to improve, to learn, to realize how to make better choices next time. You even need to die to learn more of the world, simply because you can never uncover everything in one playthrough. Which brings us to the story:\n\nBehind the immersive atmosphere and the fun, unforgiving gameplay mechanics, hides an interesting, complex, well-written story and huge amounts of lore and flavour text delivered both in long screens and in tiny bites literally everywhere you look. The story will never beat you over the head with what you should do next (and it's fair to say you should remain doubtful when it seems to do that), so it is perfectly ignorable if you just enjoy the sandbox game. But it's worth getting into, and it's also worth remembering that every time you think you know all the possible answers to a question, there's likely more there to discover, if only you do things slightly differently next time (by having a different build, carrying different items, making different choices, going down a different path, uncovering different information). The mystery of the story is a sprawling, complicated puzzle, one you will not solve easily, even by finishing the game the first few times.\n\nAs you may have gathered I think this is a great game: the perfect flawed little gem, and in my head already a cult classic.","February 4, 2014","true","339.8"," 95 of 100 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","95","100","0","3"

It's not like I really had to - I was taking a nap in a small city when a stranger woke me up. I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I took his soul away with a crowbar and noticed that I'm a bit hungry. Checked it - yes, not surprising - I can use a shard on the corpse and scavenge myself some tasty human meat. Two hexes later in the woods, I've made myself a nice BBQ and I'm feasting on that human.\n\nAs I chew on what was just two hexes ago my rival in an unfair fight, I am suddenly overcome with  disgust. I could have just left the corpse there, and move on to hunt a squirrel or pick some non-poisonous berries. Yet I chose to eat that person. And before doing that I looted him of his hoodie which was in a better condition.\n\nBut karma got to me quick. I was quickly poisoned in some mysterious way and then something wielding a 12-Gauge Shotgun blew me to bits, all my progress and looting down the drain.\n\nNEO Scavenger can be really daunting at first; you'll die a lot. But once you pick it up - it's hard to put it down. It's a wonderful selfishness simulator that is fun and engaging, built on a fantastic crafting system which brings out the curious child in you. The "old" graphics do not deter from the enjoyment, quite the opposite – they only make it eerier and more atmospheric. The soundtrack is great too and generally it feels like a lot of thought was given to the game.\n\nI haven't delved into the lore of the game yet but there are newspapers lying around with bits of info and it seems that there's a bigger story which unfolds as you manage to survive and stay alive. Unfortunately that's not as easy as it sounds, not at all; you can also go great strides (even without turning into a cannibal) and then get blown away by a shotgun or catch a disease. This could hinder the experience for some players who focus on storylines and want to complete the game – take to heart that this will be VERY HARD. This game is hardcore as it gets and it doesn't hold your hand at all.\n\nThe best advice is to watch let's plays etc and if you do pick up the game, try it for yourself before picking up a guide. You WILL pick up a guide ultimately but try to experience it without any aid at all. It'll produce unique experiences in which you'll end up dead (in your hospital gown usually).\n\nOverall this is worth much more than its price tag, a very refreshing entry to the world of roguelike which does it very very right - a sort of improved UnReal World with frightening creatures and a darker theme.","January 3, 2015","true","12.4"," 106 of 117 people (91%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","91","106","117","28","0"

This may be the ongoing question asked of the player by it's developers yet, I guaruntee you will be asking youself this each time you load Neo Scavenger regardless of your experience with it's unforgiving world. Even in it's early access state Neo Scavenger accomplishes what many other developers desperately attempt to attain yet fail to accompllish, an incredibly solid title built in a believable and atmospheric world, all the while laughing in it's large budget competitiors faces because there is yet more to come.\n\nOverview: Neo Scavenger is a post apocolypic turn based survival strategy game that honors such classics as Fallout and Wasteland while retaining an identity all it's own. Set in an incredibly atmospheric world, the protagonist has recently emerged from a cryo chamber without a memory as to how he got there, who he is or what state the world is in. Within seconds he recieves the answer to the latter in a very unwelcoming way.\n\nYou soon realize that you will desperately need to scavenge this unhospitable world if you intend on your survival and will have to leave your moral bindings behind if you're to be successful. While traveling you will be encountered by an assortment of undesirables that intend on their own as well and will achieve this at any cost, whether it be thievery, murder or deception. To assure your own instead, you will need to do the same.\n\nDuring your journey, you'll be presented with decisions that must be made and many times without prior knowledge of what may occurr based on your actions. You will pre-emptively strike what you deem to be\n\nGameplay: As stated above Neo Scavenger is a turn based survival strategy game with a wide range of varying elements that will affect each new journey you begin. You will be presented with an attribute screen where you must carefully select each according to your playstyle. Each will directly affect what skills you have available in given situations that will come about so, one must choose wiseley.\n\nOnce your travels begin you will need to manage multiple aspects in regards to your health such as hydration, hunger, restfulness, health/illness, injuries, environment temperatures, weather and more. The decisions you make will directly affect the protagonist accordingly so, one must manage these elements with confidence or otherwise you'll be swiftly presented with a message that you will assuredly see quite often, the death screen. This will come often and without warning aside from your available character management system. With that being said make sure you obsess about the details because, it's all that stands in the way of you and the grim reaper.\n\nAside from illness, fatigue, hunger and the like, you will of coarse encounter a variety of enemies along your journey that also as stated above intend on your demise. Combat is performed via a turn based system which, issues you an incredible assortment of options depending on your original skill/attribute selection which, I must reaffirm must be choen wisely! The options presented during combat range from hide, melee, , kick downed opponent, headbutt, sneak, ranged, retreat, offer/demand surrender, offer/accept cease fire, attempt to talk and countless other available options that are once again available depending on you attribute selection.\n\nDo I need to remind you to choose them wisely once again? I do? O.k check it out, this one's gonna hit home a bit more....Unless you carefully choose your attributes, you may within seconds contract any one of the following unpleasant status illnesses or diseases:\n\nBlindness, Blisters, Blue Rot, Cholera, Coughing Blood, Crippled Limb, Defoliant Exposure, Diarrhea, Gastroenteritis, Heat Stroke, Hypothermia, Hypovolemic Shock, Poisoned, Sepsis, Shock, Vomiting\n\nSound fun? No? Then choose wisely my friends, trust me.\n\nYou will without a doubt die and die often, yet during each playthrough you will obtain more knowledge in regards to how to survive and future strategies that come of it.\n\nGraphics: The graphics of Neo Scavenger serve their purpose. They are in no way revolutionary and aren't intended to be, nor needed to be whatsoever. Yet if there were one weakness of Neo Scavanger this would be it. As mentioned above the graphics serve their purpose but, that in no way means that the options available should be so barron. The options available are as basic as it gets and are as folows:\n\nFull screen, windowed, 16:9, 4:3, frame rate limiter, filter and stretch.\n\nPretty uneventful to say the least and due to the graphics engine's limitations they do not scale. So expect the presentation to be a bit lackluster. Yet, once again they serve their purpose and it will not ruin your experience whatsoever. So take this section with a grain of salt because, if you're in the market for a game in this genre, graphics are the least of your worries.\n\nSound: The music and sound effects although they may not present themselves often are perfectly crafted to create a tense and fitting atmosphere. Given the situation, the music will accompany and heighten your feeling of desperation within this incredibly depressing world. With each fade in the music will most definitely add an element that most other games cannot match. Considering so, the developers deserve an award for knowing when less is more and Neo Scavenger is a perfect example of that. The echoing sounds of the barron wilderness accompany the simplistic soundtrack design and add to a believable experience.\n\nStory: The story although seemingly simplistic and unoriginal at first is where Neo Scavenger will surprise you at every turn and leave you wanting to know more about our most unlucky protagonist. Although at first sight it may seem minimalistic, you will be proven wrong as you progress further into this world of chaos he so sadly awoke to. The story contained in Neo Scavenger will most assuredly be a driving force behind your desire to continue multiple play sessions to discover more about what happened to this once populated land. As you can see by my vagueness, I am doing my best to protect any insight as to specific story elements which, should serve as a hint that it's most definitely there and is most definitely worthwhile. Trust me when I say, there will be many more than one occasion that will leave you in awe and in horror.\n\nReplay Value: The replay value found in Neo Scavanger is second to none and I am by no means stretching my imagination out of bounds to come to that conclusion. The very fundamentals of Neo Scavanger are built to lure the player back into it's world of dessolation, no matter how many times they've played before. With each play through, you will gain knowledge as to how your next session could possibly last longer and you will most definitely feel an urge to apply it for a "better" outcome. What will give you an even more increasing desire to launch it again is that, even after you believe you have mastered it's many facets of gameplay.....you will die and die you will, often and mercilessly. Yet regardless, you will most assuredly return once again to the world of Neo Scavenger and enjoy every gut wrenching second.\n\nFinal (Early Access BETA) Review Score: 8.3/10\nAlthough still in Early Access form, I in no way feel it to be a hinderance to come to a determination that Neo Scavenger should find a place in the library of any gamer looking for a title that will surpass their expectations and leave them in shock that they haven't played it before. The developers at Blue Bottle Games have poured an incredible amount of love and attention into their world of solitude and despair which, I guaruntee will leave you feeling the same. If you're in the market for a survival game, give Neo Scavenger a chance!","October 26, 2014","true","14.3"," 96 of 106 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","96","106","0","23"

I got it with a bundle, but NEO Scavenger is honestly worth more than its asking price. It may only be flash, but don't let that deter you. It has one of the most realistic systems I have encountered. The developer is an active member of his own community, and that is very difficult to find these days with titles of this magnitude.\n\nI'm not very picky with what I play, but I am picky with what I play often. Since I got it, I have been playing this game every day, dieing every day, and starting anew every day. You die, a lot. But for some reason I always come back to start again, most times directly after the fact. This isn't like Dark Souls difficult, where if you die, you can just load up a save from right before it. No. When you die, you die. You have to start all over again.\n\nEach time you start, it is somehow an entirely new experience every time. The maps are randomized, NPC loadouts are randomized, loot and scavenging opportunities are randomized. The only things that don't change are the story, fixed encounters, and your inevitable death in these unforgiving wastes. You can spend hours building up the best loot and getting the best weapons and armor, just to get kicked in the head in your sleep, and have to start all over again. For some reason I have come to enjoy this.\n\nThe crafting system is remarkable, to say the least. Much more involved than that of Minecraft or Terraria. You are able to use the skills you chose at the start of the game to create new and different items than you could without. Being able to craft items that can possibly save you from a fight with a Dogman or a Blue Frog, keep you fed for a day, or drink clean water, can give you some sense of security. Until you fall asleep and get kicked in the head.\n\nThis game is not for those that want an easy game, that they can win every opportunity they get. You can be fully armored and have a shotgun in one hand and a crowbar in the other and pulverize the person you're fighting, just to have them throw a rock at you and die of internal bleeding a couple turns later. This game is unforgiving, and even when you're the biggest badass of the wastes... you can still die by eating some berries.\n\nI love this game. Plain and simple.","April 8, 2014","true","19.7"," 87 of 94 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","87","94","0","2"

I like it a lot, because it's gritty, fairly in-depth and more realistic than almost every other survival game.\n\nNEO Scavenger first asks you to choose your perks/flaws: Botanist, Strong, Myopia, etc. There are no XP and levels, so, mostly, what you see is what you get. After selecting your starting skills, you are thrown into the game barefoot and with only a hospital gown.\n\nYour first order of business is finding the basics of survival: shoes (one left and one right!), warm clothes, a lighter, a crowbar for scavenging, a sleeping bag, tools to obtain clean food and water and something to carry all this stuff around. In fact, the very first treasures you'll scavenge are probably disposable plastic grocery bags. They're very fragile, but they're tiny, weigh nothing and will serve as your first backpack. Those bad boys are little life savers, you have to love them! We should probably produce and dump more plastic bags all over the place for fututre survivors, right now. What do you think of that, environmentalists?\n\nFrom then on, you'll also need to find all the other things you need to survive: clean rags for wounds, alcohol for disinfection, antibiotics, painkillers, a firearm with ammo, gloves, a gasmask for polluted areas, crafting tools, binoculars, noisemakers to warn you of intruders during the night, etc. One of the game's main qualities is that the list of things needed to survive effectively is very, very long, but you can also make do with just the essentials.\n\nContemporary technology is surprisingly useless. A found computer might have no battery, then a found battery might have no charge in it, then a charged battery will reveal the computer is password-locked, then you'll hack it (if you picked that skill)... only to discover the computer only contains pictures of cats. On the other hand, a cheap plastic bottle filled with safe drinking water is always a useful commodity. Is that social commentary or what?\n\nWeapons are also imporant, but not nearly as much as in most survival games. It's possible to completely avoid all combat with a peace-loving build.\n\nSpeaking of which, combat is a strange numberless affair, where you choose broad actions (run forward/back, take cover, trip enemy, threaten). The only numeric value is range, which is enormously important depending on your fighting style. What you do get are surprisingly graphic descriptions of your situation: "You have passed out from unbearable pain" or "You have died from acute bleeding to the lungs". Ouch. As in real life, he who strikes first usually wins. It's also possible to win a fight and die from your injuries not long afterwards. All in all, fights are terrying (as they should be), the results are sometimes unpredictable and fighting fair is always a stupid idea. Did I mention you can be killed in your sleep (and vice-versa)?\n\nThere's also crafting, there's always crafting. Except here it's realistic. You're not going to craft an assault rifle with rocks in NEO Scavenger. In fact, a good ol'fire is probably the number one recipe. Sorry, no fire by friction if you haven't chosen the Trapper skill at character creation. Making fire without an external source is really not that easy without training. Another essential crafting recipe is: Fire + Water + Receptacle = Boiled (sterile) Water. Don't tell me it's boring until, weakened by diarrhea from drinking dodgy water, you are punched to death by a hobo. By the way, the game doesn't tell you what makes you sick: you only know you messed up somewhere when symptoms start showing up.\n\nThe game leaves the player with three general survival strategies: use nature's gifts to provide for your needs, scavenge cities for pre-apocalypse technology or... murder every survivor in sight for the contents of their shopping bags, RAWR!\n\nThe game has a main storyline, but as of right now it's pretty short. And did I tell you THIS GAME HAS NO ZOMBIES? Yay!\n\nThe game has two main flaws. First, the game could do a better job helping you find points of interest. The map is very large and it's not obvious where the important areas are. The second is almost a praise: I want more of it! I want more items, more weapons, more unique areas, more special encounters, more animals. MOAR! The possibilites of common household items having ingenious survival uses is almost endless. Variety in this game is good, but not great, but things are still being added to the game (and there are mods).\n\nWhile I recommend NEO Scavenger, it is in Early-Access at 99% complete, so it might be worth waiting a bit if you want the best first experience possible. Yet even right now, it's still a pretty great game and an impressive achievement as the work of a single man.\n\nIn conclusion, I'll quote Rock, Paper, Shotgun's Graham Smith which sums up the game's worth pretty well:\n"NEO Scavenger is the only survival game that feels like it has anything to do with survival."","November 27, 2014","true","38.2"," 67 of 73 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","67","73","3","4"

I like survival games.  I like rogue-like games.  So a turn-based, rogue-like survival game?  Sign me up!  Except not for this turn-based, rogue-like survival game please.\n\nIMHO rogue-like games like FTL and Don't Starve succeed because they're a streamlined experience, which makes "dying part of the fun".  Starting a new game is always exciting and you're confident you can learn from your past mistakes so you'll survive longer this time 'round.\n\nThis is where NEO falls short.  The dev had a vision and built the game to match that vision.  But if his vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland does not align with your vision of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, prepare to encounter all sorts of frustratingly illogical, immersion-breaking events.\n\nPeople call FTL brutally hard and overly random, but I "get it" - it makes sense to me when I play.  I can learn from past mistakes and play better.  NEO makes no sense to me.  The game design decisions are just weird, the interface is clunky, the graphics are grotesque.  Dying for no clear reason, when things seem to be going swimmingly right up until you die, *may* be realistic (?) in the dev's world, but not mine.\n\nYou get the same kind of all-of-a-sudden deaths in Don't Starve but it's always clear that "I shouldn't have attacked that Pig Man just for kicks" or "I shouldn't have tried to chop that last tree before lighting my campfire" or "I should have abandoned my hunt for gold and hunted berries instead, so I wouldn't starve".\n\nPlaying NEO is like being put in a straight-jacket designed by the dev.  "Play my way or not at all".  Okay dude - IF your way makes logical sense and there's a clear progression from A-to-B-to-C-to-You Died.   Going A-to-R-to-D-to-You Died does not help me live longer next time!\n\nSo "I shouldn't scavenge that random house the way I've scavenged every other house so far, because I should have known the roof was going to cave in"?  or "I shouldn't have tried to run away from that particular encounter because I should have known I would trip, fall on my ♥♥♥ and not be able to stand up again even though I'm healthy, rested and well-fed"?  How do I avoid either of those situations next time around?  That's two of the dozens of deaths that will leave you scratching your head going "REALLY?!?".\n\nForumites will tell you, take this skill, that skill and the other skill and you'll never die.  Okay, but what if I *don't want* to take those three specific skills.  What if I want to build the character *I want to play*?  In that case, prepare for many, many, many frustrating deaths because you're not playing his game the way the Dev wants you to.\n\nI don't get some of these other reviews:  "Dogman killed me while I slept despite the fact that I put down multiple noise traps, Thumb's Up 10/10."  WTF?  Is that a joke?  It's not helpful.  "Stabbed a guy three times then kicked him in the head when he was down.  He was hurt, bleeding out and on the edge of unconsciousness but he got up, landed one lucky punch and I was immediately unconscious, Thumb's Up 10/10".\n\nTroll reviews like that are turning this Reviews tab into a joke.","December 29, 2014","false","25.7"," 590 of 892 people (66%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","66","590","892","34","44"

I figure this run would end pretty quick, because I know death is apparently frequent in this game (aka roguelike). I turn around to eat a bag of chocolate, and before I know it the hobo main character is wearing six t-shirts, a hoodie, a hospital gown, a size 7 left shoe, and a size 9 right boot.\n\nWow. That escalated quickly. More like NEO Scavenger: Hobo Simulator 2015\n\nPlastic baggies are literally a currency in this world. We had one on our back, one in each hand, and about 6 spare ones stashed in the others. Nuts.\n\nNot even to mention the inventory tetris that I just witnessed. Literally level 9,000 sh*t going on here. If you are OCD or have hoarding tendencies, be forewarned.\n---\n\nWhat was so fun about this game is that you really feel the excitement as you rise up and gather better and better gear. There is alot of strategy and exploration that keeps things fresh. The story elements are present, but are never bothersome.\n\nPros:\n+Quite addictive.\n+Very deep and complex interactions. Lots of attention to detail with crafting and how items interact. How clothing functions, etc. Further, there are lots of ways to go about a situation.\n+Feels fair. We actually got quite far on the first run or so.\n\nCons:\n-Interface feels clunky at first, but isn't that bad when you get past the learning curve.\n-Music is almost non-existant. Fine enough with me because bad music is bad.\n-The combat system leaves something to be desired. Thankfully the game is not centered around it.\n\nYeah totally worth full price - lots of really fun replay value here.","January 1","true","6.8"," 43 of 46 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","43","46","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/recommended/248860/","Chernobog3","Chernobog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chernobog3/","94 products in account","A hardcore survivalist game. By hardcore, I'm talking perma death, just about everything can kill you easily, and you're kind of lady luck's ♥♥♥♥♥ in regards to how well you can do sometimes. That said, this is a great game. It's a thinking man's title, borderline unfair (I mean that in a begrudging good way),  and it will take you a long time to really master the concept of it. Coupled with a gigantic procedurally generated world and you'll find yourself playing a new set of variables each time, particularly as you can pick a handful of your starting skills before stepping into the frying pan that is NEO Scavenger.\n\nStory-wise, it's kind of an end of the world scenario, except more dealing with mutants, mad men, and bandits, rather than zombies. The plot is kind of backseated to the gameplay, however. I found almost all the NPCs to be universally hostile or locked into a constant fight/flight mentality. Don't expect dialogue or too much revealing information- your character wakes up as a corpsicle in a cryo vat and you're basically thrust into an unknown landscape. You have to gather what you need to survive and you need to do it FAST. Freezing to death is very easy and this game does not hold a newcomer's hand whatsoever. You will be hunted, attacked remorselessly, robbed, and yes, you can literally be killed in one round by the wrong person if you're unlucky. As such, this is about SURVIVAL. Not racking up xp and going nuts with a pea shooter.\n\nWhile I like NEO Scavenger, there's some things that are a needless hassle about the gameplay. The interface is extremely clunky for your items, the crafting system is a bit vague (I have a sharp edge like the recipe says... I can't harvest this dog because...?), and the biggest issue to me, is the game saves via Flash cookies, not on Steam.\n\nImagine my disgust when I kept finding my save games erased after every play session. Hours and hours, gone. So I checked my Flash and found I had it enabled to allow cookies to be saved. So something else was deleting them. According to the developers, it could be one's antivirus or any of a number of things. With all due respect, I don't really care to go searching every minute infrastructural maintenance program I have to find out which program is deleting the cookies beyond Flash and what might need an exclusion to NEO- this should have been saved in the Steam Cloud or however many other games here do it without issue. I really REALLY wish the developers would have done something about this instead forcing the player to find a meta solution. Unfortunately, from what I've read, they're not really doing anymore updates and the game is considered completed. :/ Which is a shame, because I loved everything else about this.\n\nI would heartily recommend NEO but the issue with saves is not something I can overlook after finding this out several hours in. If the developers would or could somehow make the game save within Steam and not through cookies, I will happily change this to a Recommendation. As of now, I reluctantly can't do that.","November 6, 2015","false","35.0"," 154 of 226 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","154","226","5","6"

Barley managing to roll away as a crowbar struck where your head would have been less then a second ago. You catch a brief glimpse of your assailent: raggedand erratic with the souless eyes of a killer. He hits you, the cold metal smashing your arm as you clamber to your feet.\nYour eyes still adjusting to the darkness, you miss your swing, the cold steel of your meet cleaver slashing the air in front of your attacker. He reponds with a swing of his own, smahing into your ribs... hard, bones cracking under the force.\n\nYou prepare to dodge, mentally readying yourself, watching for any twitch of movement. It pays off, you notice his legs kneel, powering themselves for a leap. At the last moment you step aside, watching him tackle past you into the rubble. A swift slice to the head lacerates immensly as he trys to make sense of what happens. The next few moments of the battle went fast. Your kicks met either his head or torso repeatedly, denying him any chance of standing upright. A stray slice here with your trusty cleaver made short work of his frrail body.Eventually, your slashes and kicks are wasted energy, the bloody mess becoming an outlet for your rage.\n\nDuring the fight you had noticed an important feature about the mans attire. A paitents gown with a deep blue sash, signifying him as a carrier of the 'Blue Rot' disease.\n\nIt's too far a walk to the city to be cured at the early, treatable stage. Let alone your wallet wan't fat enough to pay for the bills for the procedure. Your rage doen't subside for what seems an eternity, slicing at the once human-like mess over and over, your rage overcoming you. At some point of time, you must have dropped the cleaver, because now you were punching at the chunky mess that was the mans skull.\n\nYou had been defeated before, knocked unconcious, left for dead with nothing except for the clothes that merciful scavengers didnt steal from your body. Bullet wounds, lacerations, bruises, concussions, broken ribs and limbs, hunger, dehydration, sleep deprevation and even sickness from wounds left untreated. Every form of pain and punishment had been inflicted onto you.\n\nBut Everytime you bounced back, fresh with scars from your victories. man and beast fell before you all the same. The wild environment of post-apocolypse detroit had you at the knifes edge at every moment, but every time you pulled a trick from your sleeve.\n\nBut this time was different. You saved yourself to live another day, but not to live to see the end of the week. Right now the blue rot was creeping though your veins, infecting every pore of your body. Within a few days you wil be dead, no amount of trickery or wit could save you from this situation.\n\nYour days are numbered, death is imminent.\n\nYou don't bother falling back to sleep. Dead men don't need sleep. You wander aimlessly and painfully through the night, leaving your possessions and your killer's corpse behind. At dawnbreak, you feel hungry eyes linger on you. Your hunter had been following you at least an hour but you didn't care, his means to your end would be quicker then suffering pain of blue rot.\nYou let the towering, werewolf-esque creature approach you slowly at a distance. You reach for cleaver, a final battle and a warriors death. But your hand grabs aimlessly at your waist as it dawns on you that your precious weapon of steel was a 4-hour walk behind you, stuck halfway through your attackers leg.\n\nYou stand still, without purpose, without hope, as the beast charges for you. He leaps at you, claw ready to swipe. You try to dodge, instinct priotising survival rather thant wishing to die but it was too late. The claws enter your skull effortlessly, the pain is incredible, agonising to levels of extreme. It takes one more slice from the beast to end your life and your journey ends.\n\nIf you made it to the end of this text crawl wondering why i would write something so long, it's because i felt NEOscavenger required more than a simple review like: "Got shot in head while asleep 420/10"\n\nThe above story was a more descriptive, but true, experience i had with one of my more longer playthroughs.\n\nNEOscavenger is harsh, brutal and if it were human, would probably kill puppies for the heck of it. Every journey with your character, every battle, every scavenge attempt, every time you press that sleep button, can end your playthrough abrubtly and heart-breakenly if you aren't careful enough. Fights can go from one-sided victories or soul-crushing losses within moments. Dehydration seems to kick in when there is no water source for kilometers, and hunger when the only food source was that scavenger you just slaughtered... Traits allow for unique and differing playthroughs. Posiitives and negatives balacing eachother out. A myopic tank, the athletic botanist, the frail ranger, a Medical mechanic.\n\nThe combat: a turn-based sequence of text describing the events of the battle, are some of the most sweat-inducing fearful moments that i have experienced in gaming. With a bit of imagination, fights in NEOscavenger are brutally intense, every option increasing your chances of winning or dieing.\n\nThere are no easy victories, no fights won unscarred, no journey left unhindered by some problem, some gnawing concern that would later illicit your demise. My playtime says 20hrs: but if you counted the time i've spent in both the demo, and less than legal copies of the game, i've spent time almost quadruple that.\n\nIf your looking for a game that expects nothing more then your full attention to stay alive and healthy, and are still somehow not convinced by the plethoria of reviews before mine, look no further then NEOscavenger\n\n\n\n","February 20, 2015","true","26.9"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","34","38","3","0"

If you mess up, it could cost you your life. Perma-death is a thing so you really want to be careful.  The descriptions of what you do in combat is very descriptive and really helps with immersion.\n\nPros:\n- It's very fun\n- Rewarding if you come across some good gear\n- Very realistic in the mechanics\n\nCons:\n- no animations or visuals during combat\n- Purely text based (could be a good thing if you like that, I do)\n- near impossible on your first few lives.\n- UI takes some time to get used to\n\nOver all, it's a very brutal, but fun survival game, and I am really glad that I got it.

After feral dogs jump up and rip your face off with their teeth for the fifth time, I bet you'll appreciate having a robot butler to care for you, you big cosseted ghost town lover!\n\nYeah, you think you're hot ♥♥♥♥ because you dunked a few Fat Mans into a Super Mutant's face? You're nothing. You have never been in a post-apocalyptic wasteland until you're running around, frantically searching for clothes in abandoned buildings to keep from freezing to death. You haven't lived because you haven't frantically searched for a soup pan to boil water with, because you know all the water laying around is an invitation to kill you. You haven't really survived because you know that the world knows about fifteen different ways to snuff your life out, and is cold and indifferent about everyone one of those ways because that's how hardcore and brutal planet Earth is. You haven't known the true terror of conflict as another one of your kind stalks you with a hunting rifle for all the batteries and water bottles you have.\n\nYou like being in constant danger? Good, because that's how the game masks its short length. From the very start, half of the game's goal is just living long enough to reach the Megacity of Detroit. It's a short walk, but it's a short walk fraught with danger that will kill people dead (especially if you decide you're too good for guns and try to go for a Melee-only character). It's an open world and there's all sorts of fun secrets to find. If you live long enough to get there, that is.\nBut if you do, you'll suddenly realize just how cramped it all seems. And yet, it feels a bit unreasonable to ask for more, because the journey to finding the secret is a bunch of little experiences in and of itself.\n\nAlso the random encounter roleplaying sequences do a great job illustrating how depressingly hostile the world is, but also rarely try to kill you outright. And I understand why they're there - even the hardest of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in the wasteland will go down easy - but VERY SUDDENLY losing a character I've grown to love after playing for thirty hours carting ♥♥♥♥ back and forth to the DMC because I chose poorly really rubs me the wrong way. I'm not saying this is entirely a bad thing (I was choosing rather carelessly), but a little forewarning to sudden death is appreciated.\n\nAnyway! If you want to play Super Hardcore mode in NEO Scavenger, take your dumb little talisman off and see how hard the game gets. Then you can complain about it to me in the comment section, you lily-livered aluminium can collector.","December 31, 2015","true","47.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","92","24","26","12","0"

I got it as part of a Humble Bundle and figured it was worth a try. I think I played it for about 5 hours straight that first time. It's probably the greatest random find I've had.\n\nYou have various perks and handicaps that you select to build your character, so you can choose to have excellent vision and mechanical skill but be a weak, feeble insomniac. After you create your character, you wake up in a hospital, with no idea what's going on and why the world has gone to hell around you. Immediately, you have to deal with a dogman who's charging down the hallway towards you. Your traits will affect how you can deal with it.\n\nAfterwards, you venture into the outside world. It is bleak and largely empty. You'll set off, with nothing but the hospital gown on your back. You can forage for food and water, but you should really make sure that the food's fresh. Do you know what berries are poisonous? Can you trust that water? Explore a little further and you'll see some ruined buildings. Scavenge in them and you might find some actual clothes to keep you warm, maybe some preserved foodstuffs or a cell phone. Be careful, though, and try not to make too much noise.\n\nYou see someone on the horizon. You wonder whether they can explain what happened, but then you notice the rough spear that they're wielding. They charge at you, and you try to run. You can't get away fast enough, so you try to fight them off with a broken bottle you've picked up. You take the spear in the shoulder, and you stagger with the pain, but you get in an incredibly lucky thrust with the bottle and your opponent goes down. You shred some of your clothes and wrap the makeshift bandages around your wounds, but it's too late--infection has taken hold. In your last conscious moments you watch night fall, and you see a glow in the distance. It may be an illusion created by your feverish mind, but it almost looks like city lights...\n\nEach playthrough is memorable in this game, even the ones where you freeze to death the first night. If you survive in this strange new world, you can find people and locations that will help you find out background about this world. There is a story here, but you have to go searching for it. Even if you don't find all the backstory, you still have a tale of desperate survival that's incredibly compelling. I heartily recommend the game to anyone who's interested in survival games.","December 17, 2014","true","15.0"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","0"

In the beginning you are immediately faced with an oppertunity to encounter an enemy. Although I personally avoid that encounter because although the combat is turn based, it is also entirely text based. As is almost everything else in the game, from the detailed descriptions of the surrounding areas. To the fact that you wake up the next morning with stomach pains & diarrhea because you ate poisonous berries. The first time I played, I discovered a map finding out that I was in Michigan before shortly getting pummled to death in my sleep by a hunter with a crowbar. The next game I found my own crowbar and pocket knife and slaughtered a pack of wild dogs, before getting a 'severe' infection from not treating their multiple bite wounds. What the hell? this game has realistic damage indicators? Yes, you can't just drink a potion and make it all go away. It's certianly not for the average gamer.

It combines elements of survival, combat strategy, crafting, perma-death, inventory management, rpg, and a real sense of danger just lurking around every hex -- mostly in that order, I'd say. It's also turn-based rogue-like with the map changing slightly each time you begin a new journey. Do not let the modest graphics fool you -- they will be the least of your concerns, I assure you.\n\nThe combat system is actually rather realistic! Based on the character ablities and flaws you choose from the beginning, the combat system allows you to pick from quite a few options such as Charging your opponent, Headbutting, Tackling them to the ground, franticly retreating, sneaking, taking cover, sneaking behind cover, Offer to Talk, Melee combat, kick while down, shooting a ranged weapon -- too many to name, here. Choose wisely, or face the consequenses. I really enjoy the combat aspect of this game, but I imagine there are lots of players who would perhaps prefer stealth over Strength, and trade-based ablilities such as Botanist or Hacking over Athletisism. You can choose from flaws (Examples: bad metabolism, fatiques faster) as well, which allow you pick another ability or two to boost your luck. And it is almost always luck.\n\nI'm currently playing a character with the traits Strong, Melee, Athletic, Botany, and for my flaw -Metabolism.\n\nI have no idea who I am, but I appear to be a hulking, savage vegetarian. It's been 14 days, and I've killed at least 24 people -- I'm losing count, and can no longer remember any of their faces. I've been alerting many opportunists while  scavenging with a pickaxe and a lighter, but in turn, I've killed most all of those who couldn't escape. I'm hunting. Am I even human, anymore? At least I haven't resorted to cannibalism... yet.. and I'm sick with infection somehow. I found a couple of white pills, but without any knowledge of what they are, I fear the result. I've made a temporary home in a high-rise for at least 4 days now, only venturing outside to eat berries and mushrooms, and to gather water while I wait out whatever has me sick. Hopefully, I can make it through just one more night.....\n\nI have yet to finish the RPG portion of this game, but so far the stories and context are both quite fun to read.\n\nI played quite a bit before it was released, and it's also available in your browser!

Most of the systems (combat, crafting, movement, line of sight etc.) are very straightforward, and easy to grasp.  But put them all together, and almost everything you do is a meaningful choice that will continue to affect you throughout the game.\n\nAlso, my favourite contemporary novel is The Road, by Cormac Mccarthy, and this is as close as you are going to get to experiencing that chill when someone asks:  "What are you eating?"\n","October 10, 2014","true","23.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","0"

I love the game. I do, really. It's awesome, it's fun, it's addictive, and honestly it could teach people a few things about surviving in such a situation that they can't depend on society anymore. Almost all the techniques in the game are solid survival techniques that could very well save your life in the real world. But after a series of deaths before I could even get enough supplies to make the journey east (which I understand is a roguelike feature, but bear with me.), I felt the need to write this review.\nOne word, ladies and gentlemen: Yezinka. There's only one of them in the game world, and it wanders the map until it encounters your player. When it does, it hovers around in the hexes around you, and waits for you to inevitably have to sleep. You can't kill it by jumping it during the day because it can manage to sprint somewhere around 12 paces per move, while you can manage at best 4. It's also very difficult to hit with ranged weaponry (never got to try melee). Now here's the lemon in the wound: When you go to sleep, it immediately beelines for you, and steals your eyes. You can do NOTHING about it. You get around two turns, which is enough to stand up and start to look for it, and suddenly your eyes are gone. You can't do anything to recover them unless you've happened to encounter this late in the game and are near the city, and have been hoarding enough cash for cybersurgery. I say you need to be near the city because the condition "No Eyes" seems to flag you and every single enemy creature on the map drops what they're doing and attempts to kill you. I made a valiant effort and managed to kill two bandits and a dog before I was just overwhelmed with going into a new battle every turn (every other turn very VERY occasionally). Maybe if I were given a chance to pack up the things I had and try to luck my way to the city and sell everything I had for a single eye, I wouldn't have such a problem with this. Maybe if I were allowed to live for a bit and get a balancing attribute after a few turns that mitigated the fact that I can't see anymore, that'd be fine too. But as it is, if luck allows this broken monstrosity to seek you out without being killed by other wild animals or lucky NPCs, you are screwed, and there's no preparation at all that you can attempt to save yourself. I cannot in good conscience recommend any game that has a chance of giving the player such an enormous middle finger. But if you can get past that and you think it's not something that will bother you, then buy this game. The Yezinka is an enormous infected zit on the face of an otherwise outstanding game.","March 26, 2015","false","36.2"," 78 of 129 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","78","129","15","15"

The crafting system is tedious to sort through and use repeatedly, and the game doesn't always give you a fair shake- I remember one run specifically in which my character froze to death before he could find clothes, another where he was killed instantaneously by an assailant he never saw, and for the love of God, NEVER, EVER TAKE OFF THE AMULET YOU START WITH. Just... DON'T do it.\n\nThat being said, I can recommend NEO Scavenger regardless because, even in spite of some debatably fair play, I'm still coming back to it, because I don't want it to beat me.

You can deal with this using strenghts you've previously selected, after taking care of the wolf-like creature you start to wonder where you are, or who you are, you remember next to nothing, and as you set foot outside the facility you notice everything has changed, buildings are in poor condition, and there are no signs of life to be found.\n\nYou must scavenge for survival, your first order of business is protecting yourself from the elements, finding clothes is your #1 priority. After getting yourself warmed up and safe from hypothermia, you should probably find a way of protecting yourself, and scavenging for weapons can be a tedious task, but the excitement you get from finding a mint-condition rifle or shotgun is more than worth it, I won't spoil any more of the game, but I will say this: it's extremely unforgiving and I myself have never survived for more than 25 days, unraveling quite a portion of the story, but not close to all of it.\n\nTL;DR\nNEO Scavenger is an unforgiving and exciting survival game, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're a fan of the genre, but you will die.

I was worried but I had some Antacids on me so I swallowed them and kept going unknowing of what was happening. about a day later I saw I had a disease called 'blue rot' it was stage three. Having no clue of what this was and fearing for my characters life I looked it up on the wiki. Turns out naturally I only had a 30% change to survive it but If I found a certain NPC in a certain place (I wont tell you here) Then I could be cured and immunized. the problem was that in 72 hours there was a 70% chance I would be dead. Panicked by this I began to search the map frantically to the point where I was running through a forest at night when something approached me... I searched and searched but couldn't find anything due to the low light conditions I was stuck in. Then suddenly I was slashed in the stomach by what was revealed to be a dogman (think of a werewolf with no human form.) Startled I took my equipped crowbar and smacked it in the face stunning him. This didn't come without a cost however as the dogman swung again causing my leg to start bleeding profusely. I saw that the beast was stunned took my opportunity and ran while I could through sheer luck I lost it.  Wearily I continued my search for this illusive NPC well into my second sleepless night when I saw them. My dogman problem had tripled. Three dogmen 20m away. I didn't want to use it but I saw no other option. I took out the only item of value I had (a pistol with a full mag) from my bag and began to shoot knowing that running was out of the question due to their speed. 6/7 of the shots hit the pack but they were starting to close the distance. I took my bow from by back dropping the pistol and began to unload all five of my arrows into them. One of the dogmen had collapsed due to the pain I had inflicted but that still left two. There was now only 5m between me and them, my two sleepless night had left me on the verge of collapsing and even if I somehow survived this the blue rot would likely kill me. I wanted to die a hero at least. I dropped everything but my trusty crowbar. I braced for impact then swung with all my might at their leader. I was immediately slashed, battered and bruised but I had nearly got the leader at least. It was then that my sleepless nights  combined with effectively a marathon got the better of me. My battered body unable to continue collapsed of sleep deprivation and there unconscious I was torn to pieces and devoured by dogmen.\n\nThis was only of of the epic moments of this life. From this game I have so many stories I could tell from wandering out of the cryo chamber for the first time to reveal the ruined world I was surrounded in to hunting a deer for an entire day with a single spear to turn its skin into a bag of which I hauled around the best cuts of meat I could get from it. This game is an experience and I recommend trying unless you don't like to read because to become really immersed then you need to read all the text they present to you.","March 12","true","15.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","1"

That probably means I need to improve it. I mean, diarrhea is only one of the many things in this game.\n\nNEO Scavenger is a pretty tough survival game. Unlike most other survival games, this one is more strategic, and isn't first/third/ResidentEvil camera. It's like a hex-turn-based board game.\n\nWhen you begin a new game in NEO Scavenger, you're greeted with a page. Basically, you can pick traits to help you in your adventure (Botany lets you see if a certain mushroom is safe to eat, Lockpicking lets you break into locked buildings, etc.). There's also Flaws. Things like Insomniac will make sleeping more difficulty, and Metabolism will require you to eat more. Of course, some Flaws have positives. Metabolism, for instance, slightly increases healing.\n\nIt's possible to encounter friendly NPC's, or ones that want to punch you until you recieve a concussion and die. Of course, there's a way to protect yourself from hostile NPC's (or you just want to kill friendly NPC's). There's a variety of weapons. It could be a Butcher Knife, a Shotgun, a bunch of pebbles (for the daring), and a Crowbar. There's obviously more, but those are a few.\nSpeaking of NPC's, there's strange critters roaming around the world of NEO Scavenger. Ever wanted to encounter a DogMan? Or this creepy humanoid-like thing that wants eyes? It's in this game, and the latter is pretty creepy.\n\nNEO Scavenger has random encounters. You can encounter things like: a broken-down car with a sleeping bed inside, a tank with people inside, a dog, or some other stuff (that can be a little screwed up). There's also some set locations in the game. The game is randomized, but there are a few areas that are always there. For example, a large city, and a strange house. There's a few more, but you can look for those (or just Google them).\n\nNEO Scavenger has a looting feature. You can scavenge abandoned houses, buildings, and more. You might find worthless junk (like the almighty pebbles), or you might find a backpack, or even a gun! There's also left/right shoes.\n\nThe quest for shoes begins begins as soon as you begin. Walking barefoot is no fun, and neither is freezing! Finding shoes and warm clothing is important at the beginning. You game will be cut short if you don't find these items ASAP.\n\nWell, there's probably a bunch of other stuff I may have forgotten to mention, but if I remember, I will surely add it in.\nDo get this game. There's also a demo, so try that out, too.","April 24, 2014","true","30.1"," 235 of 418 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","235","418","0","6"

Honestly, there isn't really much I would recommend that the developers change, they were very thorough in making this game. Certainly nothing game-breaking (so far). Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell.* Lot's of fun for the file size. It has a sense of brutality without relying on gore to get the message across.\n\nI recommend when you play this game that you do *not* look anything up first. The game is intuitive, and a great deal  of fun can be had by messing up. This is a great game for just getting on and having fun.\n\nIf I had to think of a downside, it would be difficult but I would say there are two. The first would be that it is simple, and those that want fancy 3d graphics or a complex game should look to a different genre altogether. Second would be replayability. It has a good story, but there is something disappointing about each part of the story fleshed out: that's one fewer mystery for later. Of course, you can say that about any story-oriented game.\n\nAgain, I would say that the keyword here is intuitive. Easy to pick up the mechanics, more difficult to use them effectively, but overally the difficulty is anywhere from mild to moderate. This isn't an 'easy' game per-se, but it certainly isn't hard. It is a game where risk and reward are both quite high in most encounters. A small slip up can cost you dearly, a well timed strike can earn you incredibly useful loot, so long as you have the space to carry it all. By far the most scarce resource in the game is space. You can't carry everything you find in the beginning, so deciding what is most valuable can be a very tough decision.\n\nAll of the above serve to make it the ideal rogue-like game IMO.\n\n*EDIT: About the bugs, I should mention that there is a minor graphics bug where items will appear partly off-screen, and cannot be selected from boxes. This is uncommon, however, and easily fixed by switching between fullscreen and minimized (you can end in whatever screen you prefer). Probably not worth mentioning except that I had said "Bugs are non-existant as far as I can tell."\n\nEDIT 2: One other critisism: This game does not offer difficulty settings at this time. Initially, it seems difficult. After a few hours, it does seem slightly easy. Hopefully that will change in time, but with a sense of ease often comes recklessness (at least in my case), counteracting any potential for this game to become boring. It still remains a very fun game, and I look forward to updates.","January 11, 2015","true","50.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evankimori/recommended/248860/","evankimori","And then John was a zombie.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evankimori/","326 products in account","First of all: if you paid $15 for this game, you've underpaid. Sunk more than 90 hours in this game (online and offline) and I STILL can't see half of the content and this is just vanilla. I made the mistake of adding a mod to this game and holy crap...still can't see past 10% of the content without either dying, getting completely wrapped up in a spawn and exploration run and enjoy the hell out of simply trying to LIVE long enough!\n\nNEO Scavenger's one of those games that no matter how much you die, live, fail, respawn, mix your talents up and roll again...you want to play some more. I've clocked almost 20 hours in the DEMO alone and when I bought the game, I bought copies for friends and sat many a night down in Teamspeak and we've compared survival times and setups and this game suceeds in making you declare "One...more...game..."\n\nI turned this into a serious review just because I've joined the forums, added input and done a bit of bug submission as well and even the community is together despite it being a lone-dev game.\n\nPROS:\n-A very good "One more game..." setup.\n-A lot of the in-game recipes are common sense based. Combine...and see what happens.\n-The turn-based battle system with different movesets depending on your talents is functional and efficent. That feeling of satisfaction when you stab a feral dog to death with a wooden spear crafted by your own hands and sharpened with a glass shard.\n-The storyline so far is intriguing and you get this sense of "Where am I? Who am I? What is going on?" constantly.\n-Because of the game's setting and environment, finding so much as a shopping bag to hold your stuff feels like the greatest success. You'll know what I mean when you play.\n-The idea of drinking water straight from a pond is hazardous at best.\n-Eat berries, dog flesh, human flesh, cooked food, soup, scavenged snack cakes. The world is your buffet table!\n-Josh Culler's submissions for the soundtrack of this game are short...but VERY, VERY suitable.\n\nCONS:\n-The game is programmed for Flash. Depending on your PC and stats and some measure of bad luck-you ARE going to get some frustrate-level crashes. Save often and make sure the game doesn't bug out randomly because it pretty much means you're going to lose your progress. It doesn't happen often but when it does...damn. Hard luck. TIP: run the game in fullscreen and set your cache for Flash at 10MB to prevent random lockups.\n-The game tilts itself against you unfairly sometimes, especially when you decide to settle down in an area for extended time and the enemy spawn rate tends to increase. Not exactly fair when you're someone who likes having a "base" to call home but the gameplay is meant to keep you mobile. Not stuck in one spot. Explore at will but know that if you hang around somewhere long enough, the game WILL start pushing you out to go do something else or go somewhere.\n-The amount of enemies that can populate one tile per battle sometimes goes a little overboard. Nothing more rage inducing than getting strangled to death in your sleep by 4 enemies, 3 of whom took apart your noise traps and the other strangled you to death with a pounce. Not sure if this is intentional but it still is frustrating when it happens.\n-Not all the recipes work seamlessly. Sometimes you HAVE to check your recipe book to see if you've learned it by accident and you need to click the RECIPE to craft said item in the first place.\n-No way to repair items CURRENTLY at the time of this review without mod assistance. It's pretty annoying to have to play vanilla, find a backpack on 3% and lose it the next turn to decay, go play a mod and then come back to find out that there are still some minor frustrations.\n\nThe reason I approve this game is because the community contributes ideas, help, bug reports and helps design its own mods. So far there's 3 main stable ones that are available at the website forums and they add SO MUCH to the game already. You know you've succeeded with a game when people are climbing over themselves to add content and mods to your game, free of charge.\n\nVERDICT:\nBuy this if you like roguelikes, turn based and making decisions via micromanagement of inventory and move turns. You'll spend a good few hours with this game and still find yourself coming back for more. The gods help you if you add a mod. Might as well quit your day job while you're ahead! :D\n\nAnd now for your typical funny lines:\n\nAlways use Botany.\n\nWounds infected?\nTannin Tea!\n\nThirsty?\nTannin Tea!\n\nPooping blood?\nTannin Tea!\n\nVomiting?\nTannin Tea!\n\nWanna make money?\nTannin Tea!\n\nInfected and sick?\nTannin Tea!\n\nSurrounded by 6 Dogmen and all you have is a rock?\nTannin Tea!\n\nTannin Tea!

Expect to die and restart several times while first playing NEO Scavenger, there is no reloading, only learning from your last playthrough's mistakes.","January 4, 2015","true","51.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Not even who you are. Your goal is to make it to "The Glow" or Detroit Mega City as you may learn to call it both. Your goal is to make it here, exploring along the way, better equipping yourself with the task of finding out who you are.\nThis is how I would imagine a post-apocalyptic Detroit happening.\nConstantly being bombarded by the ruthless Dogmen, and Bad Muthas, a Detroit street gang of brutal, thuggish cannibals who will NOT hesitate to attack you on sight. Also strangers and looters equipped with scoped hunting rifles, and Detroit Mega City Guards with rifles, shotguns, and full SWAT-type gear ready to exterminate you.\nYou will be excited as ever to just find a pair of old plastic shopping bags and a shard of glass or a broken bottle to arm yourself with. Every little space in your inventory counts, so space management is almost as important to your survival as dealing with combat scenarios with a cool, calm, level head.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou will need to scavenge for loot while maintaining low visibility, otherwise if you think you're tough enough you can brazenly move into an abandoned building, scavenge it loudly and roughly, and hope someone or something doesn't hear or see you.\nThe choices you make for every little situation in this game need to be approached with clear thinking, and taking into account repercussions of your actions is seriously encouraged for this experience.\n\nYou will have random encounters within the story line and others along your travels.\nYou may succomb to diseases from exposure to sick people, bad weather (hypothermia and pneumonia), food poisoning, and even BREATHING toxic fumes over time.\n\nYou will wake up to people stealing your supplies and food or attempting to bash your skull in with a stone. Then be forced to make the decision to flee in complete terror, sneak up on the thief in the dark and take them by surprise, or just stand up from your sleep and attack them in a raging fury.\n\nIf you can get past the clunky UI and lack of animation or intimate graphical control, this game is a dity gem just waiting to be appreciated by the next "arachaeologist" who finds it. I never pictured myself enjoying a game that's 60% text-based, but I quickly fell in love with this game. Here, you can learn quickly from past mistakes and keep pushing forward. If you ever thought it was hard to survive in other "survival" games, this is FAR more unforgiving but also more rewarding to experience. True-to-life combat system that allows your simplest mistakes to be exploted by your enemy, possibly resulting in your death or serious injury.\n\nOVERALL RATING OUT OF 10:\n9.5/10\nEven if you hate text-based games, or games with hexes (I certainly did), you may find yourself immersed and deeply invested into this game. I highly recommend this for anyone who appreciates post-apocalyptic roleplaying games and/or heavy survival. Even at full retail price this is a worthwhile purchase. The game has a few flaws, but all are so minor and outweighed greatly by what good there is in the game that you quickly forget they exist or have trouble noticing them to begin with. Very reminiscent of the first game of the Fallout series, more so than the second, but this game has its own unique flavour.","January 4, 2015","true","13.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

The writing is beautiful and manages to capture most any scenario that you're put into. Generally, it prides itself on being a survival, inventory-managing (think Deus Ex) roguelike that is incredibly unforgiving. Maybe a little too unforgiving.\n\nGenerally, when I lose a roguelike or a game in general, it'd be nice to have some idea of what I was doing /wrong/. I don't have that sense while playing Neo Scavenger. Most every playthrough, I think I am playing at the top of my game, as best as possible. Enemies can randomly hit you in the head with their fist and instantly kill you, even if you're geared up to the max. Unless you get ridiculously lucky, the cold of the environment WILL kill you. Eating the wrong things WILL kill you. If you got unlucky and didn't find a town, the cold or wolves or zombies or bandits WILL kill you.\n\nIt has stopped being fun to play. The UI is there. The mechanics are all there. The combat is thrilling. The art is there, the writing is there, and dammit I want this game to be so much more than it actually is. If you really want a hyper-realistic survival game, especially one as complicated as this one, then I can recommend it wholeheartedly. But if you're looking for an enjoyable, frantic gaming experience (as so many other survival games hope to achieve), Neo Scavenger unfortunately is far, far too luck-based to give any sense of accomplishment.\n\nIn addition, over the 5 months I stopped playing, the "skill ceiling" or "endgame" has gotten no higher or larger as far as I can tell. A legendary melee weapon (the crowbar) is handed out basically for free, the warmest clothing can be found in nearly every building, and one corpse's food can sustain you forever, as can the numerous woods, rivers etc. If you don't start out with certain skills (botany comes to mind) then you'll be stuck relying on finding towns to survive. and you CAN'T get new skills aside from the implants that I've never seen.\n\nOverall, I think that with a bit of patching Neo Scavenger could be a great, renowned game. It's not that it needs polish; it needs content, and it needs a difficulty that scales directly with how skilled you are, and skill should /matter/ more than it does.","April 29, 2014","false","5.9"," 68 of 120 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","68","120","0","4"

I accidentally clicked on the wrong type of berry and poisoned myself. There was nothing I could do as my character just got sicker and sicker. With all that said, it is an extremely rewarding game once you figure out a plan to survive. Each time you last a little longer in the game feels like a vitory and the story in the background is very interesting as well. I recommend reading the newspapers.

I'm a huge fan of survival/apocalypse type games and, although I'm not too keen on permadeaths and rogue-likes, in this game, it doesn't bother me as much.  NEO Scavenger is challenging and requires a lot of conservative thought if you hope to survive as every decision, every chioce and every action you make, matters.\n\nAs of writing this, the game is still in Early Access but it is definitely playable.  My only gripe is that combat is extremely stressful (well, for me it is) and I can't help but feel that the AI cheats.  Even when I do my utmost best to hide and cover my tracks to try and avoid combat it's almost as if the enemies are psychic and always find me regardless.\n\nIn my opinion it feels more like a simulation than a game, in that, sometimes I'm not having fun.  Situations will arise where I second and third-guess every move I make and wonder if the next turn will be my last.  Sometimes I'm under so much duress I need to take a break to let my adrenaline subside.  Not that this is a bad thing, mind you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleXVI/recommended/248860/","PurpleXVI","PurpleXVI","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PurpleXVI/","535 products in account","The main problem with NEO Scavenger is, sadly, the scavenging. While there's a decent bit of good writing to be found,  you'll probably never discover it unless you edit the game files or get incredibly lucky with your scavenging rewards, as health, weariness and thirst tick down with absurd speeds, areas get tapped out of resources in no-time(meaning that setting up a camp, which is necessary unless you get ridiculously lucky finding backpacks, etc. is useless) and all your items decay with ridiculous rapidity, too.\n\nYou'll never really get to actually PLAY the game, is the thing, you'll be stuck doing nothing but grinding berries, cured meat and boiled water(which you can only get if you're lucky enough to find a saucepan), and then when you finally get enough of it to start moving somewhere... your backpack falls apart and you have to leave it all behind.\n\nBut, okay, let's say you're good at management and overcome that hurdle. Then you may find one of the twenty or so locations you can interact with beyond scavenging(in a map of thousands of hexes, and only a few of them look any different from the surrounding generic town hexes)... and whatever you do roughly has a 50% chance of instakilling you or losing you all your carried stuff.\n\nSo now, good luck, you can do all your grinding again! Hope you're lucky enough to find a saucepan early on this time around, too, or you may as well just restart.\n\nThe combat also boasts a lot of choices to make, but it boils down to either: Have a ranged weapon, keep distance, shoot shoot shoot, or have melee weapon, close distance, beat beat beat. A few of the other options might occasionally be tempting if the game gave any indication of how likely they were to succeed or not(say, percentages or odds or something) rather than just vaguely suggesting a "high" or "low" chance(what's high? 50+%? 75+%? 95+%?).\n\nLong story short: Needs more obvious mechanics, needs less busywork to pad out playtime, needs to make consequences of choices more predictable/obvious OR it needs some sort of save function. It feels like someone played FTL and A Dark Room and wanted to copy them without understanding them.","December 22, 2014","false","4.5"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","20","33","0","0"

You pick out traits to help define your character (melee, ranged, mechanic, athletic, strong etc) and can pick weaknesses as well which let you get more points on good traits as a tradeoff and allow you to try to balance unique builds. These attributes influence completely what sort of actions you'll have available to you, how you handle conflicts, crafting, trying to find shelter, heat, food and so on. They define and influence your decisions way beyond the normal str,int,con type character building.\n\n+ crafting : there is quite a complex crafting system in place that is entirely based on resources available and the traits you picked. If you find just the right ingredients in the early game to make a decent weapon or clothes you'll have a much easier time, otherwise you'll want to avoid conflicts and scavange more.\n\n+(mostly) combat : deciding whether to fight, and how to fight is very important here.. not because you fight all the time but because the stakes are high and a few bad streaks could see you left bleeding in a field far from your shelter. I like this change to slightly more realistic combat. There's no visible health bar, it's all about waiting till you get a chance to strike, wounding your opponent, and then kicking while they are down. Not particularly heroic but if you make a mistake that leaves you vulnerable and they get a hit in, they'll do the same to you. It comes down primarily to trying to get in range for your weapon, stay out of range from theirs, and defend yourself until you have an opportunity. For example, if you have a melee weapon you can try to rush them but you risk falling on your butt at which point you'd be an open target, or you can advance normally but they'll be able to back away.\n\n- combat balance: My con with this is that your weapons make all the difference and with the random nature and limited weapon types, you can either be useless in combat or feel like there was no risk. In my first play through I believe I hit a guy with a pocket knife like 20 times until he ran away after punching me and then I bled to death. In my second playthrough I tied a knife to a stick to make a spear, with a range of 3 is the longest melee weapon. And then proceeded to kill everyone that didn't have a gun without a scratch because they couldn't get near me without getting stabbed. And those with guns I could sneak on fairly easy and then once I hit them they were too wounded to fight back. It went from combat being impossible to being 'meh'.","January 2, 2015","true","3.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Each number, represents a different game from the start.\n\n1. I came out of the building, felt disoriented and not sure what to do. Something nasty came to me and attacked. I tried to defend myself but I bled out after the series of injuries.\n\n2. This time I had time to wander some more, I found some mushrooms, berries, sharpened a big stick and waited for trouble... but I froze to death.\n\n3. Shortly after I came out, the feral dog sneaked on me and attacked. I was fighing furiously with my punches, until I damaged his brain with concussions. I would have never thought that reading about the combat could be so exciting: bruises, cuts, bites, concussions, bleedings... all those details were amazing. My brain did the rest, imaging myself fighting for life with this dog. When he dropped dead, I patched up my wounds, took some painkillers and gutted him, took 2 small pieces of raw meat into my small medkit and moved along to find some clothes before I freeze to death again. I went to the city and scavenged it. I found plenty of goody goodies: crowbar with strap, binoculars with strap too!, cardboard box, cargo pants (with pockets!=more slots, yea!), T-shirt and some straps. Now, I am afraid to go out, because I don't want to loose all my treasure :( . T-shirt, cargo pants, hospistal gown on top of it all, holding crowbar in one hand and cardboard box with my treasure in the other one... time to move on. I go to the next building, I must be lucky, plenty of other  goods but I have no space to take it... First dillemma: break bottle and use it to make small campfire or leave it as a container for water later on? To hell with it... I might not live so long and I need warmth. OMFG! I had not enough points and had to end the turn, now the sun is gone... After a while it came out again, now I sit in front of a campfire, eating a cooked dog meat and think what to do next. The fire is not big enough, I move to the forest for more wood, some stranger attacks me, I try to talk to with him, he's confused but still charges at me... Time to cave his head in with the brand new crowbar. WTF!? He is some kind of a boxer! He keeps punching me and avoiding my crowbar! I cough up with blood and have got internal bleeding! After a short fight, I pass out and this guy is checking for loot on me... I wake up, beaten drastically, he retreated. MOTHERF**ER stole my cardboard box with goodies!!! I was on my way back to the camp when I have found an old car and a sleeping bag in it. Resting in the filhty but warm sleeping bag in abandoned IT office building, curing my heavy injuries, a mysterious horror creature woke me up. I had to run away, leaving my sleeping bag behind... After a while of running away, I had to go back, the cold rain has started to rain and it was a night... I know that my end is near but I keep sneaking in the dark trying to get into my warm sleeping bag... I just hope it is not sleeping in it... LMAO I threatened it with my crowbar and it ran away!!! I can't believe it!@ Sleeping, resting and healing in my precious filthy sleeping bag. After many hours, something is creeping on me once again. It's dark and we do not see each other yet, I will run away, I need some water anyways. It was a feral dog, I took some bites and I am bleeding but the dog is dead. I rest some more, take a bottle and go to look for some water, I find a small lake, drink a lot and take some with me, in a small plastic bottle.\n\nNO SAVE DATA FOUND... great... just f*cking great... Game is made in flash, so when I was cleaning my pc with ccleaner, it must have deleted some macromedia old cookies and my save file... how f*ucking hard can it be, to make seperate none-flash savegame file!?\n\n4. Tracked and killed by Merga Wraith\n\n5. - Chopped a poor fellow to death with a meat cleaver... He refused to fall back. No regrets.\n\n- WTF!? I met three bandits cooking something (I was hungry), there was also a terrified woman with a little baby in her arms. I had not a lot of options, but I think I have picked the wrong one! They have cracked her skull with a crowbar!!! " What happens next is not worth mentioning, apart from feed. You can't remember how long it's been since you have eaten that well." WTF HAVE I DONE!?\n\n- apart from all that, I am doing incredibly well. Got two shoes, nice clothes, meat cleaver to defend myself, made a campfire and cleaned some dirt rags for future needs. The only thing that bothers me is the guy with a rifle wandering around me somewhere.\n\n- ok he tried to kill me when I went to sleep! He shot at me! I took cover and now he offers to talk! Oh, no buddy I am coming to get your with my meat cleaver now! He keeps shooting and missing because I use covers, soon brand new rifle with a scope will be mine! Lmao, I chopped him to death! xD","June 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Sometimes I've just died in the first day from getting eaten alive by a pack of feral dogs that tracked me down.\n\nThe ultimate goal is staying alive while you're dragged along on the storyline.

The interplay between different systems and the really neat environment and design decisions should have made a great game.\n\nIt didn't. There's not enough content for this game to shine, and because there's so little content the problems it has are made starkly apparent. Permadeath is not an inherently good or bad decision, but what it does in a game like NEO Scavenger is force the player through the same few bits of content over and over again. That content has an optimized solution, which means the first 5-10 minutes of every play-through are doing the exact same thing, every time, with no reason or reward from deviating from it. And then you end up at one of the pieces of game content that you _did_ play before, with functionally identical choices. And then you die, fairly or unfairly (and this game _loves_ unfair deaths), and you get to do it again.\n\nA simulation game has to hide its brain to be deeply rewarding. This doesn't, and the narrative and the neat bits do not carry it through.

Then went after the stranger, got shot and I had emptied my ammo on the dogman, so we fought melee untill I realised my next move would knock me out, and be my death, so I ran at range 10, and  got away, found shelter, and promptly slept, didn't get attacked in the night, and didn't find either the dogman or stranger again. Later got sick from unclean water and died, because I decided to try and boil some water, so it wouldn't happen again.","January 28, 2015","true","80.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Every game I played started and ended the same way: I wandered around, scavenged for items, found nothing or barely anything (one game I found some pants; another, a multitool; every other game I would find a single shoe), then got attacked and killed. No matter if I tried to run or hide, I would eventually get attacked by an enemy and die. I couldn't fight, because I found no weapons. I was constantly getting sick, because I found no clothes. I'm all for games being tough, but when literally all I'm finding everywhere I go is dirty rags and plastic shopping bags, it's not fun. Maybe I'm doing something wrong and should look up strategies on how to survive, but I think games should have a minimum amount of playability without having to use outside resources, and this one doesn't, so I can't recommend it. I'm sad about that, because I followed it through Early Access and waited to play until release, really looking forward to it, but there's not holding your hand and there's not giving you any direction at all, and this game falls into the latter category for me.

If you are feeling a masochist, pick this.\n\nJokes aside, although the only control you have on you caracter is on the inventory management and choosing which actions to perform, I can assure you that this is one of the most complex survival games available in Steam. Due to it's level of difficulty, I suggest you play this on short bursts (as on the first playthroughts you won't last that long anyway :P )\n\nPROS:\n-Excellent atmosphere that absorves you into it's post-apocaliptyc setting.\n-The sound is great, from the realistic effects to the music.\n-Every choice has a consequence, even a choice as deceptevly simple as drinking a bottle of water that you just found\n-I would dare to say that the depth of the game's survival mechanics are unparalelled.\n-There is an actual main storyline to this game shall you choose to follow it.\n\nCONS:\n-It is a very difficult game. I have 6+ hours on this game by the time I am writing this, and I still take a beating every time. I tottaly understand if many people are put off by it.\n\n-The learning curve: I will be honest. This game has TONS of trial and error. Only after the first 5 playthroughs(about 2 hours of playing), you will be able to understand why you have died. From there, the game gets more satisfying, but adding to the complex interface and the fact that the game almost begs you to seek vital information (such as important crafting recipes) to the game's wiki page.\n\nHaving said that, if you are looking for a challenge, you certainly have one here. If I were to call this game by other name, it would be Bear Grylls Simulator.","December 7, 2014","true","17.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Most challenges are easily overcome if you're prepared, but the same challenges can still easily kill you if you rush in, and in most cases you only get one chance. Enemy threats are easily distinguishable on the world map, with all NPCs shown wearing the equipment they're carrying, which lets you guess at their faction, disposition, and danger level. Also, you get to kick a dogman's ♥♥♥ with your bare hands.\n\nPros:\n- Exploration\n- Meaningful consequences to choices\n- Lots of interactions and events\n- Great art\n- Traits used often and in useful ways\n\nCons:\n- Somewhat limited variety crafting system\n- Crafting slows down noticeably when carrying lots of items, and may break sometimes\n- You -will- spend a lot of time playing inventory tetris\n- Be warned, this is a permadeath game (for those who this is a con)","June 21, 2015","true","188.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But then you go to sleep and a dogman rips you to peices. 10/10 would be ripped to peices again.\n\nBut to be more serious the game is well made and the permadeath feature makes the game force you to learn from past mistakes, dying of hypothermia, getting shot to death by a bad mutha. All things that can be avoided. You live and learn in this game.\n\nThe game may be basic but offers a wide array of replay to anyone. Dont like to bash people over the head with a club then avoid mele and pick ranged or the other way arround.

It's got an interesting story, but you can ignore it and carve out your own tale if you so choose.\n\nHowever, I feel there are two problems with this game:\n\nFirstly, the world seems pretty much dead.  Except for one story location, there doesn't seem to be anyone anywhere except hostile bandits and looters who are willing to not murder you on sight if you agree to not murder them on sight.  In my opinion, the world should feel just a little bit more alive.\n\nSecondly, the game is TOO brutal.  I get that it's a roguelike and roguelikes are supposed to be tough, but there's a lot of things that, quite frankly, are full of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI once stabbed a guy with a long, pointed tree branch made into a spear.  According to the game text, I viciously stabbed his upper stomach, and according to the in-game status text, he was bleeding heavily, in shock, and on the ground.  Somehow he managed to knock me out in one punch, steal my spear and backpack, and run away before I woke up, got an infection and died.\n\nSeveral times I've started a brand new game just to not find any early game drops and freeze to death within a minute.  No hyperbole, I died within a single minute of starting a new game thanks to the RNG.  Other times I'll be walking around the game world and suddenly I've got diiarhea and I'm vomiting and my stomach hurts and I'm dead.\n\n\nDon't get me wrong, this game is loads of fun to play and you should definitely give it a try if you like roguelikes and randomly-generated game worlds, but there's a lot of things that make me scream and swear at the game when I really shouldn't be.\n\nOverall, I would indeed recommend this game.  7.8/10","January 3, 2015","true","10.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

You play as Philip Kindred, a man who has lost most of his memories after being rudely awakened from his cryogenic-sleep pod in the near future.  The game is set in post-apocalyptic Michigan, with a mix of supernatural/horror and sci-fi elements.  Overall it reminds me of Fallout 1 and 2 in terms of tone and atmosphere.\n\nSomething you should definitely be aware of before buying: Permadeath!  There is only one save slot in NEO Scavenger and when you die the game deletes the savegame, forcing you to start over.  However you can get around this fairly simply by manually backing up your savegame files after you save, so even players who don't like permadeath should still be able to enjoy NEO Scavenger if they save often and remember to back up those save files.  (I believe there is also a mod that adds multiple save slots, or that automatically backs up your save game, or something like that.  I never tried it out myself, so I can't comment on it.)\n\nNEO Scavenger is a text heavy game, and there is no narrator or voice acting.  Talking with friendly NPCs and fighting hostile ones both involve plenty of text.  Not that the game doesn't have a good UI too, but the lore and details of the game are all conveyed through text.\n\nSpeaking of which, the story of the game is told rather subtly, which I like but some people might not.  You'll have to search for clues to who you are and what's going on in the world.  Talking to NPCs, investigating strange locations, even simply finding and reading ancient newspaper article could tell you something important about the world of NEO Scavenger.  My point is you are going to have to really explore the game to uncover the plot.\n\nThere is an end to the story after which you cannot keep playing, but the game is pretty clear that going to that area is a fairly big deal and you are never forced to do so.\n\nOne of my favorite ways NEO Scavenger tells you about the world (and lets you tell the game what sort of person 'your' Philip Kindred is) is through random events.  These events will pop up occasionally as you explore the map, present you with a situation/problem, and a number of choices to deal with said situation/problem.  They're a bit like a single-page Choose-Your-Own-Adventure games.  Though sometimes a bad choice can get you eaten, so keep what I said about backing up your saves in mind if you dislike permadeath.  I've found several dozen of them so far and the choices and their outcomes are generally very satisfying.  There was one that actually let me ask for more information before deciding whether to help a slightly suspicious person, which is something I've often lamented a lack of in other games.\n\nThere's also a small modding scene, despite the lack of Steam Workshop support (flash and steam don't work well together apparently).  Check out the forums of the Blue Bottle Games website or Nexus mods for those.\n\nFinally, I just want to mention that the actual total hours I've played this game are at least twice of what Steam says it is.  This is because I bought the game through the developers website and generally play the version I downloaded there.  Speaking of which. if you do decide you want to buy the full game, you can get NEO Scavenger DRM free on Good Old Games, or directly through the Blue Bottle Games website.","December 28, 2014","true","98.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, I got drunk one night and impulsively hit 'buy'. So now I have it, and I like it enough to give a review, which I don't usually do.\n\nNEO is brutal. This isn't the type of game where you play the ultra-altruistic "Hero" that saves everybody and looks good doing it. You'll live a lot longer if you take the attitude of "desperate homeless guy that doesn't want to get involved in your ♥♥♥♥".\n\nWhen you die, it's over. No going back to a previous save. You just start over from scratch.\n\nThe learning curve is a little bit steep, but so rewarding once you get there. My first several hours I went through at least half a dozen deaths. I learned to avoid fights. To clean my wounds before bandaging them. I learned to not ever eat yellow berries. I rage quit twice. I came back twice.\n\nNow, I've got a rifle (with ELEVEN bullets!), a warm coat and enough clean water to last me a week. I'm unstoppable, king of all there is in this wasteland.\n\nExcept that I'm not. I still run away from everything that moves, I only camp in secluded buildings, diligently cover my tracks behind me and always keep an eye over my shoulder.\n\nAnd that's how it should be. I survived for this long because I learned how to live in the wasteland. I didn't get a bunch of XP from slaughtering hundreds of enemies and then suddenly become immune to a bullet to the brainpan.\n\nThat's what I love about this game. The "XP" is your own damn brain. Learning how to craft the things you need. How to avoid those looters in the distance. Knowing that I've gotten as far as I have by not making mistakes.\n\nNEO has an outrageous amount of complexity that you would never know exists until you go looking for it. If you're on the fence, just buy it. Well worth the money spent.\n\nOne last tip: If you're new, take botany. Makes the game a little more forgiving since you won't really have to worry about food & drink.\n","August 10, 2015","true","60.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The problem with the game is that it is ridiculously chance derived and geared towards grinding. Yes I understand it is a "rogue like game" but it takes the worst elements of rogue like and runs under them with a banner off a cliff. Practically the only way to play this game for more then a few minutes is by save scumming through it but even with that its so tedious and repetitive that the novelty  behind this game wears off fast. The story-line is almost nonexistent and is stringed out like a carrot on a stick. Its sad because I want to like this game. It has all of the essential qualities of being an amazing game and had the developers spent a little more time working on it then this would have been one of my favorite games. Sadly they didn't spend the extra time and this is just kind of a mediocre game that has some cool ideas behind it that aren't fully developed.","February 12, 2015","false","75.1"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","16","29","0","0"

It relies heavily on your own imagination which, in my opinion, makes it that much more powerful.  It is one of the only games that captures the bleakness and terror of the situation.  One moment you're strutting along with a shotgun in hand, a smile on your face, and the next, you're panicking because you drank contaminated water.

Then you finish him with 5 kicks to the face while the NPC is on the ground. Also giving him a concussion and eventullay dieing from blood loss.

Of course, I'm not trying to encourage a higher price, I'm just thanking Daniel for his reasonable pricing. (Take that Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes)\n\nI can't recommend this enough. After getting the game I sunk a ridiculous amount of time into it in a single weekend. I recommend starting off completely blind. No wikis. No gameplay videos. Just jump in. After dying horribly a few times, you can begin checking a few things out from the wiki. OH and I URGE you to read all the messages at the bottom of the screen during combat (you can click the box to expand). Then just let your imagination fly and get all the horribly violent moments carved deep into your brains. If your imagination is anything like mine, you're gonna find this game to be one of the most ruthlessly violent games you've played and it doesn't even graphically show you any of the scenes.\n\nNow, I understand this is not a game for everyone. If you don't enjoy reading a lot of text, that is not a reason to stay away. You don't have to read any of it. But if you don't enjoy slow paced, the original Fallout-like games with survival and tension, you might as well stay away. But if you know someone who likes that kind of stuff, please, tell them about NEO Scavenger.","April 10, 2014","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Here we go! Review 2.0\n\nBUY IT NOW!\n\nPROS...\n- More in-depth than any other post-apocolypse (if that's how you spell it XD) survival games I have ever played.\n- Kinda funny predicaments (again, can't spell) like hopelessly running from a "Mega Wraith" (you'll understand once you see it) until you pass out and get your head LITTERALLY CRUSHED by it\n- Story is not nessecary. Really, you can just jump in, not read anything and still have a good time. Great for when you don't have a lot of time to spend\n- Addicting. Beacuse you die so much *see CONS* you constantly have that Flappy-Bird-ish "The next life will be better" mentality\n\nCONS...\n- More expensive than I would like but maybe thats just me\n- Still in early access so there are occasional bugs (which I still haven't found) and some item combos that arent there.\n- Really hard. Since it's randomly generated, it takes a whole lot of luck to not die beofore you can even\n- Too much cussing in the main story. Remember that this is an indie game so there aren't the same standards as some other titles. BUT REALLY! I warn you that there is a sence were every 3 words (yes I counted) they drop the F-bomb.\n\n\nOverall, it's a great game and deserves to be played. At least try the demo to get a taste of what the core of it really is.\n\n30phil1 wrote a review\n30phil1 posted the review\n30phil1 played NEO Scavenger\n30phil1's head was crushed by Mega Wraith's grasp\n30phil1 died of trumatic brain injury\n*End Turn*","January 21, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What at first seemed a little interesting survival game turned out to be a massive and addictive experience, with the most detailed survival mechanics you've ever seen (except maybe Project Zomboid).\n\nIn NEO Scavenger, death is considered a sure thing, the question is how long you will last for. Survive the cold, survive the wounds. Survive the infection, survive the unboiled water you were forced to drink because you had no way to make a fire. Survive the blisters you got because you hadn't found boots yet, while a dogman chases you. Survive the poisoning you got eating unidentified mushrooms. And worst of all, survive the people (NPCs) who want what you've managed to gather.\n\nThe world has unique lore, setting a post-apocalyptic world with paranormal phenomenons happening left and right, but extremely well presented, gradually giving you the information, which is spread through conversations, pieces of newspapers and others.\n\nThe atmosphere is similar(ly angsty) to those of Dark Souls, or EVE online, but more personal and centered around the desperate situation your character wakes up into, like Spec Ops: The Line.\n\nThe combat is quite simple and brutal: He who connects the first hit usually wins. This enforces a visceral and all-or-nothing mindset, with no place for holding resources back, and a "shoot first, ask questions later" policy that makes you question your own acts as a player.\n\nBoth combat and map gameplay are turn-based, and reward thinking carefully about your next move, since the game works with permanent iron man mode (dying deletes the save file) to ensure that you're adequately kept on your toes.\n\nOverall, this is the best survival game I've ever played, and definitely the best one-man-made game out there:\n10/10","December 19, 2014","true","224.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is quite a lot to explore, although the game could have a lot more content than it's having. However considering that it's not a big project and not many people are working on it, it's understandable.\n\nStill, the price is quite high for what you get.

There is always something to discover, something to scare you or something to kill you. After countless deaths by ghosts, dogmen, cannibals and once because of very bad diarrhea, I still come back to the game, trying out different skill combination. The semi-random layout of the map (random scavange locations + fixed special locations), there is always an insentive to explore and see the world. Random encounters make every venture to a city that much more interessting.\nThe slow pace of the game is perfect for people who want to take it slow, or like me, need time to actually figure out what they want to do. Combat is also refreshingly slow, gives you time to think over your moves and select the best option at the given moment (will you headbutt your opponent or dodge his next attack, hoping he will be vulnerable to counter attack).\nI hope the game evolves in the same way, presenting us with more dangerous creatures that stalk you in the night and more unique places that make you sit for a moment and carefully choose your next action, because permadeath is never that far away.","April 1, 2014","true","46.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not a single one has captivated me in such a short time as NEO Scavenger. This game's exterior is rather simple, but once you get in and start playing, you will no doubt be in awe of the depth of its mechanics. The amount of freedom in the choices you can make, and how they affect you living or dying (sometimes terribly...) is unprecedented. Almost everything you could think of doing in order to survive in a post-apocalyptic world is in some way built into this game. and it not even finished yet!

A lot of people might say something along the lines of ".. but the graphics aren't great at all.." and thats okay. But what this game lacks in graphics, it more than makes up for in the mechanics and detail.\n\nIt will suck you in, probably even make you mad a little bit, but thats the beauty of it! NEO Scavanger tests your wits and your patience. Your cunning and intellect. Crafting is a huge part of the game. You have to gather supplies and build shelter and weapons, tools and clothes, hunt deer and trap squirrels. Wasteland raiders and looters roam the countryside, so watch out! You can get inflicted with a crap ton of bad status ailments such as Hypothermia, Sephis, infections, concussions, starvation, dehydration, poison, internal bleeding, and much... MUCH more! It is very challenging and makes you think about EVERY move before you make it!\n\nLook... even if you know you don't want to spend the money to buy it (which is still only $10), it is at least worth DLing the demo.

It's not about grinding, leveling up or anything like that. It's far more of a roguelike survival simulation. Only unlike Waywards island sim this game is more akin to the movie The Road or th S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.\n\nIt's desperateand meaningful combat involves you sneaking around, pulling people down, parrying, stabbing, swinging and doing everything you can to win. While a win feels great, the person you're facing is often in the same shoes as you.\n\nAs for graphics everything is nicely drawn. Icons are easy to see and understand, the world is big but easy to navigate, the hand drawn figures range from average to awesome. It's not the best looking game but it's got a gritty atmosphere about it and it works great with the music.\n\nAs for the sim part, this game just shines. Plastic bags will rip and you'll lose items, certain items can't be put into shopping carts because of the wholes in the frame, you'll be dumping pills out of small pill containers and putting them into larger ones so you can carry more.\n\nFor a turn based game played on a hex grid, this is game can really get to you. I definitely suggest picking it up.","December 8, 2013","true","9.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Although brutal from the start (I survived 3 hours my first playthrough), the more you play this game and the more time you devote to figuring out what skills/items/reactions will help you survive depending on the given situation (Hint: run) the more satisfying it is when you reach the point of gun-toting, berry-eating, sleeping-bag-sleeping, Dogman slaying badass, ONLY to die of diarrhea (RIP colon). And in the total stupor of "how did... that... why?" begin another playthrough and start the whole brutal endeavor all over again- BUT this time ready to defeat the mutated Detroit Diarrhea of the future with the knowledge gleaned from your frothy death (Hint #2: boil your damn water). Excellent! Fine! Stupendous! Here we go again! Thanks to procedurally generated environments, the game feels fresh every time you restart it. New buildings to scavenge, new bandits to hoot and holler at, and the realization that the best weapon of all in this game isn't your .308 rifle with 2 bullets, but simply the knowhow to just run the hell away and live another night.

I haven't played many like it, and certainly not any that I have enjoyed as much. It's a complicatedly simple game. It nearly masters survival against the elements, finding and cleaning water to drink, gathering plants for food or beating a deer to death with your bare hands for food.\n\nIt's style will put a lot of people off. It is a text game at it's descriptive and story core, something I am absolutely fine with, coupled with a hex based pixelated landscape. The controls are entirely mouse based or a combination of mouse and keyboard, and while it can seem strange and complex at first, a few playthroughs and you'll master them.\n\nAnother thing that will put people off is it's genre. It is that, no common, "rouge-like." When you die, you're kaput for good, and you start another play through. I liken it to Faster Than Light, in that aspect. Not just for it's art style and rouge-likeness, but for how you can upgrade your character, or ship/crew in FTL, and progress in the story only to die horrbily.\n\nOne great thing about NEO Scavenger is it's story. What is its story? I can tell you that you play as Philip Kindred who, after some odd years of cryo-stasis, wakes up in a world vastly different from what used to be. Kindred doesn't know that, of course, since he's conviently lost his memory. That's what you learn at the start, and that's where the story can end for you.\n\nYou can spend all of your time in NEO Scavenger simply getting better loot and surviving for as long as possible. The only way to advance the story is to seek it out activly. On the surface, it's a great survival rouge-like, but under the surface lies a vast and complex story filled with multiple branches, characters, challenges, and intrigue. There is an ending to the game. I didn't even know there was one, and I've been playing since early access. Honestly, I die or screw up before I make it far in the story.\n\nThe storytelling is all driven by you. You see a strange glow at night, follow it for a few days, and suddenly you find yourself surounded by life at the Detriot Mega City. What is this strange DMC? Ask some people, read some newpaper scraps you find while scavenging. Or don't. Go somewhere else, advance the story in a different way. I've found three ways you can "start" the story, and all of them require you to think and act proactivly.\n\nThe enemies and lore behind them is also great. I won't spoil what they are, but this game is supposed to be a realistic survival sim-like thing while also having deep roots in the supernatural. If you wonder to yourself," Oh my god, what the hell is that creature from the bowels of my worst nightmares," then google it and you'll likely find an real urban legend from Michigan that the enemy was based on.\n\nNEO Scavenger is one of the best games in existence, in my opinion. Unlike a lot of other games, it has a demo! If you're on the fence, play the demo. If you think you like it, buy it without a doubt and get into it. I don't rate games, but for the sake of this review, I give it a 9.5/10. Why a 9.5, you ask. Because I'm super biased about this game, but I admit it's not perfect.\n\nSo go play the demo, fall in love, and buy this game. Throw yourself full heartedly into the world and lore that surrounds NEO Scavenger. Explore the DMC, find awesome old-world loot, investigate strange amusement parks, derilect cities, and even face otherworldly horrors in the pursuit of Philip Kindred's epic story.\n\nOr don't. It's up to you, but be warned: you'll likely freeze do death anyway. Seriously, Michigan is cold and it rains a lot. I'm talking ALL the time. ♥♥♥♥ rain.\n\nOh, and go ahead, take off that talisman. Seriously, it's no big deal.\n\nJust don't lose it. Ever.\n","August 25, 2015","true","89.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Hunger sets in if you don't consume food, you can die from dehydration, freeze to death, bleed to death, die from infection and poison; the odds are stacked against you. However, the same goes for everyone else in Neo Scavenger, as well. It isn't like other games, where they severly penalize you but the conditions does not effect the enemy. Far from it, scavengers you find along the way can bleed to their demise and freeze and perish in the cold if they have no clothing, just like the way you can in the given conditions.\n\n\nIf you pick this game up, be prepared to scream at times, and die countless more. Each death comes with learning to play better, and the learning curve is extremely steep. This game is literally based on Marxism, and it truly is a brutal, unforgiving atmosphere. Do not underestimate the enemy, and if you encounter two or more at once, do not be frugal. It's better to use that ammunition and live another day, than die and start over.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FingersCut/recommended/248860/","FingersCut","Fingers-Cut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FingersCut/","573 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNEO Scavenger now has my full recommendation.\n\nThis game has some deep tactical roots to it. A turned based rogue-like where you start off in the most startling position of weakness I could possibly imagine. “Scavenger” is the name of the game but this key aspect and function serves as a means to an end, and that end is survival.\n\nYou wake up in a cryogenic facility with nothing of use but a hospital gown, medical bracelet. You're soon attacked by a supernatural creature, setting the tone for the brutal reality of survival, which seems to be the biggest note of the game. Notice I didn’t mention any shoes or memories. You’re barefoot and it’s autumn. No way to go through life in my humble opinion. I guess there’s a story about finding your identity or finding out what happened to the world.\n\nSounds interesting, right? Like “28 Days Later” meets “DayZ”. I couldn’t tell you, because basically I’ve spent my hours just trying to survive against... get ready for it...\n\nStarvation. Food is scarce. I once savored a small packet of crackers for sustenance. I recently died trying to hunt a dangerous creature in what felt like a very realistic and thought out exchange in combat.\n\nHydration. Water is not as scarce, but takes up storage space and the effects of dehydration can onset quickly leaving you weaker to take on the rigors of survival and ultimately lead to death.\n\nHypothermia. It always seems cold and rainy. One play-through I traveled west for 12 hours and died of hypothermia desperately trying to find some degree of shelter or warmth.\n\nBrain damage and severe blood loss. Some people seem to be opportunists in this new and horrifying setting, attacking you on sight. You can try to reason with them or beat them to death or submission. Either way combat has to be dealt with or avoided one way or another. There are also inhumane beasts, such as the dogman who(that?) recently severed an artery in my leg, taking a fluke victory in what was described to me as brutal combat.\n\nThe turned based combat plays out very interestingly, giving you often unique choices based on your surroundings, tools and skill set. In addition to normal attacks with your weaponry you often have different tactical options in a fight, like a trip or a head-butt. Leaving your opponent stunned and vulnerable is a key to winning conflicts and staying healthy.\n\nWounds need attention and in a very animalistic way you need to learn that just because you can best a being in mortal combat it doesn’t necessarily mean he can be your prey.  The spoils of war are all well and good but damn well better be worth the cost of an open wound or wounded limb.\nLuckily there seems to be a wide array of technology, pharmaceuticals and med-kits to be found in your mysterious surroundings, everything seems to have something more to it. There's a vast world of crafting, trapping and other skills I've only touched the surface of. Hacking with a laptop can be far more effective than hacking with a cleaver.\n\nStorage plays as big of a roll as anything I have mentioned thus far. I really enjoy the vast inventory options and the various challenges that arrive. The tools available to you in moving your life supporting cargo are just as varied. Plastic bags can be used as a light and spacious backpack but they quickly deteriorate under such use, a true backpack can handle much more rigors. Sleds can be used to drag your sleeping bag and other supplies but is outclassed by a modified shopping cart as a vehicle.\n\nLight sources can play a big part in safe scavenging, night time or not. Lighters run out of butane though, and flashlights need batteries. You often consume some of your items durability upon use as you scavenge for that rare useful weapon and equally sparse ammunition.\n\nThere are some hiccups in this surprisingly immersive experience, like a lack of a local leaderboard and tracking or rating of your statistics and progress. The game doesn’t seem to integrate with windows well on start-up, but this is easily fixable in the settings. The aural potential of this game seems unrealized and the atmospheric tune that plays throughout doesn’t do enough for me. The lack of sound just about the only thing holding me back from having a more immersed experience.\n\nThe slightly crude graphics and the fact that it is a Java game may be off putting to some, but those willing to look past the amateur feel will be rewarded with a view into this game’s deep, brutal, intelligent soul. The sense and reality of a true, terrifying post-apocalyptic survival setting seems fully represented. Made by Blue Bottle Games, which from what I can tell is just one dude, this frisky indie title feels like a true labor of love towards the bleak reality of our impending doom.\n\n8.5/10","March 29, 2014","true","19.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The user interface is not exactly intuitive, and the graphics are nice but a bit retro.\n\nIf you overcome these initial scepticisms though, what you'll find is a game that is a mixture of "A dark room" (minus the initial set-up phase), "Minecraft" (minus the blocky 3d graphics) and any Rougelike (so expect to die frequently).\n\nThe basic setup is always the same: you wake up in some kind of cryo-lab, and the world outside has turned into a post-apocalyptic dystopia similar to "The Walking Dead" or "28 Days Later".\n\nYou have to find out about your own past and uncover the secret of what happened to the world.\n\nYou walk around the landscape on hex-grids, scavenging the woods or the remains of long-gone cities for clothes, food, water and weapons, while avoiding (at least initially) other NPCs or animals, most of which want to see you dead. You can craft things together with recipes you find scattered around randomly, and from time to time you find pieces of newspapers which tell you a bit about what has happened.\n\nThe environment is highly dynamic, you have different weather patterns which impact your sight (when you find a scope or binoculars, you can even increase your visible range), and many other scavengers are roaming the area on their own (one nice example: I once found a corpse, looted it and moved his stuff into my hideout, just to find him chopped to bits of meat when I came back the next day... and of course the killer was not far off and killed me a few minutes later...)\n\nThe story unfolds bit by bit (you have to survive the first night to even get an idea on where you should be moving), and even though I not yet come very far in the story yet (did I mention it is very easy to die in this game?) it is a game I will keep on coming back for "just one more try..."\n\nThe only downside (IMHO) is that there is no way of saving the game (except for the "save&quit" function), so every death is permanent. And since it's written in Flash there's no easy way of getting the save data out for bakup purposes. But that just shows that it's a real Roguelike at heart...","November 23, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This update makes it so much better, gives a better balance to the beginning skills and some thing alittle bit less noticable is the beginning area is now dotted with more cities and towns which really increase your chances of finding some cloths or a backpack which are damnedfully welcomed. Now these changes do make the game slightly easier but hell this was probably the hardest game I own in my library. Now it's only the hardest game I own still. Lemme say how hard this bloody game is, it's harder than probably all the Darksoul bosses put in to one fight. I mean the environment will kill you, if a Bad Motha doesn't beat your brains out while you sleep, or the infamous shadow that just makes you explode basically.\n\nEven for a early access game I must be honest I feel like I'm getting a full game that is complete. I rarely find bugs, or any imbalaces. The Dev does a AAA job of keeping up with the community and the game. I've had a few early access games and by far this Dev really takes care of this game, like all devs should.\n\nSo if you're a fan of Hexagon RPG, Survival, Mystery, Action, Adventure, Strategy, Turnbased Fun... or even one of those applies to you, I'd highly recommend getting this game.\n\nFor $10 you honestly cannot go wrong with this game.\n\n10/10 Would get stoned to death again.","November 14, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sneak around scavenging for clothing, weapons... craft those bits of junk into something useable. Then go out again - you'll still get killed, but perhaps less often. This is a game of learning and trial & error. You will learn as you die. And you will learn as you survive. Its something of a slow burner. You WILL come back to it after a period of frustration. It'll sit there somewhere in your mind, suggesting you have another go - maybe this time...\n\nPermadeath has to be in the game or would essentially ruin the story, and essentially this is the driving force - this game can be replayed with different information based on your skillset - perhaps some things that would be hidden would be revealed.\n\nI feel some things that need improving - crafting for example is good, but would be best if it remembered every combination you'd come up with from previous games (rather like the old son of in the old rogue type games. This has some previous recipes but not many, and trying to remember them all yourself is absurd.\n\nAlso something that (I think) needs changing to a degree is the way loot is calculated - many times you can obtain a hoard from scavenging with almost no chance to gain anything, but then you can repeatedly find nothing when you have a good chance. Certain skills improve or reduce this, but I think too much in some cases.\n\nBasically here is a potentially good game, which needs many more refinements before it can really be considered complete.\n\nI enjoy this sort of game, but I really wonder if I'm actually anything better than totally rubbish at them. The fact is that despite any faults - any time you have what you deem to be a completely unfair death or when you were just starting to do well for once then along comes... a big nasty monster... at least you have the knowledge of what doesnt work next time, or a different skill to pick - maybe you'll endure the early multitude of deaths and finish the game - perhaps I really am rubbish at it, maybe it (the game) needs balancing, or maybe it always will be just a tad too hard.\n\nIn conclusion:\nI'd play it more if I didnt die as often, if I got to see slightly more of the story.\n\nAll too often you go through the initial stages then die in a low level battle.

Its a very very good game. This is the first and possibly only review I have ever been compelled to write on steam and its something to be said for the quality of this game that I want to save this game for me and not put it in my discard pile.\n\nI hesitated about giving this a yes review for the reason that there is no save function.  I get what you are trying to do with death being death however after spending over one hundred hours and near twenty or thirty attempts just to get as far as the gate of detroit (once)... in the last three cases doing nothing but hunting and hiding in a forest making leather armour (mod?) for nigh on twenty hours of play time only to be slaughtered by two dog men half an hour after setting out for the city then doing the same thing in another game, spending this time ten hours (of real life time)  in a forest making leather armour only to be slaughtered by three men as soon as I left the forest not even being able to run away and then doing the same thing, ten hours in a forest hunting and making armour,  only to be slaughtered while I slept without even waking up even though I had multiple noise traps in place.  Then I tried cheating using a mod to add every skill but it had lost its charm because of this becoming too easy.  I dont want a walkthough,  want a hard playthrough but please not a hundred of them, I dont have the time.\n\nI have stopped playing this game because I dont have this sort of time to spend to get no where in a game.  I choose not to play again to try and get somewhere in the plot only then to later get slaughtered having spent a hundred hours progressing the plot and have to start all over again.  I want to play it through and I commend you for having this idea to have this "when your dead your dead" idea but I actually have a real life to survive in and I simply dont have time to spend too much of it locked into this game.\n\nYes, have an Iron man mode for the realism of the survival aspect of the game, but until there is a save function I will not be returning to this game.  I recommend this game to anyone who has a hundred hours to spend just to get out of the starting blocks.\n\nEDIT... I have changed this from NO to YES to NO to YES... Its too good not to reccomend.  And... then... I started another game... Dan... I hate you... I love you... I hate you... I love you... please add an iron man function your driving me insane.","November 12, 2014","true","115.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to watch what you eat and drink, make sure you’re clothed properly, and as the title suggest, scavenge the world for supplies and materials. Every time you play it's different, and it can come down to skill and some luck. There are interesting skills that provide you with a variety of crafting options that may otherwise be unavailable, or perks such as the ability to find more loot, get better information on your medical state, or craft certain items. Pretty good story (although I haven't gotten very far because I die a lot :D) Highly recommend to anyone who is into more hardcore survival games.

I recommend it to anyone who wants a turn-based hex RPG. Set in a post-apocolyptic Lovecraftian Michigan, your character emerges from a crygenic vat to step into a race against time. You can die from dehydration, starvation, disease  and hypothermia, in addition to wounds inflicted by the various denizens surrounding the Motor City's wastelands.\n\nThis hard setting is further amplified by the decision not to include a leveling system. Each time you play, you learn more about the game mechanics and possibilities. You can augment your character with four of a dozen advantages, as well as about six disadvantages. Thes combination of these influence your play style, as some opportunities only present themselves to those with a given trait.\n\nFor those who love to play first-person shooter "RPG" as murder hobos, this is not the game for you. It is more reminiscent of games from the late 1980s and early 1990s in that it tells its story in a piecemeal fashion with only one Rouge-like save option. While you can engage in combat, you will frequently die. Stealth, scavanging and crafting reveal much more of the story, and further contribute to the desperation as you try to unravel not only how you came to be cycled out of the cryogenics tank, but also what happened to create this near-future landscape.\n\nExpect to die a lot.

I would always play Zork in a huddle with friends, but I was always the only one to beat it.  This led me to be fully engrossed in text based games for years to come.  NEO Scavenger takes text heavy elements that remind me of Zork.  These come into play during the small, but quite enjoyable narrative that the player builds into their game.  The exploration and post-apocalyptic atmosphere also brought back memories of Fallout, but much more serious.  This is by no means a bad thing though because players want a very realistic experience, full of imagery, when playing a text heavy game.  This realism is also extremely prevalent during combat with so many options to choose from depending on skills, gear, etc.  However skills and gear can also heavily limit combat.  This helps the player get a feeling for their character better when role-playing a smart, but incredibly weak character.  This game gets a 9/10 from me because even though it's in my list of personal favorites, it has some faults that limit the game.  These are noticeable if too many mistakes are made on a run, lack of devotion causing boredom, or the always prevalent difficulty curve of rogue-likes.  However, I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of these minor issues, due to the shear number of appealing qualities this game holds that a vast majority of gamers, looking for a new flavored splash of adventure in their games, can enjoy.","October 27, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Since stalker: call of pripyat I felt kind of left in the bench, but Neo scavenger totaly have potential for it! It feels like actual surviving, having to find food, clothes, shelter, water, tools, weapons, decide if you run or fight in an encounter, craft things etc. every mistakes can be paid the high price, the global experience is impressively convincing!\n\nThe game's really hard tho, I keep dying in so many different ways, which is great as surviving shouldn't be easy, but the permadeath makes it really hard on the player, you barely start to get some good stuffs and die to start from the beghining again. It's really frustrating, but the difficulty of the game make it so deliciously painful ^^\n\nThe game is still on developement so criticizing is probably prematured, but i'd like to signal that the rarity and price of ammunitions makes it unworthy to equip anything else than melee weapons, also (maybe it's a bug) when the cart broke i lost all my stuffs inside on many occasions, which doesn't make sens, as if the cart broke the stuffs shouldn't just disapear and be on the ground for me to save what i can... And last thing, the food/water mechanism isn't really logic, as you'll starve almost as fast as you'll get dehydrated, eating 50kg of berries will feed you for barely a few hours and they're pretty hard to find when you need them.\n\nHere's a few thing I'd love to see implemented/improved, hopefully devs would read it (who knows ^^) and find some indeas interesting, also maybe some things i suggest here are allready in the game/planed and I haven't found out yet, sorry if it happen:\n\n-Ability to cancel last action, as sometime i click on the wrong square or make mistakes while crafting.\n\n-Fixing the strarvation system: human body can last over 40 days without food, it doesn't make sense to die from starvation after barely 2 days. Maybe splitting "well fed" with "hungry" and "bulk", where "hungry" would affect your action points, fight capability, scavenging ability etc. While "bulk" would be your global "well fed" status, going from overweight (which inflict handicap), to anorexic which make "hunger" constantly low and starvation deadly. Also the meat spoils really fast, i'm not sure if it's unrealistic but why not some ways to make it last longer, like an hermetic bag, lunch boxes, thermal backpack or something.\n\n-The combat interface is pretty hard to understand, sometime i just get attacked out of nowhere while sleeping (which is pretty cool), but the guy turns out to be badly stuffed and wreck me out in couple hits, leaving me no other option than crie while watching my character die in horrible pain. Maybe something signaling the global risk of the oponent and/or chances of successfull attacks, dodges, escapes etc. Just so we know if we can try a fight or just drop all our ♥♥♥♥♥ out and run the hell away.\n\n-How can't a medic + botanic find some antidotes in forests? I keep dying from poisoning without having any chance of reaching the clinic. Also, items in general lacks a description of their effects as well as statuses leave you wondering how to fix them i'd like to have a hint of what everything does or need to be fixed (for ex: antibiotics: can heal X, or dissentry: can be healed with X).\n\n-When crafting, have a picture of each craftable item in the recipes list, this would ease a lot the recipe's browsing.\n\n-Pliz, just pliz, more ammunitions, I gave up using any weapon as i take hours to find only 3 bullets, and allways for the one weapon you don't have, i love to shoot things, but in a week of playing I had the chance to do so about 3 times only.\n\n-I would LOVE to be able to fix items, for example taking parts of one gun to fix another gun, it makes a lot of sense and have been seen in many crafting/rogue-like games (such as fallout or 7days to die), I really love that feature as you don't waste good finds (like guns, backpacks, carts etc...) just because you allready have one that's in a barely better condition.\n\n-More shopz! there is only one shop, and it's near town which mean if you want to farm cash, buy ammunitions, buy food etc. You'll have to go all the way there, across that lifeless desert of empty buildings and rude people that won't let you kill and eat them, I died a LOT starving just trying to reach it, why not itinerant sellers or random shops in some ruins?\n\n-Ability to settle. I mean it's a surviving game, greatly done, but you can't make you home anywhere, why not the ability to choose a place to fortify, stock food, make confortable shelter, medical supplies, and (why not) working benches that allows you to fix things, craft more, that require tools to enable some special crafts etc.\n\n-Definitly more scavenging places, and more specifics ones, like pharmacies, gunshops, supermarkets, factories... We all love those.\n\n-Reinforce the "friendly encounters" potential, right now it's mostly neutral/ennemy, maybe we could meet some people that help us, offer trades, indicate to locations etc.\n\n-The ability to loot money from innocent victi... people i killed in legitimate defense, I mean there is money in the game, how come no one carry any?\n\n-More weapons and more craftability in weapons, like the ability to upgrade a rifle (kind of like in stalker, i really loved that feature) to make it more deadly. Also the ability to craft bullets would be nice.\n\n-Skill learning, I don't get why there is so much slots available while you can't chose more than 5 to about 8 skills, i get it for the start, but then i'd like to have a way to learn new skills ingame after a while.\n\n-Even biger map. I know this one is huge allready, but in the end there's nothing but one city and the start facility (plus the ruins of course) I'd love to see more special places, more terrains, more climates... more surprises!\n\n-More hunting potential, I managed to kill a dear once, but with no ammunitions and no way to come near them and oneshot them, it's really hard to get any, so the moral choice of rather eating or not human flesh become a rethorical question: you just can't survive without your daily bad mutha's barbecue, I'd like to play it "nice guy" sometime and eat only berries and animal meat, but it need more dears and squirels, and even bunnies, rats, birds etc.. Traps also are underated, we should be able to put one in the forest and come back later to see if it caught something.\n\n-Maps markers, like if i have to drop my loot for some reason, I can mark the place to come back later, this could combine with the previous traps comment to know where you had put a trap, and make you come back to check them before your catch get stolen (by a thief or another animal) or spoils.\n\n-More detailed medicinal interraction: risks of local wound infection (that can turn to septisemia of not cured), specific intervention required (tools needed to pull out an arrow, suturation, hemoragy, broken bones etc.)\n\n-Difficulty choice/save game, as it's pretty frustrating to start all over everytime you die, i'd personnally like to be able to save my games at some points, maybe make it hard like having to find a saving location in the map etc.  An alternative would be to propose 2 game modes: hardcore (permadeath) and softcore (respaw with penalties).\n\n-Zombies, lol joke, the game is allready great, it doesn't even need zombies (i'm not sure some zombie-like creatures would ruin it tho).\n\nThat's about all I can think of right now, but anyway the game rocks! I really hope you guys will push it to the best of it's potential, and for the players still hesitating: go for it! It's worth every penny!","April 4, 2014","true","118.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also the game makes real use of the character skills, just like in old school RPG's - ain't got melee skill? Well, ain't gonna craft the best melee weapons, for example.\n\nAs it is some kind of rouge like, there's no saving to be safe, it's just go for it and hope that you won't mess up, which leads to some pretty frustrating moments but also is part of the addictive character of the game. Closed the game more then one time during my 15 ingame hours but came back every time to start a new character.\n\nThe combat system is kind of strange in the first few tries but as soon as you get the hang of it, it is really fun. It works turn based and you choose your actions as the enemies choose theirs, after that the outcome is shown in a textfield with lots of pretty brutal stuff, from arrows to the knee to wolffangs to your face.\n\nThe graphic is not up to date, instead it is real outdated but this game is not about graphics, it's about imagination. Many encounters contain lots and lots of written text (remember Fallout 1/2 or Baldurs Gate conversations? - you won't find those conversations but massive ambient text).\n\nFeatures:\n- nice ambient text\n- great crafting system, starting from making glas shards out of bottles over crafting armor from hides and furs to upgrade weapons with scopes for example\n- huge bunch of neat items with degeneration\n- deep skillsystem with skills giving options on encounters (but skills are chosen on character creation and can't be trained)\n- big range of enemies starting from cannibal gangs over strange mutants up to paramilitary townguards (if you decide to attack them)\n- extensive character needs, from hunger and thirst over induced pain to warmth (yes, you can freeze and expect to do so often in the beginning)\n-rouge like: saving only by leaving the game, a dead character stays dead but a nice little statistic when died shows some of the players accomplishments\n- one of the most stable early access games I've ever played with a range of features and stuff that outruns some released games by far\n- big, randomly created (open) world with some points of interest\n- devs active on steam forum\n\nIf you like challenging games which are more about ambient then shiny graphics, show those devs some love and give it a try (there's also a demo which I highly recommend to play to be sure this kind of game suites you).","September 6, 2014","true","30.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is really difficult yet it manages to make the experience fun. And when I say difficult I mean difficult, it's not a question of if you will die, it's more of a question WHEN will you die.\n\nYou start in a cryo facility completely nude, save for a hospital gown. This is a problem because un-like other survival games the temperature is a very important part of the game. If you're not wearing multiple layers of shirts as well as pants and shoes you will freeze to death minutes after you start.\n\nThe health system is really neat. It requires you to bandage each individual cut you receive. There are also injuries like broken bones that are severely crippling because of how little room you are given to carry things. The inventory system gives you a couple options: Carry it in your hands or if you have a backpack you can put it in there. Aside from that you can put things in your pants. However not even the largest backpack gives you a ton of room so every limb needs to be functioning for you to survive. There is also a range of illness that you can catch. They can be related to the cold, an infection from a cut, drinking/eating tainted water and food (respectively), and a whole host of other diseases that I've yet to experience.\n\nTL;DR The health system is pretty intricate and requires dilligantly repairing yourself if you're going to live as well as being sanitary.\n\nThere are bandits and other monsters that prevent you from getting to comfortable. The combat in Neo Scavenger is also pretty realistic. If you fall over or get stunned it could be it for you. Or maybe not. Not everyone in this game is a blackbelt and the majority of people, including you will often stumble in combat or miss their attacks. In-fact even just charging at your enemy is a risky move becuse you could trip and open yourself up to being stomped. Guns in this game are well done and you won't become invincible if you can get one. They are decently common, however, ammo is not. You may be lucky to find maybe 6 rounds that fit into your gun. But guns are not completely uselss, though. A single bullet can end a fight. Being shot in the torso is enough to make you fall over and possibly passout, destined to either be looted and wake up naked and bleeding with your guts strewn about or to get stomped once your opponent has reached you. Bullets will also cripple/break bones so being shot in the leg or arm might not be directly fatal but the resulting infection/unability to carry things could be.\n\nTL;DR Combat is also really realistic and fair (except for when the Bad Muthas are ganging up on you).\n\nCrafting is also, unsurprisingly decently realistic. There isn't tons of stuff you can craft but what you can craft is realistic. For instance if you want to butcher the bandit you just killed, cook him up, and finally eat him there are several ways to do so. Unlike some games where you must have a certain tool this game allows you to use all sorts of simmilar tools to do the same thing. When you're butchering the dead bandit you can use nearly every sharp object in the game to complete this task. Crafting also will occasionally require that you have specific traits that are set up at the beggining of the game. There are a few vehicles that can be made/found and can be used to pull some of the crap you're carrying at a penalty to speed.\n\nTL;DR There isn't much to say. Crafting is realistic but there isn't tons to make.\n\nThere is no story right now, so there's not much to say about that.\n\n\nBad stuff:\n\nThe user-interface is a bit messy.\n\nThere isn't much NPC-Player interaction other than killing eachother or NPCs acting indignant when you ask them stuff about the world.\n\nShould you buy this game?\n\nYes! Even though it isn't completed and there is no story it's a fun game. The devs seem interested in completing this game so it's a safe bet that they won't abandon the project if they make bank on EA. I'm honestly surprised that more people haven't bought this game. Fans of Fallout and survival games will enjoy this game thoroughly. However, if you are not interested in games being realistic and you hate non-3D, mostly text-based, and not FPS games then don't buy this.\n\nRating: 9/10 Buy it.\n\nTL;DR  It's a good game. If you're still not convinced try the demo.","September 10, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The user interface is not exactly intuitive, and the graphics are nice but a bit retro.\n\nIf you overcome these initial scepticisms though, what you'll find is a game that is a mixture of "A dark room" (minus the initial set-up phase), "Minecraft" (minus the blocky 3d graphics) and any Rougelike (so expect to die frequently).\n\nThe basic setup is always the same: you wake up in some kind of cryo-lab, and the world outside has turned into a post-apocalyptic dystopia similar to "The Walking Dead" or "28 Days Later".\n\nYou have to find out about your own past and uncover the secret of what happened to the world.\n\nYou walk around the landscape on hex-grids, scavenging the woods or the remains of long-gone cities for clothes, food, water and weapons, while avoiding (at least initially) other NPCs or animals, most of which want to see you dead. You can craft things together with recipes you find scattered around randomly, and from time to time you find pieces of newspapers which tell you a bit about what has happened.\n\nThe environment is highly dynamic, you have different weather patterns which impact your sight (when you find a scope or binoculars, you can even increase your visible range), and many other scavengers are roaming the area on their own (one nice example: I once found a corpse, looted it and moved his stuff into my hideout, just to find him chopped to bits of meat when I came back the next day... and of course the killer was not far off and killed me a few minutes later...)\n\nThe story unfolds bit by bit (you have to survive the first night to even get an idea on where you should be moving), and even though I not yet come very far in the story yet (did I mention it is very easy to die in this game?) it is a game I will keep on coming back for "just one more try..."\n\nThe only downside (IMHO) is that there is no way of saving the game (except for the "save&quit" function), so every death is permanent. And since it's written in Flash there's no easy way of getting the save data out for bakup purposes. But that just shows that it's a real Roguelike at heart...","November 23, 2014","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This update makes it so much better, gives a better balance to the beginning skills and some thing alittle bit less noticable is the beginning area is now dotted with more cities and towns which really increase your chances of finding some cloths or a backpack which are damnedfully welcomed. Now these changes do make the game slightly easier but hell this was probably the hardest game I own in my library. Now it's only the hardest game I own still. Lemme say how hard this bloody game is, it's harder than probably all the Darksoul bosses put in to one fight. I mean the environment will kill you, if a Bad Motha doesn't beat your brains out while you sleep, or the infamous shadow that just makes you explode basically.\n\nEven for a early access game I must be honest I feel like I'm getting a full game that is complete. I rarely find bugs, or any imbalaces. The Dev does a AAA job of keeping up with the community and the game. I've had a few early access games and by far this Dev really takes care of this game, like all devs should.\n\nSo if you're a fan of Hexagon RPG, Survival, Mystery, Action, Adventure, Strategy, Turnbased Fun... or even one of those applies to you, I'd highly recommend getting this game.\n\nFor $10 you honestly cannot go wrong with this game.\n\n10/10 Would get stoned to death again.","November 14, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sneak around scavenging for clothing, weapons... craft those bits of junk into something useable. Then go out again - you'll still get killed, but perhaps less often. This is a game of learning and trial & error. You will learn as you die. And you will learn as you survive. Its something of a slow burner. You WILL come back to it after a period of frustration. It'll sit there somewhere in your mind, suggesting you have another go - maybe this time...\n\nPermadeath has to be in the game or would essentially ruin the story, and essentially this is the driving force - this game can be replayed with different information based on your skillset - perhaps some things that would be hidden would be revealed.\n\nI feel some things that need improving - crafting for example is good, but would be best if it remembered every combination you'd come up with from previous games (rather like the old son of in the old rogue type games. This has some previous recipes but not many, and trying to remember them all yourself is absurd.\n\nAlso something that (I think) needs changing to a degree is the way loot is calculated - many times you can obtain a hoard from scavenging with almost no chance to gain anything, but then you can repeatedly find nothing when you have a good chance. Certain skills improve or reduce this, but I think too much in some cases.\n\nBasically here is a potentially good game, which needs many more refinements before it can really be considered complete.\n\nI enjoy this sort of game, but I really wonder if I'm actually anything better than totally rubbish at them. The fact is that despite any faults - any time you have what you deem to be a completely unfair death or when you were just starting to do well for once then along comes... a big nasty monster... at least you have the knowledge of what doesnt work next time, or a different skill to pick - maybe you'll endure the early multitude of deaths and finish the game - perhaps I really am rubbish at it, maybe it (the game) needs balancing, or maybe it always will be just a tad too hard.\n\nIn conclusion:\nI'd play it more if I didnt die as often, if I got to see slightly more of the story.\n\nAll too often you go through the initial stages then die in a low level battle. Perhaps if you were just left sometimes with your stuff robbed - at least you had a little chance...\n\n7/10 (with potential to be 9/10)\n\n**SPOILER ALERT**\nLeave the talisman alone.","November 16, 2014","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Its a very very good game. This is the first and possibly only review I have ever been compelled to write on steam and its something to be said for the quality of this game that I want to save this game for me and not put it in my discard pile.\n\nI hesitated about giving this a yes review for the reason that there is no save function.  I get what you are trying to do with death being death however after spending over one hundred hours and near twenty or thirty attempts just to get as far as the gate of detroit (once)... in the last three cases doing nothing but hunting and hiding in a forest making leather armour (mod?) for nigh on twenty hours of play time only to be slaughtered by two dog men half an hour after setting out for the city then doing the same thing in another game, spending this time ten hours (of real life time)  in a forest making leather armour only to be slaughtered by three men as soon as I left the forest not even being able to run away and then doing the same thing, ten hours in a forest hunting and making armour,  only to be slaughtered while I slept without even waking up even though I had multiple noise traps in place.  Then I tried cheating using a mod to add every skill but it had lost its charm because of this becoming too easy.  I dont want a walkthough,  want a hard playthrough but please not a hundred of them, I dont have the time.\n\nI have stopped playing this game because I dont have this sort of time to spend to get no where in a game.  I choose not to play again to try and get somewhere in the plot only then to later get slaughtered having spent a hundred hours progressing the plot and have to start all over again.  I want to play it through and I commend you for having this idea to have this "when your dead your dead" idea but I actually have a real life to survive in and I simply dont have time to spend too much of it locked into this game.\n\nYes, have an Iron man mode for the realism of the survival aspect of the game, but until there is a save function I will not be returning to this game.  I recommend this game to anyone who has a hundred hours to spend just to get out of the starting blocks.\n\nEDIT... I have changed this from NO to YES to NO to YES... Its too good not to reccomend.  And... then... I started another game... Dan... I hate you... I love you... I hate you... I love you... please add an iron man function your driving me insane.","November 12, 2014","true","115.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One minute you are killing Bad Muthas left and right and the next moment your clawed to death by a Dogman, or shot by a high powered rifle. This game never lets you have it easy, and even if you think that you can survive forever, think again. I personally tried to fight the Detroit Megacity Gaurds, it didn't end well. I also took off the bronze talisman, just to see why I had it, that didn't end to well, either.\n\nThis game is one of the best survival games I've ever played, and I will continue to play this game long into the future.

You have to watch what you eat and drink, make sure you’re clothed properly, and as the title suggest, scavenge the world for supplies and materials. Every time you play it's different, and it can come down to skill and some luck. There are interesting skills that provide you with a variety of crafting options that may otherwise be unavailable, or perks such as the ability to find more loot, get better information on your medical state, or craft certain items. Pretty good story (although I haven't gotten very far because I die a lot :D) Highly recommend to anyone who is into more hardcore survival games.

If you are looking for something with graphics this isnt the game. If you are looking to kill a bandit with a sharpend stick to loot him for a boot a crummy tshirt and a quarter full lighter then this is your game. The perma death system makes you take fewer risks (you know, actually trying to survive) The skill system is pretty good, though at the time of this review isnt fully implemented. The only thing i have against this game is if you use a cleaner like CC cleaner it will wipe your saved game. SO keep that in mind, you dont want to wipe your flash cache when playing this one. 9/10, would play again...if i wernt still keeping it in a window while i work.\n\nUpdate 8/30/14 The game has been updated to have more enemies, more items, more story.

I recommend it to anyone who wants a turn-based hex RPG. Set in a post-apocolyptic Lovecraftian Michigan, your character emerges from a crygenic vat to step into a race against time. You can die from dehydration, starvation, disease  and hypothermia, in addition to wounds inflicted by the various denizens surrounding the Motor City's wastelands.\n\nThis hard setting is further amplified by the decision not to include a leveling system. Each time you play, you learn more about the game mechanics and possibilities. You can augment your character with four of a dozen advantages, as well as about six disadvantages. Thes combination of these influence your play style, as some opportunities only present themselves to those with a given trait.\n\nFor those who love to play first-person shooter "RPG" as murder hobos, this is not the game for you. It is more reminiscent of games from the late 1980s and early 1990s in that it tells its story in a piecemeal fashion with only one Rouge-like save option. While you can engage in combat, you will frequently die. Stealth, scavanging and crafting reveal much more of the story, and further contribute to the desperation as you try to unravel not only how you came to be cycled out of the cryogenics tank, but also what happened to create this near-future landscape.\n\nExpect to die a lot.

I would always play Zork in a huddle with friends, but I was always the only one to beat it.  This led me to be fully engrossed in text based games for years to come.  NEO Scavenger takes text heavy elements that remind me of Zork.  These come into play during the small, but quite enjoyable narrative that the player builds into their game.  The exploration and post-apocalyptic atmosphere also brought back memories of Fallout, but much more serious.  This is by no means a bad thing though because players want a very realistic experience, full of imagery, when playing a text heavy game.  This realism is also extremely prevalent during combat with so many options to choose from depending on skills, gear, etc.  However skills and gear can also heavily limit combat.  This helps the player get a feeling for their character better when role-playing a smart, but incredibly weak character.  This game gets a 9/10 from me because even though it's in my list of personal favorites, it has some faults that limit the game.  These are noticeable if too many mistakes are made on a run, lack of devotion causing boredom, or the always prevalent difficulty curve of rogue-likes.  However, I would recommend this to anyone, regardless of these minor issues, due to the shear number of appealing qualities this game holds that a vast majority of gamers, looking for a new flavored splash of adventure in their games, can enjoy.","October 27, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't be put off by the mildly ugly graphics.  You will forget them in no time.  What makes this game mind blowing is that it is a rogue-ish game with permadeath, yet it doesn't feel like it.  Sure, the first few times you play you are going to measure your lifespan in hours, but once you get the hang of it you realize that survival is all up to you and completely possible for very long periods of time.  I am writting this after burning a solid 6 hours on this game in a single sitting.  In that entire time I had thrills, upsets, and close calls, but never died.  This is a rougalike game to be sure, but don't let that cause you to run screaming.\n\nThe survival aspects of this game are absolutely awesome.  You find yourself searching for food and water, planning ahead, and deciding when it is worth a risky encounter.  There is no "I am a bad guy" badge on people.  See a fellow stranger in the distance?  It is up to you if you want to use surprise to take out a possible threat, or wave and see if he is friendly and wants to talk.  Do you risk a fire to boil water, knowing it might attract a threat?  When it gets dark, do you stumble blindly looking for a good camp, or take a risky spot in the open and hope for the best?  What do you do when you wake up to find a melon head stolen your weapon and backpack; grab a stick and give chase, stalk them, what?  There are always so many options, and that doesn't even get into the tactical turn based combat!\n\nThe combat, while simple on its face is complex and interesting.  Planning is rewarded, but so is on the spot craftiness.   The the game never demands a split second decision, so you have time to ponder your move and roll the dice.  It lets you do so many crafty things and it tends to behave as you would expect.  For instance, imagine you come accross some scary looking person who looks like they want to eat you, and have a host of options.  Do you sneak in close and try and stab him with your trust spear, hoping that this game awesome wound system will let you stun and cripple the guy before he realizes you are there?  Do you try and slip away before he sees  you?  Maybe you decide to bluff and at a distance try pointing your rifle (with no bullets in it) at him, trying to scare him off, if he charges anyways, flip that rifle around and show him the butt of it.  You can jump out of concleament and egg him on, hoping in the rush to get  to you he gives you a solid opening to land the first blow.  Perhaps you get out your old butchers cleaver and start the fight by charging him over onto the ground, and hacking him apart before he can get up.  Hey, he might not even a bad guy, you can always just wave from a distance offering friendly chat and see what he does.\n\nThis game is so unassuming, but it is solildly on my top 5 for 2014, and for the value for the price, it is easily #1.  It says "early access", but as far as I can tell, this is a full game.  This game is an absolute gem.  The worst thing about this game is that there are so many things that might scare people off from what is an awesome experience; perm death, ugly graphics, early access, a slightly obscure interface (until you get the hang of it), and a strange theme.  Don't let any of these things scare you off.  This game is amazing!  I can't even imagine what it will be once it is out of early access.  Don't wait for a sale, buy it now.","December 8, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It completely caught me by surprise and is a great example of Early Access done right. I paid the $9.99 awhile ago and I felt it was completely worth it, and after the frequent updates and improvements, it definitely continues to be worth the money. While I do think the UI needs to be cleaned up a little and the story could be fleshed out more, NEO Scavenger is still a great game. From the crafting that is more than just there because a ton of games are including it, to the way it draws you in for one more turn, and then another, and then maybe another hour goes by, I couldn't say enough good things. There are some flaws and it isn't for everyone, but check out the demo and support a developer that does Early Access right.

I would like to define it as a "Turn based RPG", but that too doesn't quite fit the bill. "Sandbox"? no, not that either . Now I'm not saying that all of these traits and aspects are not included in NEO Scav, but each one does not define it well alone. The only thing I can think to do is paste all of them together (using medium string and a sharp edge) making it a Sandbox Survival Turn Based Role Playing Game (a SSTBRPG), now all we have to do is throw a H in front of that acronym for "Hardcore" and its shaping up to be a decent genre description, a bit of a mouthful though.\n\nNot that (H)SSTBRPG's really exist (that I know of aside from a few indie titles scattered about the web) as a gaming norm, just kind of an acronym I made up on the spot, but the idea isn't a norm. Why is that? The only answer I could think of was that it is too much of a risk for large companies to make a game like that, one that would truly test a person's ability to survive in the wilderness  and deal with day to day threats like hunger, thirst, sleep, and warmth. I don't know if that's true or not, and looking at the amount of people who play games like NEO Scav, I can't see how that theory could hold together.\n\nI'm getting off track.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNEO Scavenger is created (to my knowledge) by one person, Daniel Fedor. That alone when looking at the game is an amazing feat, especially considering how in depth NEO Scav truly is. Whether its crafting or just scavenging there is plenty of things for you to make or find.\n\nThe first day is the hardest, you wake up in an odd place with something scratching at the door (I won't go into detail as, well... Spoilers) , but you immediately have to escape. Using skills to selected at the start, a set of four with the ability to add more at the cost of negative traits, you venture out into the world.\n\nYou walk out into the sunlight of the world, its dawn,  its cold, and you don't have much in the way of clothing save a hospital gown. Immediately you're struck with a problem, find clothing or die of hypothermia. This is what kills most new survivors, and it took me a while (and a few protagonist deaths) to find my rhythm. This first day is brutal, but once it's over, a whole new day begins.\n\nNow you're warm-ish, but the previous days exertions have caused you to grow quite thirsty. You see that there's a water source nearby, a river, but you don't know if the water is safe to drink. You have no method of checking if its "infected" or if its "sterile" but  you don't have the luxury of waiting. This is something that kills off a lot of the players that make it past day one. Let's say you were lucky, and now you're no longer thirsty, and you didn't manage to acquire some form of disease or infection, now what.\n\nBy this time you're starting to feel a little hungry, while scavenging you manage to find a couple of mushrooms and some berries, but without the proper skill (which you can choose at the start of the game, it's called "Botany") you can't tell if these are poisonous or not.  You pick them up all the same, if it comes to it, you might have to take the chance.\n\nBut whats that on the horizon, it looks like another scavenger is none too pleased with you stealing his supplies (or for any myriad of other reasons), and now he wants you dead. You can't escape, you have to fight. You pick up a large nearby stick and prepare to defend yourself.\n\nThe fight is frantic, messy, and results in both parties getting pretty bruised up, but eventually the other scavenger retreats from battle, leaving you to treat your wounds...\n\nThe point is that NEO Scavenger is relentless in its urge to kill you, but it's not like you can't combat this. You can cover you're tracks so that enemies have a harder time following you, you can hide in urban areas and ambush scavengers to steal their stuff, you can apply bandages to your wounds and take pain pills to deal with blood loss and manage the amount of pain your character is in. All the while traveling for some far off goal.\n\nAnd there is SO much more, and even more to be added I'm sure.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn short try the demo, it's a pretty accurate but  slimmed down version of how the game plays out, if you like it, buy it... you can't go wrong. The creator is pretty active in the forums, discussing current game bugs and ideas with the community, both here on steam, as well as on his site at Blue Bottle Games.\n\nTake care, good luck surviving, and hopefully this was helpful.\n\nP.Kindred XIII\n","February 26, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game involves turn-based combat and crafting which both give the game that unique gameplay style that makes it stand out amongst other titles. (May not sound like it, but it really is different)\n\nThe game is hard, I really do mean hard. The rogue-like genre means that when you die or lose in game you will need to restart from the beginning, it also means that each map is procedurally generated and so there will never be the same items or NPC's in a single location. With the difficulty aside the game is really fun with a lot of replayability, there is no real storyline yet but it will be soon implemented according to the dev.\n\nAt the time of writing this review it is still in the beta stage of development and also in Early Access, from what I have seen and played it is one of the few Early Access games that haven't disappointed me.\n","June 24, 2014","true","26.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Anyhow, this is Neo Scavenger in a nutshell:\n\nCold. How long has it been since I've been warm. A day? Ten? I don't know any more, time seems so eternal out here, and I've lost track of it. I don't know anything but pain, fear, and cold these days... and hunger. I tried building a campfire a while back, and that damned Bandit left me bleeding and scarred. I went looking for some medical equipment later that night, an an apartment collapsed on me. I'm weak and tired, but I'm too afraid to sleep... But I can afford to close my eyes a bit, right?...\n"Give up all your f***ing gear if you want to live!" Before I'm even fully aware, I'm staring into the muzzle of a revolver. I panic and begin to scream, and he whacks me across the face with the revolver's butt.\n"What? You f***ing deaf? Hand it all over!" I'm not deaf, but I'm not stupid either. If I hand over all this gear, I might live a while longer, but I'd still die. Slower and even more painfully than if he shot me. Besides, he might even be bluffing? Before he knows what's happening, I slam a heavy punch into his chest, knocking the wind out of his lungs and freezing him for a moment. Not one to waste, I use that moment. I grab a heavy-looking stone on the ground and begin to pummel him. In the dark, I see nothing but a vague grey shape. I slam the stone into his stomach, and he screams in pain. I pummel him even further, and further... Long after he dies, I'm still hitting him with the stone. My arms are aching and my head is pulsing, but I keep hitting the battered corpse. Finally, I relent. More out of exhaustion and pain rather than any sense of logic.\nThen, I sleep. Fitfully and weakly at first, but soon enough, my fatigue catches up to me, and I rest. When I wake up, the full realization of what I'd done caught up to me. The "bandit" was a starving emaciated skeletal husk, and his revolver was a rusted abomination that was more likely to explode rather than fire. I begin to suck in a hitching, weak breath as I sob. That could have been me, and it probably would be before long...\nIt's been a while since I killed that man, but the heavy black weight of it hangs heavily on my shoulders. I hate my own existence, and have long considered suicide... If this isn't hell, then what is it? Just as I begin to slip the bottle of sedatives out of my pocket, I see a man approaching me. I haven't seen another sould in so long... and I feel genuine joy and excitement at the prospect of talking to someone... Maybe even make a friend? I begin to rush towards him, hands in the air to signify my friendliness. Before I know what happens, I am knocked aside the head, and looted.\nThis is Neo Scavenger, and though your adventure may not last as long, or be as miserly, you will experience the highs and lows of survival. You will wonder: "Why? Why did it have to end this way?" And you will face many hard choices.\nDo both your practical intellect and your inner masochist a favour, and buy this game. It's well worth it's price.","February 22, 2014","true","96.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the crafting that is more than just there because a ton of games are including it, to the way it draws you in for one more turn, and then another, and then maybe another hour goes by, I couldn't say enough good things.

First of all, the game is out of Early Access and is feature complete(to my knowledge), and does have an end-game scenario. It's just not that easy to do. 195 hours in the game and I have yet to "beat" it. Ususally for me the story comes second to the survival gameplay. The story is unique and interesting from what I've uncovered(and read about), though some things can take a long time to complete, and usually I'll die before I come close to completing my objective.\n\nThis brings me to my second point. The game is hard, yes, but it's not as impossible as some people make it out to be. Jumping right in to the game with no prior knowledge, like I did, will be tough. You'll die quite often until you start to make some sense of the mechanics and gameplay. You will also get unlucky at times and be woken from a dead sleep by a creature which can mess you up bad. But, like I said, it's not impossible. You just need to try new skill combinations and ways of going through the world. Taking the strong/tough perks will allow you to wreck NPCs that you come across, but when you're faced with a life or death story scenario, you may not be as well equipped to deal with dangers as you may have thought. At the time of writing this, I've been playing a no-combat-skills build. I've taken Hacking, Medic, Botany, Lockpicking, Eagle Eye, Tracking, Athletic and Electrician, along with Fragile and Insomniac for the extra points. I've been playing this character for three or four real life days now, and I've gone through at least thirty in-game days. Without dying.\n\nPlaying like this forces you to reconsider everything you've been doing. Before, I'd walk right up to that feral dog and turn it in to a pin cushion with my bow. Now though, I'm fragile and unskilled at any combat. All I have for protection is a war club, which, in my hands, is about as deadly as a shoe. If I even see a feral dog, I'm headed in a new direction. I've also found out that running away  is ♥♥♥♥ing useful! . I may not be able to kill that guy and eat his body, but I'm alive for another day. And I didn't even need his man meat. I've got the botany skill and can just forage around some forests and fill up on berries. In this current game, I've also not used any noise traps when I sleep, because I don't have the room. I get burdened easy, and only carry a couple small backpacks. Still, I have yet to die.\n\nYou just need to think a little before commiting to an action. Before I try to get some rest, I hide and wait for a few turns to see if anyone's in the area. If no one has wandered into my camp, I sleep. And since I have insomnia, I usually wake up before anything gets too close to me. I know there's a terrible and unfortunate death waiting for me in the future, but until then I'll keep scouring this wasteland, looking for the RFID spoofing software I need in order to advance a story encounter I have yet to complete.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but for me, it's definitely in my top 5. It's easy enough to pick up and play for 30 minutes of down time, or I can spend hours in the game, completely immersed and elated when I find a text file worth nearly $2000 in a laptop that's been sitting in a building for years, and which would have been useless to me were it not for the hacking trait.\n\nIf you're undecided, just play the demo or watch some videos. There's quite a bit of content missing from the demo, but you'll get the gist of things and be able to make a more informed decision on whether or not this is your type of game. To anyone buying this game, I sincerely hope you like it, as it's like no other game I've played before, and absolutely one of my favorites. Thanks for the amazing game Daniel, and I am looking forward to your next endeavor.","July 3, 2015","true","311.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even if you die and have to start back from the cryo lab and the beginning is always the same, it's really easy to have a completly different experience while you play. You will never encounter the same enemy during your first travel to one place and you will really need luck to survive some obstacles (for example, someone steal all your stuff while you sleep, including your clothes. The amount luck you'll need to survive that is really really big).\n\nYou know that you've progressed in this game when you look back at the main event that happened during your journey. From when you left that cryo lab with only a hospital gown with you and when you just killed 5 dogman with your rifle and your compound bow.\n\nSpeaking of combat, this is one of the games where you feel more cruel when you kill someone than in a FPS game, and you dont even see it happen! It's just click and hope to read something that is good for you! Even if you are not reading a book each time you use an attack, you'll feel very cruel when you'll read that he died by lung bleeding, so you basically caused him to drown in his own blood.\n\nAnyway, go buy this game now!

The game is really difficult yet it manages to make the experience fun. And when I say difficult I mean difficult, it's not a question of if you will die, it's more of a question WHEN will you die.\n\nYou start in a cryo facility completely nude, save for a hospital gown. This is a problem because un-like other survival games the temperature is a very important part of the game. If you're not wearing multiple layers of shirts as well as pants and shoes you will freeze to death minutes after you start.\n\nThe health system is really neat. It requires you to bandage each individual cut you receive. There are also injuries like broken bones that are severely crippling because of how little room you are given to carry things. The inventory system gives you a couple options: Carry it in your hands or if you have a backpack you can put it in there. Aside from that you can put things in your pants. However not even the largest backpack gives you a ton of room so every limb needs to be functioning for you to survive. There is also a range of illness that you can catch. They can be related to the cold, an infection from a cut, drinking/eating tainted water and food (respectively), and a whole host of other diseases that I've yet to experience.\n\nTL;DR The health system is pretty intricate and requires dilligantly repairing yourself if you're going to live as well as being sanitary.\n\nThere are bandits and other monsters that prevent you from getting to comfortable. The combat in Neo Scavenger is also pretty realistic. If you fall over or get stunned it could be it for you. Or maybe not. Not everyone in this game is a blackbelt and the majority of people, including you will often stumble in combat or miss their attacks. In-fact even just charging at your enemy is a risky move becuse you could trip and open yourself up to being stomped. Guns in this game are well done and you won't become invincible if you can get one. They are decently common, however, ammo is not. You may be lucky to find maybe 6 rounds that fit into your gun. But guns are not completely uselss, though. A single bullet can end a fight. Being shot in the torso is enough to make you fall over and possibly passout, destined to either be looted and wake up naked and bleeding with your guts strewn about or to get stomped once your opponent has reached you. Bullets will also cripple/break bones so being shot in the leg or arm might not be directly fatal but the resulting infection/unability to carry things could be.\n\nTL;DR Combat is also really realistic and fair (except for when the Bad Muthas are ganging up on you).\n\nCrafting is also, unsurprisingly decently realistic. There isn't tons of stuff you can craft but what you can craft is realistic. For instance if you want to butcher the bandit you just killed, cook him up, and finally eat him there are several ways to do so. Unlike some games where you must have a certain tool this game allows you to use all sorts of simmilar tools to do the same thing. When you're butchering the dead bandit you can use nearly every sharp object in the game to complete this task. Crafting also will occasionally require that you have specific traits that are set up at the beggining of the game. There are a few vehicles that can be made/found and can be used to pull some of the crap you're carrying at a penalty to speed.\n\nTL;DR There isn't much to say. Crafting is realistic but there isn't tons to make.\n\nThere is no story right now, so there's not much to say about that.\n\n\nBad stuff:\n\nThe user-interface is a bit messy.\n\nThere isn't much NPC-Player interaction other than killing eachother or NPCs acting indignant when you ask them stuff about the world.\n\nShould you buy this game?\n\nYes! Even though it isn't completed and there is no story it's a fun game. The devs seem interested in completing this game so it's a safe bet that they won't abandon the project if they make bank on EA. I'm honestly surprised that more people haven't bought this game. Fans of Fallout and survival games will enjoy this game thoroughly. However, if you are not interested in games being realistic and you hate non-3D, mostly text-based, and not FPS games then don't buy this.\n\nRating: 9/10 Buy it.\n\nTL;DR  It's a good game. If you're still not convinced try the demo.","September 10, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041727388/recommended/248860/","76561198041727388","Jeeub","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041727388/","168 products in account","Pretty much everything there is to say about this game has been said, though I'd like to throw in my two cents as well as address a couple issues I've seen people comment on in some of the reviews. First of all, the game is out of Early Access and is feature complete(to my knowledge), and does have an end-game scenario. It's just not that easy to do. 195 hours in the game and I have yet to "beat" it. Ususally for me the story comes second to the survival gameplay. The story is unique and interesting from what I've uncovered(and read about), though some things can take a long time to complete, and usually I'll die before I come close to completing my objective.\n\nThis brings me to my second point. The game is hard, yes, but it's not as impossible as some people make it out to be. Jumping right in to the game with no prior knowledge, like I did, will be tough. You'll die quite often until you start to make some sense of the mechanics and gameplay. You will also get unlucky at times and be woken from a dead sleep by a creature which can mess you up bad. But, like I said, it's not impossible. You just need to try new skill combinations and ways of going through the world. Taking the strong/tough perks will allow you to wreck NPCs that you come across, but when you're faced with a life or death story scenario, you may not be as well equipped to deal with dangers as you may have thought. At the time of writing this, I've been playing a no-combat-skills build. I've taken Hacking, Medic, Botany, Lockpicking, Eagle Eye, Tracking, Athletic and Electrician, along with Fragile and Insomniac for the extra points. I've been playing this character for three or four real life days now, and I've gone through at least thirty in-game days. Without dying.\n\nPlaying like this forces you to reconsider everything you've been doing. Before, I'd walk right up to that feral dog and turn it in to a pin cushion with my bow. Now though, I'm fragile and unskilled at any combat. All I have for protection is a war club, which, in my hands, is about as deadly as a shoe. If I even see a feral dog, I'm headed in a new direction. I've also found out that running away  is ♥♥♥♥ing useful! . I may not be able to kill that guy and eat his body, but I'm alive for another day. And I didn't even need his man meat. I've got the botany skill and can just forage around some forests and fill up on berries. In this current game, I've also not used any noise traps when I sleep, because I don't have the room. I get burdened easy, and only carry a couple small backpacks. Still, I have yet to die.\n\nYou just need to think a little before commiting to an action. Before I try to get some rest, I hide and wait for a few turns to see if anyone's in the area. If no one has wandered into my camp, I sleep. And since I have insomnia, I usually wake up before anything gets too close to me. I know there's a terrible and unfortunate death waiting for me in the future, but until then I'll keep scouring this wasteland, looking for the RFID spoofing software I need in order to advance a story encounter I have yet to complete.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, but for me, it's definitely in my top 5. It's easy enough to pick up and play for 30 minutes of down time, or I can spend hours in the game, completely immersed and elated when I find a text file worth nearly $2000 in a laptop that's been sitting in a building for years, and which would have been useless to me were it not for the hacking trait.\n\nIf you're undecided, just play the demo or watch some videos. There's quite a bit of content missing from the demo, but you'll get the gist of things and be able to make a more informed decision on whether or not this is your type of game. To anyone buying this game, I sincerely hope you like it, as it's like no other game I've played before, and absolutely one of my favorites. Thanks for the amazing game Daniel, and I am looking forward to your next endeavor.","July 3, 2015","true","311.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DerpCustomURL/recommended/248860/","DerpCustomURL","IvanDerp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DerpCustomURL/","71 products in account","So far this is an okay game it's pretty rough for most new players since every choice you make might lead to your character death and I've kept dying but that's because I've been learning it the hardway, if you go around and look at a few let's play and read some of the Guides you'll find the game somewhat easier.\n\nI've been playing this game for a while now and after a while it does get a bit repetitive I keep trying to explore places but find it lacking in content could be just me.\n\nIt's an okay game overall, I had a great adventure and even manage to write a story about it! Enjoy!\n\n**Story may contain Spoiler**\n\nThis is the story of my latest adventure\n\nDay 1: I woke up in a strange facility, I have no clue who am I and why am I here.. Suddenly! Surprise Dogman appeared! I beat the living s**t out of it like there was no tomorrow until it stopped twitching.\n\nIt was a good work out I don't remember when was the last time I had a work out or if I even work out at all. My stomach made a rumbling noise so I went to search the place for food but only found a green bag with a white cross sign inside it was just a bunch of dumb pills.. I stared at the dead dog like creature feeling somewhat regretful for killing.. perhaps it was just trying to help me.. So I chopped his body into pieces and brought some wood from the nearby forest to make fire to cook it.\n\n"This is what it would've wanted me to do" I thought to myself silently thanking it for becoming a meal and a coat but also silently hating it at the same time for not bringing any condiments with it.\n\nAfter satisfying my stomach I went to stroll into the nearest town looking for any sign of civilization but nobody was here the streets were empty and ocassionally I'd see a few skeletons laying around, perhaps it's halloween and they're having a huge hide and seek event.. YES! that could only be the most logical reason!\n\nI looked around inside buildings ocassionally taking items with me "I'm just gonna borrow this stuff I'm sure they wouldn't mind" I thought to myself as I grabbed as much stuff as I could carry.\n\nIt was starting to get dark and I was afraid if a stranger would walk up to me and offer me a sugar free candy, so I went back to the facility I woke up in and decided to call it home.\n\nI saw a faint glow of light in the distance and I knew it.. they were hiding from me.. nobody hides from me.. nobo.. *falls asleep* zzzZZZzzzZZZzz...\n\nDay 2: I had a good sleep last night but my stomach was beginning to complain again.. I went out and made myself a hardened spear before heading out any further.. just in case I encounter any stranger danger..\n\nAs I headed out toward where I last saw the glow of light I spotted more Town! as I sprinted toward the town I came across a friendly stranger.\n\nHe was carrying a revolver he must be dressing up as a cowboy and he was also wearing a pair of croc so I asked him to give me all of his stuff because my stuff sucks, but he refused and start to charge at me, The nerve of some people I tell you! So I poked him on the head with my sharp stick, he fell and was crawling away from me as he beg for mercy so I gave him what he wanted and kept poking him with my sharp stick until he was no longer in pain.\n\nI was pretty happy that I could borrow his croc I saw that cool kids wear these kind of sho- err sandals..? what ever it is.. the cool kids on the old worn out poster wear it so I'm a cool kid now.\n\nOH! and he also had an expired cracker and some ketchup! So I hack him and whack him and chop him since there's no point to let him go to waste no siree! he would've want me to eat him or else he would've told me stories about starving childrens in some distant foreign land! So being the civilized human being I am, I cooked him as best as I could with the few ingridients he had on him that I'm sure would've made Gordon Ramsay proud.\n\nToday was a good day I said to myself as I went to sleep.\n\nDay 3: A noise woke me up today.. it was a guy! He tried to take my precious empty bottle in the corner! “My Precious!!!” I shouted as I charge toward him and knocked some debris toward him, the debris made him vulnerable and as he tries to recover I stabbed him with my sharp pointy stick and carved a hole in his right arm.\n\nI kept stabbing him with my pointy stick as I hissed at him aggressively, nobody touches my precious! Nobody but me!\n\nI lacerated, gashed and carved him into pieces there was no mercy.. it was the sacrifice my precious neede- Oohh!! He had a crowbar! Now I can dress up as Gordon Freemsay the Angry crazy canibalistic chef with a Phd!\n\nAnd so I ventured out as Gordon Freemsay! Suddenly 3 Dog appeared! I knew it.. I should’ve double tapped him when I last met him at Galaxy News Radio.. now he reappeared before me as an actual 3 Dog!\n\nSo I demolished one of the closest dog’s head using my crowbar! That really got the attention of the other 2 Dog and again I demolished the other dog head, it seem that knocked some sense to the last dog as it tries to fall back from me but it knew.. it knew it was too late.. it knew that it had done f**ked up and “WHACK!!” that was the last thing it heard.. “nobody.. mess with Gordon Freemsay..” I said to it in a silent hiss.\n\nAs I went on my way I was again approached by more meanies.. they just don’t know when to quit..\n\nAfter slaughtering about 2 more Dog and 2 Stranger with an angry mother issue, I went off to go shopping for a sauce pan and back pack and found a cool sled and since I’m not a thief I left my plastic shopping bag with some rotting left over cooked human meat as a trade in case the owner came back.\n\nIt was another great day, I cooked some water from a nearby lake so I can wash my boo-boo away and bottle some more in case I made some more boo-boo.\n\nI also did an art and craft project by stringing small can with a handful of strings and pebbles it made music if people step or trip on them! It will be a great addition to my house!\n\nDay 4: My art and craft project ringed in the middle of the night.. *sigh* I guess it’s time for a midnight snack, it was a dogie! “Chinese food it is then” I lured it into a trap but it still managed to scratch my coat before I stabbed a new nose into it’s lung and bled all over the floor.\n\nGreat.. now I’m gonna have to clean that up.. *sigh* why do they have to make things difficult I grumble to myself as I enjoy my midnight snack and went back to sleep but as soon as I closed my eyes another stranger ringed my welcome bell.. I got up and quickly took cover.. I couldn’t see where or who this stranger was so I lashed out and swinged my sharp pointy stick wildly to where I think he’s at but this stranger managed to shred my upper left leg, I fell to the ground and just then I knew.. I done goofed.. and all the horrible things I’ve done.. I’ve become a monster.. and I didn’t want to acknowledge that.. I was in denial all this time.. this is it.. my time has finally come.. I am ready.. do your worst Karma.. and just like that I passed out..\n\n...\n\nEverything was silent.. I woke up.. there was a bright light as if the sun was shining upon me..\n\n...\n\nWait a minute.. it actually is the sun! And sure enough! there he was.. The f**ker that tried to kill me! Laying on the ground with a hole in his chest.. Boy~! I sure didn’t learn a single thing from that experience so I cut that f**ker up and ate him. It sure was a glorious day in this man army! And it was pretty nice of him to bring me a hunting rifle with a scope, strap and there's even a bullet in it aww that's so sweet of him.\n\nI enjoyed the rest of the day munching on the left over while reading the outdated newspaper man.. I wish I had some fava beans and a nice chianti to go with this live- shh!! There were noises outside.. and sure it was another stranger waiting in the nearby outskirt of the forest.. and so Gordon Freemsay continues his rampage in this post-apocalyptic world..","December 24, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

NEO Scavenger's mechanics are constantly intriguing, but more than anything, it shines with the world it presents and the judicious exposition thereof. while it certainly fits in the post-apocalyptic genre, it's a stranger catastrophe that's befallen this world than the usual nuclear or ecological disasters we see; the rules of the universe seem to be in drift. setting is dripped out in tantalizing paragraphs fished up out of scraps of newspapers from before and during whatever disaster it was that set things askew. the frustrations of a challenging narrative roguelike make things that much more intense: unlike a Stone Soup or a Binding of Isaac that can more or less be set aside at any point, NEO Scavenger demands the exploration of its mysteries, keeping the player coming back in the face of annihilation because of the raw power of the strangeness of the world that it depicts.\n\nhighly recommended.","June 22, 2015","true","23.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then one day I spotted a dogman outside my camp, but before I could pursue it, it became dawn, so I had to reteat so I could make it back to camp in time. I got into my sleeping bag and thought, "I'm going to catch that beast with my bow and war club," and fell asleep. Well, I wake up and look about, and not 2 feet away from me is that sneaky beaky dogman who, apparently, got past ALL of my noise traps and killed me before I could even get up.\n\n10/10 would die from a ninja dogman again","April 21, 2015","true","44.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

While there's no hand-holding in this survivalist/sci-fi RPG, every loss gives you a bit of knowledge about how to survive better on the next playtrough. While most everything about the game is minimalist (lofi-graphics and text/icon turn-based combat), the game's approach to describing characters and events forces you to assess your decisions not based on a sheet of numbers or a cookie-cutter game sprite, but on what you know about your capabilities, and what you can see of the problem(s) you face. It's a great aesthetic that forces you to be your character instead of just playing them.

While there's no hand-holding in this survivalist/sci-fi RPG, every loss gives you a bit of knowledge about how to survive better on the next playtrough. While most everything about the game is minimalist (lofi-graphics and text/icon turn-based combat), the game's approach to describing characters and events forces you to assess your decisions not based on a sheet of numbers or a cookie-cutter game sprite, but on what you know about your capabilities, and what you can see of the problem(s) you face. It's a great aesthetic that forces you to be your character instead of just playing them. It's a great game, and getting better.","February 7, 2014","true","50.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are several indie gems out there but I have to admit that this one is the best I've played. Why? Probably because it reminds me so much of the original Wasteland and does well to hold me over till the I get the money for the second. You play as a man with no real memory of who he is and wakes up in a post apocalyptic world, except it doesn't use the cliched desert wasteland or zombie infested urban feista. No, it sets itself apart by creating its own twisted world. In the game you move along a hex map and scavange for supplies. These supplies range from balls of twine and floss to civilian grade weapons and military grade technology. You are able to craft a varity of things out of seemingly usless items. My favorite being the sled (plastic sled + medium length twine, rope, floss, etc.) which allows me to carry more things BUT i am unable to run making combat difficult. Combat takes a bit getting use to but not for very long. It's turn based where you select what you do and you do it then your opponent takes their turn. Simple and when combined with your imagination, downright enjoyable. Even in early acess this game is so well polished I would believe it to be complete, though I'm glade it isn't because I would love to see more and more items and craftable objects. This is a must for fans of classic RPGs, Fallout(original), Wasteland, The Road(both book and movie), and Fallen Paragon(a book I highly recommend find it on Amazon).","March 28, 2014","true","18.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I also have a thing for not buying early access games, but NEO Scavenger recently came out with their real version. Some people can be bothered by an RPG's strange meta-game of having to micro manage your inventory squares, and this game is not for them. If you're like me, though, and get a strange fascination with figuring out the best way to hold aspirin inside a water bottle inside a box inside a plastic shopping bag (so you can still have one hand free to fend off scavengers who want to steal that bag) then you will find a lot to love here. As survival goes the game doesn't hold your hand and never levels you up, but I haven't seen a system this robust since Realms of Arkania. It's up to you to learn how to interact with the environment, weather, temperature and the like. The crafting system is extensive and partially based on your character creation choices.\n\nThere's no way around it, battle is particularly lackluster: that's the moment you finally realize that you're playing a MUD, with tons of context specific customization but not any graphics to represent it. Unfortunately there's not even much descriptive text to get you into it, either. Still combat is servicable and the options that pop up are fun, and if you're a character where combat is secondary to surviving then it probably won't weigh too heavily on you. I really like this game and it will be fun learning to get better at it.","January 4, 2015","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I purchased this game because I saw my brother play it one day, and it looked like a good game to pass the time, maybe when I was downloading something or needed something to do while I was about to go somewhere. So I paid for the game, and launched it, and found it extremely difficult to play. It took me maybe 2 hours to figure out where to go, what to do, and how to survive. But once I did, it began opening new windows in the world of NEO Scavenger. I got really far, then one day while fighting a DMC Guard, was fatally shot in the chest and killed. I thought to myself, "No big deal, I'll just do it again." So I did. And I died of a disease called The Blue Rot. I continued playing. Died of a bandit. Continued playing...and playing...and playing....\n\nEventually I went upstairs and I found out that I had been playing the game for 3 hours, but what seemed to be only 30 minutes to me. In other words, the ten dollars I spent on this game lasted a whole long while.\n\n\nPROS OF THIS GAME\n-Time consuming, and very, very fun.\n-Don't need a super computer to run it.\n-Download time is literally 3 minutes.\n-There generally is no raging at your monitor included with this game.\n-The creativity put into this game is flippin' amazing.\n-Totally worth the ten dollars.\n\nCONS OF THIS GAME\n-Mild glitches can interrupt gameplay (NOTE THAT IT IS IN EARLY ACCESS)\n-If you're someone who doesn't have a lot of time on their hands, don't buy this.\n-This game sucks the life essence out of you and your friends.\n-Updates generally come rather slowly.\n\n\n\nAnyway, this game is great and you need to buy it.","October 12, 2014","true","96.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It sounded like the survival game I'd been wanting for YEARS! But after scavenging only 2 abandoned towns I was shot at and constantly stunned until I died. I was Tough and had clothes on, not sure if that improves my defense or not, and I was behind cover. Infact getting behind cover was the one single action I was able to pull off.\n\nIn my many playthroughs since I have never been able to find another frying pan or torch, and things were even harder. Finding a lighter is so damn hard that I usually starve to death. Or if I just try waiting it out and eating mushrooms in forests, I end up dying of sickness. This isn't a game about surviving, it's a game about taking a while to die. 2 days is my usual record.\n\nThis game relies so incredibly heavily on luck that it just isn't fun. But survival is all about strategy, so this works out horribly. I've tried building a great shelter, but died of sickness. Tried never staying in one spot, but got mauled. There are only ways to lose and no ways to win. Also with the very small amount of recipes available, you'd think the game would give you hints on when you need just 1 more item to make something. Dragging the skills into the crafting table is just really monotonous. It should be doing this itself! It's the Minecraft crafting table all over again, with no user-friendliness.\n\nAnd the skills, they were a selling point for me, but now that I've gotten to play it I only pick the same skills each time. They are just not at all balanced. This is what I'd expect from a game still in beta. I thought I'd be avoiding these huge flaws in a finished game. Incredibly dissapointing. I've tried other survival roguelikes and they were pretty bad too in there own ways.\n\nStarting to wonder if this genre combo simply can never work.\n\nUPDATE: Same day I post this, a wonderful person tells me about a free game in beta called Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. It's got more content than I can handle! And despite it's wonky controls, it has a very clear crafting system, and loads of methods for getting materials. It's also far more immersive with you actually exploring the areas yourself. Just hope you don't need graphics, because that's the game's only flaw. To play it like Neo Scavenger, just turn zombies off and NPCs on. And finally, when you die in it, you learn from it. You play better next time. Something I sadly can't say about Neo Scavenger, where it's difficulty is based on a dice roll.","March 5, 2015","false","7.6"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","5"

The gameplay largely centers around exploring abandoned cities searching for useful items and shelter. One of the best features of the game is the level of detail in everything, every item serves a purpose and every decision has its pros and cons. The combat is extremely brutal in spite of being text based, as the descriptions are very specific and make you think about what exactly you have done; eg 'You kick the enemy breaking their ribs and punctured their lung, they bleed to death.' There are a lot of hazards you can succumb to, such as temperature, sickness, bleeding and starvation.\n\nOverall I reccomend this game to anyone who likes challenging tactical turn based games, particularly permadeath roguelike style ones.","May 17, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

But anway, this is Steam version.\n\nOne of the mistakes people make when first playing this game is assuming it is unrelentingly hard just because you die a lot; it isn't. It just doesn't have a tutorial, and is very strict. You'll die, but those deaths are not random; they are because of some mistake you made. Learn from it. Don't die that way next time. And don't forget your skills; if you die of poisoning try to figure out why and not do it again. Maybe it had something to do with those mushrooms you ate? or that rancid swamp water you drank? Did you die of Sepsis? Then maybe try keeping your wounds clean instead of rubbing dirt in them.\n\nOnce you get into the swing of things, it isn't hard to survive, and luck starts to be a fairly minor factor. This can take a bit of learning; even poring over the wiki isn't going to totally familiarize yourself with the mechanics, but it is a good idea to use the wiki for craftables. Not necessary, but helpful.\n\nOne last bit of advice: there's no 100% completion for this game, so keep in mind you do not have to complete every challenge you come across. In fact, you shouldn't try; no character can handle all challenges. Pick your battles, and don't be afraid to run away, even if you are a full combat character.\n\nMost of all, the game is turn based. Take your time, think things through, and use your skills.","February 22, 2015","true","70.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Also pays heavy attention to the community and is well receiving of criticism and ideas alike.\n\nThe game itself contains hundreds of recipes, items, and ways to die. The survival system is realistic. You need to eat, drink, stay warm, have vision, scavenge, hunt, trade, and try to keep healthy while doing it. Starving? Those mushrooms look mighty tasty. BAM! They're poisonous. Should have been a botanist, eh?\n\nOh, you're tired? Cold? Campfire in the woods sounds nice, and man am I so glad I found that sleeping bag. BAM! Robbed in your sleep. Bam! Dogman fight! Oh god, you're bleeding out! Slap rags and a makeshift splint on your torn and broken arm. Ouch, you didn't boil them, now you have an infection.\n\nI've never really been one to enjoy hardcore games. Infact I usually stay away from roguelikes.

Greg grabbed a large branch and waited for one to come to him. A man with a revolver came at Greg and was telling him to drop his medical garb and his branch.Greg, who got atttached to his garb, ran right at the man and beat him till he was on the floor unconsious. Greg grabbed the man's shoes and revolver and 2 bullets and ran to the right of Zom. Greg found a strangely dressed man in black armor and a shotgun. Greg wanted that shotgun, but knew he had to get closer and make sure his bullet counted. The man offered to talk to Greg, but Greg just walked casually twards him. The man, thinking he just wanted to be closer when they talked, started to move closer also. Greg walked right into the man, lifted the gun, and shot him. Greg was astonished when the bullet totally missed the man. Greg stood there in shocked silence while the man lifted his shotgun and blasted Greg in the chest point blank.","March 26, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You take a quick look through your gear making sure nothing has been stolen in the night. Shoving the pieces of your shelter into your pack and throwing your hide cloak around your shoulders you take off through the pouring rain.\n\nYou rummage through a few houses not finding much, these where the first places to get scavenger after everything went to ****. As you exit the last house on the street tearing an old tee shirt into rags, suddenly hearing a loud clatter you throw yourself to the ground and watch as a large figure resembling Werewolf from old story's lumbers past. It passes by and you release a breath you didn't know you where holding in. Unslinging the rifle from your shoulder you top off the magazine, fighting a dog man today is not something you wish to happen.\n\nA few days later you stand atop a hill scanning the area with half a binocular you keep slung around your neck searching for any movement while munching on a handful of berries. After several hours you see the flash a blue sash moving out of the tree line, a blue frog preacher not friendly and normally carrying somewhat valuable objects you will have no remorse from ending this ones life. Moving closer as to not waste your valuable ammunition you line up a shot from your rifle. With a loud accompanying crack the figure drops to the ground motionless. as you get close the man jumps to his feet and sprints back into the tree line, Swear under your breath you give chase into the dense forest.\n\nHe couldnt have gotten far you think to yourself examining the blood trail. The trees seem to press closer on you and your draw a small revolver from your cargo pants pocket, your rifle would be ineffective at these close ranges. The blue sash makes it easy to find the lifeless body after a few minutes. Your so focous on looting the corpse you almost don't hear the rustle of foliage, you grab your pistol from where it lay beside the body and scan the woods searching for the source of the sound. A single shot whipes by your head and you throw yourself behind a log still searching for your attacker. You take a deep breath staying here is suicide, you lung forward from behind the log in a full on sprint. Stumbling over the overgrown roots of the trees you feel relieved as you see the light streaming for the edge of the forest. In all fairness you almost make it before the second shot rings out catching you in the leg. Gritting your teeth against the pain you fire blindly behind you as you break out into the field. You leap into the tall grass silently thanking what ever god stays about for the concealment. The third shot hits you in the back going through your lung, you cough blood flying from your mouth and then the fourth and final shot the only you don't hear finally ends your pain.\n\nNeo Scavenger is a post apocalyptic survival simulator. You must contend with food, water, the cold, the weight of your equipment, wild beasts and other people in your struggle to simply stay alive. Neo scavenger also adds in sides mission and a story although i must admit i have no lived long enough to complete any of them. Also random events can happen while moving about the hexagonal landscape ranging from slave auctions to abandon camps. Combat is turn based and visceral in its descriptions, enough to make you slightly uncomfortable with each killing blow. A skill is also in place allowing you to change your play style with each life keeping the game fresh. There can be quite a lot of reading in parts however its is done very very well, each line adds more to the atmosphere and does a good job of giving a visual of the surrounding area.\n\nThis is a brutal unforgiving game Death comes quickly to the unknowing and the unprepared. Its not everyone's game by far taking up a niche role in giving a somewhat realistic survival game, probably the closest ive found to a proper simulator.\n\nI give NeoScavenger an 8.5/10\nMenus can be rather clunky at times and starting off as a new player can be rather brutal but once you grown acclimated to the environment it becomes a rather masochistic joy to play. Just be wary of purchasing and watch some footage and play to free demo to see if you think you would enjoy the game.","April 12, 2015","true","26.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.\n\nBasically, this is the kind of difficulty and immersiveness you will find in this game.","January 28","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

It's a lot of fun, and the writing for events is great! This game's mechanics have a steep learning curve, but is just fun after. The combat shows realism, and encourages not beating to death everyone, but rather beating up, trying to make surrender, or even kill with a ranged weapon. Also, the skills are useful. For a example, if your tired of freezing to death, get trapping. You can make a campfire from friction. Also, the current special areas are amazing, and have quite a bit hidden surprises. (There is even a haunted house!) Go play this game, it's just 10.00 US dollars, and is worth even more than that. It requires scavenging a lot, and the name live up to it.

The game is terrible when it comes to forgiving mistakes, which makes it brutally fun as you either get punished or punish others for making a bad move like attacking you without weapons while you have a large knife and the strong skill.

But figuring out if the small pocket knife is better to take with you because it takes up less space or if it's worth losing that extra storage to a base ball bat is a much harder to decide.\n\nEvery choice in NEO Scavenger could mean regret or death in the next few turns or happiness and success.\n\n\nSome things to note before buying:\nIf you like not being able to save your progress then this game is fore you. The only option you have is to 'save' game; which acquaints to going back to the start screen or quitting the game and being able to pick up where you left off however you soon realize it's not really saving anything the first time you die your save is gone. When you die you have to start over again with nothing . . .from the beginning. For me I really get depressed when I worked really hard to get what I got only to die because it was cold or because I drank some bad water.\n\n\nThe good:\n\nChallenging\nTons of content to see\nhigh replay value\n\n\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe random nature of  encounters and item generation is very unforgiving at times and often ends with your character being killed after only a few turns.\nA limited (small) set of starting skills to choose from.","March 30, 2015","true","27.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

One character I had managed to take down a military (ATN?) guy with a crowbar, which gave me rad body armor, guns and a pack full of goodies. As I'm crowbarring his unconcious head in, his attack drone comes out of nowhere and messes up my arm and leg. After cowering in a nearby abandoned building that I tarted up with noise traps and tarps, I poured the dead soldiers whiskey all over my wounds and chowed down on my cured squirrel stash. I healed up, bailed the area and with my new armor and arms, became a total wasteland badass for about 50 turns. That is, Until 3 dogmen tracked me down to a forest shack and took turns arranging my intestines.

It's a good kind of hard that makes you feel warm with the feels for your characters health and well being as he try's to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ happened and why he can't remember ♥♥♥♥.\n4. Even when you think you got things going well it can still go bad. The run I was the most equipped on was ended by a dogman who was hungry for human flesh, mine to be specific after he killed an npc and ditched the body. This keeps you on your toes as you sneak from building to building hopping to find a crowbar or bow or at least a lighter while the building doesn't give away under your feet and you fall to your doom or fall down some stairs and hit your head, breaking your neck and dieing right away.\nI live the game, also a great tip is don't take your necklace off, no gear, no matter how strong, is worth taking it off. If you need it that badly then make room for it.\nKeep your yellow canary lighter close by and what ever odd tool turned melee weapon and named "mr head basher" or "stabby stabby craby" or "I dunno what the hell to name this" ready to bash/Stab what ever wanders close enough at night, even a deer or bunny","March 7","true","14.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/recommended/248860/","chlorique","Chlorique Queas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chlorique/","696 products in account","TL;DR\nNeo Scavenger is a brutal 2D survival game set in a supernatural apocalypse where you try survive the wasteland of everything that wants, can, and will kill you should they ever get their claws on you. Also permadeath is on. A shining example of gameplay over graphics.\n\nGame Detail\nName: Neo Scavenger\nGenre: Survival, Strategic Inventory Management\nPersonal score: I never knew masochism and sadism was an art form till today. Fun.\n\nWhat is Neo Scavenger\nNeo Scavenger is a 2D survival game set in a hex based world where a devastation has happened to the world and well, apocalypse thing happen and you are a survivor of it. In first glance the innocent looking graphic and the non threatening looking trailer may throw you off on how brutal this game is but as people often say, 'you don't know hell till you been there' read on. Permadeath is on btw.\n\n1:Gameplay\nThe main gist of Neo scavenger gameplay is well, scavenging old ruins of buildings and forest  to follow the trail of barebone story. Each hex has a protection value from beeing seen, comfort and how alert you can be when something goes near you. Each of this stats can be improved by items, shelter and other craftable. A low protection from the enviromental will make your character slowly freezes during the night and if their body temperature is already low enough they will die. A low alert level will cause your character to not wake up when threats are nearby and bandits/looter/stuff can kill you in your sleep and you will die. A low comfort will cause your character to fight less efficiently and you might suddenly fall asleep and you will die.\n\nAdding to that, the map is hex form and you have a limited numbers of move during the day and far less during the night to move around, scavenge or perform one of the many in game action before needing to end your turn for the AI to move. On each hex you can scavenge supplies with city tiles having more supplies but comes at the increase risk of being discovered by bandits and obtaining injuries. Scavenging is extremely important in this game because it is your only way of getting randomized loots early game. Pretty much everything you need can be obtain by scavenging. Which might leads to a fight should you encounter bandits while on the move.\n\nFighting in Neo Scavenger is a game of chances and luck. A fully kited out bandit can still be defeated by you wielding nothing more than a rock but such a thing would of course take extreme luck due to the hidden diceroll system. Based on the perks you have chosen special attacks may not be available to you and only to the perk wielder. A few way fights can be resolve is through killing your opponent, dominating them and causing them to surrender or simply point your gun at them and watch them flee. Even an empty gun works occasionally to fool the AI seeing as in real life you would of course not attack the man with a gun even though its empty but you don't know that.\n\nShould you get wounded in Neo Scavenger you will have to treat them to prevent the blood loss from draining too much and yes it regenerates slowly. Wound treatment has their own special menu where you apply splints, bandages and meds to your character. Left unchecked a large wound has the potential to end your playthrough instantly. Also water and berries you collected are often time poisones because the game isn't hard enough. This might cause disease that has a similar effect to a tired status or in worse case scenario cause a total system failure which leads to your death.\n\nFrom all the materials you gathered from the scavenging you can use the crafting menu to create items. A wood with a sharp object will yield a spear that you can use to attack. Container with strings and stones will yield a noisemaker to increase the alert level of your campsite. Many other options exist for the player to find themselves.\n\nThe player character will also experience hunger and thirst which can be reduce by eating and drinking, failure to do so will lead to death. But as mentioned earlier, most of the water and food you find in the forest where the risks are low are poisonous and consuming them will lead to death.\n\nInventory management in Neo scavenger are quite realistic in terms of real life, your character has only 2 hands and thus can only hold 1 item in each hands without a bag. With a bag this frees up 1 hand for combat and allows more item to be carried but a bag is not your only means of carrying. Side pockets in pants, shirt and even a sledge can be found and use to help you carry more items which is especially important during end game where you often have to make far away expedition. Any item being held or use will eventually degrade before completely break down into nothing and in fact most of the things found in the wild are actually used goods and so they already have lowered durability. To beat the coldness of the night without a good shelter multiple cloths can be worn on top of each other to increase heat levels during the night and prevent freezing to death.\n\nThe day and night system is also quite important. During the day enemies can spot you from further away and the same holds true for you and the during the night the decreased line of sight cause your action points to be less that during the day.\n\nAs you traverse the deadly world of Neo Scavenger you might come across strange landmarks or building that will lead you to a random event. Success of survival and loot gain depends on the players perks chosen and dialog choices.\n\nAnd lastly the perks. During character creation you can choose several perks with perk points limiting the amount. The best perks are usually the most expensive but to help player with that negative perks can also be chosen that frees up point for more positive perks.\n\n2:Sound\nUtilizing more ambient noises instead of spoken dialogs the world of neo scavenger is truly brought to life, The forest shakes and the ruined city exhibit an eerie feeling as the player explores it.\n\nBut well, good filler is better than no filler.\n\n3:Graphics\nEverything is sprite based no exception. The characters are sprites, the menu utilizes sprites and even the backgrounds are sprites but like other sprites these are well done enough to pass the inspection. You can clearly tell what an item is at a glance which should be the most important thing in a survival game like this.\n\nAt least they do look pretty.\n\nConclusion\nYou will die a lot in this game. That is a fact and i hope i emphasized it enough. But the game definitely do not hold your hand at all from the moment you walk out of the facility till the next moment your guts spilled out from getting stabbed by an alcohol bottle. This game is intense. Fan of survival game should definitely get it.\n\nFInal verdict: Yes.\n\n\nTIPS!\nFIND A SHOE, SERIOUSLY.\nFIND SOME CLOTHES TOO WHILE YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THAT SHOE.\nYOU WILL DIE. AND IT'S PERMAD DEATH SO GET READY TO RESTART A LOT.\nBUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS....\ndon't eat those red berries.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nCheck out the Original Network Groups.

Hear me roar.\n\nI played for 14 hours, slaughtered COUNTLESS beasties, raiders and robbers. I killed something called a "melonhead" and I've slaughtered so many dogs I could wear their skins and pretend to be the wolf-man.\nIt was at that time - as I munched down another human steak, made on the desecrated remains of a man who had tried to steal my sled in the middle of the night, that I was assaulted. Well, it was actually while I slept after having eaten the corpse of the aformentioned adversary, seeing as time apparently stops when you eat things.\n\nIn any case, let me recount to you, the story of Philip the Doghide boy.\nPhilip, just as any man, awoke from cryogenic stasis in a secret lab, where he was quickly faced with a hideous creature screaming like the midnight wind 'cross a praire of bones so sharp as knives. And much like that praire of bones, the dogman was soon still and dead. You see, Philip was a total badass, and he vanquished this horrific beast with a few swift uppercuts and rock-hard right-left combos. The beast lay dead, and not satisfied with merely having sent this beast's soul to dogman-heaven, Philip decided that it's skin looked comfortable. He grabbed a shard of glass, cut it open and wore it's pelt - face and all, possibly while dancing to some trance-music and smearing cheap lipstick on himself. Naked. In front of a mirror.\n\nAfter that psychadellic trip, Philip wandered out into the wilderness, wearing nothing but the skin of his dead adversary. He was messed with. Attacked by rabid dogs and feral.. Dogs. And more dogs. This game has a lot of dogs. If you don't like killing dogs, this is probably not the game for you.\nAnyway, needless to say, dogs never really posed a problem for Philip. Philip had two good pairs of hands, and he had a shank made of glass in one of them. Philip was not to be ♥♥♥♥ed with.\n\nNow, Philip was a hulking mass of death, even when armed with nothing but a shard of glass, so I'll assume you understand what happened when Philip found a crowbar and a loaded shotgun in a shed. That's right. Philip turned into a lean, mean, psychopathic killing machine. This brings us to a dark chapter of Philip's life. The killing. The killing never stopped.\n\nPhilip was a soulless husk of a man, and that crowbar whispered sweet things in his ears at night. It craved for blood. Lusted for it. Philip was renamed "Philip Mordake".\nPhilip tried to fight it, of course. Philip was no murderer.. Philip merely loved to kill dogs, but that didn't matter. For each person that crossed Philip's path, the crowbar screamed. It pleaded, begged and demanded of Philip.. Terrible things. Great things. But terrible things.\nIt drove him to insanity, the whispering. The screams. They all melded together as Philip gave in to the crowbar's crazed yelling. He'd separate flesh from bone, and smash until there was nothing left but something that barely resembeled a human. He'd eat the flesh. Why not? Cut it loose with a shard of glass, and eat chunk by chunk until he was no longer starving.\n\nPhilip's path on this strange earth was carved from the blood and bone of any that entered his path. Any that dared touch his sled. Philip was a cruel God on this earth, his fury tempestous and his retribution violent and brutal as it was swift. He cut many a foe from existance, and wore their remains as trophies.\n\nThis brings us to the end of Philip's journey. For Philip had been surprised to wake up in the middle of the night, at the sound of somebody stealing his sled! That could not happen - no not at all. And Philip's recourse to this - though predictable - was a thing to behold. He knocked down that poor thief, and whaled with his crowbar until there was naught left of his adversary. Philip hadn't even been injured at this. He was in perfect health, and continued to be so as he smeared himself with the blood of his enemy (note; you can't actually do this in the game. You'll wish you could, though.) and sat himself down again. He dozed off, and once more awoke. This time, to the face of the very first foe that he'd faced.\n\nIt was a Dogman, looming above him like a gaunt, shadowy behemoth. The crowbar awoke. It screamed. It begged for blood, and Philip didn't have to be asked twice. He leapt for the creature! He cut it down, and bit it's flesh with that accursed crowbar time and time again! A hailstorm of blows weakened the beast, and it desperately slashed out!\n...\nPhilip was struck in the heart, and died immediately. And the crowbar fell from his hand, going silent.. It was just a normal crowbar.\n\nNow, you might think that's an amusing story. Or maybe you hated that story, but let me tell you what.\nI spent 14 HOURS. 14 BLOODY HOURS ON PHILIP.\nPhilip was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ED MONSTER! He was the toughest thing since diamonds armed with shanks in a cuban jail.\nHe'd survived battles with up to three opponents at once, and though injured, he'd come out on top.\nAnd now he just got killed instantly because of some fantastic stroke of good fortune for some psuedo-werewolf.\n\nThis game is interesting, but it's interesting for about 10 minutes. If you've discovered amazing loot in one house, you've basically found all there is in this game. Sure, there are random events and such, but very few of them actually lead anywhere. You're Philip, and you'll always be Philip. Not Philippa, or Sam, or James the Jive-♥♥♥ Jukebox Jockey. Philip.\nYou'll pick your perks, disadvantages and roll out. You die because of silly reasons or because you had a bad start. And then you have to start all over, without any progress having been made.\nAfter a while, it becomes tedious. It's not fun to micro-manage your campfire, clothes, hydration and hunger-levels, as well as spend the ENTIRE GAME TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP, I MEAN ♥♥♥♥. JUST FALL ASLEEP, MAN! YOU JUST MASSACRED AN ENTIRE VILLAGE!\n\nAll in all, I'd refund this game if I hadn't hate♥♥♥♥ed 14 hours of gameplay out of it. Do yourself a favour and look at a youtube-clip of somebody playing it without audio first. That will be your life in this game. Like what you see?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttwipeofdoom/recommended/248860/","buttwipeofdoom","buttwipeofdoom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/buttwipeofdoom/","74 products in account","I think this game is super unbalanced in terms of how much luck you need to get through it. It's really hard to survive combat without one of the combat traits but in taking combat traits you loose the survival traits that keep you alive over the long haul. It's not uncommon to spend a couple hours building yourself and your camp up up just to get wrecked by a dog you couldn't out run. Ultimately the scavenging and crafting are alright but the combat system is really what gets me. There is no consistant means of escape and no way to tell how much health your opponent has or has lost during the battle.\nOn a side note I'm really interested in the story elements of the game. I want to see the robot facility and I want to find out whats in the middle of the swamp but I just feel like I'm spending all of my time dealing with malnutrition and water poisoning. This is again another luck based flaw. If you can't find a tin can or a pot to boil water in your as good as dead within the first day or so. In all honesty I think the best way to fix that would be to have more set, consistent points in the game. That way I"m not forraging through settlement after settlement just to have varying results of survival gear, weapons or neurishment which leave the players superunder capable of surviving.\nMaybe I"m missing things that others figured out but there isn't even a tutorial system to introduce you to the interface.","May 11, 2015","false","17.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

A neat idea made unbearable by an inexcusably horrendous interface, glitches and things that don't make sense and completely break any immersion. More chore than challenge; would not recommend.\n\n- - - - - - The interface is absolutely horrible for no reason other than bad design. You're going to be clicking on things at least five times more than you have any right to. What's worse, once you explore the map a bit, the game begins to be unreasonably slow and unresponsive.\n- - - - Game suffers from bugs that have no right to be in the final product. For example, if you get exiled from the city, get a different tracking bracelet and try to get it again, the game will treat the new bracelet as the old one and won't let you back in. What's worse, the only way to get back is to literally wait (!!!) for an entire year of game-time (8760 turns).\n- - - - Unimmersive; for a survival game, surviving stops being any challenge whatsoever as soon as you reach the city outskirts and stay there. You can live safely and comfortably indefinitely while earning a shootload of money, and the only reason to leave safety is to push the story forward. Also, the character is supposed to be someone who got dropped into this post-apocalyptic world out of the blue, yet in the extremely limited NPC interactions he somehow already knows about things he hasn't even come close to seeing. The "crafting recipes found on random pieces of paper scattered all over the place" thing not only makes no sense, but is also largely useless as they more often than not show obvious things like "heat source + kindling = fire", or "binoculars + strap = binoculars with strap".\n- - - It's a wiki game; the game itself fails to give you even the most basic information about things for no good reason; for example, weapon reach, not to mention things like weapon damage, etc. The player has to look things up that he really shouldn't need to, and even then, the wiki itself doesn't bother listing a lot of useful information about a lot of things, which shows a lack of any real player interest.\n- Minimum in-game sounds, almost no music.\n~ Game might seem "unfair" to a lot of people who dislike dicerolling and are used to streamlined games. Some situation can simply kill you, and there's nothing you can do about it. Permadeath.\n+ A challenging and exciting early-game. Caution and risk management are needed, and running for it is often the correct choice.\n+ An interesting, strategic and tactical battle system, once you get the hang of it.\n+ Character creation is also interesting, which lets you choose traits and disadvantages (which let you choose more traits)","February 10","false","38.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You experience the life of someone in a strange, while still somewhat familiar world and you are left to what you can find to survive among a population that is more aggressive than passive. Friends are in a short supply, as are the means to adequately defend yourself from both the enemies of the world and the elements of it, two threats the game pits against you that are only outweighed by the threat you pose to yourself and your body's basic needs for survival.\n\nCan it look better? Probably. Does it need to look better? Absolutely not. Throw away what you think a game should look like and remember instead what a game should be, because that's what you'll find here. Certainly a selection for the determined as you will suffer inexplicable loss time and time again, but the constant struggle for survival make all of the moments of success you encounter, however many or few that you may find they be, all the more rewarding.","December 14, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No need to re-grind back up to level 200\n-Very atmospheric\n-Character customization is decent\n\nCons:\n-Very empty characters, only defining traits are those chosen at the start of the game. No real room for roleplaying.\n-Story is very difficult to uncover without multiple runs, and when you do uncover it, its also very empty and disappointing.\n-Music is so nonexistent that sometimes i forget its there\n-Dying is a bit unbalanced, explained more below\n\nIf i have a fur coat, with a backpack jammed with goodies, and im wielding a crowbar, i should NOT get killed by a half naked man with his bare fists just because he had the "Strong" trait. Also getting OHK'd by a dogman when im in top shape because he just so happened to swing at my upper chest and got a good hit in, causing me to go into cardiac arrest. This may be a roguelike but that doesnt excuse poor game balance by the developers.\nIll play this game from time to time when im bored but im definitely not jumping on this everyday when i wake up in the morning because im so excited to make ANOTHER empty character who i kill with alcohol poisoning because ive survived for about 5 years. (because thats how simple this game is once you master it)\n\nGame review aside, you should try Cataclysm DDA, its a free OpenGL game, and its wickedly addictive.\n\nRating: 5/10\nVerdict: Buy it on sale if you have nothing more important on your wishlist.","April 8","false","19.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game offers a whole lot of replayability, Making the map different, and enemy/creature spawns different every time.\n\nThis game is very old fashioned Text adventure like, All set on a hex based map, You decide what to do after reading the scenario given in front of you.\nOne of the core concepts of the game is... Well, To survive, And scavenge. (Hence the title.) I am going to say right now, that it can be a hastle, Having a huge chance to find something and only ending up with broken glass is a real bummer, But you can use pretty much every item has its use, Either in crafting, Or in a way that you'd need to figure out.\n\n\nYour start off, Selecting your character traits. You start with four basic ones, that are positive/helpful. You can select a few bad traits to get another good one, But honestly right now, The bad traits make things a living hell.\nOne of the funniest things I've read someone do, Is surrender everything to a bandit, And yes, EVERYTHING, To said bandit. The player had to go and chase the bandit down, naked and beat him up.\n\nThe fighting is a bit confusing, and the game could honestly use a tutorial, Showing the player how this works, That works, And even this. One thing im going to say though, is that the games art is great, Ambience can have you feel immersed, and everything. One of my favorite things about the game is finding new items and progressing on, Which has a glorious feeling once it happens, But when that ONE dog-man slashes your chest, Its all over.\n\nThis game is actually, very difficult. You can be rocking with great loot, walking around the mall with your coffee and suddenly theres something, you hide, And once you see what it is, Theres no way out. A dog man slashes you, Takes a ♥♥♥♥ on you, and your done. Game over. Time to start again.\n\nI honestly dont know why I wrote this, Probably because im tired and have nothing else to do, But I suggest you get this game and enjoy it. Its for sure, not for everyone, but im going to tell you, if you played Pen and Paper RPG's, Text adventure games, This is perfect for you.","February 6, 2014","true","12.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I first got the game on the 'Free Demo' mode and found it good fun. So, I invested the money and got the full version. There are quite a few improvments in the Full Version, but not really worth the proce tag. Still, I enjoyed the game for a good few hours, and once I reached the town in the south east corner of the map found that there wasn't really much else to do to keep you playing any further. I would either stick to the Demo, or wait for the game to go on sale. I would add too that this is a 'Early Access' game, so I am also looking forward to the 'Full Version' in the future ;)","December 5, 2014","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

This game is absolutely fantastic! I've played many games over the years, and I can safely say that this one is the best I've ever played. It ticks all the boxes for me:\n\n1. It's challenging. A game without challenge is pointless. When you first start playing, you will get yourself killed multiple times, in a variety of different ways. This will keep happening unless you engage your brain, and use the tools available to survive. Permadeath means that you can't afford to make mistakes, which makes the game much more intense, and progression is much more fulfilling. I wouldn't have it any other way. 10/10\n\n2. Gameplay. This game is a sandbox turn-based rogue-likeish RPG. Some may not like this sort of game, but I've played many games of this sort, and it's the best of the lot. Most of these sorts of games over-complicate everything, and gameplay suffers as a result. This is not the case for Neo-Scavanger! The sandbox element is the cherry on top - do whatever the hell you want to do. Perfect! :D 10/10\n\n2. Focus is on gameplay and NOT on graphics etc. Too many games these days look nice, but in reality they have no replayability or depth. Neo-Scavanger is the opposite - the graphics and UI allow you to play the game, they are not there to be pretty . It's graphics and art are still great though, proper old-school stuff. Also, there is the added benefit that ANY computer will be able to run this game. It's built in flash, so if your PC can handle some random online flash game, it can handle Neo-Scavanger no problem. 10/10\n\n3. Depth. This game is deep! I have been playing for a few days now, and I have barely scratched the surface. I've just about got the point where I can reliably survive in the wilds, and have yet to actually explore the world. The game is mysterious, it's hard to know what the game will throw at me as I continue to play, and I love that feeling in a game. 10/10\n\n4.Lore and story. I like anything to do with post-apocalytic settings etc, who doesn't? I havn't really played enough to comment on this aspect of the game, but from what I've played so far the writing and story is top-notch. 10/10\n\n5. Thoughtful developers who listen. Having read a few dev posts, it is obvious that they care about this game. They are very open to suggestions and discussion. 10/10\n\n6. Mods. I haven't researched the mods much, but I know that they do indeed exist. Always great to have that option!\n\nSummary: 11/10. Buy this game now! Even if you normally don't like this sort of game, give it a go! It's cheap ;)\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","53.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is truly unique and the odds are never in your favor. for example: you could have a pistol and the other guy could have a stick, and you might miss and then he gives you a sever traumatic brain injury. The combat may be just choices, but besides it being turn based, and besides only clicking options repeatedly, its still fun to scavenge and work your way up from having only your bare hands to defend yourself to having a camp, guns, and a good amount of other items. And it gets BETTER! Its so in depth that you could get an infection if you put dirty rags on your cuts, you coult get knocked upside the head and people will grab your weapons and kill you in your sleep, you could trigger booby traps, etc. this game has very good potential, and i dont think there is any way someone could mess this game up for me. some people think its boring? not me.

There's a bunch of bugs and design decisions that can make the game utterly trivial, and after a certain point there simply isn't much to do. And even if you aim for the far-away goals, the chances are a bug is going to ruin your save before you reach them.\n\nIt's not finished yet. But it is fun to play.

This game is absolutely fantastic! I've played many games over the years, and I can safely say that this one is the best I've ever played. It ticks all the boxes for me:\n\n1. It's challenging. A game without challenge is pointless. When you first start playing, you will get yourself killed multiple times, in a variety of different ways. This will keep happening unless you engage your brain, and use the tools available to survive. Permadeath means that you can't afford to make mistakes, which makes the game much more intense, and progression is much more fulfilling. I wouldn't have it any other way. 10/10\n\n2. Gameplay. This game is a sandbox turn-based rogue-likeish RPG. Some may not like this sort of game, but I've played many games of this sort, and it's the best of the lot. Most of these sorts of games over-complicate everything, and gameplay suffers as a result. This is not the case for Neo-Scavanger! The sandbox element is the cherry on top - do whatever the hell you want to do. Perfect! :D 10/10\n\n2. Focus is on gameplay and NOT on graphics etc. Too many games these days look nice, but in reality they have no replayability or depth. Neo-Scavanger is the opposite - the graphics and UI allow you to play the game, they are not there to be pretty . It's graphics and art are still great though, proper old-school stuff. Also, there is the added benefit that ANY computer will be able to run this game. It's built in flash, so if your PC can handle some random online flash game, it can handle Neo-Scavanger no problem. 10/10\n\n3. Depth. This game is deep! I have been playing for a few days now, and I have barely scratched the surface. I've just about got the point where I can reliably survive in the wilds, and have yet to actually explore the world. The game is mysterious, it's hard to know what the game will throw at me as I continue to play, and I love that feeling in a game. 10/10\n\n4.Lore and story. I like anything to do with post-apocalytic settings etc, who doesn't? I havn't really played enough to comment on this aspect of the game, but from what I've played so far the writing and story is top-notch. 10/10\n\n5. Thoughtful developers who listen. Having read a few dev posts, it is obvious that they care about this game. They are very open to suggestions and discussion. 10/10\n\n6. Mods. I haven't researched the mods much, but I know that they do indeed exist. Always great to have that option!\n\nSummary: 11/10. Buy this game now! Even if you normally don't like this sort of game, give it a go! It's cheap ;)\n\n","December 29, 2014","true","53.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the first hours, my character would die from starvation or dehydration or either get killed because for some reason Dogman(s) love to hunt me down. However on the second day I used the crafting page, and started to read some of the information at the wiki. This went on until I succeeded making the right character with the necessary traits to fortify my base and create alarm systems, and as well as foraging and hunting and making traps, producing clothing and distilling and sterilizing water, and also going beyond to even cure cooked meat with salt(ash).\n\nSo far I think this game is realy really what I always wanted from an apocalyptic role-playing game. There is freedom of choice, and also a pretty large map and simulates even in a small platform a deep experience for anyone, who want to feel like role-playing in this large area infested with looters and bandits, predators, and hidden quests.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/248860\n\nI would really recommend you to try this game out, and also help the developers to finish the game and add more content into it. I am really impressed on how much they have managed to squeeze into this game. In my books the developers have scored 10/10 in gameplay and also the healing/medical system and the metabolism and other addictions and features which mimic the human body is outstandingly simulated.

But seriously, this game is brutal. One second you'll find yourself punching up a melonhead, then going to sleep, and dying to a dogman. Extremely unforgiving and luck based. If you find what perk to pick up thought, (Mine are personally Melee/Strength, Trapping, and Ranged), you will survive longer. But the more and more I play this game, the less and less diverse I get. This is due to most of the skills being utter ♥♥♥♥. If you want to actually survive, you got to pick trapping. If you want an early ranged weapon, you got to go ranged. This is a big problem, for the game doesn't really support the other lesser traits very often. Still, a fun game that I became a psychopathic murderer who eats the flesh of humans in.","June 19, 2015","true","26.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It would of been a much better choice to have the player kill the person in the apartments or take it over or anything, but I think you have to avoid a lot of things in this game to actually be able to enjoy many aspects of it, because scavenging and surviving just won't do it alone for anyone.","April 27","true","17.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is the game in its entirety. I've played several survivor horror games in the past and I was looking forward to something different. Text/ turn based survival horror appealed to me.  At first, you kinda have to get used to the controls. Click this tab to do this, click this tab to do that. Click this button to turn off the text so you can do the only thing available to do. Speaking of, skills in this game are pretty much worthless.\nYa, some skills actually do stuff. Melee does help in combat, you can Hide while you explore the map, Botany gives you more loot to choose from in forest tiles, some cutscene you use tracking to reveal more text about something that happened when they just could have told you in the first place what happened. Other skills don't matter. Mechanical and Hide give you the ability to scavange buildings safely but reduce the probability of loot while scavenging.  Medic give you the ability to scavenge for medical supplies in the spawn point and gives you better healing but if you don't have any medicine ...who cares!\nYour best bet is to hit the road and gather as much as you can to help you survive. The very first town you find will give you a cutscene and a little back story and that's usually it. Most times than not, this town is empty of stuff to take. So, you move out and explore the area around. And as you wander, in the cold and rain, you start suffering from hypothermia. You "could" build a fire but in the thirty five- fourty games straight that I played (because you almost always die within the first two in game days) I've found a lighter twice.\nNow, as you reach near death due to freezing to death , you get a cutscene about an abondoned car. The car has a sleeping bag inside and if you use the Tracking skill, you will find one left boot. You can grab the sleeping bag and carry it to your camp, which camps always attract dogs, and if a dog or a soldier doesn't come into your camp and kill you, you can sleep for a few hours and warm up . But that just slows the inevitable. For the only out come for this game is..... you'll freeze to death with one left boot.","April 28, 2015","false","12.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's sometimes too unreasonable to die and what it offers you is mostly scavenging around which gets quite repetitive after some time. It's hard to understand why anybody would like such a game too dependent on inventory management. Crafting is painful to me. When I try to consider the game content and atmosphere, I feel like it lacks certain aspects, there's nothing really interesting compared to other post-apocalyptic games.\n\nI'm really sorry to say this game is a disappointment to me.

It is personally one of the best turn-based stratgey games i have played. You can really get emersed in this game trying to survive by keeping all of your stat conditions at the best they can possibibly be. NEO Scavenger is a great game that you can play over and over and never get tired of it because its different almost everytime (except for locations i think they stay in the same place I have a really good playthrough atm so im not sure). The traits that you can get at the begining of the game can really help or hurt you depending on what kind of playthrough you want to do. All in all, Neo Scavenger gets a 8.5/10 in my book.","March 30, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

First steam game I have ever seen do so, and feels sorta cheap, not what I was expecting for the price. The menu controls are a little clunky. For a survival game, I wasnt expecting to get the same linear story line every time I play, and although the map is random every time, and big, it's annoying knowing the correct play-outs of every critical event in the game each time.\n\nMy biggest issue in the game though is just how bad combat is balanced, your average battle goes like this; You: Stabbed the guy 14 times with a glass shard. Enemy: Trips you, trips you, trips you, trips you, kicks while down, kicks while down, punch, your dead. Game over, you lose everything.\n\nCause you know, stun locks are awesome, especially when NPCS get them and you get no counters to them.","December 18, 2014","false","8.6"," 14 of 31 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","14","31","0","0"

Let me just sum up my buyer's remorse with two points on why I do not recommend this game:\n\n1.) It plays as badly as it looks -- turns out this isn't one of those indy 'ugly duckling' games that have outdated graphics but excellent content and playability.  The graphics, story and gameplay are all sloppy.  Not to mention the previews are misleading.\n\n2.) The game relies purely on difficulty to make this a survival game, lacking any of the richness I was expecting given the high praise among the Steam community.  One would expect that a game rated so highly would have sacrificed looks for content, and it certainly is lacking in both -- instead it's a series of instant-death by storyline misadventure or because the character is about as hardy and resiliant as wet one-ply toilet paper... despite being 'tough'.\n\nI wanted to have some nice things to say about this game, but I really can't find anything worth the $15.  I would argue this should be considered no more than a $2 curiosity than a game worth the developer's asking price.","January 17, 2015","false","15.9"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","1"

(<- my favorite example because it really represents just how bad the game design gets at stages). at least you can customize your character and equipment.\nit's a shame that you don't see anything of the world and story because what i really like about this game is that it somehow still manages to be immersive.\n\nthis game is for people who love micromanagement and boring repetitive stuff. definitely not a game for someone who's into story and exploration and adventure.","December 19, 2014","false","34.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

There is no effective way to organize one's inventory.  It's a huge mess of items arranged by size.  It's nearly impossible for a player to understand what he has at any given time.\n\nThis would be forgiveable if the gameplay was decent, but it's not.  Combat is a complete mess.  I found myself trying to avoid combat because it is simply too much of a hassle.  There is almost no information given about the foes, and who wins is pretty much a crapshoot.\n\nI have nothing good to say about this title.

I really did. I'm a fan of roguelikes, but this game tried to be both roguelike and linear at the same time. You start in the same place every time, and while that wouldn't be an issue, it's always the same scenario. That's the issue I have - I don't play a roguelike to do the same tired story missions over and over. It has some pretty unique elements to it, but the things that aren't good really ruin the game for me. In most roguelikes, I accept the sense of permadeath and the inevitability of some unfair losses, but this game takes it to another level, stranding you with little to no resources and then giving you a disease that can only be survived through either extreme luck with the RNG or a very specific item. It'd be different if it was avoidable, but you can contract it simply by getting close to the enemies that carry it - and a nearly unavoidable game-ending feature like that doesn't make for a good roguelike.","October 27, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

I know there are j@ck@sses on steam who will say things like "btr ply sum x 2 wn" or "git gud" or whatever. I say: screw you. I don't have half my life to dedicate to learning one game when I have a job, girlfriend, real life friends, no acne, don't weigh four hundred pounds of flab, don't have a mushroom growing from my belly button due to poor hygenie or a sh!t bucket. Kudos if you get the reference.\n\nAnyways;\n\nTip One:\n\nPermadeath as an option rather than a default. It's a great concept but most gamers aren't hardcore gamers. Your average run of the mill gamer is going to be either a kid or an adult with a small bit of free time to spend with nothing else to do. Hardcore gamers are out there but they're not as numerous as they like to think they are.\n\n\nTip Two:\n\nExpand the crafting system. Right now it's only possible to build a tarp shelter as a method of keeping out of the elements. Base building would also be nice. But what about doing things like using that tarp to fix up a building? Perhaps not make it impenetrable but make the building a little more livable. Also; for the love of god... MAKE THE TARP SHELTER SMALLER IN INVENTORY! Sorry but I wasn't aware that a tarp wasn't a foldable object and thus couldn't be any smaller than the largest 'vehicle' in the game.\n\nTip Three:\n\nActual vehicles. We see them in Detroit on the map so why not have them elsewhere as ultra-rare loot that needs constant maintenance? A truck for example could provide a large amount of advantages and disadvantages to someone using one. It would make stealth much harder when the player needs to sleep but it would also cut travel times drastically. Besides; what if NPCs had vehicles? Vehicles in better shape to chase down an enemy or to take hits? Either way; vehicles would be an awesome addition.\n\nTip Four:\n\nI can feel the nerd rage about to assault my comment box already. Put in a difficulty system. Yes; making a video game is an art but still your consumer base isn't going to get any bigger by making the game harder. Some players just want to play for the story. Others are in it for the challenge and even still; some like myself like a mixture of both but not extremes.\n\nTip Five:\n\nHere we go. Companions. Maybe not companions capable of combat but at least something like a horse or mule to carry about equipment. Humans have done this since very early in our species's lifetime. Why not have our protagonist able to do it? It provides another dynamic such as: what do I put on the mule? Do I put survival gear on the mule and keep my loot close or do I do the opposite? How much ammo should the mule carry? How much water? Food? Wood for a fire?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood luck. Git gud.","April 25","false","33.3"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","5"

No skill or tactics to employ, just plain old luck determines whether you'll live each day. Combine this with permadeath, and you find yourself stuck replaying the same day over and over again, having about as much fun as Bill Murray did when caught in the same loop.\n\nI'm being serious, you can fall, cut yourself, and die of blood loss just from *walking* if that's how the dice roll (advancing in combat carries the chance to trip and fall). Whether or not you find shoes and clothes in time to keep warm and not die from hypothermia, pure luck. Whether you wake up in time to defend yourself before an enemy kills you in your sleep, pure luck. Whether you can actually get to sleep because it's random whether or not you'll find a sleeping bag and it rains constantly... again, luck. Whether your very first fire started in a burnt out office building because you are hiding from the rain with nothing but a hospital gown and a large stick attracts an entire pack of feral dogs who you literally have zero chance against... need I go on?\n\nThere's just no meaningful interaction. All of your equipment wears out shockingly fast and it's a crapshoot whether you'll find a replacement. At times it feels like a miracle during an encounter just to close the gap to an enemy without tripping over yourself and falling to the ground before you can poke 'em with your spear. Start a fire to keep warm and attract an enemy you aren't ready to deal with. Lay low and hide, die of hypothermia. Damned if you do and damned if you don't. Either option is viable based solely on luck. You're not playing a game so much as just watching the unluckiest man on Earth die over and over again.\n\nThere is no character progression. You know how to make everything right away. Just put all of your swag into the crafting table and whatever can be made is instantly available. However good you are at fighting and surviving from the moment you wake up is as good as you're ever gonna be. All of your equipment has a ridiculously short lifespan. So even if you find a really good anything, don't get attached. Even crowbars wear out... CROWBARS! Solid bars of pure steel... wear out.  Seriously?\n\nThere's just no feeling of accomplishment. None. If you manage to survive for a week, it's not because you did anything right, you just got lucky. A first playthrough can net you shoes, cargo pants, a hoodie, a multitool, and a saucepan after 12 hours of scavenging. A second playthrough can net you a cut arm, 200 pebbles, a handful of poison berries, and 3 shards of glass after 12 hours of scavenging. The player is reduced to the role of spectator of the very short and uninteresting life of some guy named Phillip.\n\nWithout engagement, without meaningful choices to make, without progression, there's just no game here.\n\n","January 23, 2015","false","43.2"," 38 of 94 people (40%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","40","38","94","5","7"

There is just so much they could do here.  Combat feels granular and staisfying, while at the same time being crazy-lethal if you're not careful.  The loot you find feels like you're struggling to survive, and the crafting system is elegant.  Character creation is simple, but offers meaningful choices.  It's got a LOT of good stuff in it.\n\nBut the main game also wants to have a story.  And that main quest line feels kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when it's next to what would make a fantastic open-world survival game.  Since death is frequent, and often from kinda unfair places, having to redo the same quests over and over is unsatisfying, to say the least.  And I'm not a hundred percent sure if the game has magic in it or not, because it sure seems like it sometimes, and that clashes with the flavor of a sci-fi wrecked earth.\n\nOh, the deaths.  Man.  I have died a dozen times at least from starting a game, and freezing to death before I can find shoes.  I have died because I can't find clean water, or anything to boil water in to sterilize it.  I have died from a single lucky gunshot.  I like how lethal the game can be, but I do not enjoy at all how arbitrary it feels at times.\n\nAlso, the demo thing.  The demo shows off a scavenging system where each city tile has multiple things to search.  Do you check the storage shed, which may have nothing but is pretty safe, or do you go for the high rise, where you might get jumped, but could have a lot more left over?  The main game has one thing to search per tile.  Choice : eliminated.  Just right out the window.  I cannot, in good faith, recommend a game where the main game takes AWAY choices.","September 28, 2014","false","17.7"," 12 of 39 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","12","39","0","7"

This is essentially a text-based game. The only way you know things are happening is by reading the log. You have buttons presented to you that are options. When you click the button, the log updates. Nothing else happens on the screen. Even if you win a combat, the only indication is from the combat log.\n\nThe graphics are awful. The UI layout is haphazard. There are lots of slots and buttons that make no sense. For example, when you are in your inventory, there is a red X in the upper corner, which usually means "close window", but in this case it does nothing and has hover text that says "Current cursor mode. (1) Take (2) Drop (3) Use." What? I was able to drag a lake and forest around in my area inventory. Why? The game allows you to hang yourself constantly. It never seems to help or guide you to an appropriate choice. For example, it will let you start the game without picking any traits!\n\nCombat seems to happen randomly, and is a baffling ordeal. If you just click "Confirm" and have no action selected, your enemy will alternate between charging at you, advancing, leaving himself open, etc. No clue what's going on, there. I could never figure out how to eat. When I right clicked on berries in my hand and "used" them, they fell apart in my hand. Huh???\n\nOverall, this game is a complete mess, even if you can get past the crude graphics and terrible UI.","March 31, 2014","false","0.5"," 5 of 28 people (18%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","18","5","28","2","0"

And that's about the limit of its positive qualities.  It's biggest and most glaring flaw is the 'erase your save upon death' feature.  That's right boys and girls, they PURPOSEFULLY designed this game so that if you die once, if, oh say, you cant find better clothing within 8 hours, or you encounter a creature, or you take off the silly little necklace you start with, you will die, and whatever progress you have made is erased.\n\nThe idea of a hardcore mode has it place, but in a game that offers such a chance for exploration, that offers such a detailed crafting grid, the FORCED, non optional hardcore mode is a terrible idea.  Want to play the game to explore, see the world they created?  Too bad.  You either blitz the story, or die once to either bad luck or bad enemy design, and poof, congratulations, all your time and effort has been destroyed, and you get to do it all over again.  I suppose this is probably someones idea of fun, but it isn't mine.  I honestly regret making this purchase.  If you're looking for a GOOD survival style game, get Project Zomboid.","June 20, 2014","false","11.6"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","6","31","0","0"

Beyond that its rather easy to stay alive. Remarkably easy really.\n\nThe trailor vidoes hint at every decision potentially resulting in life or death but ive had very little trouble from noisly ransacking every building or storage unit i come accross with a crowbar and lighter. That might change however if i can ever light a fire... but of course ide need a tiny slip of paper to tell me how to use my lighter to start a fire and by the time i find that ill realise that I dont have the appropraite skill to start fires. Meanwhile Ill have alrleady hacked 2 laptops and a plethora of smaller eletrical devices to gain access to more or less nothing but a GPS that isnt neessisary because my map allready points out exactly where I am.\nBasicly I would give this one a pass for now, keep an eye on it though more features are bound to come out in time.\n","February 2, 2014","false","19.5"," 18 of 62 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","18","62","0","0"

At no point have I ever been glad I purchased it. At no point will I recommend this game to my friends. I will recommend NEO Scavenger to child molesters, terrorists who spill American blood, and women who call grown men 'hun' because they deserve to suffer. This is not a game for people. NEO Scavenger is a device used to test if a player is human or not, much like the Voight-Kampff Test. Time spent interacting with his horrid program will only expose a player as being a poorly made simulacrum, a hollow mimic, who is not truly alive, because real people play real games.
