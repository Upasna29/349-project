"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tealazure/recommended/12120/","tealazure","Azu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tealazure/","381 products in account","San Andreas is one of my all-time favorite games, and for very good reason. It's a fantastic entry to the series, with enough content to keep you occupied for weeks. That's not even including the highly populated and still, very much alive multiplayer mod (SA-MP) and the plethora of other mods you can obtain for this amazing game.\n\nHowever, since Rockstar is so hell-bent on ruining the PC user's experience, I can't recommend the Steam release of this game. The latest patch has removed a number (18, to be specific) of key songs from the once fantastic soundtrack. There is still no 1080p support. Previous save files will no longer work and you -will- more than likely crash if you are playing this game with a dual-monitor set up. Although despite these downgrades, at least they were 'kind enough' to implement very basic Xinput support, so you can play it with a controller. Woo.\n\nRockstar has all the right to do this. The removal of once available songs makes sense due to copyright reasons. You can't exactly sell your product when it contains content you no longer have the license to use, let alone monetize. But when the game is deliberately patched to take away content that users have already paid for, and to hinder the experience once again, you're just hurting your PC fanbase. Which, I suppose is nothing new if you've played any PC release of Grand Theft Auto post-GTA3.\n\nThe best way to enjoy this game is to purchase a retail copy. It'll probably be cheaper, it'll look good on your shelf, you can mod it by default all you want, and you won't have any of your content patched out without warning. With that said. Don't bother buying any other GTA games on Steam either. If they've already removed content in one title, then expect it again in the future from other installments of the franchise when licenses inevitably expire, or can no longer be obtained.\n\nTL;DR: Great game but ruined by Rockstar's anti-consumer attitude. Go buy it elsewhere for the full experience.","November 7, 2014","false","0.1"," 1,180 of 1,314 people (90%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","90","180","1","23","7"

It increased the scale of the previous GTA games and introduced addictive RPG game mechanics into the series. Samuel L Jackson as officer Tenpenny is some of the best celeb casting in a video game ever. This is a game that precedes the dumbing down of AAA gaming, where the mass market was encouraged to enjoy a complex and sometimes difficult title.\n\nSadly, I can't recommend the game in its current state. Rockstar has decided to gimp the soundtrack by removing several important songs that contributed to the atmosphere while roaming open world. This would be a hard sell even if they only did this to new customers, but in my case they have removed songs that were once in the game that I paid for. The situation is unacceptable. It underpins the ridiculousness of license agreements, when they make a title worse for all the paying customers, while leaving those who download the title illegaly with the experience as it was originally intended.","November 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 663 of 726 people (91%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","91","663","726","11","0"

The cities you get to explore are Los Santos which is based on Los Angeles and does a really good job with detailing the area and putting the ghetto into it and makes you feel like you actually live in the hood. You have the countryside between Los Santos and San Fierro and feels like you live in California with its lush forests. San Fierro which is based on San Francisco also does a good job and feels like a believable Bay Area city, The dessert between San Fierro and Las Venturas feels like a realistic mojave desert and is perfect(especially if you're a fallout fan) to explore. Las Venturas is based on Las Vegas and does an amazing job with its neon lights and casinos to make it a realstic metropolis. The game mechanics in this game are very heavliy improved from Vice City because you can now see your target's health and driving feels more loose in SA. You have gang wars which are pretty fun and lets you recruit your own gang members and take over other hoods by playing a little survival mini game. The soundtrack is amazing in this game and is very believable and feels you are actually living in the 90's and is my second favorite soundtrack after Vice City. Oh and using the jetpack is so much fun. Now the flaws on this game is that even though GTA SA is challenging it is also has very tedious missions, especially missions that involve using an airplane. Those missions are terrible, not fun at all and have the worst controls that I have ever seen in a video game. The story is flawed in many ways too and there is some character flaws here and there but the story isn't bad at all and it's very deep. The characters are also memorable too and good voice acting from Samuel L. mutha♥♥♥♥in Jackson. Yes he plays the main antagonist which also gives this game another +. Like I said earlier, this game is challenging and tedious at times but it's very rewarding and that's what makes a good video game. This I would say would be my favorite GTA game after Vice City and this game was worth playing through till the end and is a masterpiece.","November 26, 2013","true","43.4"," 513 of 591 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","513","591","0","7"

It took nearly 10 years for Rockstar to add true controller support (November 2014) and even that is mediocre at best. It's worthy to note that in the November 2014 patch, Rockstar disenfranchised its current customers by unnecessarily removing content and apparently stripping out higher resolutions options. The patch also caused the in-game graphics to appear worse (though this could just be isolated to my experience). Overall, the steam version of GTA San Andreas is more like the "Frankenstein version” and I wouldn't recommend it to those seeking the authentic GTA San Andreas experience. If you don't mind your game constantly transforming on you, then I suppose this version may be for you. Rockstar's track record of poor GTA PC releases undoubtedly continues with their latest revision of this great game.\n\nRecommended Fixes/ModsFor those who already own GTA: San Andreas on Steam, you should consider installing "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - Enhanced Edition" mod per the Steam User Guide: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=382803643.

I love it to the point where I own both the physical copy and the Steam version.\nBut recently, Rockstar made a patch that is just absolutely unacceptable.\n\nHere's what they did:\nAdds Xinput controller support (Xbox 360 controllers)\nNow this is good. But it's the only good thing about the patch.\n\nMakes “Steering with Mouse” enabled by default\nThis is an odd choice but usually I'd let a quirky design choice like this slide as long as it's toggleable.\n\nRemoves several songs from *all owners* and from future purchases (the same ones that were removed in the mobile version)\nEven if certain licenses expired, it doesn't excuse outright removing certain songs from the game. The physical and retail versions still have them, are they gonna get banned globally now? Of course not.\n\nRemoves several resolution options, including 1920×1080\nThis is the worst part of all. How the ♥♥♥♥ can anyone defend this? At least with the last part I could kinda see where they were coming from copyright-wise, but they're straight-up removing features from the game for absolutely no reason.\n\nLoading a saved game starts a new one\nAgain, absolutely unacceptable. What good does it do to literally break the save feature of a game?\n\nFinal verdict: Please, if you haven't played it already, either buy it physically or pirate an older version of it. This version is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that no consumer should ever deal with. Rockstar is never getting another penny from me, and it's such a shame that I need to do this with GTA V coming out on PC soon, but I cannot support any companies who think it's a good idea to literally REMOVE CONTENT FROM YOUR GAME FOR ABSOLUTELY NO ♥♥♥♥ING REASON. ♥♥♥♥ YOU ROCKSTAR.","November 8, 2014","false","5.0"," 68 of 73 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","68","73","0","0"

This game will  guarantee an authentic groove life experience. The way you make contact with this life, it's one of a kind. It's not all about thugs, drugs, thefting and many others like these. It becomes really funny when you discover such a large world, a replica of early '90 years, in which you can transform this game into a role-play one. You will feel me after you will play it. They brushed every single object, excluding the sky-scrapers. You can even enter in some gigantic boats of army.\n\nI bought this game for almost 3 euros. I did because it was the game I was obsessed to play when I was younger, like 4 years ago. I even gifted few to my friends. This game has been a massive impact upon Action Games; a tremendous jump from GTA Vice City; no one would have expected such a real game.\n\n\nNow some particular issues:\nPro:\n- huge map; so well detalied;\n- plenty of characters you will make contact with;\n- variety of vehicles(tanks, choppers, boats, cars, bicycles)\n- many missions, all achievable;\n- sound track, voice lines between characters;\n- weather types, all again neat;\n- good radio stations, well suited to that period;\n- you can find more by playing it.\n\n:Cons:\n- nothin' ;\n- just to fill this space- this game has lost its delight because many gamers now play only by their attention given to graphics details. I know it's an old game. Still, you don't know it untill you don't play it.\n\nAll in all, shall you ask yourself if you should buy this game? No, just do it right away. It's not expensive, not by a strecth. It's a neat game, it calls you!

It's been almost 10 years since this game was released! That was quite a long time ago. And to see it released after Vice City it was a big deal. Seriously, the game employed at least 10 times the area Vice City had. And here there are 3 different cities available not to mention the countryside in between these. This game is huge and just by completing all side missions you can easily go over a 100 hours of gameplay time!\n\nThis game still did not have any physics as in order to get the next gen feeling we needed to wait for the 4th instalment of the franchise. But this is not a problem as in case you look at it as Vice City's successor you can appreciate what San Andreas offers: greater playable area, hundreds of vehicles, minigames, car modifications, gang wars and the ability to purchase clothing, tattoos and even to have your own haircut.\n\nI had only an issue with the game's RPG elements: for some reason some stunts are not available at first and you need to keep driving a car until you unlock the next level. To be able to sprint further or have stronger punches in melee you need to visit the gym often. From time to time you need to eat but junk food will soon make you obese. So you need to visit the gym again. These side activities stole some of my time and I never liked paying any attention to them but I had to. I liked how these were skipped in the next episode which, unfortunately, skipped the car modifications and this is the only GTA with bikes in it! And to date, in my opinion, this game has used the best voice actors in the series: Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Ice T and James Woods just to name a few.\n\nThis is a classic and if you like the "old" GTA games but for some reason skipped this one now is to time to purchase it. Or when it's discounted as 10 bucks is a bit too much for such a title but I'm sure the price will soon drop.","June 14, 2014","true","0.3"," 47 of 53 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","47","53","0","0"

Rockstar removed radio tracks due to liscensing issues. Admitedly these changes are pretty minor, but they're in conflict with the game's core remaining audience.\n\nIt's an old game. Folks who play old games like the idea of those games staying the way they were or not changing without their direct involvment (i.e. content/graphic mods). Furthermore, when they do make changes to their games they generally put content in rather than take it out as Rockstar has done here.\n\nOn the side of rationality though, fans will probably unofficialy patch those tracks back in eventually and this version of the game now has 360 controller support. So it's kind of a mixed bag.

Numerous songs have been removed from the game for licensing reasons (why not only remove them for new purchases?) and widescreen support is apparently gone as well as some resolution options?\n\nI managed to pause the download and create a backup of the game, I think I've lost the songs but I still have an old, slightly-modded exe which allows for 16:9 at 1080p and most importantly: the ability to load my old saves.\n\nWhat Rockstar did was callous, and unforgivable. This will definitely harm consumer confidence, but they probably don't even care.\n\nAs much as I want to get GTA: V, I'll probably avoid it or wait until it's on sale a few years down the line. I mean, can we really trust Rockstar? What next? They downgrade GTA: IV?\n\nIf you want to find out more about the latest patch, read the other reviews that go into detail and provide a removed song list.\n\nAlso, if you really are thinking about buying this game, I wouldn't blame you if you "find" it available somewhere around the internet (I don't even support piracy, but in this case I'll make an exception).","November 12, 2014","false","138.2"," 39 of 41 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","39","41","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/12120/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","My childhood mostly consisted of drawing, stuffing my face with sweets and of course, the PS2. At that time, I was given two games, both in the same series, being GTA: Vice City and of course, GTA: San Andreas which was pretty new for it's time. I instantly fell in love with both games, what with both of the game's poop-crazy storylines, well developed and memorable characters and of last but not least, the multiple crimes that will rack up those classic wanted stars!\n\nSadly, I had lost this game a while back, due to moving and such and I was absolutely devastated. Looking for an alternative, I stumbled across Steam, with it's little miracle of putting the entire GTA series bundle on sale for an unbelieveably cheap price.	 I immediately smashed £20 into my steam wallet and hastefully slammed that purchase button and I've never looked back. This game astonished me, what with it's massive and immense game world it has. The chunk of data on that one compact disc still amazes me to this day.\n\nGoing back to the hood, as Carl 'CJ' Johnson a young representant of the Grove Street Families, an African-American street gang and one of the oldest street gangs in Los Santos, San Andreas. ''After five years on the east coast, it was time to go home.'' was the exact words from CJ's mouth, as he arrived to pick up his luggage at the L.S Airport. His motive remaining clear, after he received a call before the planned flight from his older brother, detailing that their mother had been murdered by a mysterious hustler. Giving a warm welcome by his grieving older brother and sister, along with his two Grove Street comrades, Big Smoke and Ryder, you soon find yourself spraying graffiti, drive-by shooting, exploring the far and wide sprawling sun-drenched state of San Andreas, popping some caps in the asses of the corrupt ''bustas'', and of course putting other sworn rival gangs in their place.\n\nThe gameplay on foot is top-notch. Interactivity with NPC's and overworld objects are very simple and the character animations are clear and very personified. Though the driving in this game is what I found a little problematic, what with the controls being a little messed up, but it's hardly noticeable over the irresistable charm the game has at it's repetoire.\n\nI definitely recommend a controller for this game. Since, it's argueable to say that again, I found the controls somewhat 'sloppyish' and a little finicky, with just using a mouse and keyboard.  All the while it does feel just right when using a PS3 controller, if you can wire that up to your PC's controller port. Truly adds to the nostalgic flare, since the reminiscence of both the Dualshock 2 and 3 controller.\n\nThe only problem I've recently discovered is that a notorious patch has bestowed upon this classic game, thanks to Rockstar and now I believe that this game is now unmoddable and a handful of songs have been removed due to legal copyright reasons, which kinda sucks now.\n\nNow looking back, I still do recommend this game, but not so much for Steam now. Definitely either get it on the Playstation Store or the Xbox Live Marketplace.","September 28, 2014","true","12.7"," 66 of 85 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","66","85","3","0"

That's not censorship and damage control at all.\n\nWell, San Andreas is one of the best games ever. The Steam version of San Andreas IS NOT the game you played ten years ago though. This would certainly be a positive review, if not for the latest patch (November 7th 2014). That update has REMOVED 18 songs (including tracks from NWA, 2Pac, Rage Against The Machine, Ozzy Osbourne and Tom Petty) and HD support from a game you owned for years. Yes, you read that right. A patch removed content you PAID FOR when you bought the game. That such a thing is legal and was allowed by Steam, says a lot about the current state of the game industry. It sets a very dangerous precedent.\n\nNot only that, but the patch has also pretty much changed the game into the iOS/Android version - buggy, often crashing, with low resolution - and yet, bugginess is not as bad as REMOVAL OF CONTENT.\n\nWhile the game is pretty much the Game of the Decade for the '00s, I CANNOT with a pure conscience recommend it to anyone in the current state of affairs. I'd even go as far as saying that Rockstar has fallen down from one of the best game devs to EA-level.","November 8, 2014","false","21.7"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

Just download an emulator and use the PS2 disc. The main reason I say this is that the most recent update has not only removed 16:9 resolutions from the game entirely (despite a previous patch fixing 1920x1080p resolution) but they have also removed many of the songs which made this game's soundtrack absolutely iconic.\n\nSongs removed from which stations:\n\nRADIO X\nOzzy Osbourne - Hellraiser\nRage Against The Machine - Killing In The Name\n\nK-DST\nJoe Cocker - Woman To Woman\n\nPLAYBACK FM\nUltramagnetic MCs - Critical Beatdown\n\nBOUNCE FM\nThe Gap Band - You Dropped a Bomb On Me\nFatback Band - Yum Yum (Gimme Some)\nRoy Ayers - Running Away\n\nRADIO LOS SANTOS\nN.W.A. - Express Yourself\n2Pac - I Don't Give A F*ck\n\nK-JAH WEST\nBlood Sisters - Ring My Bell\nBlack Harmony - Don't Let It Go To Your Head\n\nMASTER SOUNDS 98.3\nCharles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band - Express Yourself\nThe Blackbyrds - Rock Creek Park\nThe J.B.'s - Grunt\nMaceo & The Macks - Soul Power '74\nJames Brown - The Payback\n\nSo as you can see, a lot of superb songs were removed, and the only good thing to come from this update? Xbox 360 controller support... which in consideration, isn't worth the tradeoffs. I'd rather stick with MKB and keep all my songs.\n\nThe only actions I can recommend regarding this game is to go onto Amazon and buy a new copy of the game (£4.99 at the time of this post(£5 cheaper than this poor excuse for a game)) and while your 1080p res will still be broken, it will exist, and you'll have the full compliment of the original songs.\nThe only downside to this? You have to have the disc in the disc drive to play it. I can live with that though, considering what's been done to the digital version.\nOr you could just pirate the game.","November 9, 2014","false","101.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Put your pitchforks away and hear me out for a sec.\nI love this game. This was the game that changed gaming back when people were mad that you played as someone not white. I played this game from hours to days on end and it is still one of the best games out there.\n\nUnfortunetly a recent patch destroyed it in multiple ways, the main reasons being...\n1. Due to Rockstar's legal papers expiring they removed all music from the game.\nRock, Paper, Shotgun  goes into it a bit better than I can.\n2. This created an odd bug with some of the cars causing cars to... act up or bug out I guess.\n3. The update destroyed all save files. It wouldn't matter if your buying it but still.\n4. For whatever reason the resolution was messed up and now "don't quote me on this one" you can't play at 1080p and the game wasn't made to be played at a lower resolution making it look like sh*t.\n\nOverall I have to say, WTH. I mean this isn't going to remove the songs on Xbox or ps2. And the songs are still on all mobile copies of gta. So why only pc? *sigh* Rockstar. I'm somewhat scared if they are going down the same path as Ubisoft with the bad choices they're making and their 'Social Club' you need to sign up to play newer Rockstar games.\n\nIn the end, your better off getting this game on mobile, witch is an odd thing to say for me because I hate mobile gaming but any smartphone can now play it, so might as well.

It's one of the first games I sunk over 100 hours into, and even more so with the many user mods released over the last decade or so, including two multiplayer ones and the CLEO mods. I figured I'd grab it on Steam a couple years back for convenience instead of continuing to use my scratched up disc copy. But a recent major patch for this game actually strips away content rather than add any. It has removed 1920x1080 support, 17 songs from the great soundtrack (most likely because of expired royalty/copyright), and replaces most of original menu/HUD with the mobile version similar to the recent Android/iOS releases of this game. You can find the full list of changes elsewhere.\n\nI only wrote this as a warning to any friends who may not be aware of this recent change and add a negative review to that column on the Steam store page.

Because of this, I cannot recommend the Steam version of Grand theft auto: San Andreas upon download.\n\nPoor Business Decisions\n● Resolutions Above 1680x1050 Are Not Supported. Upon first downloading Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, resolutions above 1650x1050 are not supported. If you would like to go higher, you will need to download an older version of the gta-sa.exe.\n\n● No Steam achievements. Users of the Steam service have been lobbying for Steam achievements for San Andreas for years. Here we are, almost 10 years later (at the time of writing this review) and there's still no Steam achievements. The slap in the face is that Rockstar Games released an "HD" remake of San Andreas in 2014 for Xbox 360 with achievements.\n\n● 2014 "Update" Savegame Incompatibility Issue. On the 7th of November 2014 Rockstar released a "patch" that not only removed 19 songs for all users who legally purchased the game, they made all game saves created before that patch incompatible with that version, corrupting them along the way. This is quite serious as some individuals invest hundreds and in some cases thousands of hours into their save files only to have them get corrupted. Then again, you would think anyone that spends hundreds if not thousands of hours on their save would have backups, wouldn't you? This brings up the question if they're going to pull this stunt with Grand Theft Auto IV or Grand Theft Auto V a few years down the road.\n\n● Controversial Removal of 19 Songs Featured In The Original Release of The Game!\n\nOn the 7th of November, 2014 Rockstar Games removed nineteen songs featured in the original version of the game, released on the 7th of June, 2005. The controversial business descision is that they didn't leave these tracks in the game for the users who have legally purchased this product before the 7th of November. So to this into perspective, Rockstar Games has essentially removed a great deal of content that users of the Steam service have legally paid for.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nWhen Grand theft auto: Vice City's music licenses were about to expire back in December of 2012, Rockstar Games removed the licensed songs from the game but allowed every user who purchased Grand theft auto: Vice City before December to keep their songs.\n\nList of Tracks Removed From The Steam Version:\n\nBounce FM\nRunning Away - Roy Ayers\nYou Dropped A Bomb On Me - The Gap Band\nYum Yum - The Fatback Band\n\nKDST\nRunning Down A Dream - Tom Petty\nWoman to Woman - Joe Cocker\n\nK-JAH West Radio\nDon’t Let It Go to Your Head - Black Harmony\nRing My Bell - Blood Sisters\n\nMaster Sounds 98.3\nExpress Yourself - Charles Wright\nRock Creek Park - The Blackbyrds\nFunky President - James Brown\nSoul Power ‘74 - Macer & The Macks\nThe Payback - James Brown\nGrunt - The JB’s\n\nPlayback FM\nCritical Beatdown - Ultramagnetic MC’s\n\nRadio Los Santos\nI Don’t Give A f*ck - 2 Pac\nHood Took Me Under - Compton’s Most Wanted\nExpress Yourself - NWA\n\nRadio:X\nHellraiser - Ozzy Osbourne\nKilling in the Name - Rage Against the Machine\n\nI cannot recommend this product here on Steam and heavily recommend going elsewhere to obtain this product.","November 11, 2014","false","22.6"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Along with that I can't use weapons when the mouse doesn't work and the default keybinds in this version are horrendous.\n\n- Lack of 16 by 9 resolutions, though I seem to have 1280x720 and 1600x900 resolutions.\n\n- No intro video, not a game breaking thing but why remove it from the newer version I have no idea.\n\n- Some music removed from the game. This is unstandable due to licensing issues, again nothing game breaking, although it is for me as sometimes entering cars will make the game crash\n\nBefore the update the game ran perfectly fine, if you really want to get this game, try and pick up a retail copy second hand somewhere, that way, it is "optional" to have updates on the game.

You play as Carl Johnson, former banger for Grove Street, who returns to Los Santos in San Andreas after several years.In San Andreas, the gang warfare system, is an interesting addition, allowing you to control territory and push out rival gangs. San Andreas has more of a focus on building the Grove Street gang into an empire, which was different from the way Vice City played. The soundtrack is pretty cool and there are newer features from previous GTA titles, such as muscular changes as you build stamina, or gaining weight from eating. San Andreas has a great storyline, memorable dialogue, and a kick ♥♥♥ jetpack you can steal and fly around on. Graphically it is better than Vice City, but not as smooth looking as GTA IV.  Though it is 10-years old, It is still fun to play and worth your time if you are a fan of the series.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/recommended/12120/","arbayer2","arbayer2 <BCI/TBfB>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arbayer2/","393 products in account","Frankly, GTA: San Andreas is the game which got me interested in the franchise. Extremely well-written, expansive, innovative and incredibly fun. CJ is one of the strongest characters Rockstar has ever developed, along with the rest of the character list. The voice acting is incredibly well-done, the music selection is (or was) second only to GTA: Vice City in my opinion. The variety of things you can do in this game is arguably second-to-none in the entire franchise, which helps Rockstar in its portrayal of a truly open world.\n\nThe graphical stylings, while outdated by today's standards, still please the eye and many parallels can be seen between this game's environment and that of Grand Theft Auto V's more recent version of Los Santos which I can't help but think about as I play this game. GTA V's environmental design would undoubtedly have suffered in my opinion had Rockstar not made GTA: SA previously.\n\nOverall, I'd consider it a must-play for anyone interested in sandbox games, GTA as a franchise or... hell, historically notable games. This game is widely considered one of the best of all time, which makes sense, considering it was the best-selling PlayStation 2 game ever.\n\nHowever, the Steam version has just been updated (after several years with no updates whatsoever), and there are a few unfortunate setbacks I have to point out for people who are considering buying the Steam version.\n\nYears ago, Rockstar updated GTA: SA for Steam with version 3.0. Among some bugfixes and miscellaneous improvements, the patch somehow inexplicably broke 16:9 resolution support entirely.\n\nThis problem is still around in the latest patch, which, if you're like the majority of PC owners these days and have a 16:9 widescreen monitor, will mean you will encounter letterboxing and a lower resolution than your monitor is capable of rendering. Only with an unofficial modification can you get around this, and it's deeply disturbing that Rockstar still hasn't noticed this problem yet.\n\nAlongside this, Rockstar, apparently pressured by music publishers whose tracks they licensed for GTA: SA's soundtrack, has removed somewhere around 20 tracks from the game entirely. This was done retroactively, meaning that previous owners of the game before the latest patch, like myself, have no choice but to play the game now without musical content they purchased.\n\nIf you don't play GTA games for the radio stations, this may not impact you as much, but regardless, Rockstar's approach to enforcing licensing restrictions with this patch was in my opinion heavy-handed at best, criminally deceptive at worst. It can set a precedent for AAA publishers to unilaterally remove content at will, and while the change of content with/without notice is disclosed in most games' EULAs these days, that just doesn't work in an economic system where one pays for the ownership of a good.\n\nSome of the artists in this game I first found out about thanks to GTA: San Andreas, including Helmet, Rage Against The Machine, NWA, Eazy-E, Ice Cube and Public Enemy, and it's a little heart-breaking that the game no longer reflects my childhood memories of it after a decade, with some of my favorite songs conspicuously absent. These are songs everyone who bought the game before the update paid for.\n\nRockstar hasn't even mentioned the update at all on their website (par for the course, though, they're very sporadic with their PR), or on the News page on Steam for the game, so I'm not sure whether or not they were even going to announce this. We shall see what happens.\n\nI will be fair and include the latest patch's implementation of (apparent) DRM-free implementation and XInput control support, however. The XInput implimentation is not perfect but still playable and hopefully it is beneficial to people accustomed to GTA console controls.\n\nBasically, if you try using an Xbox 360 controller's triggers for throttle control for vehicles similarly to GTA IV you've got your work cut out for you, as all inputs besides the thumbsticks are treated as digital buttons including the triggers. This makes it very difficult to regulate the speed of your vehicle in my personal experience, which is extremely important in multiple missions. Other than performing steering with thumbsticks, I gained absolutely nothing in playablility because of this but was still capable of beating the game.\n\nIt's due to these less-than-ideal changes to the game, as playable as it still is, that I cannot recommend you purchase the Steam version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, because at the end of the day you get less content than you would have had a week ago for the same price (at the time of writing) and have no choice in the matter. You owe it to yourself to find an original retail version with the soundtrack and resolution compatibility completely intact, at least then you won't be forced to update the game according the whims of music industry executives.\n\n(As the update to the game was very recent and may change in the future, I will accordingly update this review if things develop further.)","November 9, 2014","false","82.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

After years away from his old mates, he goes back to Los Santos to attent to his mother's, only to find himself back into the life he desperately wanted to get away from.\n\nUnlike Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City, the gameplay hasn't aged at all. Anyone who played IV or V will know what to expect, as it is the basis for every new GTA title. You can climb anything you want, look anywhere you want without the camera bothering you, interact with pedestrians, climb a mountain with a bike and much, much more. It's not about what you can do, it's about what you can't do.\n\nAs this is the first 3D open-world game ever to have multiple cities, it leaves a lot to be expected. Fortunately, it does not disappoint. The cities (Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas) are incredibly huge and detailed, fiddled with minigames, side-activities and crazy characters to spice up the formula. All accompanied by a large countryside for you to look for the Bigfoot explore.\n\nWhen you attach all that with an awesome licensed soundtrack that takes cues from dozens of different genres with the voice of Samuel L. Jackson himself, you realize that this is a game like no other. The world that Rockstar created using this engine feels like a living charicature of 90's USA, even if it's held back by the game's primitive visuals. It's just one of those rare videogames that everyone just needs to experience atleast once in their lifetime.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GidGeigs/recommended/12120/","GidGeigs","Gideon's Streaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GidGeigs/","236 products in account","The Grand Theft Auto series is like comfort food. It's one I've always been able to go to for reliably charming characters, enthralling story and gameplay, with presented moments leaving me curious to dive in and see what's new and exciting.\n\nSan Andreas is not an exception to this! In fact, in my books, it defines those exact values.\n\nAs far as the story goes, the protagonist returns to his hometown, where he then finds his family and friends going downhill. Then framed by two high-ranking and corrupt policemen, he's on the run getting into all sorts of hijinks and shenanigans, traveling far and wide meeting and getting involved with all sorts of interesting characters!\n\nSimply navigating the variety of environments in the vehicles provided feels good. The weight of the cars is just right and though the friction their wheels provide against the ground could be called a little slidey and difficult to maintain, it's rewarding to feel yourself master the way it works as the game progresses, both through in-game stats and your own technical ability. The gunplay isn't anything too special, but every weapon does what it should and there's one or a few in every expected category (though some are definitely outside of what you'd expect) for getting the job done and more.\n\nThere is absolutely no shortage of missions, and while some can be stubborn, every one is fun in premise. It's important to be careful, because any one mistake no matter the size can screw the whole gig over and cause you a lot of time! On missions where you're driving somebody important, which there are many of, flipping the car upside-down will cause it to catch on fire and, in time, explode. The person inside won't leave, and instead will sit there waiting for their demise, giving you a long time to think about how much they must hate you and an even longer time to think about how much you hate them. If you fail a mission, to try again you must make it all the way back in the world to the starting point... and this can lead to awkward and tedious situations, since some missions can take you pretty far away from where you began. Not to mention that if death is the cause of defeat, you'll lose all your guns and some of your cash you could use to help get them back! Any indoor segments can be clunky and frustrating, with the game's on-foot mechanics of navigation and battle noticeably designed overall to work better outdoors. It adds a good amount of pressure to not screw up when you know things can go wrong at any time, but it can be hard to keep sane when half your mistakes can be so easily blamed on the game!\n\nWith missions put to the side, there's still much to play with outside of them. The world is full of things to do like play basketball, pool, or arcade games; you can go racing, disco dancing, gambling, or do some work as a paramedic... and that's just the start! The protagonist can change and be customized in many different ways: you can fatten him up with junk food, buff him up at the gym, get him tattooed at the tattoo shop, change his clothes to your liking, or take him to the barber for a trim! (Or an afro, seemingly straight out of nowhere?) While one of the few things you can't change about him is what he says and how he acts, throwing him in a pair of boxers with hearts on them as he goes about his business will seem to change his tone a bit. On a bit of the downside, there are a lot of collectibles, with no clues as to where they would be, all over the place in odd locations. This is an absolute pain to anybody who's picky about getting everything done, but resources can be found online which list the location of every one, and if it's not something important to you then know that you're not missing out on much! All rewards are something nice to have, but are pretty much all superfluous, as you can already obtain just about everything they offer otherwise. (There are a few exclusives, but still, they're nothing fun or exciting, only helpful, so don't worry!)\n\nFor the age of the game, the graphics stand up well to the test of time. Not in their realism, but in the style they are consistently represented in. Everything is solid from one thing to another, and the world is beautiful to look at from every angle, though it shines especially when everything can be seen complimenting one another at once from a distance! Indoors the attention to detail can be lacking, especially in some of the mission-exclusive locations, but you'll be finding yourself outside most of the time anyhow, and it's nothing that will break the experience when you aren't.\n\nThe soundtrack consists of licensed tracks, and is represented through the different radio stations you'll hear while driving, which offer from one to another a good selection of just about anything anybody could be into. It sticks true to the early nineties setting, the list of tracks being full of nothing but memorable songs! Each radio station has commercials brimming with heavy satire, alongside an eccentric disc jockey who chimes in every now and again. There's no shortage of both hit classics and hidden gems which anybody should be happy to hear again or to be introduced to. It's all top-notch, and compliments the time you'll spend in cares quite well! Even if you don't like what's presented, since this is the PC version of the game you can add your own tracks into the game if you'd like, which will have their own radio station.\n\nFor anybody new to the series, I'd suggest this being the place to start. To get through the story alone takes fifty to sixty hours, but if that seems like a bit much, don't worry! It'll be hard to notice the time flying by when there's so much fun to be had. With a wide variety of weapons, vehicles, side-games, and a gigantic world to play with all you find and gain within, the game lives up well to the title of the series, which even outside of context gets to the point: it's grand, there's theft, and loads of auto! ...Auto meaning, y'know, automobiles...","October 31, 2015","true","59.0"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","0"

The main thing i've noticed is realy weird video mode. it now supports only few resolutions and all are not bigger then 1280x768. The next thing i've noticed is a crash from the main manu as you try to go into "advanced" video settings. this way I cant setup a normal resolution. Some folks also report such stuff like missing songs, textures and so on.\nThe thing is that they've put a silly port from Xbox 360 into steam instead of the original PC version.

Rockstar's decission with the latest "patch" is very much a slap in the face as well as running contrary to what they did when Vice City found itself in a similar situation (expiring music licenses). It is inexcusable and needs to be fixed.\n\nThat being said, the game in it's present state is likely unplayable for a myriad of reason. The recent update is effectivly forcing you to use the same 'HD' version they was released for mobile devices, which gives you texture issues and problems with 1080p resolutions (not to mention broken controller and mouse support).\n\nTo actually play this game, you are now forced to downgrade it to a previous version.\n\nThe game itself, all current issue aside, is still a classic GTA game for a reason. And if you can get a non-Steam version or just simply downgrade this one, it is worth your time to play. However, I will not recommend buying this game until Rockstar either fixes the things they broke with the latest "patch" or issues an apology for how this was handled. If this is how they treat an older game, what's to stop them from doing the same with GTA IV or V?\n\nEDIT: I feel I should clarify, in case someone sees my playtime and calls it into question. I have owned this game on the PS2 for many, many years and have sunk many hours into that version. So yes, I am experienced with this game, but have only recently gotten it for the PC for various reasons (mostly my being lazy and it having been gifted to me by a friend who got it from preordering GTA:V).","January 19, 2015","false","4.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitjob_playpoker/recommended/12120/","quitjob_playpoker","Makki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quitjob_playpoker/","1045 products in account","San Andreas is a third game in "3D Universe" which was heavily based on real-life events such as rivalry between Crips, Bloods and Hispanic gangs, crack epidemic, Los Angeles riots and severe police misconduct in LAPD which involved unprovoked beatings and shootings, stealing and dealing narcotics, planting of false evidence, frameups and bank robbery. It is one of the rare games that features black character as main protagonist. Besides San Andreas, I can only remember that The Suffering and GTA V did it.\n\nMap is almost four times bigger than its predecessor, and consists of 3 big urban areas Los Santos, San Fierro and Las Venturas which are inspired by Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas respectively. Countryside in game effectively serves as a 4th area due to its large size and diversity. There are many recognizable landmarks (which are named different) such as Area 51, Hollywood sign, Hoover Dam, Golden Gate bridge and many others.\n\nYou play as Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns to Las Santos after spending five years in Liberty City when he hears about his mother's murder. He finds his life very hard immediately upon arriving. Relationship with his brother "Sweet" is cold since he accuses him of leaving the family and friends. Crack addiction has affected many in his neighbourhood, and on top of that he gets on Frank Tenpenny's radar, a corrupt LAPD C.R.A.S.H. officer. Situation is grim, and he decides to rejoin his former gang, to get brother's approval and help making things better.\nWhole getto vibe and jargon are omnipresent, they are delivered through excellently written dialogs and voice acting. Besides CJ's Groove Street Families, other gangs include their arch enemies Ballas, Vagos and later in the game Vietnamese Da Nang Boys, Triads, Russians and three families of Italian Mafia.\n\nGang wars becomes a thing later in the game when you need to defend your territory when enemy gang tries to take over. If you successfully do it, members of your gang will hang out in the area, and you can recruit them for helping you in missions. Stealth elements are also incorporated from Rockstar's previous game Manhunt; there are couple of missions which were specifically made with stealth in mind.\n\nRole-playing elements are new part of the series. You can visit the gym and learn hand-to-hand combat, work on your stamina by running or driving bike and build up your muscles by lifting weights. It has effect on your appearance which is important because you can date girls, and not all of them love the same thing. Muscles will open you a way to some of them, while others won't appreciate it at all, so you'll have to visit fast food restaurant to gain some fat. You can customize your looking by getting different haircuts, clothes, jewellry and tattoos.\nRPG elements that have effect on the gameplay are in driving and handling firearms. The more you drive certain type of vehicle or use specific weapon, the more you excel at it.\n\nSwimming and diving are also introduced, so you don't have to be afraid of water anymore. You can even pilot a plane after acquiring license for it. Bicycle, offroad vehicles such as tractors and combine harvesters, even jetpack and using parachutes are now on the table. There are driving, bike, boat and pilot schools which will help you learn many tricks.\nFor those who love to hunt for hidden stuff, there is a plethora of it. Original 100 hidden packages are replaced with spray paint tags, but in addition to them there are hidden camera shots, horseshoes and oysters which will keep you preoccupied.\n\nMy favorite side activities in the game were definitely street races and trucker missions. There are over twenty street races and they include cars, bikes and aircrafts. You are given specific vehicle for each of them and you compete against 5 AI opponents. They are absent in aircraft races, they just consist of getting through checkpoints in a certain amount of time.\nEight trucking missions are separated into three types; delivering cargo within certain time limit, delivering illegal cargo whilst being pursued by a police with a three or four star rating and delivering a fragile cargo without damaging it. There are eight missions in total that successively become harder by having tighter time limits, stronger police attention or easily damaged cargo, all that by covering larger areas to reach destination. Last two missions are combination of fragile and timed objects as well as police attention, and can be quite challenging.\n\nThere are 11 radio stations in the game with over 10 hours of material. My favovite one is WCTR; Rockstar is always spot on with satire used in talk shows and advertisements, laughing is therefore guaranteed.\nVoice cast lineup is led by phenomenal Samuel L. Jackson who gives voice to main antagonist. William Fichtner and Danny Dyer reprise their roles from Vice City as Ken Rosenberg and Kent Paul, while the rest of the cast include James Woods, David Cross, Peter Fonda, Wil Wheaton and many famous rappers.\n\nGame has sold over 27 million copies by 2011 and remains best-selling PS2 game of all time. It has been remastered and ported to many other platforms. It is the last game in "3D Universe", Rockstar launched a new canon ("HD Universe") with GTA IV and GTA V.","May 20","true","60.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","13","15","2","0"

This is not okay nor is it legal. There is no law that forces or even allows any company to retroactively steal music from customers who legally purchased it while the copyright license was still active.\nPutting up a new copy of the game online so that new customers don't get the expired songs music is how this should have been handled, but they had no right to remove the songs from copies that were legally purchased by the end user while the license was still active. I can't believe they would be this stupid and lazy.\nIt's no different than if they illegally hacked your X-box to remove access to the songs from the hard copy of the game or if a music company hacked your computer to erase some MP3 files that you bought and downloaded because the publisher lost the license for some of the songs on it.\nThis was illegal for Rockstar to do, there is no licensing law that forced or even permitted them to do this. This move was entirely on them and I expect they will have a class action lawsuit on them for it in the near future.\nRegardless of what they would like to believe, no ELUA makes it legal for them to do this.

The game itself is amazing although with a few issues. The most apparent issues are with compatibility, mostly on Windows 7, 8 and 8.1. Problems ranging from audio and graphic glitches ... screen/game freezing .. to mouse controls not working properly. Same as in Vice City. But you could expect these for an old game and many (if not all) can be fixed by adding fixes, workarounds and mods. Now I remember how my friend bought me this game over a decade ago. The huge amount of content ... cool story ... I had lots and lots of fun. To this day I still own the DVD and I even got my girlfriend to play it. And she loved it too. So I thought I would have digital copy just in case something happens with my DVD. An added bonus is also that you do not have to deal with RGSC in this game. But just like Vice City it suffers from licensing and how Rockstar treats digital distribution of games. Because you DO NOT OWN IT when you buy it here, you just borrow it. They change the game when they wish and as recent events have shown they can remove stuff. Songs, options, fixes and in this way also all of the mods made throughout the years. In this case they swapped it with a mobile port entirely. And this will go on in the future. So as time goes your copy of the game on Steam gets worse and worse ... while old disk copies (like mine) and even pirated versions remain the best quality available. THIS is why I do not recommend buying it here. Which is a shame because it is one of the best games I have ever played and mods just made it even better. Most of those mods got invalidated when they switched the normal version with this clumsy port. Yes, you can download files to return it back to how it was. But then what is the point of having a legal digital copy if you need third-party files. Very very disappointing.","May 24, 2015","false","0.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Well... Barely\n\nRockstar's recent unannounced patch that they released to the PC version of the game has ruined the game for me.\nWhat are the damaging changes, you may ask?\n\n-Multiple songs have been removed from the game's soundtrack (Id assume this is caused by expired licenses, which is something i could understand)\n-Removed higher resolution options. I believe this was an issue back in the day, which got the game updated with higher resolution options, why on earth would they remove this later?\n-All save games prior to this patch are no longer usable. If you try to load a save prior to the patch, the game will start off new and fresh. And oh lookie, me who spent hours and hours trying to get 100% and finally did it, until a month later the save gets destroyed\n\nThe only GOOD thing this hidden patch gave was simple controller support\n\n\nIve known this game for ages, and it has been a classic for many years, but since this patch, i would recommend anyone to refrain from buying this off steam, and grabbing an old CD instead, that doesnt get sudden patches 9 years after release\n\nEDIT:It seems that this version crashes or freezes more often during loading\nI ended up losing 30 minutes of progress because the game had frozen, and this has happend 3 times now","March 12, 2015","false","172.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","1"

After an Introduction Sequence CJ gets to meet several old contacts such as his older brother Sean "Sweet" Johnson,his sister Kendl Johnson,and his old gang mates Ryder and Big Smoke. Several plot twists bring CJ to the cities San Fierro and Las Venturas,where he does Missions for several old and new contacts.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe player starts with getting dropped off in a district of Los Santos.In the beginning the Player has to do a few Missions first to unlock all the World's content such as clothing shops,hairdresser's,tattoo and gun stores,restaurants and tuning garages. After unlocking the whole content the player is able to find the mentioned features all around the map.\nWith playing the Story missions,the player starts to unlock more of the map,such as the countryside around the cities as well as the cities San Fierro and Las Venturas themselve.\n\nThe player can travel through the world of San Andreas by using cars,bikes,motorbikes,boats and later even helicopters and planes.\nFor fighting,the game offers a big amount of guns and other weapons that can be found all over the map or bought at one of the several gun stores.\n\nThe game also includes several minigames such as races,lowrider competitions and dance contests.\n\nAtmosphere:\n\nThe Game's World attracts the player with a realistic,plausible setting and map.\nEleven Radio Stations can be heard while riding a vehicle,also players can do their own radio by dragging mp3-files into the user files.\n\nConclusion,Pro's and Con's:\n\nPro:\n- Funny and addicting gameplay\n- Huge,beautiful and interesting map\n- Cool characters\n- Interesting story about betrayal, family and the Drug War between Gangs\n- Huge amount of weapons\n\nContra:\n- Sometimes weird and unplausible moments in story\n- Car and motorbike stearing got much worse than in the prequels\n- Irritating Minigames\n\nConclusion:\n\nGrand Theft Auto: San Andreas is a funny,addicting Game which has a huge amount of content and is absolutely worth buying. Although it sometimes has it weak moments,most of the time it is awesome to play!\n\nRating: 90/100\n\nImportant!\nThe stearing of cars,motorbikes,etc. gets better the longer you drive em'(driving skills improve with time spent riding the different types of vehicles),but without cheats it takes a while to get 'pro' on driving a car!","June 26, 2014","true","17.8"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","6"

I had only one friend. That friend introduced me to the world of GTA. My first GTA was Vice City. That game was a true experience. It made me feel all tingly in the places I now pay women to lick and suck. Results, unfortunately, cannot be compared to the pleasure Vice City gave me. And then my only friend said:  "♥♥♥♥♥, negro, wait till you play San Andreas."\n\nMY ♥♥♥♥♥♥ GOD\n\nThat game wasn't like anything I played before. It was bigger, faster, better. It had everything my developing body and mind needed. Rockstar had always been great with writing plot and making cutscenes but they outdone themselves in San Andreas. It had it all. Gang wars, bouncing lowriders, classic rock, sunset over the desert, robbing the casino, murdering harlots to get your cash back, etc, etc.\n\nI mean, you started as a low gangbanger from the ghetto with no rep, no name and then BAM you're stealing a fighter jet from an air carrier just to blow Russian spies to kingdom come. Is there anything better? Of course not, you ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI've been playing it with my mouth open and my underwear leaking with j1zz. From blastin dem balla fools through exile from Los Santos, passing  THOSE MOTHERFUKING DRIVING AND FLYING SCHOOLS,  stealing a jetpack, all the way to blastin balla fools again that game was just... just... it was... DAYUM SON IT WAS THE ♥♥♥♥♥, NIQQA, IT WAS THE ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI played that game not long ago and I know whatchu sayin,  "Ah but shiee, dawg, dat game is hella old and it looks terrible and check muh CS:GO skins, shieee."  If you do that and please follow Robin Williams' example and ♥♥♥♥♥ KILL YOURSELF. This game has flaws, yes, but it is, even today, one of the greatest achievements of game industry.\n\nSuch names as CJ, Sweet, Cesar, Kendl, The Truth, Toreno,  motherfukin Tenpenny  are part of my life. They will stay with me forever. That game shaped me. Made me a better man.\n\nFinal Rating: ★★★★★\nThat's right, beyotch. 5 motherfukin stars.

Here I was , thinking that the whole idea of patches was to make a game better. Instead what do we get? Lower resolutions , black screen freezes and dubious controller support. Wow , thanks I guess, I'll just mod it for 1080p and to use analog triggers for gas/brake on my 360 controller. What is that R*? I cant? Your brilliant state of the art update made all the mods incompatible? Well at least I still have the great soundtrack. What? I dont have that either? You have removed some of the best songs because you were too stingy to pay royalties?\n\nIRONY ALERT:\nCJ actually sings fragments of some of the removed songs when left idle  ("You dropped a bomb on me" for instance )\nR* advertise the PC version of GTA 5 having 160 songs more than the console version and at the same time they remove songs from the other game set in the same city.\n\nPersonal note:\nI bought this game in hopes of reliving my adolescent years but I guess that was too much to ask for.  I have been now stuck on Fender Ketchup  , the scare-o-meter fills up but nothing happens. That is if the mission starts at all , most of the time the game just freezes when walking into the mission blip or the casino.\n\nTL;DR: Not modable, less songs , glitches and freezes.  Dont buy this crap , in this state this is like a beta version of the game we used to know and love. We are paying the same amount of money for less content , which hardly seems fair.","December 11, 2014","false","51.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I did about 3 playthroughs with lots of side-missions and stuff. This game is truly a masterpiece. Everyone who has played it before knows, i guess. But here a 3 reasons why you shouldn't get it on Steam.\n1: Due to a recent patch, Rockstar has removed around 12 songs (as you can see in the other comments) and removed 1080p support. This is causing some game breaking glitches.\n2: No steam achievements. Seriously, why?\n3: ♥♥♥♥ed up PC controls and mouse support. I know it has always been like that but, as we all know, Rockstar doesn't care about PC gamers.\n\nCome on Rockstar, Give us the Remastered San Andreas Version for PC.\nWith little effort, much profit.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/core93/recommended/12120/","core93","core","http://steamcommunity.com/id/core93/","131 products in account",""One of the greatest games ever made."\nThat's what I said about Vice City and that's also what I think about San Andreas.\n\nThe game is set in the nineties in a fictional state called San Andreas. You play the role of Carl Johnson (CJ), who has been living in Liberty City. But then he got a phone call. His mom was killed by a drive-by. He rushes home to Los Santos to do honour to his mother. Back at home he has to put in work for his hood. A cycle of violence begins: drugs, gang wars, corrupt police... Welcome to Los Santos!\n\nWhat GTA San Andreas delivers is classical GTA gameplay with many improvments:\n- the huge world with 3 different cities, smaller towns and varying environments like desert, farmland, forests, hills\n- an amazing shooting and movment system compared to Vice City\nYou can duck, swim, dive, climb on rooftops etc. Which gives you a new feeling of freedom\n- there is even a bigger variety of vehicles: bikes, bicycles, sport cars, SUVs, pick-ups, boats, helicopters and planes!\n- customisation: tattoos, clothes, hairstyle, tuning cars\n- RPG elements: you have to eat, you can level up skills\n- many details and mini-games: robbery, basketball, video games, billard etc.\n- amazing music: especially rap music (nwa, 2pac, ice cube, eazy-e), but probably not as good as Vice City's music\n\nThe story of GTA SA is okay, but sometimes confusing and hard to follow. I also think that parts of it are a bit over the top. However Rockstar Games did a good job connecting the story of Vice City, San Andreas and GTA 3. They also did a good job with the characters.\nSome of the missions are a bit annoying, but overall the missions are very good. I really like the addition of stealth in some of the missions.\nRockstar added a lot of details and mini-games, which often made me wonder: "Wtf? You can really break into a house and steal TVs? This game is amazing!" I love such moments.\nWhat I also really liked was the hood part of the game. Getting green shirt, rag and shoes, spray a car in green, call your homies to join you, drive through other gang areas, provoke a gang war... even if the KI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and could have been improved. Of course it's a matter of taste and actually not the whole game is about the hood life.\n\nConclusion:\nGTA San Andreas offers so much content, that everyone will get countless hours of fun out of it.\nIf you haven't played it yet, go get it now or you'll miss a part of video game history!","July 30, 2014","true","156.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

If it wasn't for the downgrader i'd not recommend it. Now, to the review.\nOld, but gold. Simply the best.\nYou all know of this game, if not, you were born too early. It's one of the BEST open world games EVER. The story is great, map is huge, there is MYTHS and LEGENDS and EASTER EGGS everywhere. The mod community is the BIGGEST in the world. Songs are GREAT. The whole soundtrack is perfect. There is an unofficial multiplayer mod "San Andreas: Multi Player" which is better than GTA Online. I just wanna confirm this game is great.

The updated removed songs form the radio station people report about broken save files and they even removed resolutions... i play on a 1366x768 and they dont even have that resolution... i think they have four or five resoltions you can choose from and if you have a higher resolutions that what gta sa gives you then to bad you have to play on one of the lower resolutions.\n\nAlso my game freezed up by trying to enter the pizza shop close to grove street! What i never had a game freeze up on me and i have played arma 2 and 3 farcry 4 assassins creed 4 and many more and i can play them just fine but i cant play a 10 year old game without it freezing?\n\nAlso people have reported that you cant mod gta sa no more... why the **** not rockstar, you took away SA MP why would you do that to us. One of the most popular if not the most popular gaming company gave us the worst update they could have ever done. you should put gta sa on the steam workshop that would be amazing but you wont will you rockstar... no you wont, you took away many of our childhood memories with that update, you need to reupdate the game taking away all the stuff you put in this update.\n\nI have also noticed that the textures in the game are messed up as well, at the begining of the game when officer tenpenny and the other 2 officers gun down carl i noticed there guns clipping through the hands and it was very noticable so yes it is true that there is glitches with the textures in the game.\n\nAnother issue is that when i start up the game i cant use the mouse i have to CTRL+ALT+DEL many times to get my mouse to move the camera which makes no sense... and yes you can use a controller but you dont know what to do because it say stuff like use joy 9 to do this or joy 11 to do this... why not just say use y to enter and car and use x to jump... so unless you know all the 16 buttons and where they are at on the controller you wont be able to play with a controller. and yes i know you might be thinking that well if you have played gta sa before you should be able to play with a controller right... wrong because when i tried to use the controller everything was swapped around on the controller making it impossible to figure out what was what and where was where.\n\nSo i wish i could recommend this game but no i cant i feel it would be a sin to recommend this game that was one a amazing game to now a run down game full of missing songs to broken save files to texture glitches... and its sad knowing one of the very best gta games has been ruined by there own creator's... i never thought the day would come.","July 25, 2015","false","9.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","4"

Look, do not play this game on PS2 anymore because the graphics and lighting compared to this pc port are so damn washed out, I just can't believe it. This game is a classic and if you want a good written story with good voice acting than, you would like this as well. The only bad side to this game is the default controls. They are just terrible and hard to get used to. Totally change the controls as fast as you can. It's kind of disappointing that most people won't go out and get a 10 year old and just buy the newest GTA, but you don't know what you're missing out on. Graphics might be really dated but the story will never be. If you're a retro kind of guy like me, then you should reconsider your next buy.","December 27, 2014","true","21.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

You can get drunk, get fat get buffed, do some haircut, get some new clothes (and by that I mean a lot vareity of clothes), mod your lowrider and ♥♥♥♥.\nOh shiit!\n\nCharacter Design and Dialogue 8/10 1) Characters\nThere are more than 20 involving characters, each with their own characteristics. They are different in manner, dialogue, looks, and all. So you won't get bored why the story progresses. Hey, don't forget that Sam L. mother♥♥♥♥ing Jackson is also a voiceactor here.\n\n2) Dialogue\nThe dialogue is real shining. You are garunteed to be laughing in every cutscene. Very humorous, and very clever.\n10/10 'd like to rewind the cutscene for these great dialogue\n\nStory 5/10The story is not so strong. The drama is not so good. But the length is very good for the gameplay-based type. Overall, it is not so ugly.\n\nOthers 8/10  1) Sound\nMusics are great, special effects are acceptable. Main theme song is the best. Please go to youtube and find Young Maylay (CJ's voice actor) version, fricking sick!\n\n2) Graphics\nCar models are very beautiful but pedestrians are somewhat repetitive. The weather and sky are beautiful. Overall, not so bad.\n\n3) Map\nMap rendering mechanics are very slow such that rendering distance can not be very large. Map details are very good, you can walk/drive around San Andreas, listening to the radio, after your long day. However, it has very low interactibility. Anyway, this game has a very fantastic map.\n\nOverall 9/10 would revive your childhood again","February 21, 2015","true","86.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","1"

There is a reason why it's one of the first missions in the game people, just keep up with the train, don't crash the bike and you will beat it. JUST FOLLOW THE TRAIN CJ.\nThats my little rant aside, this is hands down the best GTA of all time in my opinion. Just the size of the world and the variety of missions alone make it the best. Missions like you driving a bike into a plane before it takes off, blowing up the plane and then jumping out with a parachute. Stealing a plane, jumping out the plane into another plane, killing everyone in the plane then flying that plane back to the airport.\nSneaking into a military base, killing everyone there once you're inside, stealing a jetpack and escaping the base by flying out of there using the jetpack while choopers and planes are on your a*s trying to shoot you down. The casino robbery and the final mission, there are so many others like that i could go on forever. It also has the best story in the series in my opinion as well as the best characters like big smoke, ryder, catalina, mike toreno, tenpenny, woozie etc.\nAnd the length of the game as well and all the side missions and activities is crazy even though i can beat the game fairly quickly now because i played through it so many times. A first time playthrough will take you around 30 hours. I also have to mention the amazing soundtrack and radio stations its great stuff. This is more of a love letter then a review, its one of my favourite games of all time.\n10/10 (Masterpiece)","February 16","true","19.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I was wrong.\n\nGrand Theft Auto San Andreas is a game that separates itself from all others. San Andreas' combination of a great story, great game play and much more is why.\n\nStory - 10/10\n\nI think the story is very good. You are Carl Johnson. You are coming back from Liberty City because you got a call from your brother Sweet saying your mother just died. All this crazy stuff happens. Its great and really sucks you in. You will want more when you finish the game.\n\nGraphics - 8/10\n\nThe graphics are average at best, but the animations are great. The rest of the game makes up for the graphics.\n\nSound - 10/10\n\nThe sound in the game is phenomenal. There are many radio stations with a huge variety of music. You can even have a custom radio station with your own tracks! The sound affects are perfect. The voice acting is even BETTER than perfect! Young Maylay completely nails his voice acting role of Carl Johnson (The main character in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas).\n\nControls - 9.6/10\n\nThe controls are great. It can be confusing at first, but you will get used to them very quickly. If you are used to playing the PS2 version of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you can buy a PS2 to PC converter so you can use the PS2 controller with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas for the PC.\n\nGame play - 10/10\n\nWow. Simply wow. Playing this game is so much fun. I just can't get enough of San Andreas. I still play it today. You will be playing it forever. There is so much to do. You can do missions, destroy crap, dating a girl friend and MUCH, MUCH, MUCH more! I am so amazed at how much fun this game is!\n\nBonus Features/Mods - 10/10\n\nAfter you beat Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you will still be playing for months, maybe even years like me! You can download mods like a Bigfoot mod, car mods, and all kinds of mods! You can do anything you want after you finish the game. My favorite thing to do after beating the game is searching for Easter eggs and myths. San Andreas is full of them!\n\nFinal Score - 10/10\n\nSimply put. This is the greatest game ever made. Props to Rock Star for making such a amazing game! BUY THIS GAME NOW!","April 24, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

There were no autosave features, no HD textures, and no friends asking to go play darts. Nevertheless, GTA San Andreas is still a stellar example of wonderful and varied world design, and it's attention to detail rivals that of many modern open-world games. This game will provided nearly limitless hours of fun and ridiculous freeroaming, with a decent story to back it up.

It's also probably the most fully featured Grand Theft Auto game (with GTA V coming closer to this then IV did.) with player and vehicle customization being quite diverse and some light RPG elements such as gaining/losing weight, strength, running speed, stealth, and swimming abilities.\n\nOverall if you enjoy the Grand Theft Auto series, games like it, or just feel like you're a black man stuck in a white persons body, then you should very much enjoy visiting San Andreas, whether it's your first time or coming back again.","June 27, 2014","true","85.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","6"

So let me go over the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- LONG Story MANY hours will go into this game and most will not be Regretted.\n\n- The Game has a HUUUUUUUGE map to explore, and find the oh so many secrets.\n\n- The Customization of your character is almost infinite, with so MANY different variaties to choose from you could deck out your character as much as you'd like.\n\n-SO many cars to choose from, including Bicycles and and Motorcycles, most cars able to be customized and outfitted.\n\n-Your character can learn different fighting styles as he travles, making him versatile in brawls.\n\n-You can Swim, HOLY CRAP a Grown man who can swim.\n\n-You can recruit grang members into a posse, and do drive bys or have massive gun fights.\n\n-You can claim territory and have massive gang wars with the 3 other Opposing gangs.\n\n-SO MANY weapons to pick from, including Assualt Rifles, SMGs, Pistols.\n\n-Many shop interirors and building interiors to check out and see.\n\n-Many Secret Interiors and other Secrets around the world, for you to explore and find.\n\n-Its made by Rockstar I mean COME on Rockstar games is BAD ♥♥♥.\n\n-Lag is non-exsistant.\n\n-Nice Musical pieces on all Radio Stations, and a few Radio Talkshows have some funny dialogue.\n\n-The game isn't too easy or too hard, some missions being SUPER easy, while some will be a challenge.\n\nCons:\n\n-Graphics are not exactly the best.\n\n-Controls on PC can be confusing (Especially for thoese of Us who played it on PS2)\n\n-The save feature in this game, is annoying. (You have to drive ALL the way back to a home you own JUST to save.)\n\n-The Music and Speech in the game, can often feel repetitive and just plain boring.\n\n-Missions have NO checkpoints, so if you die YOU have to do that mission ALL over again.\n\n-Modding is hard to do in this game.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, I would infact i'd recommend it to anyone whos already played the game, or IS completely new to Rockstar Games, or the GTA franchise. The game is overall one of the few games I play, that don't require mods to BE fun or MORE fun.","August 13, 2014","true","17.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, I had the non-steam (retail disk) version a few years back, so thought it would be fun to relive the old days, before GTA V came out.\nThe game is crappy now. It is poorly optimised, most of the songs I remember are gone, and the resolution is very low, even on its highest settings. I thought this was perculiar, as the resolution was great, when I first got the game in 2010/2011. Having done some research, I found out that R* patched the game, to the point where it was essentially a port of the MOBILE game. This dissapointed me greatly.\nIn conclusion, no, I don't reccomend this. If you got it free with GTA V, its okay, because it's free. However, don't buy this on it's own.\nReally, my honest opinion is, if you want to play this game, torrent it. This gives you the genuine experience of what the game was intended to be upon release. However, if you don't want to break the law, GTA V is my answer.","January 24, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then, after the update deleted my save files i was able to play it again for a few minutes. Today it it refused to launch again.\n\nBesides all that, a lot of songs from the original game have been removed and the controls are a bit difficult.

However, I had the non-steam (retail disk) version a few years back, so thought it would be fun to relive the old days, before GTA V came out.\nThe game is crappy now. It is poorly optimised, most of the songs I remember are gone, and the resolution is very low, even on its highest settings. I thought this was perculiar, as the resolution was great, when I first got the game in 2010/2011. Having done some research, I found out that R* patched the game, to the point where it was essentially a port of the MOBILE game. This dissapointed me greatly.\nIn conclusion, no, I don't reccomend this. If you got it free with GTA V, its okay, because it's free. However, don't buy this on it's own.\nReally, my honest opinion is, if you want to play this game, torrent it. This gives you the genuine experience of what the game was intended to be upon release. However, if you don't want to break the law, GTA V is my answer.","January 24, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I think everbody heard of this masterpiece from 2005. It literally shaped the modern OpenWorld games with an interactive enviroment.\n\nFive years ago "CJ" left the gangster life in Los Santos, San Andreas and moved to Liberty City. Today we write the year 1992, when Carl Johnson returned to his home in Grove Street, Los Santos. His family is splitted - his mother was murdered like his younger Brother Brian. Only his brother "Sweet" and sister "Kendl" remained; when "CJ" realizes that the city suffers under gang rivalries, drugs and corruption he must take the initiative - this he owes his family and friends.\nBut soon he will realize that the corrupt cop "Tenpenny", traitors and a secret organization prevent him from bringing peace to the hood.\n\nThis is just a small insight of the story (don't worry - there is no spoiler included).\n\nLet's list the good (+) and bad (-) aspects of "GTA San Andreas":\n++ exciting story until the end\n++ best radio stations/soundtrack\n++ inovative mechanics\n+ special folder for your own music!\n+ nice gameplay\n+ modeled cars and cities\n+ long playtime!\n+ really funny moments\n+ you can drive a tank\n+ huge map\n+ different ambients (country, forest, ghettos, towns)\n+ other OpenWorld activities\n+ RPG elements/stats\n+ "design" your CJ with tattoos, cloths or a new haircut\n+ customize your cars\n+ no high-end 8k gamer-PC needed - toaster is enough\n+ Multiplayer!!!!1!!1!\n+ MODS\n\n"YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL!!!"\n- it's laborious to install mods\n- frame bugs (activate "FrameLimiter" = 30fps)\n- annoying bike-cops...\n- mods can cause crashes\n- update November 2014*\n- probably cut\n- ''All you had to do, was following the damn train CJ!' -Smoke\n- "Rider" saying that you don't know how to drive\n\n*The update in November 2014 changed (as I heard) lots of things - and not in a good way (deactivated the HD-version and other things). In Germany (maybe somewhere else...) the game is also cut (as far as I know) - that means that you can not hit people while laying on the ground, shoot their head-off, people don't drop money and bodies disappear after 5 seconds. The Uncut-Patch causes often problems and crashes.\n\nI would recommend that you do not buy the Steam-version of "GTA San Andreas" to prevent the changes of the update.\nBut otherwise I can say that this part of the "GTA"-series is in my opinion the best because Carl Johnson is the most authentic protagonist (in my opinion)... and you can swim :D\nOn purpose I did not mentioned the "bad" graphics, because this game is from 2004/2005 and it would be unfair to mark that as "bad aspect" - so don't be a graphic-whor.e\n\nTo conclude: I give "GTA: SA" 9 of 10 possible points. I think that this is a very good and entitled result :)\nThank you for reading - have a nice day.\n\n\n"I'll have two numbah 9s\na numbah 9 large\na numbah 6 with extra dip\na numbah 7\ntwo numbuh 45s, one with cheese\nand a laaaaarge soda..." - Big Smoke","April 5","true","29.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","0"

However, the recent update essentially stripped content and broke saves. As of this time I recommend pirating the game instead of purchasing it on Steam, because right now you would be paying the same amount for less content than you would have gotten a few months ago. Either that or find a used copy on Ebay. I have tried contacting Rockstar on the issue and of course they haven't replied at all. Rockstar has gone on my list of companies to not buy games from anymore, right next to Ubisoft and EA... so good going with that.

I am constantly surprised Rockstar managed to put this game on the PS2. It features a massive open world, with a simply sublime soundtrack and cast of characters. The gameplay was far more dynamic then it's predecessor. With being able to climb walls, to having a parachute, to finding a jetpack and doing drive by shootings from 50 feet in the air.\n\nSan Andreas was just as amazing when it first came out as it is today. Almost every modern sandbox game takes leaps and bounds that Rockstar first carved in 2004. If you only buy one Grand Theft Auto game, buy this one.

After a plane crash the preisdent calls in Chill iron to come sell drugs to kids across california so CRASH can operate in secret and save the world from the russian mobsters importing illegal lobsters to suburban housewives in the US.

His brother Small Vapor turns out to be working with the russians and you must break out of prison using your streeet knowledge to board a giant airship made of lobsters and kill your brother. Afterwards you are shown a cutscene where your mother turns out to be a lobster and you kill yourself wiht your brothers corpse due to your grief.

However, I can no longer recommend it. I got the steam version free as a complimentary gift for preordering GTA V, and decided to relive a bit of nostalgia, only to be horrified at the result. A game that worked even a year ago while I was tinkering with it, is now completely unplayable.\n\nThe resolutions have changed to cause constant stretching even with fixes, including higher resolutions completely removed, and a plethora of graphical mishaps to boot. As mentioned before, though this is a more minor issue for me, a great deal of the music has been removed from the game completely. The game has always had poor performance on PC, with a cap of 25 fps, and completely broken physics if you dare to surpass it, but now it is even worse on all fronts, to the point where random events in the game will cause fatal crashes. Mods are also no longer supported, just in case you thought you were going to install a fix for that.\n\nThis makes me fear for the game I just spent $60 on, and proves to me that Rockstar's PC support has not improved at all since GTA IV's abysmal port. Hopefully I'm wrong. Stay the hell away from the Steam version of San Andreas.","January 26, 2015","false","1.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ignore the mostly positive reviews - they are almost entirely from before the game-wrecking patch. Most of the reviews for the game today are rightly negative.\n\nThe patch basically breaks functionality and removes things that were there and/or working fine before. Songs have been pulled from the soundtrack. Certain standard 16x9 resolution options are no longer available. See the other negative reviews for other problems.\n\nIt is appalling that a Company would break functionality to any game after users have paid for it, to say nothing of wrecking an old classic after leaving it intact for years.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/12120/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","♥♥♥♥ CJ WE GOTTA GET BACK TO THE HOOD\n\n*ahem*\n\nA word of warning: Rockstar has changed the Steam version of San Andreas from its original release. It has native Xbox controller support and higher-fidelity graphics on par with the 2014 re-release, but also less resolution options, less music tracks (check here[www.neogaf.com] for a list of what was removed) and breaks some old saves. You can find information on unofficial fixes here. Gamers' Steam reviews, as always when things change in any way, are 'taking Rockstar to task' over this. Not that they don't have a point, but still.\n\n\nAnyway.\n\nSan Andreas is the fifth game in the Grand Theft Auto series, released in 2004. You've probably heard of the series if you're browsing this website, but if you haven't it's basically an open-world crime simulator that also lets you simulate low-rent gangster movies. This particular release has somewhat clunky controls and the graphics were bad even when it came out, if still charming in their own way.\n\nBut I ultimately think San Andreas is the best game in the series, and not just because it has 'the most to do'. Grand Theft Auto V is technically higher on the 'fun scale' with superior gameplay, superior graphics and more optional side activities; it's certainly fun to play. The titles before SA are really more valuable as gaming history, since they were even more janky & limited, and even more cliched, than SA. And while SA is a functional game that absolutely has its charm - I'm partial to its pastiche of the 90s myself - that's not the main reason I'm saying it's the best.\n\n\nNo, my reasoning has to do with the story and the tone. GTA V's story is interesting enough in a doofy crime capers way, but the tone of that game is ultimately aggressively nihilistic and uncaring about almost anything within itself. Not to say these elements aren't present in San Andreas, but they're not nearly as strong or disheartening here.\n\nGTA IV is better in this regard, I'd say, but it's not off the hook. It tried to be more serious, and while it made strides in that direction, the weight of its open-world gameplay ambitions ultimately hamstrung its story. I didn't mind its more muted tone, 'realistic' driving and lack of cheat codes (for the base game anyway), but there's no getting around the fact that having a main character who bemoans the atrocities of the Balkan Wars he survived but is perfectly able to wantonly run over pedestrians is...odd. The final act of the story resembling a cheap mafia film didn't exactly help either.\n\nSan Andreas, by contrast, doesn't just exist primarily to "poke fun" at American society so much as it tries to tell a story about a west coast gangbanger with a heart of gold, trying to do right for his lower-class neighborhood, family and gang within the moral construct (and repressive society) he was born and raised in. It's ultimately more genuine than V because it cares enough about its characters not to utterly derail itself every time the game displays pathos for them. It's also not self-important enough to pretend that it wouldn't be a bad thing if it did do that. Perhaps most importantly, it's self-aware enough not to be stony-faced at every turn it takes.\n\n\nThe characters themselves might not be particularly more savory, and certainly there's stereotypical/exaggerated behavior going on, but at least SA doesn't furiously punch in every direction or practically flash "LAUGH AT THESE SAD LOSERS WHO ARE ALSO YOU, LOSER" on the screen every time you see them interact with each other.\n\nNot that this game is a literary masterpiece by any means, but it's the closest the series has come to that level. And while GTA IV was also trying to operate on the same level, albeit with its own direction and its own flaws, V was just a step back in this regard. There's always been puerile satire of society and voyeuristic displays of women in the 3D GTA games, including in San Andreas, and it's always gotten disheartening if you played for long enough, but SA...isn't quite as bad in this regard, I feel. There's enough determination and hope in the story for the game not to crash and burn at least, although it's long enough that it does drag in parts.\n\n\nI still resent whenever the game shoves boobs, 'sexy wimmins' and other series-standard female objectification in my face without comment, of course. Nothing is perfect. I also think it's still a bit weird that CJ comes across as a pretty decent dude (perhaps the most 'good' in the series), trying to do what he can and make the best of a pretty bad situation, and yet the game still gives you the option to go on classic GTA rampages.\n\nMaybe there's something to be said for the tension between open-world game structure and any semblance of a plot. Whatever the case may be, San Andreas doesn't gel perfectly. GTA IV suffered from this problem too, and both games - hell, pretty much the entire series - also suffer from a number of frustrating missions. Following a damn train was never so difficult.\n\n\nThe game world is obviously not as realistic as V's due to the technological constraints of 2004, which means that the game isn't trying to sell itself as a perfect graphical model of Real Life(tm) that's fatally flawed by crazy AI behavior. The game looks enough like a game that it's not quite as jarring when something insane happens on the street next to you. (San Andreas' modding support is at least better than V's, and I say this because I couldn't find anywhere else in the revieew to stick it.)\n\n\nHonestly, I don't know if I'd call this one of the best games ever made, but I think it's still a classic in its genre. Pick it up if it's on sale and you're interested.","March 6, 2013","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

This game is absolutely amazing in every way possible. I just wanted to get this out of the way right here:\n\nHere are the specs of my PC:\n\nProcessor: Intel Pentium\nCPU: B980 @ 2.40GHz\nRAM: 4GB\nOperating System: Windows 10\nType: 64-bit operating system x64-based processor\nGraphics Card: Intel HD Graphics\n\nAnd guess what? I'm getting over 100FPS! This game is well optimized, and has a great story. There is so much you can do on the PC version that you can't do on the PS2/XB versions. Amazing mod support, great story, great gameplay, and good graphics and frame rate for a terrible PC like mine! Even though I'm running the game at low graphics, you can't even tell a difference.\n\nThe game's story is very long, but it's so open-world, that it feels like San Andreas is just as big as the GTA V version of Los Santos. I also noticed that this game along with a couple other GTA games has gore in it, which makes it a little more graphic. I'm totally ok with it too, just thought I'd bring it up.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are a little different than the PS2/XB versions of the game. There's no auto aim on PC (unless if you play with the controller mod), but PC gaming is really advanced and I understand why they don't have auto aim for mice. It'll be really easy to get a shot with auto aim if your playing on PC. I also know that the PC version is missing a cheat code from the console version, and there are a few changes to the environment, because the console version and the PC version are not exactly the same either. It's alright though.\n\nI'll give this a 9/10, and here is my list of PROS and CONS on the PC version:\n\nPROS:\nGreat mod support\nGreat story\nGreat gameplay\nGreat performance/optimization\nOPEN WORLD BABY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Well, that should go under gameplay)\nAnd it actually works on bad PC's!\n\nCONS:\nMissing cheat code\nEnviromental changes between PC and console\nSlight gameplay mechanic changes\nBad controller support (you have to use the controller mod to have good controller support)\nNo intro at the beginning of the game (for me at least, I don't know about other people)\n\nWell, this is my review for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas on the PC. I love it, and I'd play it any day.","June 3","true","25.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is one of the most loved Games ever made, expectally by PS2 users. The Mission are challerging but offer a various different range of mission. So Drive-by's, Raid's, Protect the Train etc. Even though i haven't completed the game yet, im hooked to the storyline. Even though were im currently at there isn't a real in-depth storyline, but i will expect a deeper one later on. The shooting is odd, as it can be hard to aim with a mouse, so i advice you use a controller for GTA:SA. And i had to edit some controls such as jump which was Lshift, when as i am  normally found playing FPS games, is used to Lshift being used to run. The map size is great for the time when this was made, and the size of this map, helped devolped maps in Just Cause 2 or GTA V. And i can't really complain about the graphics because of the time this game was made, and there wasn't many other games with much better graphics than this at the time.\n\nMy Overall Rating of this Game is 10/10 ---> This is one of those games that will go down in history of being the big chance in GTA Games and games overall.","December 13, 2013","true","15.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

By today's bleeding edge standards the graphics may be a little dated, and the acting is a little over the top, but the gameplay is rock solid.\n\nIf you've never played an open world adventure game, give this a try.

However, this is one of the few times that the PC version is not exactly the best. This version can be very, very glitchy. I don't recommend using cheats on it, because that can mess up your game if your not careful. The controls can also be a problem, and you may want to configure with them. I do not have too big a problem with flight. If you have the console versions, don't feel obligated to buy this version. If you do, just be careful.\nThe game is very fun, and the overworld is amazing. However, there are some very tedious missions, and buying a console version won't fix that.\nAll these problems really cancel out with what is great with this game.","January 26, 2014","true","341.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

One more time to try to do the most from what there is to be done in this game and 60 hours were not enough to do not more than 70% of what I had aimed for after after beating it. (But there's so many other games to try out there, so I decided to move on)\n\nGTA: San Andreas is one of the best mafia openworld sandbox action 3rdPS games i've ever played in my life.\n\nThe graphical improvements from GTA: Vice City are noticable. The voice acting is perfect. The map is huge compared to the games before it.\nIn a big world full of choices you make your way through a very interesting, fun, crazy, and dramatic story about brotherhood, friendship, hunger, corruption and betrayal. GTA: San Andreas is the 3rd  instalment of its kind and the 5th in turn within the franchise (excluding the special editions of the titles of that time).\nLots of vehicles to use, lots of guns to choose, lots of characters to meet, lots of places to explore, lots of easter eggs to find, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of side quest missions and achievements to accomplish. A game easy capable to stay playable for a ton of extra hours after finishing the main story.\nAnd even after all that said, with the game supporting mods and with millions of those out there to be downloaded and tried, the amount of extra playtime that can be spent in this game even today is insane.\nIts like the Elder Scrolls of its genre.\nThere are noticable cons in this edition to be fair. Some crashes here and there and very few but hard to miss bugs, but they didn't take away from the tons of fun i had. Also some missions, taking their length and places under consideration, could use a checkpoint mechanism (though you can still manage them after a few tries at worst).\n\nTotally and fully recommended.","January 20, 2015","true","60.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

I have played GTA V on the PS3 and PS4 and GTA V comes a very close 2nd to SA. GTA SA is all about the 90's; gangsters,drugs,guns(in a video game though) and being a 90's kid it brings back many memories back too. It's amazing how well done the characters are from the likes of the voice acting to acting to even visuals(even for an old game). The story line is briliant too, it just keeps you coming back for more. The gameplay mechanics and graphics surely will seem old but you will still be able to have great fun. The only shameful thing with the PC version is with the updates that have removed certain stuff such as songs but you can easily use community mods to work around them. Do not be put off buying this game because of the removal of stuff because there is a work around! You can also get a really cheap disc copy from Amazon which will be the original game from day one.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ttesttm/recommended/12120/","ttesttm","TTEST GREYJOY™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ttesttm/","114 products in account","My Opinion About The Game (Without Story Spoilers) : Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas is an Open World TPS made and published by Rockstar Studios . I probaby don't need to intouduce you to the series. I didn't play Vice City (I will and when I did I'll delete this part of the review) and all the others before that but I played all the others after this one. For me it seems like this one has the biggest world that you can actually go to. Like I said I didn' played the other games before this one (yet) but I think this has the best story out of all of them. I like all of them though. The only con I can think of this game considering it's age are the flying tutorials and missions they are awful hard. You can say that I'm a noob but I've seen a lot of people having the same problem. So I recommend playing atleast that part of the game with a controller but overall I recommend a controller for the game because of the vehicles. There's a small negative part of the game which is small because it doesn't  happen if you do this like I say , there's a part of the game where you have to take over territories . And theres a small territory named Jefferson Motel. That territory is so small that enemy gang members doesn't spawn there , so you need to lure them from other territories nearby. But if you took over all the territories except that one you gonna have a hard time capturing it. So I recomend capturing that one first. There are other negatives  which I did a researc on when I noticed the same things which  are regarding the Steam version not the game itself. Rockstar added a patch to the game which removed songs , option for changing resoultions and something with SAMP isn't right either . I played the crack GTA SA with SAMP and it barely had crashes but with the Steam version it crashes at least 1 time in 1 hour but usually around 2-3 times. And they messed up people's saves but that didn't affect me because I got the game after that. I completed the game's story 100%  all the missions all the territories all the stats like Respect , Stamina , Muscle theese kind of things , schools etc. I really like the game's story I like the characters I like that I don't have to go to bowling in every second. If you have Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 and SAMP doesn't start properly run Steam in administrator mode and set both GTA SA and samp exe to run in Windows SP3 (on Windows 8.1) , Windows 98 (on Windows 10)  and both in administrator mode. This made the multiplayer worked even tho you still gonna have crashes because of the crappy port.\n\nGraphics : 9 (The game came out in 2005)\nAudio : 9 (The Steam version itself would be 7 because of the removal of some songs)\nGameplay : 10 (If you want to play SAMP on the Steam version you gonna have a hard time and I don't even know about what's up with the modding in it , considering GTA V's status on that)\nStory : 9\nReplayability : 8 (8 because of the hell in the flying missions)\nValue : 6 (7 If you only buy it for the Single Player )\n\nOverall I recommend the game mainly if you only want to play in single player or if you don't mind a lot of crashes then multiplayer too. Well I wouldn't complain much about it after the GTA IV port. Enjoy the game !","May 23","true","71.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

The plotline follows him and his homies Ryder, Big Smoke and Sweet, throughout the country, desert and 3 cities. There are lots of blockbuster main missions and side tasks to complete, along with girlfriends to date (who provide some very useful abilities). Drive-bys, vehicle stunts, plane hijacking and flying, stealth, shooting, gang wars - you name it this game has it!\n+ Gigantic selection of weapons, with RPG elements of leveling - the more you utilise a gun, the more accustomed you become to it, improving accuracy and damage, or even unlocking dual wielding for pistols, uzi's, tec-9s and more. To add to this, you can build muscle at the gym for more melee damage, or eat till you're obese at fast food restaurants. There is a nice chunk of customisation in Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, with plenty of clothes, hats, jewellery and other accessories to personalise your character.\n+ Around 30 hours content for the singleplayer story, although there is definitely more for first time players, with many hidden collectibles to find.\n+ Incredible assortment of radio station music, even the country channels are good.\n\nMixed\n\n~ The graphics are old and it definitely shows, but it shouldn't detract too much from the enjoyment. They are what you would expect from a game released in 2004.\n\nOverall Score: 9.5/10\n\nGrand Theft Auto San Andreas is one of my fondest childhood memories. Truly an infallible game for its time and well worth picking up.","May 18, 2015","true","30.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I mean its kinda a pain in the **** to try a mod this with higher graphical detail then its current Steam version has.\n\n3.\nFix all the known problems that causes the game to glitch and crash on play.

In this game, you take on the role of Carl Johnson (aka CJ for short), a man who recently came back to San Andreas from Liberty City after his mother was killed in a driveby shooting. During the course of the game, CJ will have to earn money and respect by doing tasks and missions for others.\n\nNow that the summary's out of the way, let's get onto the game itself. The PC port isn't as good as the PS2 port in terms of features. For some reason a lot of features were left out in the PC port. Even at version 3.0, the game still lacks things the original PS2 version has. Most notably, car sheen is missing from most of the cars. Some sound effects, such as when you invite hookers into a car, are also missing (the moaning sounds mostly). The moon and night skies are also less detailed and varied. In addition, a few cheats don't exist in the PC version (such as "drive on water" and "hookers pay you".)\n\nAnother unfortunate issue is that you can't mod version 3.0 or 2.0 (which is technically 3.0 but without steam support.). This was done because of a controversy a few years back. Thankfully, you can downgrade the game to either 1.01 or 1.0 with a downgrader program. (google it)  Despite some saying it's illegal, Valve hasn't removed forum posts from the Steam forums which means they probably don't care. (they're heavy supporters of modding as you probably know. And removing something like that wouldn't be good for their userbase or their business.)\n\nThe PC version also boasts a special radio station for players to play their own music. You'll usually find it in your "My Documents" folder in a folder under the name "GTA user files" Another feature that uses this folder is the camera. Take a picture and it saves here.\n\nGameplaywise, the game plays pretty well and it's just as fun as the PS2 version, regardless of problems. Most if not all of CJ's dialog is there. At first, being used to playing GTA IV, I was a little confused about how the wanted level system worked.  But after a while I figured it out. The weapons are responsive and the controls are fluent. Even the hand-to-hand works well.\n\nThe pedestrian AI is very good for such an old game. They'll do things from conversing with eachother (though sometimes the conversations make absolutely no sense) to fighting eachother and getting into police chases. they'll even ram you until your car explodes if you hit theirs (such as the stupid Taxi drivers) That being said, it's not without flaws. The plane AI is simplistic and will often wreak for no reason. This is because the planes were only programmed to fly over the player's head in a straight line, which often results in them colliding with high objects like skyscrapers and mountains. The resulting explosion can injure or even kill CJ if he's too close too.\n\nGraphically, the game is dated by today's standards. This can easily be seen on character models. While the lips move, the individual fingers on the hands don't, which results in a " classic Resident Evil esque" cutscene where characters point with their whole hand. Some cars also lack detail, such as the ZR-350 which just looks like it was textured in MS paint. Thankfully, there are mods out there that can help the game look nicer so it's not a total loss. (most will require you to downgrade to 1.0 or 1.01 to actually use though unless they use the 2.0/3.0 installation method.) It's also not as impressive as the PS2 version graphically due to the lack of detail on some cars mentioned above and the moon thing mentioned earlier. It can go higher res than the PS2 version, so that is at least somewhat a redeeming quality.\n\nSound. As stated earlier, some sounds are missing. However, most if not all the typical dialog and sound effects are there. CJ will yell at pedestrians and police if they attack him or get in his way. What he says depends upon how expensive the clothing he's wearing is and how much money he has. The game features a voice acting cast including favorites like Samuel L. Jackson (Officer Frank Tenpenny.) As with most GTA games, the music doesn't play unless you're driving. The variety of stations ranges from R&B, hardcore rap, to even rock and country. The User Track player function mentioned above allows you to customize your own station. The Radio commercials and talk shows are just as enjoyable as well. With many humorus parody commercials and talk shows with the nonsense and humor that the GTA series' radio channels are known for.\n\nOverall: 9/10. The PC port has its flaws but it's well worth the 14.99 price tag here on steam. Buy it if you want it. Though if you want to mod, it would probably be easier on you to buy the original version of the PC version (version 1.0) off of ebay than downgrading steam's version 3.0.","July 5, 2014","true","242.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas by far beats Grand Theft Auto 5 in my opinion as GTA San Andreas is still entertaining many people on this very day! This game works brilliantly on Windows 7 and there is always something new to do on the game. It never gets old! I have not even comleted it yet and I'm only on about the 11th mission and decided to do some free roaming. The story is also fantastic and is a longer story than Grand Theft Auto V! The only downside to it wich is also due to the fact that this game is old, it doesn't allow you to use the RT, LT and D-Pad on the Xbox 360 controller. However the rest of the game is completely reccomended by me.","March 26, 2014","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In this game, you take on the role of Carl Johnson (aka CJ for short), a man who recently came back to San Andreas from Liberty City after his mother was killed in a driveby shooting. During the course of the game, CJ will have to earn money and respect by doing tasks and missions for others.\n\nNow that the summary's out of the way, let's get onto the game itself. The PC port isn't as good as the PS2 port in terms of features. For some reason a lot of features were left out in the PC port. Even at version 3.0, the game still lacks things the original PS2 version has. Most notably, car sheen is missing from most of the cars. Some sound effects, such as when you invite hookers into a car, are also missing (the moaning sounds mostly). The moon and night skies are also less detailed and varied. In addition, a few cheats don't exist in the PC version (such as "drive on water" and "hookers pay you".)\n\nAnother unfortunate issue is that you can't mod version 3.0 or 2.0 (which is technically 3.0 but without steam support.). This was done because of a controversy a few years back. Thankfully, you can downgrade the game to either 1.01 or 1.0 with a downgrader program. (google it)  Despite some saying it's illegal, Valve hasn't removed forum posts from the Steam forums which means they probably don't care. (they're heavy supporters of modding as you probably know. And removing something like that wouldn't be good for their userbase or their business.)\n\nThe PC version also boasts a special radio station for players to play their own music. You'll usually find it in your "My Documents" folder in a folder under the name "GTA user files" Another feature that uses this folder is the camera. Take a picture and it saves here.\n\nGameplaywise, the game plays pretty well and it's just as fun as the PS2 version, regardless of problems. Most if not all of CJ's dialog is there. At first, being used to playing GTA IV, I was a little confused about how the wanted level system worked.  But after a while I figured it out. The weapons are responsive and the controls are fluent. Even the hand-to-hand works well.\n\nThe pedestrian AI is very good for such an old game. They'll do things from conversing with eachother (though sometimes the conversations make absolutely no sense) to fighting eachother and getting into police chases. they'll even ram you until your car explodes if you hit theirs (such as the stupid Taxi drivers) That being said, it's not without flaws. The plane AI is simplistic and will often wreak for no reason. This is because the planes were only programmed to fly over the player's head in a straight line, which often results in them colliding with high objects like skyscrapers and mountains. The resulting explosion can injure or even kill CJ if he's too close too.\n\nGraphically, the game is dated by today's standards. This can easily be seen on character models. While the lips move, the individual fingers on the hands don't, which results in a " classic Resident Evil esque" cutscene where characters point with their whole hand. Some cars also lack detail, such as the ZR-350 which just looks like it was textured in MS paint. Thankfully, there are mods out there that can help the game look nicer so it's not a total loss. (most will require you to downgrade to 1.0 or 1.01 to actually use though unless they use the 2.0/3.0 installation method.) It's also not as impressive as the PS2 version graphically due to the lack of detail on some cars mentioned above and the moon thing mentioned earlier. It can go higher res than the PS2 version, so that is at least somewhat a redeeming quality.\n\nSound. As stated earlier, some sounds are missing. However, most if not all the typical dialog and sound effects are there. CJ will yell at pedestrians and police if they attack him or get in his way. What he says depends upon how expensive the clothing he's wearing is and how much money he has. The game features a voice acting cast including favorites like Samuel L. Jackson (Officer Frank Tenpenny.) As with most GTA games, the music doesn't play unless you're driving. The variety of stations ranges from R&B, hardcore rap, to even rock and country. The User Track player function mentioned above allows you to customize your own station. The Radio commercials and talk shows are just as enjoyable as well. With many humorus parody commercials and talk shows with the nonsense and humor that the GTA series' radio channels are known for.\n\nOverall: 9/10. The PC port has its flaws but it's well worth the 14.99 price tag here on steam. Buy it if you want it. Though if you want to mod, it would probably be easier on you to buy the original version of the PC version (version 1.0) off of ebay than downgrading steam's version 3.0.","July 5, 2014","true","242.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not really that the game glorifies or is critical of the material anyway.. it just reflects on it and lets the player decide, and it's not without its humor.\n\nBut when the main character indulges requests to kill complete strangers because some idiot he doesen't even respect asks him to, it comes across as totally inconsistent, makes no sense for the story, and seems dumb. Hopefully that won't be the rest of the missions to the game, which is probably massively long. I bet i'm 2% done or something, ugh.\n\nThis is one of the better GTA games of all time. It's dated today.. so i guess you would need to turn the clock back too far to play this one, unless you really want to go back and try it.","June 28, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lengthy story will keep you hooked and preoccupied for at least 30 hours, and another 20 hours exploring San Andreas and accomplishing side missions and quests. Story is bar none probably one of the best so far in the GTA Series, second to maybe the HD Universe. Old and new characters alike are involved in this journey of one man trying to restablish his ties with his family, but along the way get caught up in a much more bigger plot. The only drawback and downfall of this game is the relatively large empty areas some cities have contained, as the playing field is very large, but has very little to offer in terms of size and it seemingly feels like the areas could have been more condensed with more focus on one area rather than expanding out with little to see. 8.7/10","July 7, 2014","true","41.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The RPG elements were useful without being annoying (building up your gun/vehicle/hand-to-hand/etc skills was just fun and MUCH better than dragging your friends and family to friggin' leisure activities between every damn mission like GTA 4). The play control was better than VC (mouse looking in vehicles was a great addition), the characters are a little cliche (over the top, racial stereotypes), but all in all, it adds to the 90s flavor of the game. Also, the soundtrack can't be beat. After GTA 4, I switched over to Saints Row and haven't really looked back. I love GTA's dark sense of humor, but the play control in 4 was a massive step down from San Andreas.\n\nIt's not flawless, but it is a true sandbox. You can run missions, or just antogonize the local law enforcement and enjoy running across bone county runnin-n-gunnin'. I got to the point where I owned every territory, had turned in every illegal car, and was STILL finding stuff to mess around with! I also decided to just throw my own playlist together and just enjoy running around in/on various vehicles just to be able to floor it to my jams (so to speak) and see how long the car would hold together.\n\nIf you like games where your character can grow, but it dosn't mean their worthless to start, a halfway decent story, a TON of stuff to do, and a high amount of replayability, this game is for you!","June 18, 2014","true","34.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Downgrading your gta-sa.exe (Steam version is 3.0, previous was 1.0/1.2 & 2.0) is "almost mandatory" according to a wiki I was reading through for some of the mods...\n\nIts still an amazing game without mods though, worth the couple of dollars you can get it for during the sales.

I love the location the characters, (Well, not ALL of them, but I'll get on that later) and the vehicles! I think this was an outstanding achievment for 2004. But, this is not my favorite GTA, that prize goes to Grand Theft Auto Five. I hear you thinking "It's the same location!" well it's not. It might be in Los Santos, but when I purchased the game this past monday (On the X-Box 360) I took out the map of the game in the box, and (To my displeasure) I did not see San Fierro or Las Venturas on the map. But overall, I like it better that GTA SA for four reasons, 1, More likable characters, I personally did not like CJ all to much in GTA SA, to me, he got annoying, really fast, and I have not played to much of GTA VC, so I can not make a judgement on Tommy. 2, The vehicles, they hadle much more realisticly that SA, and also show more realistic damage that SA. (Where when you get hit in the side all the doors on that side take as much damages so as they look like thay have been hit by a hand grenade) 3, The weapons, that feel more realistic (Well except for the silencers that things some some major BS) and the the add-ons make them weapons near perfection to me. and finally 4, I love the story in GTA SA, but GTA V's story steal the show for me. (Play them both and you will understand). But still for all of it's flaws, GTA SA is one of the best games I have played. If you can, get both this and GTA V, because they are both amazing.

This is the best gta. I know alot of people have had problems with the game through steam, i have not had any of these problems. I'm running windows 8, which is the main reason i'm writing this. So people know it does work on windows 8 for me without any problems. I would advise researching what others with windows 8 have to say to see if anyone else has had problems. The main downside for me is the pc controls are not very good for instance riding a bike you have to spam w to move fast which makes turning very frustrating. The first mission i failed a bunch of times because i couldn't get the hang of the bike. Would recommend using a program to bind keys to a controller to make things easier if you have that option. I love the story of this game its a little over the top but thats what makes it so great. GTA 4 went with a more realistic story which was great, but it just didn't leave the impression on me this game did.

San Andreas is packed with content and even today i find it a blast to play. It doesn't have the setting or the music that made Vice City so iconic, but everything else is greatly improved. The map is huge and diversified, with 3 distinct cities, countryside and desert. There's tons of vehicles. The RPG elements aren't overused. The shooting mechanics are more fluid. The story has it's flaws, but it's well written, and there's plenty of great characters, even with some cameos. The soundtrack is also great. The missions are well designed and varied. There's plenty of side content, although some of it is boring. The list goes on and on. Almost everything you could do in GTA III or Vice City, you can do it better here. For me, this is the definitive sandbox experience. And i'm not even talking about all the mods that you can get, which increases the replayability and fun that you can have. No game is perfect, but this one gets very close to that, especially when it came out. Just get it.\n\nTo have the best possible experience you'll need to tweak the game a bit, with some essential mods.\n1- You'll need to downgrade the game to it's 1.0 version to be able to mod it.\n2- Install a .asi loader to allow mods to be loaded.\n3- The most important thing is the SilentPatch, fixing many bugs and issues and also raises the FPS from 25 to 30.\n4- Widescreen Fix if you're playing on a widescreen.\n5- GInput, you you wanna play with a controller.\nThere's also plenty of other options, but i think these are the essential that everyone should install to the base game.\n","November 9, 2015","true","67.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
