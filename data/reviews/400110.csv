It's got some problems but also has some seriously nifty mechanics that make me willing to put up with the problems.\n\nPro:\n-Very maleable world where the game tolerates you doing very unexpected things\n\nAssociated Con:\n- The 3rd-person camera is kind of derpy, and doesn't know how to avoid objects obstructing your vision., probably because their positions aren't set in stone  You'll have to manually move the camera around a lot to see what's going on.\n\n\nPro:\n- Does the concept of "the matrix" right.  You don't alter the universe by just staring at an object and saying "there is no spoon".  You do it by actually having the power to alter the game's scripting code that defines how the spoon works, in-character.\n\nAssociated Con:\n- It's nearly impossible for the developer to think of everything a player might do to hack the game in-character, and thus you can do stuff that breaks assumptions and makes bugs surface.\n\n\nPro:\n- Unique gameplay mechanic that doesn't just talk about your character being a hacker, but actually has YOU, the player, doing the hacking, and not in a stupid "movie OS" sort of way, but in a way that actually feels like really programming - you actually type script code in-character, using a scripting language the game invented for its universe.\n\nAssociated Con:\n- The game doesn't let you get access to this aspect of itself until a few hours of gameplay.  The apparent plot at first, the pure "dating sim", is kind of lame.  Especially since you apparently are a "salesman" selling soda by literally selling it one can at a time to random strangers you converse with, rather than by, say, selling it by the crate to restaurants like you'd expect.  That doesn't seem very viable as a job and feels like the sort of plot intended for an 8-year-old player.  But you have to go through that a while before the actual gameplay surfaces and the game suddenly gets a lot more mature and smart than it seemed at first.\n\nPro:\n- You are expected to crack the mysteries of how to do powerful hacks yourself, and it is possible once you are given the tools to get started.  The universe's objects behave logically and consistently making it possible to reverse-engineer things to learn the system naturally in-character.\n\nAssociated Con:\n- The game is VERY vulnerable to spoilers. The primary challenge of the game is learning the names of things so you can hack them, so it probably won't have good replay value unless someone starts making mods that add new plots.","October 14, 2015","true","63.5"," 64 of 67 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","64","67","0","0"

Nope, let me just fiddle with my radio.\nI want to get to room? No problems, let me just turn my radio knob.\nThere is a person missing? Nope, let me press this magic button. And here we go.\nNo hacking tools allowed in casino? No problems, let me just bring my magic radio. turn knob and get my tools.\nI need to break in to reach computer? Ha! I have been practically living there already.\n\nAnd achieving that was trivial to me. (I also later found just outright teleporter, but I am not gonna tell you where)\n\nBut game didn't acknowledge most of my actions. It wanted me to follow it's story, without shortcuts(and taking them would glitch out game)\nMissing person!? No you cannot teleport them! You need to go to bed and sleep! So they come to you in a dream, only then you allowed to go after them to try to find them! Even if you do find them, you not allowed to tell it to anyone. Until you resolve some problem, which is super easy to resolve. No seriously, game was hinting at it so hard, that it was impossible to miss. (Btw, it is in a title)\n\nI also thought that game have proper secondary quests, but nope.\nAll stuff which I found out from dialogs from NPC, never was acknowledged.\nThey like, YOU CANNOT BREAK IN TO THAT HOUSE AND BRING EVIDENCE.\nWhile, I already visited that house and striped it clean of all evidence, but I couldn’t tell them that, or give it.\nSince story never anticipated that.\n\nWarning major spoilers below\nAnd biggest problem, this game have no good story to tell. It doesn't have a real conclusion, it sort of bums around and ends. It doesn't show you or tell you about what happens after, or what was consequences of your actions, it just ends.\n\nIt is about a guy, who falls in love with a girl and starts to stalk her, so he can get closer, while she friend zones you so hard, that you would be located near by Pluto, it that so far away.\nWhile that happens, there are also token evil Ministry(Empire/Federation/Government, just pick your poison), which acts so evil, according to NPCs.\nPlayer have no way of knowing it first hand for a while, till they use a massive laser to kill your girl's boyfriend, then it's fight to the end! No? Okey.\nSo there is no real confrontation.\nAlso he doesn't really die. They just uploaded him to internet Tron style, for some reason. Which is never fully explained. Besides single mention that it somehow involved with generating power.\nSo in conclusion, game have no real good story to tell, then what does it have?\nA sandbox for hacking? Yes!\nBut is it good sandbox? No!\nProblem with hacking the world, is that nothing tries to stop you. Player have no real restrains, and that's a problem, nothing really a challenge. Game will try to feed you narrative locations, but they all pretty bland and pointless, and if anything ruin atmosphere which was very good at beginning of the game. You’ll come across few side stories(Which actually way more interesting then game's primary story), to then nothing.\nThat's it.\nLot's of game actions also tied to a fact that player have to sleep(that's not required to progress, but if you skip sleep, then you will miss huge chunk of the game)\nAnd most game actions are placed on very rudimentary triggers, which easily break if something goes of script, locking up game.\nAnd you can mess with stuff, but there isn't interesting reactions in the world. Nothing really changes if you hack everyone bank accounts, or if you make everyone fall asleep, or if you make everyone electrocuted. All NPCs will just shrug it off and never acknowledge something weird.\nOnly way to really mess with them is to hack doors, but that just tends to get them stuck on loops, so that only funny first time.\nI routinely broke in to big evil Ministry HQ, just to mess with computers and loot them, which actually did something, it got me send to jail, but since Police was as competent as story writers, they didn't take any of my stuff, so I hacked prison gate and just walked away, just to repeat my shenanigans again.\nBut nothing got unlocked, I couldn’t tell anyone about it, no new dialogue appeared anywhere.\nWhen Rebels wanted to infiltrate bad guys, I was like I KNOW, but game didn't let me to have my way, it forced it's story.\nAnd when I insisted that I can break in to HQ in ALL dialogue options, game just ignored it, since nothing would happen.\n\nBut let me tell you real deal breaker.\nThere is villain, and that villain is bad(Supposedly, motivations are not clear)\nAnd if you find villain, then villain kills you with magic taser. Though that's on second time you disturb villain, and that doesn't matter how.\nSo villain will yell at you and tell you to "Get of the lawn! You spoiled brats!", while I twiddle my thumbs on my RETARDIS, which allows me to literally teleport anyone around me to NULL space if I would wish too.\nAnd so I hacked in to villain inventory and stole her taser. Makes sense, now villain have no way of killing me.\nJust for me to get killed by standing near villain, because cut scene have no other outcomes.\nLike seriously? In game where you allowed to hack world, you forgot to make world to recognize that.\nAlso before that, I made her stupid sleepy, drunk and corrupted, and she still was threatening me.\n\nIn short this game needs to recognize player's action, and it simply doesn't. Yes you can do that, but game have no way offering real difficulty, besides obtuse quest system and poor dialogue trees, which don't lead anywhere half of the time.\nIt doesn't reward or notices most of your actions. You can stroll to most locked room, but game won't see it, you won't be able to tell evil plan to other NPCs. So what the point of offering dialog options, when most of them token at best?\n\nThis game story exists for it's creators and it's sandbox exists for hacking. They don't really work together or recognize each other.\n\nIs this game about hacking? While having lot's of hacking, it isn't recognizing it or rewarding it. So no.\nIs it about story? While it have big central story, it never does conclusions on it or gives you any thoughts on the topic. So no.\nIs it artsy indie game? Yes. And that's a problem, it could be so much more, but it ended up being so little.\nIs it buggy? Oh yes, I kept getting stuck in world geometry, dialogue trees and just glitching out cut scenes and just normal crashing to desktop for a good measure.\n\nCan you enjoy it? Yes, but to a degree. It isn't perfect, or strictly good. It just is. And if anything the longer you play, the more you get disappointed at the end.\n\nConclusion:\nMy this year biggest disappointment.\nI won't ask for a refund, I got my enjoyment out of a game, but not $25(or $17.5 on sale) worth of enjoyment.\nHonestly there is much better game, within ideas, compare to what was presented to us.\nCurrently it more of a prototype of much better game, it missing to much and what it have is just to little.\nThis is what it did to me:\n\nloop\nvar game = GetGame()\nif game.IsGood()\nHeart.Rejoice()\nelse\nHeart.Break()\nend\nendERROR: HEART BROKE","September 27, 2015","false","2.7"," 441 of 624 people (71%) found this review helpful 92 people found this review funny","71","441","624","92","32"

Heart.Break() presents the player with a world that is not so much interesting as it is wholly cohesive, much like its obvious predecessors Shenmue and Omikron: The Nomad Soul.  Ultimately the line between player and developer is blurred as they receive the power to alter the city of Dorisburg at its most basic structural level, its code.  Unlike other programming-themed games, here the player is not expected to laboriously logic out the solutions to difficult computer science puzzles, instead code is used as a tool to circumvent, subvert, and destroy the game itself.

This game world definitely has a unique look and feel. Having to learn the daily routines of the characters is a cool game mechanic. The openness of the game is both good and bad.

Chatting to random people, stumbling around drunk, smoking indoors, going to raves, passing out on stranger's beds in communes and looting most things that are not bolted down is all quite possible but the game does hint at a darker plot teasing the depth of the story.\n\nAs for a world that feels alive, the soundtrack meshes with the game's vibe and atmosphere really well and I see it is available on Bandcamp now. As for the dialogue, I won't say it's super impressive by any means. The game doesn't always take into account which order you've spoken to characters in perfectly which can lead to a few strange lines of dialogue every now and then.\n\nAs a programmer by day, I do find the in-game coding to be a fairly decent balance for both newcomers and experienced developers. I'd be curious to see how players who have never coded actually grasp the mechanic. Some things are too easy in code like awarding yourself free money and I do wish the summary for commands was a bit more explanatory like actual APIs (Javadoc or Ruby/Python standard libraries). I know the focus of the game is "exploration" but that might be a big barrier for people new to programming.\n\nMy only real complaint is the camera controls. Luckily you can invert the camera rotation (feels more natural to me) in the Options screen but you can only zoom in and out with W and S not the mouse wheel which is bizarre. People who have played third person games like the Sims 3 or Cities Skylines might find the camera a bit weak in comparison. Whilst in the street, buildings between the player and the camera also don't go transparent so sometimes you find yourself messing around with it until you can see where you're going again.

The graphics are effective and have an interesting style, the sound works well, the gameplay is smooth (although there are a few problems with the camera and getting caught on objects) and the basic idea - of a world in which you can "hack" literally anything - is fascinating and well implemented.\n\nWhere it falls down a bit is as an actual adventure game. The story's rather badly paced and seriously dissonant with the abilities and scope you have in the game. I spent 3 hours (!) wandering around looking for a modifier (the item which lets you hack), couldn't find anything or indeed any interesting items other than a bunch of disks and a teleporter that sends you back to the hotel where you start. I practically quit in frustration before I Googled and found a review article that happens to mention the name and location of the one place and one time you have to be at to meet the one girl who advances the plot.  Once I'd done that and gotten the modifier, was I interested in the fetch quest I was told to do next? Nope, I went off and hacked everything in side, in doing so finding the name of the master villain, blundering into an encounter with them that was apparently supposed to be much later in the game (in which they yelled at me for all the trouble I'd caused them when I hadn't done anything yet), and then finding a terminal that blew the whole game wide open.\n\nIt's fun, but it's not really an adventure, and the facade of an adventure tremendously fades when you consider that the hacking in this game is supposed to be in-character (other characters have modifiers and talk about being hackers), which means it makes no sense that anyone ever does anything else. Oh, there's bad guys using secret methods to track people's location? Gee, that would be scary if you couldn't get anyone's location anytime you like with two function calls. Worried about your job? You can hack yourself a million dollars in 30 seconds.\n\nSo, if you like the idea of a game where you can be curious and experimental with a simple programming language and build up to having the feeling of AWESOMA POWAH then this game is great.

It is my first game of the hacking "genre", but I do have experience in software development and I am somehow familiar with the topic.\n\nThe beginning is quite straight forward and you get along pretty good. However as soon as you get to the main city where the actual story (for what I can tell atm, I haven't finished yet) takes place.\nA problem that you may face if you have absolutely no idea of what "hacking" is about, that even if you do not have to do any hacking yet, you are already expected to have the right mindset for doing so. The nature of hacking just is about finding a way how to get to a solution and in the case of the beginning it is just about getting to know the right people at the right time. This does require some skill set like having fun with exploring new areas, keep on pushing again and again until you get the result you want - like advancing in dialogues- and last but not least the patience to keep up with the task. But what is the task? This question will become clearer the more you move on. This is part of the game.\n\nTo sum up, you will need about 2-4h to get to the part where the "actual" game begins (the hacking part). If you get there, the rest will mostly be learning new stuff (like simple programming and manipulation) and a nice story. But you have to have the patience to get there - if you don't then probably the hacking part may not be your biggest satisfaction, neither. So you may just put the game aside and don't "waste" time on this game. On the other hand if you do get there you are most probably going to have a lot of fun with the rest of the game as well.\n\nThis may also be the biggest criticism: The game is not there to "teach" you patience and since it does not have the claim to be an educational game it somehow fails to introduce todays average/casual gamer to the required thinking (no offense to both parties :) ).  So I would definitly recommend the game but beforehand I'd make sure the player does know what to expect.","May 8","true","22.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I didn't hit it directly, I hit some other game from the same publisher or something and then a link to it from there. It was pre-release at the time and not being promoted anywhere else. I read enough to be excited by the prospect of it but fell asleep or got distracted or something without making a note of the name.\n\nFast forward a few weeks till I thought of it again and I was driving myself nuts trying to remember the name of this brilliant experimental adventure game I had found... I got so frustrated I almost had myself convinced I imagined it, dreamed it or fantasized it.\n\nI was pretty sure it would be released on Steam eventually if it wasn't a delusion, so I waited, stalking the coming soon and new release listings on the Store page. And finally here it is, snapped it up real quick and I'm glad I did.\n\n[PROS & CONS]\nPros\n- Highly experimental game mechanic (A pro in my book)\n- Vibrant and creative art style\n- Brilliant "chiptune" soundtrack, appeal for retro gamers\n\nCons\n- Not polished like a AAA game (not that you should expect it to be)\n- Writing could be stronger, but I am a harsh critic in this department, others might be more forgiving\n- Primary plot path is by necessity shorter and more direct than most games, though their is a great deal that can be done outside that path.\n\ntl;dr?

Really interesting and enjoyable open-world hacking game, where you can hack a turtle (or was it a tortoise...)!\n\nThe game is great with it's hacking. There's so many secrets and hidden webs for you to follow if you use some intution and it's one of the most rewarding parts of this game. It has a very hands-off approach when it comes to telling the player what to do, which is what makes it so satisfying when you run into something really interesting and cool..cus you did it yourself, not cus the big marker told you to do the thing. Congrats! I was also surprised by how much I could do with the hacking. The coding language in the game isn't going to turn you into a real life world class coder, but it's a great tool for beginners to pick up and advanced enough to let people with experience to make some pretty cool hacks (i know there's a way you can exploit the finance PC for infinite $$$...never could work it out).\n\nOne of the other's strengths of the game is it's music. One of the main dude's on this game, El Huervo, contributed tracks to the Hotline Miami soudntracks and him (and other contributers) have created a fantastic OST. Music isn't used too much but when it is, it hits the feeling of the world and the atmosphere just right. Whenever I was walking around the town, I liked to carry a radio just so I could help immerse myself in the world that little bit more.\n\nThe game does have some negatives though. There's some bugs in the game that can get you stuck (watch out for desks. seriously.), NPCs don't really react to you much (both friendly and hostile) and the ending of the game is a bit limp and unsatisfying, with relationships and characters just feeling...unresolved...\n\n...but if you can deal with all those things and willing to be a bit more forigiving of a small indie team making a game of this scale, then you'll find a game that's totally worth your time.

Slowly you realize that exploration follows a fragmented linear path using hacking to jump the gaps, this type of storytelling I enjoyed immensely and once completed felt the need to load an old save and go down some of the paths I didn't complete first time around.\n\nHowever, it could be improved in a number of small ways,\n\n- Inventory, it's too simple and clunky, a grid with stacking items, previews and images would be much easier to navigate rather than having to hold things and put them back to interact (at which point the item changes position in the list due to usage).\n- Something like a vague storage of important things you have been told or seen, not necessarily a quest log, just a journal of some kind that is controlled by the game like "X told me there's Y over there, perhaps I should check" since I tended to forget some important paths I didn't go down in sake of others, in the end I played the game with a text file open in the background to keep track of information, that's not the end of the world but I think it would make the accessibility a little better.\n\nI'd say those two things were my only gripe, I had a few bugs where I couldn't move, couldn't talk to NPC etc but they were fixed with a restart.\n\nOverall this is a really enjoyable game that challenged me and rewarded me, more please! :)","January 9","true","17.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's complexity and the freedom it gives to the player is something you rarely see in a game, it has left me wanting for more.\n\nThe game can easily intimidate you as you begin to play (it did to me), but if you just relax, pay a little attention, fiddle with things a little and explore as much as you can, you'll be mastering this jewel in no time. The in game programming mechanic open a whole new world for players, and don't require you to know a thing about it. You will find any and all learning tools while playing the game, and by the time you notice you will be typing code like crazy.\n\nVisually, the game is beautiful. A world full of color, almost psychedelic, yet perfectly balanced to be serious. You will feel certain gloom hanging about everything, but glimmering cheerfulness in some points that will give you a comfortable feeling.\n\nI must admit though, that some of the characters, with notorious exceptions, are a bit lacking, and it takes a while and some trial and error to get up to speed at certain times. But all around, the narrative compensates for this, and you'll find that you can actually have more fun if you actually stay off the track.\n\nGive it a go!","May 9","true","65.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It’s not something I would recommend to friends at full price and discount price would also be dubious at best.  I really wanted to like and enjoy Else Heart.Break() but this game feels more like a working prototype than a fully fleshed out adventure game.\n\nThe story line in this game is difficult to follow and there is no in-game journal of any kind to assist you in keeping track numerous names, places, or times. The main protagonist and supporting characters are largely uninteresting and reading or making dialog choices feels like an unrewarding chore that ultimately have little impact on the world and its story.\n\nIf you manage to muddle through the first couple of hours of this slow burner then you get a small glimpse of what potential Else Heart.Break() has and get to try writing “Spark” code and bending the world to your will.  In my experience this was not enough to want to make me keep droning through the rest of the story and I had to end up calling it quits.  The potential is here for this game to be something fun and unique but at the moment it’s just unique and I hope a sequel will come along to fix all the problems Else Heart.Break() suffers from.","May 29","false","14.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The great atmosphere thrills you from the very start and the city seems to have a lot of mysteries waiting to be discovered.\nThe game always gives you the feeling of being helpless. This supports the atmosphere on the on hand, but on the other one it also tends to ruin the fun. The game would benefit from established game-mechanics like a Quest-log or at least hints on what to do next.\nI finally reached a point, where I had completely no idea on what to do next. I tried to talk with every character, checked the common locations, so I started to experiment. I reached places which seemed to be way beyond of what I should reach according to where I am in the story. The game always allows you to do that using your Modifier, but it feels like cheating. Also, the Modifier which was the selling point for me, is introduced way to late (2-3hrs).\nThe game has a lot of potential, but it was not very fun for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dr_labcoat/recommended/400110/","dr_labcoat","Dr Labcoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dr_labcoat/","94 products in account","Else Heart.Break() is an RPG adventure game that is inspired of the retro games of the past that appeared in past computing platforms. It's a 3D adventure that you can rotate the camera around to look at other views of the location.\n\nThe protagonist starts in his parents house via boat after a telephone call about a job offer selling cola and is then rushed off to Dorisburg, an island whose major industry is mining some mysterious element. The game has a strange surreal feel to it - both being colourful but with some underlying gloom and decay which seems to give the impression that something is seriously wrong with the environment.  One example of this is the large number of litter bins that are piled up in the streets. There's electronic boxes and computers everwhere that are seem to be connected to the mysterious Computer Ministry, and people in suits can be seen modifying these devices.\n\nYour first hours on Dorisburg don't seem to go well. The Hotel Devotchka seems to have issues with your hotel room and the people working and staying there are quite quite strange and detached. Your contact for the cola sales job seems hard to find. You get distracted with the night life and contact a mysterious girl in the local nightclub. This starts you on a path where you start to understand what's really going on in Dorisburg - and in turn join a new circle of friends who are also fighting for answers.\n\nThe graphics style of the game is quite chunky and retro which suits the feel of the game extremely well. The soundtrack in the game is a mixture of ambient electronica and trip-hop (sorry I'm not really up on music genres) but suits the various environments in this strange surreal computer based world. The game is quite laid back and you explore and interact with people to learn more about what is going on. Some events happen as certain times of the day so it's important to be in the right place at the right time to meet people for appointments. There's a romance story here which I'm not sure how it's going to turn out yet. I feel that it might all go badly for Sebastian in the end if he cares about the girl he meets.\n\nThere is some programming in this game. I'm an accomplished programmer myself so I didn't have too many problems picking up the code. For a complete beginner, you can find people who teach you little pieces of code and will point you to others who know more. There are also guides that are easy to follow on floppy discs all over the place. Most of the devices have code on them so you can tinker and experiment to see how it works. You can start out looking at the code in lamps and drinks and modifying their properties to change their colour or effect on people. You can then move onto learning to open doors and hacking computers to allow you to move without being tracked. It's a gradual learning curve understanding enough to modify existing code to make it work..or take it out of action.\n\nThere are plenty of computers lying around with working code that you can copy to a spare floppy and play around with it later. I found various finished tools on people's computers that can be used to aid you. As your skills improve, you can hack devices and take control of the environment so the learning effort is definitely worth it.\n\nI'm about six hours into this so I'm still learning how everything works, but this is a novel experience that started out as an escape from the dull provincial life into a new exciting environment that I haven't reached the bottom of yet. One of the missions I did was to creep into the mines via a back route and steal all the data. It was quite a heart-pumping challenge to remain undetected.\n\nI can recommend this stylish and innovative game if you're into mysteries and problem solving through computers. Once you pick it up a few programming tricks, you can do some very interesting things in Dorisburg.\n\n** Additonal points after completing the game **\n\nI finally finished the game after about 30 hours of effort (and restarting) and I can definitely say that the effort was worth it. I managed to modify code in computer to explore all the places in Dorisburg and even those places that don't really exist.\n\nMy only issue with Else Heart.Break() is that the missions you are sent on are not logged within the game (I wrote them on paper) and if you don't complete them in time you will just lose the chance to complete them. This is a bit of a shame as events keep moving forward even if you're actively working on the mission. I suppose it's real life realism in that the world doesn't stand still whilst you're trying to work.\n\nThe ending is a bit disappointing as well. It's basically a fight or flight situation which leaves little room for inventive hacking to rid Dorisburg of the real villains and leaving your friends to the mercies of a corrupt organisation and a really horrible antagonist. I guess that again this is something of real life given the nature of power on Dorisburg. Doesn't make it hurt all the less. It's like the film Easy Rider, there's no avoiding the tragic ending and you have to leave with it as it was written.\n\nBut the original review stands. Well worth investing the time in, just to immerse yourself in programming and hacking things. I'd love to see a sequel as the story is left up in the air..","October 1, 2015","true","38.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I had a bit of trouble sometimes finding how to do things and i also ran into a few bugs where i got stuck. I will be writing about my experience with the game.\n\nThis game teaching you about scripting (technically not programming). And it does so in the way of telling a love story. you are playing in a world made up of bits and bytes, one's and zero's. And the story will take you through it.\n\nGameplayYou start working for a soda company but you dont really sell anything. By "stalking" people in game you find out where they are at what time if the day. The game doesnt really encourage you to go exploring so much as just following the story. But in the end exploring the entire town is really worth it (just be carefull around government facilities). You will find floppy disks around town and they will reveal parts of the story and teach you how to script in their custom made scripting language.\n\nAt some points in the game you will be stuck, it will happn, stuck in the story, stuck in the scripting, stuck in the actual word. you will get stuck, its unfortunate but it is not a really big deal, just save often enough so you can resume from a point where it was fine. If you are stuck with scripting things you can always look at the steam guides and forum for this game for help. Because you are not the only one, and people better than you have written guides on how to script or helped people on the forums.\n\nThe last time i checked the game developer was very active on the forums with helping out with bugs and issues realted to the game itself.\n\n\nGraphics, sound and musicThe Graphics in this game are not "Full-HD" or something like that. The textures look a bit low resolution BUT the graphics, the textures the way the game looks is very stialized, this game does not need high resolution textures. It has its own nice style.\n\nThe Camera is a another thing, the camera is hard to control around your character and you often cannot get an angle or view on the subject of matter because the camera is stuck behind other things like walls or buildings.\n\nThe sound is decent, nothing to write home about but it does the job, same goes for the music.\n\n\nConclusionI really like this game because it has scripting in it, and I love that. But you really need to like scripting or want to get into it in order to like this game, because there is no way to play without it.\n\nI give this game a 7/10. Its good at what it does but that about it. I do reccomend this game to anyone wanting to learn scripting or can already script / program.\n\nTL;DRGet this game if you want to learn to script or if you can already script / program. otherwise it wont be a fun experience for you","April 28","true","16.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I read about it and saw a good review by PCGamer, and it being the favourite game of the year of the reviewer. I previously played some other programming related games and enjoyed those, so I expected this one to be fun too.\nSadly, it wasn't. The game gives you no clear instructions what to do, and while you can usually figure it out easily, sometimes you are just walking around, talking to random people trying to do what you think you are supposed to do. The controls are rather annoying, as the camera often clips into buildings making it hard to look around.\nI have not played the game for long, but I already encountered a bug twice where I had to reload a savegame because the game stopped responding to my input, and I get random lagspîkes from time to time (although that might just be my outdated hardware).\nSo while I expected to have a good time with this game, I sadly didn't. I would not currently recommend the game untill the developers roll out some patches.","March 6","false","1.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I will eventually know the place, I guess.\nNavigating also feels slow even though you can run: it's mostly due to having to constantly move the camera to see your destination.\n\nThe story seems to get messed up when you don't do what the game expects.\nI passed out in the street and missed an event. After that, the dialogues were quite unrelated to the current context and I lost track of what I was supposed to do.\n\nI think I try to get into the hacking part too fast and miss the main thread. However, I don't know what else to do and start getting bored.\n\nFinally, the game got stuck after using a broken fuse box with the Slurp() instruction (not sure what it was supposed to do).

Avoid this game if you have no clue about coding.

It has an open world that allows quite a lot of free exploration and discovery despite its small size. I was impressed by how I progressed the story without activating any quests and by just following cues from NPCs.\n\nThe game becomes a bore once a coding mechanic is introduced which to me - as someone not familiar enough with coding - makes the game completely unplayable and utterly frustrating. The first tutorial sections are easy enough puzzles, but once you get to the real deal the game is quite relentless.

Why you ask?\nWell, let's compare the actual game to the things, which were promised.\n\n1. "An expansive 3D world, begging to be explored."\nIf you call Dorisburg open world, then the cities in Path of Exile are open world as well. And I am not talking about lacking content, it is mainly about the quality of the content. I was excited to explore the supposed open world and before I was heading to my next step of the story line, which was checking in to the Devutchka hotel, I walked around the city to experience what is going on there. I talked with people, I looked for some buildings, but when I slowly started to change from randomly experiencing the map to finding my next story line objective, the city just got more and more annoying, because it was pretty hard to find the hotel after I explored other areas (btw. for me personally it was kind of immersion breaking, that you just look at a black void at the borders of the city, but that was not the only thing; the camera started to be really annoying at some point, because the perspective is just bad and you have to really work on seeing what you actually want to see, because your vision is either blocked by buildings or you are looking from the wrong perspective) and on the way I found like 500 floppies, 500 computers and a couple of people, oh and yes, you can kick lamps, for whatever reason. In the meantime a slept a couple of times in foreign beds and stole stuff from people, which...\n\n2. "Many hours of engaging story, set in a meticulously simulated city, with people that feel truly alive."\n...brings me to my next point. Truly alive? You are joking, right? I spoke to most people along my way and they either didn't want to talk to me at all, said some boring casual stuff, nothing special or weren't there because in the whole "open world" city there were like 20 people on the streets, and that number is generous. And most of them weren't special at all, or at least the "special" things were pretty boring compared to what imagination could have created. Also the dialogues sometimes were pretty stupid, since the people there are literally like AI and not believable at all (btw. when I looked for my room in the hotel, I found another room, which was open and it was really small and kind of ridiculous, because it had like two rooms, of which one was the main room with two sinks and a shower and the second room was like 2m² and had only a toilet in it. that's right, you obviously can stay over night in a hotel to get a room without a bed. I was really confused, when I saw that, well but finally I found my actual room and look at that, it was basically the same room, but only because it was Sebastians room, he shouted out "WHAT THE" and he was also "confused", when he saw the living conditions. for me this kind of scripted events aren't open world to me at all, since he should've noticed that ♥♥♥♥ in the previous room already, and when you make an "open world" you should expect, that people are gonna exploit this by reaching areas, that aren't supposed to be visited yet or at all, according to the actual story line), when they for example don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about you stealing stuff, which...\n\n3. "A challenging game where your actions matter and nothing can ever be unsaid or undone."\nbrings me to my next point. Really? Really? Where do my actions matter? Please say the place and situation in the game, so I can check it out by myself. I break into houses of foreign people, and they are like "Hey, who are you? What's up?" or "Hey, what are you doing? What's your name?". I steal stuff in the front of the faces of the stupid AI and they do... nothing. Literally. Another example of how actions don't matter and you can undo them is, when you meet the guy, who speaks to an animal, or himself loudly so you don't have to talk to him, to see him talking. He asks you for a beer and you can answer no, no and then you can still give him a beer. Same with other people who ask you something about yourself and you still can change something about that, except the things, that don't matter. Like being called by your nickname for example. Which makes no difference. Many other answers don't seem to make any difference, except the different answer from the AI you are talking to, which has no actual consequence for you and your character, as well as the story. So meanwhile you talk to some boring guys and find loads of coca cola, booze and beer. You drink some of it, and oh, something changes... Wait, no, nothing changes. At all. Which...\n\n4. "Tons of every-day objects and computers that work and can be modified."\n...brings me to my next point. You can find many computers, that's right. You also can find many floppies, like the "DigitalCrap64", to have something to do on the computers. You also find tools for a computer, like a screwdriver. Well and that's it. I explored at least 20 houses and 90% of all things were those which I mentioned above. Oh, wait and you find beverages, like booze, coca cola or beer. Which btw. changes literally nothing about your character. I at least hoped him to get drunk after drinking some bottles o' alcohol, but mh-mh, no. What's the point of implementing something, that has no actual in-game effect or consequence? The only reason in this case could be: it is fun, or interesting, or something like that. It is neither of that though.\nI know the motto of the game "...where bits have replaced atoms.", though I didn't realize, that most content is just based on the idea of doing something on vintage computers. And talking to people, that are supposed to be interesting, but I only met a couple of people in the city and the ones I was supposed to talk to, like the woman in the hotel. A guy on the street told me about a bar, which is supposed to be interesting. Also I asked the woman in the hotel, if there is something interesting in the city and she also mentioned bars. So, as I expected, the most interesting or action rich part of the "open world" is supposed to be the bars, which...\n\n5. "A laid-back experience where you can just go to the café and have a coffee whenever things get too hectic."\n...brings me to my next point. It is indeed a laid-back experience. Though not for us, rather for the developers, as it seems. And when exactly do things get too hectic? I know, I didn't play all of the game, but considering how the story went on and what the main "attractions" were, I don't expect much else. Feel free to correct me, if I am wrong. For me it just seems like the game is about going to the bar, hanging out with a couple of chicks, then go to your home and do some else heart.break() stuff on the vintage computer. The time in-between was just boring or there just was nothing really. This didn't get better, when I was even more driven by the game to get bored due to lack of some SOUND. It was really quiet and unexciting to listen to the game, which...\n\n...sorry, I reached the limits of a Steam review, so if you are still interested in completing of reading my review, then please refer to the following link: http://pastebin.com/krGRCd9M","September 24, 2015","false","1.3"," 64 of 131 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","64","131","3","11"

Hardcore in that there is no handholding, no UI or designated scripted guidance for anything you do. The inclusion of programmer-esque hacking later on is pretty neat, and a novel idea. I just did not enjoy the constant slowness and almost nonexistant plot for such long stretches of the game. Good art design, well made, and musically sound, lots to explore and investigate, but minimal return on story or in depth character development.","September 24, 2015","false","1.4"," 39 of 102 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","39","102","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phizeroth/recommended/400110/","phizeroth","Ƥhi Ȥerøth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phizeroth/","109 products in account","Else Heart.Break() is awkward. The camera takes some getting used to (and forgiving acceptance.. just wait until you're told to find a 'tall building' but you can't actually look up), the art style is unique but strange, the event triggering and dialogue paths are often awkward and you'll spend a decent portion of time being confused about where you are in the story line and what you're supposed to do next or if you've already done it and whether that mission you just did was a success or not.\n\nThat being said, I absolutely love else Heart.Break(). I would buy an expansion or sequel in a heartbeat (Heart.Beat() ?). I spent a leisurely 28 hours on the first playthrough in three days (got snowed in), and plan on going through it again and tinkering around with more stuff and trying for alternate endings and just practicing building scripts.\n\nIts awkwardness eventually becomes endearing, the strange art style becomes a cherished world, the programming aspect is surprisingly robust, and the bugs and quirks become part of what you would expect in a fully hackable world. I wish it were longer, but I honestly have no idea how the developer crafted it in such a way that even it holds itself together for 28 hours. Once you learn how to modify the world around you, you're limited only by your programming skills and curiosity. I have a bit of code experience and definitely ended up in some places I shouldn't have before I was supposed to, but for the most part the game still kept up with me.\n\n###\n\nSpeaking of programming skill, if you have some coding knowledge, I bet you will enjoy this game. If you have no skill but really want to learn, you should certainly play it. I've learned a bit and gotten good practice just hacking around and building scripts in this. I recommend taking some programming courses online along with playing the game. Being able to apply your knowledge to the game will feel awesome.\n\nIf you have no programming skill but enjoy logical problem-solving, you should be able to tinker your way through this and have a good time. If you don't enjoy problem-solving, you're probably in the wrong place.\n\nLastly, if you actually are a professional programmer, the sky's the limit for the wacky awesome sh*t you could build in this game. There are a few Github repositories and gists that could use more advanced contributions, and a Sprak syntax package for Sublime Text that's handy for working on and saving scripts outside of the game. I would love to see a bigger Sprak meta out there.\n\n###\n\nSome people have complained that the game is too slow in the beginning and turns them off, and I won't argue with them. It didn't bother me while playing it, but while researching before purchasing, most of the let's play videos on YouTube involve someone playing through the first couple of hours and honestly it didn't look very enticing. They made me worry that programming really wasn't a major part of the game. The few YouTubers I could find that actually show some hacking were doing pretty basic stuff.\n\nSo just trust me that you should stick through until you acquire the ability to reprogram the world around you, and you won't be disappointed. Programming is the real meat of the game, and you will feel like a god.","January 24","true","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deuxtan/recommended/400110/","deuxtan","Deuxtan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deuxtan/","94 products in account","This is one of the most interesting games I've played in YEARS and I don't believe I will stop talking about it for a long time.\n\n-- SUMMARY --\nIt's weird and different in all the right ways with an incredibly open world. And what is lacks in size it makes up for in rich, detailed environments. In fact, it might be the most open game in existance since you can, and are encouraged to, literally hack and mod the game itself. Which unsuprisingly also introduces some complications with the gameplay.\n\nNonetheless I'd recommend this game to anyone with a general interest in programming and adventures games. Especially to anyone liking that 8-Bit, nerdy, quirky atmosphere similar to other media like Scott Pilgrim and Fisheye Placebo.\n\n\n\n-- PROS --\nFrom the atmosphere to the innovative gameplay to the intricate level design, I loved it all. Else Heart.Break() manages to create a world worth exploring populated with lovable characters.\n\nThe developers went to great lenghts to create a living and breathing city. Each and every of the characters and even random NPCs(!) have their work / life routine and their own individual home. Honestly, just checking out all the interesting apartments was a treat in and of itself.\n\nAnd figuring out which people you would meet at certain places and hours of the day was rewarding. The game successfully conveys the helplessness of being the stranger in a new city which makes settling in and slowly joining a new social circle that much more enjoyable.\n\nThe main game mechanic, programming, introduces a new dimension to an already interesting point and click adventure and you're given so many possibilities that you'll be spending hours just messing around, trying to exploit the game in creative ways. Discovering secrets on floppy disks at hard to reach locations, that sometimes give hints about the main story and sometimes more information about the inner workings of the games' ingame programming language SPRAK.\n\nThe coding concepts introduced are basic, easy to grasp and well explained with lots of ingame examples of working scripts than can be reused and experimented with.\n\nIn general, the developers seemed to put much emphasis on experimenting and learning on your own, which I believe to be a risky decision, possibly scaring off players who are very used to long tutorial missions and being held by the hand. But personally, I found being thrown into a world without clear objectives liberating and in combination with the beautiful city and it's mysterious hints I was instantly intrigued and intent on getting behind the secrets of Dorisburg.\n\n\n\n\n-- CONS --\nThe biggest issue is that the game creates huge expectations.\nYou'll be left wanting more more more, and while that sounds like a good thing, you might be disappointed if you're expecting all of your actions to create a new storyline or dialogue options.\n\nIn a ridiculously open environment like that it's impossible to account for the myriads of possible scenarios and it shows at times. When you finally managed to break in a previously inaccessible building with an ingenious plan, you might be taken aback by discovering that this changes nothing about the main storyline. You can't even tell any of your friends about it.\n\nThat lack of interaction devaluates your impact as a player on the game and I believe that is the single issue everyone is talking about when they complain about lacking content or story.\n\nIn an AAA game this would have been a major concern, but seeing how an indie dev team works on comparably much more limited ressources it's understandable that they simply can't create hours of content for each and every possibility just in case a handful of players choose that exact route. And creating content that only a small minority of players will experience is a pretty wasteful endeavour.\n\n\n\nMy only hope remains that this is the first of many games using this engine or some ambitious players will be building mods expanding this world that I can't seem to escape from.","February 26","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With some creativity, you can make a teleporter, turn your radio into a lockpick, or make a tazer.  The only downside to this game is the lack of clearcut objectives. Remember the "hidden" quests from the fallout series where no markers are given? Well, this game has no markers or quest journal, which emphasizes the fact that the game refuses to tell you what to do.

From hacking coffee to top-secret computer mainframes, the game’s coding system provides an interesting means of progressing its story. This code system is so robust that it allows for multiple solutions to many of the plot points that you’ll run into, allowing you to stretch your creativity and solve challenges in a personalized manner.\n\nThis hacking system lends itself well to the narrative of the game, as nearly every major plot point requires you to go out and find it yourself. You’ll often find yourself running around town talking to every NPC imaginable, attempting to find some hint or direction to advance the story. Although this can be frustrating at times, the majority of the time I found exploring Dorisburg and learning about its characters to be exciting and fun. This game rewards you for delving into its secrets by presenting you with humourous side-stories or new functions to augment your programs and hacking ability. It is extremely satisfying to work off of a small hint given to you by an NPC and hack your way to the next objective.\n\nThat said, if you are looking at this game as a non-programmer, your experience with this game may be completely different than mine. Although this game does a good job of introducing you to the concepts needed to use its language (if you manage to find the floppy disks ridden about the world), it may be a bit overwhelming to wrap your head around. It doesn’t take much hacking to advance through the plot and beat the game, however, I think that a major part of the experience lies in exploring the hacking system and messing around in the digital playground that the game gives you.\n\nAdditionally, the dialogue system that the game revolves around is extremely rudimentary. Although you are presented with many options to choose from when conversing with NPCs, I found that not many of my decisions actually mattered. The way that NPCs would interact with my character was hardly different based on the decision I made, aside from a few lines of dialogue. This definitely detracts from the overall experience of the game, as you’ll be encountering a heavy amount of dialogue.\n\nThese gripes aside, I believe that Else Heart.Break() is a fantastic game that is worth every bit of time that you put into it. Dorisburg is a lovingly-crafted playground that begs to be explored.","March 4","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The closest comparison to it would have to be a combination between Watch Dogs and The Matrix.\n\nThe art style is very interesting, the gameplay fun and unique.\n\nI very much reccomend this game, but I reccomend you read nothing!\nThe game is very easy to spoil by knowing pretty much anything, even certain functions. All the fun is had with the trial and error while trying to figure everything out for yourself. Just follow the storyline. If you get lost, just explore and live your life. It will all make sense eventually!","March 7","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you get to that stage, the world becomes flexible and the game becomes fun. That said, I didn't think much of the story, but it was worth it to get the satisfaction of creating a bottomless cup of coffee and stealing from everyone across the city.\n\nThe programming is easy to understand, but the documentation is deliberately hard to get, so you "level up" through organic discovery, which is a nice mechanic.","January 24","true","22.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And the terrible camera is only obfuscating your limited view on an area only further. I like the idea of the game in itself, but the realization of it is just....NO, especially for a point and click adventure.","May 30","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
