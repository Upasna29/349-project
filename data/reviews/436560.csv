Kings and Heroes is a first person RPG that offers a blend of lobby based dungeon running and open world exploration.  Currently, the open world is there, but not populated with any content whatsoever, so that leaves us with a mostly functional dungeon crawl experience.\n\nSeveral gamebreaking bugs plagued this game on launch day, but the small dev team put out 2 patches within 24 hours of each other to address them.  This is Early Access, so some remain, others will be discovered, and many more will be fixed as time goes by.  Currently, you can initially run dungeons ranging from small to huge on various difficulty settings from easy to nightmare.  Even small can take some time, especially solo, but large really means large.  They can be massive on huge.  Difficulty ramps up considerably as you increase it.  I don't see anyone soloing nightmare before end-game with optimized gear.  Matchmaking for me has worked fine, but it seems the game tries to place you with players of the same level, so the lower levels can make it easier to just grind solo.  After level 10, though, grouping became much more enjoyable.  I have found the experience to be surprisingly social in dungeons.  Most of my groups have chatted away as we ground our way to the lower depths of dungeons.  Chat in the city is alive with people forming premade groups as well.  One complaint here is that it gets pretty repetitive at times, especially in the early levels before you've unlocked different locations to crawl through.\n\nCrafting offers a different game to those that have managed to figure it out.  It works, but is clearly unfinished as of now.  It is listed as "independent of character level," but this is untrue.  Currently the skill levels (a max of 500) are not displayed, and are limited by your class level at 10 points per level.  Crafting itself works fine though.  Players can randomly obtain various qualities of crafted gear with a lower chance for purples and yellows.  I can see an end game situation where one would craft endlessly for that perfect item to round out a gear set.  To some this might be a turn-off.  Also there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of variation on stats.  With higher quality items, you get more stats on a piece, so crafting that high mitigation spell power plate is possible, but it cannot be customized.  It's all RNG.\n\nOverall, the experience offered in Kings and Heroes is fun, even if a little flawed due to early access.  Time will tell if this game turns in to the fully realized vision that Industry Games has for it, or if it will simply be another one of the many EA games on Steam that never really made it.  The potential is there, and there is open communication and passion from the devs.  I hope that someone reading this can see what I can from this very early access game: potential.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat dungeon crawler.\nLots of loot to grab.\nChallenging at higher difficulties.\nRewarding solo play if you can hack it.\nMeaningful crafting for those that enjoy it.\nAttentive and passionate dev team\nSocial experience.\n\nCons (many of these will be addressed as EA matures):\n\nEmpty open world.\nPoor performance / optimization in places.\nRepetitive / Grindy.\nLittle character customization outside of gear.\nRNG nature (from primary stats to crafting outcomes, everything is random)\nNumerous bugs.","June 2","true","17.0"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

(If they get the game working)\n\nSo from my understanding, there is going to be two main features to the game.\n\n1.) Overworld Exploration (Its supposed to be massive and I briefly went out of town and it looks ridiculously massive. Like Skyrim scope kind of massive, maybe even bigger.)  The overworld will be static (not random) but have a ton of stuff to explore. The further you go, I would assume it gets harder and harder.\n\n2.) Randomized dungeons... You choose the dungeon size such as small, large, huge... And also the difficulty like easy or hard... Then you spawn into a dungeon solo or in a group. I played one dungeon and it was very fast paced and fun.\n\n\n100% honest truth... If they fix the bugs and make the game run smooth, this game is going to be the next big thing since Diablo 1 and 2...  The loot seemed cool from the little I saw but seems like there are a lot of stats / attributes like in a Diablo game but it plays like a fast paced Skyrim.\n\nI really hope the workers at Industry games sees what they have and holds on to it and works to get it up and running. The gaming world needs this refreshing change in scenery.","May 31","true","12.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

Chose from one of 5 classes (more to come), one of 6 races, choose your level of neutrality (good or evil or anywhere in between), and roll your stats! Then, be ready for an adventure! This game is an excellent dungeon hub game with an exceptional (and likely to improve) open world as well. The open world alone is massive, and I can foresee so much more being added to it!\n\nThe real highlight of this game is the dungeons. Choose from multiple dungeon types (more likely to be added, and are also unlocked by level), select dungeon length, and select difficulty, and get ready for fun! Join up with up to 8 friends, or fly solo! This is only the beginning, but it already is a very fun game to play, especially in a group!\n\nThis game truly reminds me of old school dungeon runner games like Dungeon Runners Online. It sticks true to its genre. It gives you the freedom to build your character as you like, any weapon or armor for any class, and allows you to specialize your character how YOU want. It even adds in a lot of fun, shiny weapons, and different gear sets that actually look different (no cosmetic-only phenomena - what a concept)!\n\nThere is going to be so much more to come to this game, and you would be hurting yourself by not joining in earlier and helping make this game something we all will enjoy. Day 1 started out bumpy, but they ended up fixing all of the major performance issues in just that patch, and I can\'t wait to see what else will come!\n\nWhether you buy it now, or buy it in a month once more patches get released, you will come to enjoy this game as a true gem that sticks true to what it is. For once, we have an indie action RPG that is being done right. With PVP coming down the line, and even more classes, dungeons, maps and content to come, the sky is truly the limit for this game!","June 1","true","64.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","1"

But here we go.\n\nKings and Heroes, a game that most of us could only hope and wish for. First Person Combat RPG, not like Vermintide but with depth to it. Think if Skyrim, Dungeons and Dragons, and Diablo had a baby. This would be that baby. It literally checked every single thing I wanted in a game.\n\nLaunch day was a bit rough, insane lag, graphical glitches, input lag, game kinda still ran bad on my 980 and i7 5820k.

Holy god it was fun, there are still bugs, the game is unoptimized yes, but at its CORE, it is truly going to shape up to be a great game. And one I will continue playing. The devs are very very vocal, and seem like they are actually caring for their baby. Which is a breath of fresh air.\n\nI wont leave a review score right now, but I DO reccomend this game.

As it stands, the only thing I see avilable as far as content, is the dungeons. Do not get this game at the moment if you are looking for your next World of Warcraft AAA MMORPG. This is not that.\n\nThis, from the character creation all the way to the environment and dungeons, reminds me of my tabletop gaming days. 5 or 6 classes, 5 or 6 races, base stats are calculated by dice (since it\'s on PC, obviously is going to be RNG and not actual dice), and race actually impacts your stats!\n\nIn the games current state, there are plenty of graphical, UI, and AI bugs. But that didn\'t stop me from getting a group together to go do a dungeon. The AI and hit boxes need a little work. Thing that really sucks in dungeons is how narrow the corridors are, and allies can actually block your spells and ranged attacks. So 90% of the time I\'m just hitting my allies in the back of the head.\n\nOverall, I see a lot of potential in this game.

What is this? Kings and Heroes? Finally, a new adventure worthy of my time!\n\nI rolled myself a fine dwarven character, a cleric named Merrygold. With a blessed hammer and a joyous beard I set forth, landing in the bustling town of Everdale. What astonishing tales awaited me? What luminous treasure anticipated my hand at the bottom of a dark dungeon?\n\nReady for romance and danger I walked through the buildings, smiling as I examined the many races with various professions. I found myself inside a tavern, where a handful of weary travelrs rested. Suddenly, a man burst inside, calling out on voice chat in a strange accent-\n\n"WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO ACCOMPANY ME TO SLAY SOME MONSTERS AND ♥♥♥♥?"\n\nA strange way of wording, but I decided I would answer his call nontheless. I was about to respond to his summon when someone in the back of the room called out\n\n"SHUT THE F**K UP YOU DAMN DIRTY ELF. THIS IS AN ORC BAR."\n\nThe two then proceeded to bicker and insult each other's mothers, while a man jumped from the top of the balcony and recited what seemed like the entire speech from Helm's Deep.\n\nDeciding my journey lied elsewhere, I ventured to the town square, where a great statue of a courageous warrior stood. Admiring its craftmanship, I was just about to further inspect it when suddenly a robed man carrying a staff appeared at the top by some sort of teleportation spell.\n\n"I AM YOUR KING. YOU ARE ALL PEASANTS TO ME."\n\nThis he cried out, before proceeding to rain great, firey meteors down, which the good people seemed to mostly ignore.\n\nFeeling confused but still hopeful, I finally decided to try my combatical prowess in a dungeon. Onward I went, preparing myself for what was sure to be the fight of my life. I readied my hammer and prayed to my God, opening the first door in this accursed place.\n\nThen a skeleton stunlocked me and I died immediately.\n\n\n\nActual Opinion:\n\nYou've probably read about the mechancis and bugs of this game, so I'm not going to talk that much about them. What I will say is that yes, the mechanics are solid and fun, and yes, at the current moment the game is ridden with bugs.\n\nBut hands down, my favorite feature so far is the voice chat. Everyone roleplays- badly. It's pretty damn funny. I really hope this game continues to be updated and gets at -least- a small loyal following, because I can 100% see this game having a fantastic community.\n\nI followed a guy around the town for about ten minutes narrating everything he did.

Despite all of that, the basic premise plays out really well when everything comes together and works as intended. What I mean by that is that after a few minutes getting accustomed  to the controles I actually managed to join a group of 4 others for a short dungeon run since they wanted a wizard to light things up a bit (passive torch spell). I came along, and the loot is fun - diablo-esque, the group dynamics are pretty good, and the world design/graphics hold up pretty nicely. After only about 25 min we wrapped it up since it was small and I thanked them for the time and logged off. So it was a short session, but it did sell me on what this game is trying to be and I\'m curious to see how it develops.\n\nPerformance is OK, the patch seemed to have helped but I still had log in issues when I was testing stuff out. I\'ll try to log back in later and see how things go.\n\nOverall: This is clearly an early access game, bugs and all. When everything works, it feels like a first person Diablo title with a nice cozy central hub to chill at while getting a group together. Hopefully as work continues on the game they will be able to ensure that everything works much more often than not.","June 1","true","7.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Before I go on, I recommend it if you're comfortable with Early Access games.  If you are unhappy spending money on a product that is not finished, can crash, has bugs, etc - do not buy this game.\n\nThat said, I'm having an absolute blast.  The game supports solo play, and co-op up to 8 players.  5 Classes and multiple races to choose from, and multiple character slots available allow for a lot of variability in play.  Each class does play fairly distinct from the others and are legitimate on their own.\n\nCrafting is not fully implemented, but what is there is functional at a base level.  This is one of the areas I'm most excited for, but if you are buying this with crafting being a primary factor, be aware it is not yet complete!\n\nI have played both solo and with groups.  Both are a ton of fun, though get enough wizards together and your screen will be so full of color that you may lose sight of the enemy.  Towns are MMO style, with up to 250 players (I think? I could be wrong there) capable of being present.  Global voice-chat is enabled, and some people's microphones are WAY louder than others.  Hopefully there will be a way to handle this in the future.\n\nI've crashed a couple times, but overal it's been pretty solid for an Early Access experience.  Loading can take quite awhile (especially when you launch the game initially), so just be aware of that.\n\nClassic ARPG dungeon delving, grouping, looting, crafting, leveling, buying/selling and skill purchasing are all present to varying degrees of completion.\n\nTo sum up - I'm having a blast.  If you enjoy watching games progress from unstable, feature incomplete but fun games into fully fledged products, then do pick this up and support the developers.  If you need a finished product to justify the cost of your money, feel free to wait for it to be further along or released before purchase as there is definitely a way to go for some features and stability.","June 2","true","14.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

There is truly SO much potential here. Kings and Heores is a Diablo-style dungeon grinding game with lots of unique traits that really creates a refreshing experience. This game has a very nostalgic feel to it, yet it\'s unlike anything I\'ve ever played before.\n\nThe game features a huge overworld with varied landscapes and regions. It currently is explorable but not entirely populated, but it shows much promise. From giant icy castles on mountain tops, to muddy swamps, this game truly has it all. It invokes a sense of adventure I haven\'t felt in a game since I first played WoW 10 years ago. Currently there can be up to 250 players in the overworld and devs are looking to increase that. Quests and other things to do in the world are soon coming as well.\n\nThe combat is very satisfying, it feels very similar to that of Dark Messiah. Accuracy matters, there is no auto-targetting. If you get head shots, you will do more damage than blindly firing off arrows and spells. Death actually feels like it\'s meaningful too. If you die, that\'s it for the dungeon you\'re in. You can be revived by a scroll or a Cleric, but if your team wipes you don\'t get another shot.\n\nDungeons are surprisingly fun. I intially feared that playing with 8 people in first person might cause too much clutter and confusion but it actually works quite well. The dungeons currently have some basic traps, and devs say that secret passages and such are on the way soon. It\'s really great gathering a big party of friends and just dungeon crawl, there aren\'t many opportunities to do that these days.\n\nThere\'s a surprising amount of content for the game as it\'s still EA. Most of the core features work and are available. The devs seem very dedicated, they have been working day and night to pump out patches it seems. That being said, there are certainly some cons. There\'s a huge number of bugs, and the performance is not the best. I hear AMD GPU users are having some issues with artifacting and spell details on weapons. If you don\'t have a somewhat decent PC, I would hold out until there\'s some more optimization. I have a 970 though and the game is playable for me with lag only in congested areas.\n\nI will continute to update this review as things come along, but I would definitely recommend this if you\'re a fan of dungeons, looting and just having some adventures with friends.","June 1","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Mainly because there is always that nagging feeling of potential. Which then translates into this happy review of hopes and dreams.... That are not even in the game yet.\n\nLet me start off by saying that Kings and Heros feels like an immersive RPG, where you group up with players, explore dungeons, and that's pretty much it. As of June 4th, much of the world is created, but there is nothing out there.\nMuch of the world is just empty with landscapes everywhere but nothing to do 5 feet outside or inside of town, questing begins and ends just to show you where the inn is.\n\nIt is impressive that a game can stand on it's core mechanics alone and that is the main thing I will praise this game for. The dungeons feel like something you would expect out of a skyrim or DnD. I could not imagine what it must feel like to actually have freinds with this game. Or, even the finished product.\n\nEither way,\n\nTL,DR: Kings and heros is a game with great potential and impressive game mechanics. But, that's where the fun begins and ends. You will be expecting so much more after playing for a few minutes. It's just not ready.","June 4","false","1.0"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

Don't expect to see the same level of detail or have the same performance while playing.\n\nFor a price tag of $30 CAD, this is no where near a playable EA state.

However, it's not very playable (for me, at least), so it's hard to recommend.  The graphics aren't that amazing, either, but it is early access I suppose.\n\nYou can pick one of the five classes and then try and enter the game -which takes ages due to everyone else trying it at the moment.  Once you log in, you need to wait for people to move so you can get out of the spawn spot.  All the while, it's very very laggy and you will have character pop-in issues.\n\nThen, you'll need to make your way to the Inn and try to start a dungeon.  Dungeons can be very small (tried solo) to a full group, and you can also set a difficulty.  However, after my one escapade where I died due to lag, I was never able to join a dungeon again due to errors.  So, can't really play it.\n\nOverland seems a bit DDO-like with a central hub wit lots and lots of people running around.  However, this hub seems fairly (totally?) empty of stuff to do so you're stuck trying to get into the single procedural dungeon type.\n\nMaybe after the throngs quite spamming it tonight it will improve.  Shall update the review this weekend.  But, if you didn't get it at a discount already, perhaps wait a bit...\n\nEdit - Tried again and now I get a 'fatal error' when entering a dungeon; have tried several times.

I still had to wait for today to have a look, but I assume that's because Steam wouldn't allow access to the server until the game released. No blood, no foul.\n\nI cannot recommend the game in its current state, but that may change in the near future as things get rolling and some of the more pernicious bugs are executed with extreme predjudice. Some of these things could have been resolved with more extensive beta testing and a good stress test for the servers.\n\nHad it been offered as an Open Beta, I'd have been a bit kinder to it. Early Access is a good place for it, but if you're looking at investing $30 into this game (or whatever the 4-pack is going to run), then you might want to hold off a couple of weeks to see if the bigger issues have gone.\n\nTexture/model optimization, especially at lower settings would be a good place to start, fix the AI that was slowing things down in town, and getting the character generation procedure to make some sort of sense for a start. It looks like the base system was dragged wholesale from the 4th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons. Oh, and set the default Graphics quality to something other than "Ultra." Yes, Ultra is pretty, but my video card got a little overheated and threw a tantrum.\n\nHaving to get all the way into the hub city to get to the Options wasn't my idea of fun.\n\nMaking the NPCs around town into people as opposed to fluffy sound bites would be really nice, as well as some lore-- the background hdere is very pretty, but a long way from the rich tapestries of history and current events that make games like EverQuest, Final Fantasy XIV, and World of Warcraft the much-beloved powerhouses they are today.\n\nI will be logging in here and there to see how you\'re coming along, and when it\'s in a more playable condition, I'll change it to Recommend. Kings and Heroes has a lot of potential, but right now it's far too rough to be in a live environment.\n\nFor the record, the devs have pushed not one but two patches in the last ten hours, and whilst it did help matters a bit, it's still not quite where it should be. We'll see what it looks like again in a few hours, but I'm not expecting miracles.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiNvOtQz5Mc\n\nIt's come to my attention that seven out of ten people have found this review unhelpful-- I'm not a fanboy, and I have no horse in the race at this point. I think it has the potential to be good, but it's not quite there now. If the concerns I have in the video are addressed, it should cross the line between a not-recommend and a recommendation.\n\nThat depends on the developer, and not the crowd that currently seems to be having a mad because I've played all of an hour and then was critical about it. Without criticism, the devs aren't going to know what they might improve upon, and that would be even worse.\n\nI stand by my review. If it gets better, I'll amend it.","May 31","false","1.8"," 11 of 33 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","11","33","0","0"

Starting a new character puts you very literally through 30 minutes of load screens, at the end of which you MAY be able to play, assuming the load screen goes away once the UI loads.

The lengthy load screens and the fact that the whole game stutters when you mouse over a button shows a complete lack of anything resembling optimisation.  They really should have taken a step back from the art department and sought out an experienced programmer, as it's clear there were none involved.\n\nI'll keep checking back periodically as the game is updated, as the patches do seem to be coming quickly, but frankly, the lack of polish, and the massive memory and storage use (second patch was seriously 1.3 gigs!) show either a lack of skill on the devs part, or lack of concern for their customers’ time, money, and experience, which is a shame.\n\nOh, and public voice chat on by default and at top volume when you start the game is possibly the WORST idea ever concieved.

I really don\'t see what the point of this game is, 8 people going down narrow corridors with all kinds of bright spell effects, unprecise targetting, and enemies that don\'t animate smoothly is not a recipe for fun gameplay.\n\nAs for dynamically generating dungeons, so far all of my dungeons have been exactly the same (maybe a wall or two in a different place), and the same 3 types of enemies over and over. This is just not fun! I understand this is early access but I don\'t even understand the vision behind this game. It promises a lot of things but delivers on none of them. Core combat is unsatisfying, loot is represented as popup windows when clicking on a dead body, movement in groups is confusing, dungeons look very very similar and so do monsters, and crafting does not seem to work at all for me (I am stuck at level 6 for no obvious reason, and got there before crafting anything at all).\n\nMy advice for the developers is to take the most important features they care about one by one and fix them rather than failing at 20 things simultaneously.\n\nI will still keep an eye on this game as for me exploring dynamic dungeons in first person and getting better and better loot is what I was hoping for and would still like to experience at some point in the future.","June 1","false","6.0"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","26","7","27","0","3"

To put things bluntly, this game is not lying when they say "Early Access"; the game is not finished and still needs coats of polish, but the concept and mechanics are absolutely there.\n.\nHere's the quick and dirty rundown:\n.\nPROS\n- Up to 8 players in a single dungeon/party\n- Game runs pretty smoothly in the dungeons\n.\nCONS\n- The inventory system isn't perfect (No trashing items, can't move items from page to page) [At least to my knowledge]\n- Graphical issues plaguing AMD users\n- Lighting is kind of wonky sometimes or overly bright and reflective\n- Myriad of bugs typical of games still in development\n.\nYes there's more cons than pros in the above, however I still would recommend the game, provided it's further down the line in development and some of the more pressing issues have been fixed (such as dungeon tiles not snapping properly, making the boss of a dungeon inaccessible). The game's concept and core mechanics however are solid and clearly there's a diamond in the rough here, but only time will reveal how polished that diamond really is. I really want this game to become great, as I play with a group of friends that can go from anywhere from 2 players to 6 or sometimes even 7, so a game that allows more than 4 or 5 would be a godsend. I recommend this game, but I also recommend waiting for a bit further into its overall development.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nTL;DR: "Wait and see" kind of game, if you're into dungeon delvers and play games with more than 3 other friends, KEEP YOUR EYES ON THIS GAME, but don't necessarily buy it just yet (at time of writing).\n.\nFor AMD Users: Don't buy the game until the graphical issues are fixed. At present weapons that have a frost or frost/blight effect (held by either players OR enemies) will turn your entire screen into a starburst of rainbow light vomit.","May 31","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

So I'm just gonna try my best at this.\nI really like this game. I've been searching for an MMO (Even though they don't call themselves an MMO) and most of the ones that I have been playing, I get bored of very quickly or quit. But why is that? Why is it that most of us miss the good ol' days of playing an MMORPG, what happened to the mmo's like before. Well the true answer that I believe is that most games are not as social as they were before.\n\nThis game, I started out by myself not knowing anyone and thinking at launch, I should just refund my money because of the server lag issues and that it took forever for me to even load the game up from launch. Maybe this game was bunk. But! I knew this was early access and I decided to wait it out. Well....I am glad that I did. The game has proximity voice chat. I really like that! You can talk to your fellow players. Anyways....I started out solo and now I play on a couple discords with a group of regular players. We all have logged over 50+ hours on this game in a week. That shows how much fun this game is.\n\nI am excited to see how this game is going to turn out. Is it going to tank? Or is it going to be a popular RPG that everyone will want to play? I hope that this game succeeds. But if you can't wait or are looking for a game to take that extra time you have, I say surely check this game out. It's worth your time and this is just the beginning...it'll just get better and better.\n\nI've played a lot of MMORPG's over the last 10 years and this is one that I can honestly say that is on my favorites list. So check it out, I'm more than sure you will like it and stay with this growing community.\n\nIGN: Crusty the cleric","June 6","true","64.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unable to connect to US servers, saying i needed most current version of game, attempted over 2 days to get into game.  43 min of playtime logged with absolutely no play in game..  Multiple customers had same issue with login/version error not much response on forum when the issue was brought up.  Suggested having a forum mod team that can at least be the first line of customer interaction prior to release of a game, that post was deleted, no response directly to it, which to me is poor customer service and lost the developers at least 1 client likely more.  Do not release a game to the "wolves" if you don't have the proper PR team in place to deal with them.  Even a response of we are working on it would have sufficed, instead of nothing.","June 6","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
