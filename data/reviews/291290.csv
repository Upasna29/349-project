"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/recommended/291290/","spodamayn","spoderman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spodamayn/","4647 products in account","Motte Island is a top down survival horror game that took some inspiration from the classic Resident Evil/Silent Hill. Since there aren't many top-down horror games I can think of (or any at all, really), it's hard to compare it to any specific game. My playtime was about 5 hours, but on average it'd probably take around 3-5 hours to complete.\n\nThe story, atmosphere, and music are actually pretty decent for a $5 retail priced game (which you can get even cheaper during a sale). The script has a lot of broken english in it, it can mostly be understood but all of it could have been easily fixed before release if they had anyone with a decent understanding of english on the dev team. The broken english can cause some of the objectives to be a tad bit confusing, because they aren't explained fully.\n\nMost of the enemies have some fairly unique designs to them. If you're terrified of bugs.. then you probably shouldn't play this game as a great deal of the monsters are designed based on them. This actually made the game creepier to me, since I'm not a fan of insects lol.\n\nThe combat could use a lot of work. You can only equip one weapon at a time, and there's no option to store them, so if you want a new weapon, you have to drop your old one. This can be frustrating when you want to use a gun. There are 3 guns (pistol, shotgun, rifle), and all 3 have very limited ammo. 2 of the guns aren't that easy to find, and I couldn't find the pistol in my playthrough. I don't think there's more than 30 rounds for each gun in the game, and the guns seemed pretty useless against normal enemies (they're alright for boss fights.. but there aren't many situations you'd use them in). There are 2 FPS sequences that seem really forced, so the game isn't entirely top-down.\n\nGame is very dependent on stealth. If you sneak up on an enemy from behind and melee them, it's a one hit kill. This is the best way to play the game as it takes much longer to kill an enemy if you're spotted. I personally stuck with the machette and samurai sword for most of the game.. There is a decent variety of melee weapons in the game, but I found that quick charge attack + fast normal attack is the best combination (for me at least), so most of the other weapons weren't as useful.\n\nNavigation can be somewhat frustrating, as there's no map of the island in the game. This is silly, because some of the buildings have maps for them, which have a much simpler layout, but the maps that you do find can't be saved to your inventory.. so you basically have to memorize them. At one point in the game, I got stuck for a while because I couldn't find the cemetery. If I had a map, that wouldn't have been an issue. Another feature that wasn't polished is the health bar, it covers the entire bottom of the screen. Surely they could have made it noticeable enough while taking up less screen space.\n\nOverall, if you love survival horror I'd recommend giving the game a shot, just set your expectations low. I probably would have paid a dollar for it if I hadn't gotten it for free.\n\nEDIT: This review is based on the first build of the game, any future updates aren't represented in my review.","April 11, 2014","true","5.2"," 67 of 73 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","67","73","0","1"

I just can't help myself, I feel inspired.  Or, in Motte-speak: "Help myself I can't, I feel inspire."\n\nThe first problem with this game is the apparent lack of anyone on the design team who can speak English.  This I don't mind, but surely someone in their broader social circle could have offered to do a quick proof-read of the game before releasing it commercially to the world at large?  Hell, they could've asked the average six year-old on the internet...pretty sure they've worked out by now that "Maids are fight each other but suddenly stopped and tremble in the presence of Sarah" isn't a proper sentence.  You do get used to it, though...we've all seen the Star Wars films, after all.  It's just a shame that Yoda-speak isn't exactly conducive to maintaining a mood of spooky unease.  But this is hardly the game's biggest impediment to greatness.\n\nThe 2D, top-down perspective in a horror game is a brilliant idea.  And when this game gets dark, and the flashlight comes out, it's definitely some eerie ♥♥♥♥.  But in broad daylight the character animations look, well, about as good as those in Hotline Miami.  The only thing is, Hotline Miami was an incredibly fast-paced, splatter-happy ode to visual crudeness and uber-difficulty which seemed to know precisely what it was trying to achieve.  Which WASN'T "scaring" you...which, granted, this game still does surprisingly well at times, mostly on account of the aforementioned flashlight effect and the frankly awesome soundtrack.  In fact, I'd go as far as to say that the super-disturbing soundtrack pretty much SAVES this game.\n\nWhat about the gameplay, you ask?  Well, it's nice enough, especially if you're a fan of action-adventure orientated "survival horror" games of the Silent Hill / Resident Evil ilk, as I surely am.  But there's a LOT of back-tracking, and after a while you get good enough at simply AVOIDING the endlessly-respawning nasties, and the combat is mostly a case of finding one good, accurate spot to stand and mashing the mouse buttons.  I even managed to kill the first Boss with a baseball bat, 'cause I haven't yet managed to pick up a gun despite all the bullets I'm now carrying...I mean, I keep killing bad guys carrying guns which they shoot at me, but for some reason my character seems uninterested in picking any of these pistols up.  I assume I haven't missed an all-important gun placement elsewhere, but I'm not even sure it matters if I have, since I can apparently kick Boss butt well enough with a melee weapon.\n\nJust in case it's sounding like I'm not digging this game, let me assure you I actually am.  And I'm assuming it's not gonna be the longest game in history, so I probably WILL see it through to its conclusion.  What am I gonna find there?  Well, probably nothing too great story-wise, 'cause despite some early promise the story seems to be getting sillier by the hour.  But it's got mood aplenty, despite the aforementioned problems, and the moth-y motifs and mysterious island setting certainly make for good horror fodder.  I think it might be overly generous to say that this gets three-quarters of the way to its potential, but let's be nice and say it gets two-thirds of the way.  Hence the number below, slightly rounded up in the interests of encouraging future product from these admittedly promising designers.  Happy bug-swatting.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10.","April 11, 2014","true","5.8"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","37","45","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/291290/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Motte Island is a low-fi horror game, with a top-down perspective. Your objective is to go into Motte Island to save your sister from the townsfolk, and uncover whatever secrets they were hiding.\n\nYou'll probably be able to finish the game in 3 or 4 hours, and while there are different endings, it does not warrant a replay, since the endings are merely decided by the final section of the game. There are collectible photos spread around, though, each providing a cutscene for you to learn more about the island.\n\n\nPresentation\nAs I said, this is a very low fidelity game, especially regarding its artstyle. The goodside is that low-fi actually works great with horror games! While everything is low-res, dark and full of blurry fog, it sets a nice atmosphere, and lets your mind piece in what's missing.\nHowever, it's not a pretty game at all, on the contrary, it's quite ugly. Lone Survivor or even Home, were low-fi, but still weren't as ugly and Motte Island is. But overall, I think it sets the tone, and achieves its purpose!\nAnimation is very limited as well, which is more noticeable in the cutscenes, but it's not a big deal in the whole scheme of things.\n\nThe sound design in general was pretty good, actually! Everything worked towards the same atmosphere, and there was also a more oppressive track whenever you were engaged in battle. Unfortunately, the track was always the same, which got tiresome at times.\nThere were also a couple of jump-scares thrown in, but were quite repetitive, losing its effect.\nThe enemies didn't sound very scary, but all of the other ambience sounds were good.\nIt's not perfect, but taking its scope into account, I think it comes out as a positive, and helps the game!\n\n\n\n\nSo far so good! Now comes my reasoning for not recommending this game.\nI see what it's trying to do, but similarly to Eleusis, the game itself is not interesting at all. It has a great atmosphere, but lacks purpose and place to use that atmosphere in.\nMost of the time, you'll be traveling around the island (which is essentially just a small village), collecting random items. And, very much like Eleusis, they force you to go back and forth several times while you could easily collect several items at once. (These also blend in with the ground, at times, making them very hard to see... this, of course, increases frustration when you're just constantly walking around, not sure what you're looking for)\n\nWhile you have (supposedly) 3 guns in the game, I only found one, and even that was necessary to the story and not through exploration. What I did find, was a bunch of ammo that I didn't get to use... And some enemies also carried guns that you couldn't pick up, for some unknown reason. Missed chance.\nThis means that I've only used melee weapons for the whole game. Think of it as Hotline Miami. But instead of the very fast in-and-out, twitch gameplay, each enemy requires several hits to die (you have light/heavy attacks, but the heavy are mostly for stealth), so you'll just hit them and backing off repeatedly. A more reliable way of doing it, is using stealth. You can approach enemies from behind, and kill them in 1 hit.\n... or you can just run away from them. Why would you do it? Because they respawn. Yes, every time you enter/exit an area, the enemies respawn. This really does defeat the tension. There's a lot of pointless fighting, and not much fear. While I did kill them at first, I eventually just started running away since fighting was pointless and laborious. While there is a decent number of weapons, they all play similarly, so it's not exactly a positive.\n\nSo yeah. The atmosphere is completely wasted on shores and backtracking, as well as too much "safe" combat.\n\n\nAside from this main gameplay, there also 2 other sections: a side-scroller, and a cover-based fps.\nIn the first, you "drive" a car, while obstacles come down from the top of the screen. This was the most disorienting experience I've had with gaming in a loooong time. Everything happened too fast, with the obstacles sending you flying to the sides... Jesus... I'm not even sure it was possible to fail. I was hitting almost everything (it was unpleasant) but eventually go through with it.\nThen, there's the fps sections. One functions as a mini horde mode, and the other as a Boss fight. You can shoot, and you can be in cover, reloading. It wasn't very good either. The hit detections, specially, was not very tight. And there were always enemies spawning in the limits of the screen. In the last boss fight it was especially bad...\nThese two sections are extremely forced and have no place in the game, to be honest. I understand "variety", but come one!...\n\n\nOne last aspect I want to mention, is the story/writing. It's... bad. And I'm not talking about the number of grammatical errors (quite a lot), but the actual story and characters. The plot is completely senseless. For example, the villagers act like a bunch of maniacs, but suddenly, they're not the bad guys because everything goes to s***. It makes no sense how they're portrayed. It's a very artificial way of making you dislike them. And that would be fine, if they didn't change their minds halfway through. By then, how could I side with the villagers?\nMy actions from that point onwards made no sense, which threw the story out the window. The dialogue is also pretty cheesy, but hey...\n\n\nI'm sounding really negative here. To be completely honest, I did enjoy the game during the first 2 hours. It was cool, the atmosphere immersed me more than I was expecting, and everything was well, while I was exploring the village. Unfortunately, it then started just going in circles, and then introduced very rushed mechanics, ruining the overall experience.\nI can see what it was trying to do, and it's unfortunate that it simply didn't get there quite yet. But it has a couple of good aspects about it, so I'll look forward to their next game. Hopefuly, they'll learn from mistakes and make much more competent experiences!","September 22, 2014","false","3.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It is fun.  It has some memoriable moments.  It has a pretty good atmosphere.  But I don't think I'm going to finish this game.  There are two peevs that I've come across in my hour of playing.  1: Enemies respawn when you leave the screen, but weapons don't.  2: There seem to be some bugs going around.  No, not the monsters.  I stopped playing because my instruction was to find a phone in the police station and I checked every phone but no further instrunction ever came up.  I get it, they don't work.  I knew that before I checked them, but what am I supposed to do now?  I don't want to wander aimlessely around infinity monsters when my machette was taken away.\n\nBesides that, I'm still recommending this game because it was cheap, indie, and I honestly enjoyed the playtime I had.  If I feel like bothering to check the forums for direction, I may even try playing again.\n\nScale: 1=despised 2=negative 3=could go either way 4=positive 5=loved\nGame design: 4/5  I haven't played a top down game in forever, but I like the idea of a top down survival horror.  Very interesting and it seems to work well.  Too bad there seems to be some potentially game breaking bugs.  Maybe?  I honestly didn't try very hard to see if it was a bug or if I'm just missing something.\n\nTone: 3/5 I get scared easily, and I do find the game creepy.  The dark scares me, because I'm a pansy, and there are jump scares, but they don't feel cheap.  It's like, "ah, there's a monster- oh ♥♥♥♥, they're overe here now!".  I saw it coming, and I still was surprised.  Unfortunately, the story isn't really giving me any inspiration, and the engrish descriptions aren't helping things.\n\nPersonal skew: 3/5 I don't think I can speak for a lot of people about this game.  Not really my genre, but I think the game is pretty transparent in it's advertising.

It doens't really take any chances, much less any game changers.\n\n","May 11, 2015","false","2.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I played it through during the 'key error' phase where you couldn't access it through steam, so my time playing it wasn't recorded. It's about 3-5 hours, give or take. A map would've been a nice addition because Motte Island is fairly large, and can be fairly confusing if you can't recall where to go or if you have a hard time finding your way around in games. One of the things that really got to me was dialogue, the game caught my eye because of it's artistic detail, I expected it to be well-rounded, but the dialogue didn't provide that. A game like this should be rich in dialogue I believe, it shouldn't solely depend on it's other elements. I'm not saying it's a bad game, but the dialogue really didn't make me enjoy the entire experience the game had to offer. I enjoyed some of the other elements brought into it though, they could prove to be really fun at times.

Seriously, there aren’t many 2-D games out there that can envelop you this well in a sense of actually existing within the game world.\n\nBut on the other hand there are some incredibly amateurish or downright broken parts as well. The enemy AI is faulty sometimes failing to recognize you OR alternatively being Elder Scrolls levels of telepathic, the combat while really unforgiving at first becomes really simple once you figure out the trick, and perhaps the biggest issue I hold with the game is a terrible translation. I can get over the other two as the games sense of immersion wins out, but this last one flies in the face of that immersion and is by far the biggest flaw. Much of the smaller bits of text are bearable having minor grammatical issues, but when you come across a large document or something trying to convey deeper meaning it’s quite blatant the developer either used a half-working translator, or only have the passing minimum of English experience required for the project.\n\nThey manage to get the point across but it detracts terribly from your suspension of disbelief. If the game was cheaper or even free I’d be willing to overlook this but at the price they’re asking at current ($5) it seems like they should have sprung for someone to translate it properly. Considering the game had many fans waiting for it that would have happily applied, or the prevalence of relatively cheap translation services available online I can’t really forgive this massive failing.\n\nStill the game manages to do more right than it does wrong, and if you’re a serious horror fan then the depth of the games atmosphere will likely win you over.

You have to survive on multiple grounds as you encounter Zombies, Cannibles, Psycopathic Murderers', Moths', And don't forget the Moths.. They are important in this game. OKAY so It has ups and downs. But overall it does have mini-games to offer. Like a shoot 'em up Zombie game and some other aswell.

It's just guesswork to find out you need to hit the space bar multiple times to keep progressing. Dialogue flashes at the bottom of the screen for half a second, leaving you with no clue what anyone said. The ? button doesn't do anything at all, and half of the menu is invisible, so there isn't a way to quit.
