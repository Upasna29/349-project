You have no walljump here but you have double jump as a compensation.\n+Mediocre difficulty - trailer and screenshots may force you to think that this is some supermeatboy level platformer, no it's way easier, i wasted like 4 hours to complete half a game without sweating much (well levels getting harder the more you advance, so maybe last levels will be way harder)\n+Visuals and sounds - a lot of monsters, characters, traps and sounds are very simmilar to super meat boy ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ at least they are not bad\n+Steam achievements are pretty straight forward - 1 achievement for completing every single level :)\n+Cards - the game is pretty cheap so with cards its even cheaper\n+Translations - it has translations for something like 20 different languages :O\n-OST - songs are nice, but there is no much of them, they are playing on the loop, so after an hour or two they repeat themselves like 5 times, and you are getting bored by them.\n\nIn short - this game is value for money stuff, good to kill some time, specially if you like platformers","May 31","true","4.7"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

Some levels were sufficiently frustrating to make me doubt my sanity, but overall the difficulty scaled well.\n\nSome minor issues with gamepad support (that are likely being addressed), but game plays fine with gamepad with one or two small exceptions.\n\n","May 27","true","2.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","0"

Maybe change it to something more retro-ish?\n- Fourth level is much easier than third, maybe fill the fourth one with blocks so it wouldn't look so boring.\n- A blood setting would be reasonable, when there's plenty of young people playing on Steam. (also less the amount of blood particles when you die/kill an enemy?)\n\nOther than that, it's really challenging and addicting 2D platformer.\n\n\n\n\n(also my name is in the credits xddd ;3;)","May 27","true","0.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","9"

At first sight it seems to be really easy... But then levels get harder and harder. And you get more and more nervous...\nSo, let's rate this game.\n1) Gameplay - awesome. I just loved it!\n2) Graphics - funny, like in other indie games.\n3) Price - It is really chip.\n10/10\nI can't tell all about this game, but you can buy it and play right now!","May 31","true","5.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","12","16","3","0"

Played through a bit of it and made a video.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/1cOPbGyw2FM\n\nTo summarise, its a challenging 2D platformer and the game does this very well. It is Meat Boy-esque but a little simpler (no wall jumps or anything of the sort) and the instant respawn and music keeps the flow of the game going. Overall I do enjoy this game so do pick it up if you like difficult platformers.","May 27","true","9.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

Hard levels will lure you more and more into this game. It makes you stronger and teaches how to be patient.\n\nHowever i will not recommended it for people with mental disorders (just in case).\n\nP.S.: original music is SO GREAT, i hope they will add some more of it.","May 30","true","5.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","9","13","3","0"

It’s for people who have nerves of steel and like a challenge. You’re trying to escape a dungeon and by navigating through blades, enemies, spikes etc.\n\nGraphics:\n\nIt’s a very simple 2d platformer game, the graphics don’t really matter much in this type of game. The game is going for an 8-bit retro look and it looks pretty nice for that. Solid 60 FPS throughout the time I played this game.\n\nSound:\n\nThe music in this game is pretty nice and similar to those 8-bit soundtracks you find in older games. The coin pickup sound will give you nostalgia from the good ol’ days of NES and Genesis.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou’re trying to escape a dungeon. Each level has a key and an exit door, you must collect the key before you can move on to the next level. In addition to that there’s coins which are placed on hard to reach spots mostly so if you want a little extra challenge and a bit more risk than you can go for them. They give you points and that’s basically what the whole game is about. There are enemies throughout the stages, spinning blades, spikes, falling spikes etc. Every 10 levels will change the color scheme.\n\nYou have a double jump and stomping on enemies will kill them. There’s a lot of stages and as you progress they get harder and harder. This game will make you rage if you don’t like hard games, I wouldn’t recommend this. This got pretty frustrating for me after level 10 or so.\n\nThe achievements could’ve been much better, currently most of the achievements are “Beat level 1”, “Beat level 2” and so on… 50 levels with 51 achievements and 1 achievement for scoring 5000. I think they could’ve added much interesting achievements in this game.\n\nA short gameplay of me playing and failing a lot can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=698907712\n\nConclusion:\n\nPretty fun, simple good looking platformer. People who love a challenge and hard games are in for a treat. Not a high price tag so it’s a good buy if you like this sort of game.\n","June 6","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The music was fun and was good at getting you pumped up, but you also have to keep that in check, because if you are like me, getting that pumped up, in a game like this can also make you punch the wall!  It was very fun, and very rage inducing for me, but like other games like this one, I am pretty sure that is a small piece of the puzzle.","June 2","true","0.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"
