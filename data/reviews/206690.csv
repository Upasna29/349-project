For starters the campaign, once you complete a mission you can go back to it any time to get a higher score or the secondary or hidden objective. The speed up button, unlike the first game it actually speeds things up, and makes that 40 waves go by so much quicker. The addition of other weapons were sorely needed, I found the bombs most useful, but the flamethrower is great as well. The dig in featue is great, but not for every situation.\n\nUnlike last time, because of being able to play any mission completed in the campaign there is no quick play. Instead you get 2 Bonus missions which are cool but not a big deal.\n\nI rated the first one 5/10. This is definitly the better overall game. It feels like they tried to boil down what they wanted  tower defence to be and refine it from the first one.\n\n7/10 only because I feel there isn't much long term replay grab it if it goes on sale","February 9, 2015","true","17.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","19","20","0","0"

People that go to the store page, may think: "Woah, mobile game on steam, so sad", but the truth is, I didn't have much fun with a game since months ago.\n\nThe game starts with a simple map, your base on one side, and enemies that come from the top. A quick tutorial reveals that you have to put different types of turrets, upgrade them, sell them if necessary, and defend your base. Seems easy, doesn't it?\n\nYou only have 2 turrets in the early levels, but as you proceed, you unlock more turrets. At the end of each game, you're assigned Victory Points depending on how good your performance was, and Perks, depending if you fulfilled the requeriments for one. With the victory points, you improve the level of upgrades of each turret, and when one is fully upgraded, you have the ability for 40 victory points to specialize that turret, making it more utile depending on what you choose. Regarding the perks, well, you have 3 types of perks, and as you unlock them, you put the ones that fit you the best.\n\nThe difficulty of the game is HARD. The first levels are kind of easy, but after some time, you will most likely get stressed at how screwed you are, that's when the Rewind option comes in hand. Basically, you have a rewind that you can use at the round you want, to start again that round, and delete everything you did, and the enemy did, that exact round. If you use it, you have to wait 3 more rounds until you can use it again.\n\n\nThis game is a fun little game, great for killing time, and for improving your strategies. I do recommend this game!\n\nP.S: I got it for free thanks to Indie Gala, you only have to put your email, and you receive the code of the game for free, but I suggest buying it to support the developers!","April 26, 2015","true","9.2"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","18","21","3","2"

Turrets have been given the "Dig-In" ability which gives them increased range and firepower but limits them to a very narrow arc of fire. This is a good idea in principle but in reality all it means is that you will spend most of your time simply rotating the turret so it can fire on all enemies.\n\nAlso a new addition is an ability building that allows you to drop bombs on your enemies and while this also is a nice improvement that gives you something to do while waiting for money to build up it has little impact on the gameplay.\n\nPerhaps the biggest improvement is the inclusion of a interest system. By building Radar Stations, this game's equivalent of a boost turret, you earn a little extra income each wave depending on how much money you have. This is a nice addition that encourages minimalistic builds and opens up multiple tactics for you to choose on the harder difficulties.\n\nWhere iBomber Defense was the bare bones of a tower defense game Pacific manages to be the bare bones of a tower defense game with the bare bones of every tower defense gimmick out there except for a 3D FPS option tacked on. All the additions are nice and were solely needed but none of them are really added in properly and you still play the game feeling like you might as well be playing it in a browser.\n\nAlthough iBomber Defense Pacific is great improvement over the original it is still a game you play wondering what it's doing on the PC.","January 15, 2013","false","48.2"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

And with only 7 tower types, some of which are only unlocked in the 2nd half of the campaign. This gives for little variations and low replayability.\nBasically you use similar tactics on most levels.\n\nThere are a few neat ideas, the campaign plot which follow the historical events, perks, customizable towers, surprise events. But in the end they didn't add that much.\n\n15 hours to complete the campaign on medium difficulty. Hard difficulty don't add much.\nWith all perks unlocked, the game balance is partly broken.

The theater of the battles is the Pacific Ocean and you try step by step, battle by battle to make your way towards Manilla, the capital of Philippines. Once you reach Manilla, the campaign is over.\n\nThe game has a campaign with 22 maps, as i already mentioned, which can be played in 3 difficulty levels: Rookie for Easy, Soldier for Medium and Veteran for Hard). There are plenty of \"Bonus Missions\" too which are basically edited campaign maps.\n\nYour goal is to protect your Head Quarters (HQ). Japan is sending troops, vehicles, tanks, boats, ships, frigates, small, big and huge planes in their attempt to destroy your HQ. By positioning strategically your turrets, you must defend the paths the enemy\'s forces are following and manage to keep your HQ alive. The HQ is a building stationed in the heart of your \"area of control\" and has Hit Points (HP). Every time an enemy\'s vehicle, troop, ship or plane reaches it, it loses 1 HP. If all of its HPs runs out, you lose. The enemy is attacking on waves and on each map he can attack up to 40 times from multiple sides with a variety of forces.\n\nYour forces are consisted of turrets. There are 7 types of turrets: Machine Gun, Cannon, Bomb, Flamer, Comms (Communications), Rocket and Anti-Air. Each kind has its strong points and its weak. You need to find which is the suitable turret for your situation and position it carefully in order to survive the enemy\'s waves. The turrets can be upgraded up to 3 times. Over time, they will suffer damage from the enemy\'s fire. You need to make sure that they are repaired in time as if you let their health drop to zero, they will be destroyed.\n\nYou will need money in order to upgrade the turrets. There are 2 sources of money. Each time you destroy an enemy\'s unit, you will be awarded with a certain amount of money. In addition, each time you destroy one of the supply crates of the map, you will be awarded with a bigger amount of money (small hint use bombs to destroy them).\n\nBefore each map, you will given the choice to equip yourself with 3 perks. These perks are practically categories of bonus attributes which allow you to adapt the game on your personal play style. Make wisely your choices, pick the perk which suits to your character and use its advantages in the game.\n\nThe sounds and its music are pleasantly heard and you can tell by the first map that the Devs actually put some effort on them.\n\nThere is a small obvious bug sadly which thankfully does not disturb or ruin your game. When you play the game, you have the option to make it go faster when you click the [>>] button on the top right side of your screen. Once you do that everything moves twice as fast and that is very useful, especially for the first rounds of each map. However, if you wish to uncheck the [>>] button and return to the original speed, you will not be able to do it. The speed will not return to x1 but will drop to x0.8 or 0.75 depending on the round you are. Personally i didn\'t mind from it but it would be good if it didn\'t exist at all. Other than that, there are no bugs or glitches in the game.\n\nI found the game exciting and funny to play and i would recommend it to everyone and not only the ones who like tower defense games! It \'s the ideal game to play when you are on the go and you have your laptop with you or when you are on your vacation. There is no way to rage in this game, it will keep you relaxed and will give you plenty of cheerful hours to spend on.\n\n\nAll in all, i would give this game a\n\n9/10 !\n\nAlthough it was given for free, it is certainly a game which deserves your attention! Consider to get a copy and play it!","May 31","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Gameplay is similar to the previous game in the series, iBomber Defense, but several improvements have been made.\n\nThe biggest criticism with the previous game is that gameplay became stale after 40 or so waves in a single level, and some levels were too similar to others. But in iBomber Defense Pacific there are usually only 20 or so waves per level, and each level is quite different making for better variety in gameplay.\n\nAlso, there are now secondary objectives, like having to defend an oil refinery, or having to destroy enemy bunkers. Completing secondary objectives is optional but doing so earns you points to buy upgrades.\n\nTo keep things fresh now you sometimes have to deal with enemy units that aren't rushing your base! Yes, sometimes enemy units will come out onto the battlefield and start shooting it out with your turrets. This becomes especially tricky if you're trying to defend a secondary objective: Should you put your limited resources into defending your base or defending the secondary objective?\n\nAnother improvement is that now you can drop bombs on the battlefield. Bombs are a limited use item that are gradually replenished over time. Since you'll only get a few you need to make sure each one counts. Should you use them to thin out the ranks of the baddies rushing your base? Use them to blow open supply crates to get extra resources? Use them to kill that enemy battleship that's parked outside the range of your turrets? Use them to destroy a target to complete a secondary objective? Use them to destroy the secret enemy base hidden in most levels to get bonus upgrade points? Or just start randomly dropping them on buildings to revel in sheer destruction? There are a ton of tactical choices to make!\n\nIf you like tower defense games you owe it to yourself to check out iBomber Defense Pacific!","May 17, 2014","true","22.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I cant realy tell whats so amazing and diffrent from other TD games but it is a Solid TD Game.\n\nThe Mechanic in the game is no more than place diffrent tower with diffrent specific skills to prevent enemys from reaching your Base! The towers you get to Place is the Turret a fast shooting but low dmg output, The Cannon with long range and heavy damage but slow, We got the bomb tower which slowly generate bombs that you can drop anywhere on the map, The Flamethrower who burns and slows enemys. The Comm's towers who increases the range of other towers and provides extra income.\nthe Missile tower who shoots medium hige damage in an area (works best in straight lines). and the last tower the Anti Air tower.\n\nDuring the Missions or maps you can complete secondary objectives often killing crates or buildings on the map or defend specific objects! After the mission is complete you are awarded with points which you use to uppgrade your tower. you get more points if you complete the secondary objective and/or if you dont leak and all your towers survived.\n\nThere is also a Level progression in the game where you earn some xp after each mission, the only important thing about this is that you can unlock some perks to your own benefit. The game alows you to use up to 3 perks, the perks can increase your starting money of each level or boost the defense of your tower etc. it does help sometimes and it gives you a reason to continue play to advance in rank and increase score.\n\nThe Whole Game is good for an TD and the difficult level is well balanced through the game, but i dont think it is an amazing game.. the game whould be good on a mobile phone to kill time when your not close to your PC.\nI would rate this game 4/10... i dont like TD games!\n","May 9, 2013","true","8.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Gameplay is extremely fun. You fend off attack waves from ground, air, and water.. Some of the cool features in this game are that there are more than one route that the enemy travels to get to you, forcing you to focus on choke points first and develop out from there. There are bonuses to blow up on the map, including secrets. All units can be developed into beefier units, but also include a feature called 'Dig In' - this allows you to opt out of 360 degree attack capabilities for a cone of attack, but with greater range. You can build bomb towers to give you bombs that can work on land or water. You can construct support towers that extend the range of units in their area of effect. There are ambush attacks and other special combat scenarios, such as enemy return fire that make the game more than just a straight tower defense game. You earn points to increase maximum capability from your towers at the end of the round, depending on how well you do, PLUS you earn perks as rewards for things like 'number of bullets spent' or 'number of times you repair'.. all of these perk progressions are tracked so you can see how far along you are until the next unlock. All in all, I would have to say this is a great little tower defense game and I picked it up for $2.

It's deliciously difficult, which makes you return every day for a tower-dose.\nThis time around in the "Pacific" edition, some new game-mechanics are introduced like the Player Rank part, that lets you gain awesome perks as you do well on the regular missions. Together with the Tower specialization options when towers are fully upgraded it all gives you nice personal feel to how you like to play.\nThe bonus missions are fun, with huge open fields you place towers on to make a maze for the enemy, much like "Robo Defense" on Android phones.\n\nOf course i would like more then one campaign, but at the low price i'm overall quite pleased with the game and can reccomend it to all Tower-Defense lovers!","March 5, 2012","true","11.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You know how those usually go, cash shop hack job that is more focused on extracting money from your wallet than it is about entertaining you, so when iBomber Defense looked and played like a fully fleshed out game I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nNow this is a tower defense game and it is very important I get this out of the way now. Their are 2 types of tower defense games; the 'do it your way' kind where you have total freedom to mix and match your towers as the game can be beaten in multiple styles or their is, 'do it our way' kind where each stage only has one solution and you need to figure it out and this game is surprisingly both.\n\nOn the lowest setting you can get away with duct taping your way through stages but if you bump the difficulty up then each stage only has one possible solution to it.\nI think its a fair balance, not every game can be Kingdom Rush (which I think is an amazing TD game) although I personally hate the ones with only one solution because its more like a puzzle game at that point and thier are plenty of good puzzle games I would rather play than a TD game pretending to be one.\n\nPersonal genre gripes aside iBomber was clearly designed with gameplay first. You can even move the title screen about like in Super Mario 64. When did games stop being like this and remembering games are supposed to be fun? Instead they all take themselves super serious and end up a buggy mess on release instead.\n\nStoryline is WW2 but really its just an excuse plot. WW2 is as easy to pick of the shelf and use as a storyline as elves, dwarfs and cyberpunk but it gets the job done. Sound effects, yeah they exist. Okay they are fine, a bomb sounds like a bomb and a turret sounds like a turret what more do you want?\nMusic? Strangely absent or turned so low (by default) that it seems absent. I honestly don't recall hearing any music at all but it wasn't until I started writing this review that I even noticed, maybe because I was too busy having fun.\n\nI recommend this game and if you like TD games like Kingdom Rush(as you should, because its great!) then you will enjoy this game. it even has the 'specialize your turrets' tech tree. I tried it with touchscreen but oddly that didn't work out very well as the screen is just a bit too small for the delcate precision it requests of the user and I often accidently bombed my own turrets too many times so switched back to mouse input.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","April 30, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is tower defense game ported from mobile platforms. It takes place in the pacific theater in WW2 where you fight the Japanese in land, air and sea battles.

The game is probably the most strategic tower defense game I have played. There are inter dependencies between the turrets so you probably want to place them in certain configurations to maximize your income and/or damage output. So also need to pick from various perks (Fallout'esqe) and turret upgrades so your strategy on a given level can potentially change based on that. The game also lets you fast forward time and pause it if you wish; if you pause the game, which is slightly unconventional, you can redirect your turrets adding a strategic element (ie, "micro") that many other titles lack.\n\nAs for the negatives, the graphics are somewhat bland, but I guess acceptable. I found it really hard to tell the difference between enemy units so it is sometimes tough to prepare sufficiently until your turrets have engaged the enemy. My bigger gripe is that this game is $4.99 on steam vs $1.99 on the Play store. Why the PC gamer gouging that seems so prevalent with mobile game developers?
