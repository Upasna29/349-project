Again like Fantastic Pinball Thrills the nudge is more like shake the table. There are too many better pinball games available (even for 30+ year old platforms) that are much more fun than this. If it was a free game then my opinion would be different, but the content does not justify any cost as far as I am concerned.\n\n0/5","January 22","false","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I recommend it only for those who are not pinball snobs though and only on sale.\n\nNon-proportional stretching of the item models on my widescreen appear to make things look slightly squished vertically, ball physics are definitely off, and the music is very repetitive after a bit.  The 3 tables included seem to include minimal modes and mini-games so, no, it's not comparable to Real Arcade or Pinball FX 2, so just be aware of that up front.\n\nThat said, the controls work well for keyboard and 360 gamepad, and it even has one feature that the big boys don't: you can enter your highscore name with the keyboard.  Maybe they could learn something from this after all.  :)","January 17","true","0.1"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","6","0","0"
