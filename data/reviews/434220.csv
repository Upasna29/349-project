Hmmm...now, let's see..."spoopy" atmosphere and jump-scares...check.  Time-management based mechanics taught to you by some guy who repeatedly contacts you via telephone...check.  A "survive 'til 6am for a number of consecutive nights" style of game structure...check.  A variety of different enemies and nights which all "behave" differently, and need to be strategized individually...check.  And last, but certainly not least of all: BEARS.  Checkity, check-check-check.\n\nAaaaah yes, I'm quite, quite sure this game would have existed in this particular space and time IRRESPECTIVE of the spectacularly-successful FNAF franchise preceding it by not much more than a year.  But you know what?  Let's let bygones be bygones, and ignore any questionable statements made on the - let's face it, ultimately inconsequential - marketing tool which we call a "Steam Store page".  Let's just ask the most important of questions, namely:  How does Bear Haven Nights stack up as a GAME, in and of its own right?\n\nThe answer, I'm relieved to say, is that it's actually pretty good.  Not entirely "logical"...but good.  Not as good as the first Five Nights at Freddy's...but good.  Certainly above and beyond the bounds of "competence", and let's face it, for a horror game recently released onto Steam, that's a pretty amazing start.\n\nSo what does Bear Haven Nights do right?  Well, it has an excellent tutorial and slowly incrementing difficulty curve, for starters.  It's not too hard to understand what you're supposed to do in this game.  More challenging to actually pull it off, of course...but it's all easy enough to get your head around.  It's also very aesthetically pleasing, both visually and aurally, and that's certainly never something to complain about.  And the gameplay, on the whole, is very smooth and mechanically sound, and doesn't seem to "cheat" quite as much as a lot of FNAF-style games do, at least for as far as I've played it.  None of my deaths to date have seemed excessively "cheap", in other words...in truth, I probably fully deserved them.  Well, ahem...certainly within the bounds of the game's thoroughly loopy "plot", that is.  Which brings us to some negatives...\n\nWhile I'm undoubtedly a lover of almost all things child-like and creepy, I'm not really sure why you've been hired to work in a motel haunted by TEDDY BEARS.  The owners of this motel don't need a night-shift electrician...they need an EXORCIST!  The first Freddy's game pushed its luck a little with the scenario of a security guard working in a restaurant fully known to be plagued by homicidal animatronics, but on the whole, it seemed a feasible enough scenario if you lived in the same neighbourhood as David Lynch or Stephen King.  I mean, at least the animatronics were an actual ATTRACTION of the restaurant, so there was no reason the business owners would choose the welfare of some work-a-day slob over their true bread-and-butter earners.  The owners of the motel in Bear Haven Nights, on the other hand, appear to have no good financial reason to keep psychotic bears hanging about.  Surely they could just find this "Room X" that they have a security camera pointed at 24/7, and torch the little ♥♥♥♥ers back to the Hell from which they came?\n\nI'm also not quite sure about the logic of why the bears apparently can't find you in the dark - despite the fact that they come right up in your face and stare at you with menacing red eyes - but if the telephone or TV turns on, WATCH OUT!  Jump-scare time!!  I guess the teddies hate the TV even more than I do, and sincerely believe that we live in a morally vacuous, culturally bankrupt era where telephones are killing what little remains of genuine human-to-human - er, bear-to-bear - contact.  I certainly wouldn't be one to completely disagree with them.\n\nFinally, my last criticism would be that - quite UN-like the FNAF games - the jump-scares in this game JUST AREN'T SCARY.  They're perfectly cute and pleasing on a basic aesthetic level, but they sure as ♥♥♥♥ don't make you ♥♥♥♥ yo'self the way that those Scott Cawthon games do.  Everything else in the game is suitably spooky, though - the spinning fans, the ticking clocks, the red-eyed  bears looking through the windows trying to spot you, the fantastically spooky "Halloween"-esque music - so it at least delivers rather nicely on the suspense front.  But the jump-scares...a bit lame, unfortunately.\n\nOn the whole, though, this is by far one of the better FNAF "homages" currently available in the Steam marketplace.  And I know I said at the start of this review that I'd try to overlook such comparisons, but let's face it...it's nigh-on impossible!  This IS a Five Nights "clone", and possibly the closest in tone to the first Freddy game that I've yet encountered...which is mostly a good thing, even if it doesn't exactly qualify this as "original".  It is, in any case, really quite likeable in its own right, and if this is SunRay Games' first release, they may very well be a company to look out for in the near future.  Nice...a little TOO "nice" at times, if you get my gist...but definitely nice.  Do you dare the bear?  C'mon, you know you want to...\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","January 31","true","1.5"," 43 of 73 people (59%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","59","43","73","16","8"

There are ALOT of similairities, but don't let that put you off of this immediatly - The game actually shows ALOT of nice promise.  It's intriguing and doesn't hand hold (Which is nice in this day and age) Although I would almost say its a tad TOO hands-off.  The "rules" (objectives) are basically just thrown at you and you're kind of left to your own devices to figure out how things work, with only the occasional helpful text from cell-phone-guy (Name pending, I haven't gotten too far myself yet) to assist.  Again, none of this is a bad thing, just something to be aware of.  I'm intrigued by the fact that you're kind of free to explore around, instead of being confined to one room, though the perspective switch whenever you right-click to turn can be a tad jarring until you get used to it.\n\nFor a bit more in depth, check out my video covering the first night of the game, and hopefully it will give you enough reason to try it for yourself ^_^\n\nAs promised, here is the first of two videos covering a new indie horror game that launched earlier today - The second one will be right behind it, so stay tuned!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e46szuqC6E4","January 29","true","0.4"," 26 of 53 people (49%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","49","26","53","10","0"

Many people will say it is a FNAF clone, and they are right, to some extent.\nYou got the creepy bears, a survival based point and click, Jumpscares, and it even has a fan... well it's a ceiling fan but, still a fan.\nThe largest difference between Bear Haven Nights and FNAF is the game play. In FNAF you a stuck in one location and just have to do the right things to keep those creepy buggers from getting to you.\n\nIn Bear Haven Nights, you can move about. As the game goes on you find that there is really no safe place. When I first got locked out of the main office, I was so freaked. You instead have to hide in different rooms each night. However, each of the rooms have different rules that must be kept in order to survive in them. Some of these include phones that ring at certain times and lights that need to be turned off.\n\nOverall I would definitley recommend this game. If you like the FNAF style game, look no furrther. Good luck repairing all those damaged wires and Beware the CUCKOO CLOCK :) :)","February 25","true","2.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The truth is, however, that it isvery similar to FNAF in many ways. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing and will depend on whether or not you liked the FNAF games to begin with. Interestingly, I personally was not a fan of FNAF, however I am finding BHN quite enjoyable.\n\nBHN does a lot of the same things that similar games of the genre do, but it also has enough minor unique differences (at least in my opinion) that give it its own unique feel and style. Obviously, the first thing that is going to stand out is the ability to move around from location to location, which was not a feature of the FNAF series. It could be argued however that this in  essence is no different than jumping from camera to camera, and there would be little I could say to refute that, though I'm perfectly ok with that.\n\nThe art style is where the game really shines for me. It's a very simple art style indeed, but it gives the game this immense feeling of surrealism as though you may be in the Twilight Zone or inside of a dream. The game is not "frightening" and the jumpscares are not particularly scary, in comparison to other games that have come out recently (particularly Emily Wants to Play) but what the game lacks in pure fright factor, it makes up in its eerie and very well executed atmosphere. The motel setting no doubt adds to the atmophere as we've all come to associate desolate motels in the middle of nowhere with sinister occurences and crazy characters (Psycho, anyone?).\n\nAt the time of writing this, I've played the game for approximately 1.5 hours and am very satisfied with the amount of content and the way it was all put together and executed, and for less than $5, I can't help but recommend that anyone with a taste for these kinds of games give this one a try.\n\nI popped up my first impressions and funny moments videos on YouTube and have linked them here for anyone that's interested in seeing more of the game played in English, as almost all of the videos on YouTube are in Russian, it seems.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-u4dzKFuyZ4\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtlrVdvmPYk\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50jAN-gEgio\n\n10/10 beary good value.","January 30","true","7.3"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","36","10","28","5","0"

I definitely felt like a fnaf clone though. Sometimes the game seems impossible due to where the bears will spawn but once you kind of figure out their trick it becomes a lot easier. The jump scares only really scare you if you are absolutely non expecting them otherwise they just get annoying ove time. I'd still recommend the game if you like strategy games though.

The left clicking & right clicking to spin & move around is a pretty cool mechanic I haven't really seen anywhere else & certainly adds to the confusion & panic when attempting to escape from the bears. Many will call this a FNaF clone but literally the only similarities are the one camera where you can keep an eye on the bears & the fact that the robot/demon bears are trying to kill you. I'm going to really enjoy trying to beat this game & I hope there's going to be more to this series in the future =)","January 30","true","1.1"," 1 of 14 people (7%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","7","1","14","0","1"
