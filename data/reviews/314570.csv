Platformer in metroidvania style but with a lot more exploration added. Has a unique graphic style I have not seen before. It looks like you've seen it before, but when you play it it's just a bit different but quite nice. Controls can be a bit quirky and getting used to; background story is interesting but you need to like sci-fi and astronaut stuff. Music and sound is just fantastic and really hit home.\n\nOh, you play as a dog :-)\n\n( late addition: you can buy the soundtrack from their website. It's one of the better one's )","August 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 51 of 71 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","51","71","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/314570/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","The Sun at Night is a metroidvania game set in a strangely unique setting. You're Laika, the first dog sent into orbit. However, instead of miserably burning along with the ship, you're now a robot dog, joining the Rebel force against the Soviets, who seem to dominate the Earth (and beyond).\n\nI'll give you some time to take that in. Even the game's characters find it strange that you're a talking dog in silver armor. With a gun mounted on your back. Yes.\n\nThe concept probably got your interest already, I assume. Execution isn't nearly as great, and I'll try to explain the best I can.\nI usually try to describe the games I review on the whole, but that takes up way too much space, and makes for a not so informative review. So I'll just try to sum up the general aspects that make the game succeed or fail as a game, and then make a few longer paragraphs of particular aspects.\n\n\nPresentation-wise, it's a mixed bag. The bosses were usually pretty nicely designed, but there are several problems with the backgrounds. Some are simply ugly (and low-res), with lots of empty space (that's literally black, at times), but others make a big mistake by making the background and foreground exactly the same color. The first screen of the game has this problem. It makes it really hard to distinguish platforms from nothing, especially in a 2D game (not 2.5D).\nTied to that, is the fact that interactable and non-interactable objects in the game have no distinction. This means that instead of looking for an actual object when walking around, you'll have to look for a text pop-up. It makes exploration far less interesting.\nOverall, is feels very un-polished and reminded me of Valley Without Wind. It's likely a hit or miss.\n\nSound Design was mixed as well. The sound effects were generic, and not very pleasant, I would say. The music was pretty good, though! If not misplaced, at times. It was very game-y, like taking old MegaMan style music and giving a slightly more modern sound. It's not as catchy, though. But it's not bad at all!\n\nCombining these two, a problem I've had, was the fact that there was very little audio-visual response when you took damage or were close to dying. This led to many deaths in the start of the game, because I was simply not aware of how close I was to death.\n\nAs a segue, the game felt very weightless. The controls were a bit floaty, the weapons didn't really pack a punch, etc. etc. It didn't feel very good to actually play, which is unfortunate, as it is one of the most important aspects.\n\n\nThe game itself is mission based. There are 4 missions, and they're pretty huge. You have to follow a main objective, but you'll also find side-objectives. There's a LOT of backtracking in these maps, and you're likly to get lost. Why?\nWell, while the game is 2D, the maps connect in a 3D planes, with inumerous intersections between the smaller rooms. The map function is useful, sure, but it takes a while getting used to.\nThe problem I have with this, is the fact that the maps are needlessly big. Most of the rooms are there to simply fill the map. There's a lot of empty space, meaningless rooms with a few enemies. This makes the game a lot more boring than it could have been, if the rooms were actually interesting. There's also no fast travel function, which means that you'll have to navigate the complicated maps a lot. To aggravate the problem, the map marks some rooms with a door, but doesn't tell you it's locked. So you might want to just see what's left, walk for 15 minutes, and then walk back, disappointed, because it was simply a locked door (it also happened that some rooms were locked from one side only -- I tried going through one door that was open, and then had to walk for 20 minutes because I couldn't go back the way I came).\n\nIn these maps, you'll fight enemies, and explore for Nano Batteries (which you use to buy upgrades), new Weapons, and Ammo. There are also lots of terminals and notes spread across, for you to learn about the story (these prove a problem, however, which I'll talk about later).\nYou have 3 Upgrade Sections: Utility, Offense and Defense. You can upgrade your speed, get Double/Wall Jumps,  get a better Shield, upgrade each Weapon, etc. I liked the upgrade system, actually. It gave me a good sense of progression, and significantly altered some of the gameplay.\n\nThere's also a sort of crafting system for ammo and health/shield packs. You have Raw Nano, which you can use to fabricate these. You can also reduce them, if you have more than you need, and use it to get something more scarce. There's an upgrade that makes it more efficient, which is very useful. The problem with this, is that it takes like 3 clicks to reduce or fabricate something. It would take 20 times that number to fully fabricate ammo, for example. It takes a loong time to do this. Especially when you're reducing and fabricating repeatedly (since you get major returns, with the upgrade) to give yourself "infinite" resources. This could be solved with a simple counter. You could set it to fabricate 20 at once, and there, problem solved. But as it is, it's a very inefficient system overall. But it's good that it's there, I guess.\n\nLast aspect about the mechanics, is the Save System. There are checkpoints spread out through the map (unevenly so). If you die, you'll have to replay everything from the last time you saved at the checkpoint. This could be fine, but it's not, since they're so far apart. Besides, it's easy to die because you were distracted. So, it leads to even more backtracking. It could be easily solved by saving at when entering a new room, or just manual saves. Or even get you all the way back to the checkpoint, but keeping your progress and collectables.\n\n---\n\nThat's all. Now, what the game did interestingly, it how it wanted to construct its universe, with ideals and views on communism and war in general. This could have been stellar, but...\n\nWhen you start the game, you're thrown into the rebel camp. The characters there have real personality, despite exchanging very few words with you. But as I said, some seemed genuinely good, and it would have been great to have a component focused heavily on them. But you're introduced to all these characters, and they're never developed. They're only in that first section, and then abandoned.\nThat's the first problem.\n\nThe second, is how it tries to pass its ideology to the player. It's all done through notes and terminals spread across the levels. However, it usually throws terms at you, without giving them proper context. If you're not familiar with communism and the cold war, then you're very likely not to understand 90% of it.\nThis is important. Context. You can't explain an ideal without its context or reasons. It will simply fall on deaf ears, understandably so.\n\nTied to this, is a huge overload of incoherent information. The notes spread across are often disconnected from each other, so you'll just be getting bits and pieces of an overall message, all fragmented. And there's A LOT of them in the game. So, after a while, since the player isn't getting the whole idea, he will simply start filtering through all of those, and closing his mind. I ended up reading most of them in diagonal, as the game went on, because of the sheer amount of text that didn't provide as much use as it should.\nThis could be helped by compressing the notes a bit more. There were more paragraphs of text it each than was necessary. If there were simply short, concise phrases, the game would have benefited more.\n\n-\n\nOverall, I think it was an overambitious project. You could see all the great ideas, but they seemed poorly executed and too rushed. Maybe they can solve all these problems in a future game. Because the ideas are there, definitely!","October 12, 2014","false","8.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","4"

A few of the things I really hope they address if continuing the trilogy are:\n\nThe map is really confusing and difficult to use.  It works fine at a smaller scale; but once you explore more of the map it becomes cluttered and difficult to follow.\nSun at Night levels are designed using x, y, and z-axis, in comparison to Metroid or Castlevania that uses only the x and y-axis.  This allows for more complex level design; but I think it actually hurts the game.  It makes the areas difficult to navigate with a lot of boring sections that feel like place filler.\nThe camera is very tight in most parts of the game causing you to get hit by enemies off-screen.  You can keep you're shield on at all times; but I would prefer for the camera to be pulled out for a better view.\nThe game starts off really slowly, with a lot of exposition.\nThe skill menu UI is really poorly designed.  I shouldn't have to scroll horizontally and vertically to see the entire skill tree.\nSome primary missions don't provide NAV data.  This is pretty annoying since the map is confusing to read and navigate.  I would prefer seeing secondary objectives have no nav data; but provide higher rewards while primary objectives always having nav data.\nThere is a general lack of save points.   The maps are large and there is a lot to explore; but with infrequent save points you could lose 10 to 15 minutes of time if you die.  I got to the point where exploring just wasn't worth the risk.\nOverall, if you're a fan of Metroidvania style games I would recommend giving it a try; but don't expect to be blown away by it.  There are just too many things wrong with it that hold it back.","August 24, 2014","true","7.9"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

Not because it's weird, but because it's...well, not very good. The controls are looser than a Russian harlot, the resolution is such that you'll constantly be assailed from enemies off-screen before you can react, the interface might as well be in Cyrillic for all the use it is, and the game seems to translate 'Metroidvania' into 'have giant confusing levels with large patches of nothing and a lot of backtracking'\n\nWhich is a shame, because in the moments it's not a chore to play, it's a charmingly off-beat little game with a lot of heart. I wanted to like it, you'll probably want to like it too. - It's clearly a labor of love. But sadly, even if you love something, once you send it into orbit on an experimental one way mission, it's going to crash and burn. And much like its namesake, Laika is not a glorious success - it's an ignominious end for a loveable mutt - death by faulty systems, and frankly she deserves better.\n","August 12, 2014","false","1.0"," 42 of 70 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","42","70","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/314570/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","The Sun at Night is a fun action/platformer with metroidvania vibes (though it isn't really a metroidvania) that unfortunately ends on a major cliffhanger.\n\nThe story appears to take place in an alternate history, perhaps post-apocalyptic, Soviet Union.  You play as Laika, a cybernatically enhanced dog who has no idea where she came from or who made her.  After Laika wakes up, she falls in with what appears to be a group of anti-Soviet revolutionaries, and accepts a mission from them, which leads into another and then another, and then ... full stop.  Lots of questions are raised about what the hell is really going on, but aside from a couple vague hints which only raise more questions, nothing is answered.  I guess that's left for the next game, or the one after that, or the one after that - who knows?\n\nThe gameplay itself is great.  You run around humongous levels laid out in 3 dimensional layers, fight soviet soldiers, robots, and mutated, cybernatically enhanced wildlife, find new weapons and nano batteries to aquire and upgrade your skills (hint:  make double-jump and wall-jump your first two upgrades), and get lost while exploring.  There's a helpful automap which takes a while to get used to - for those to whom it means anything, think of what Descent and Daggerfall automaps were like, and make them bigger by an order of magnitude.  The optional nav arrow you can trigger at any time for *certain* quests was a life saver.\n\nYou can fire in any direction, twin-stick style, though you have to press the trigger to fire making it kinda impossible to jump, aim and shoot at the same time when using a 360 controller - but that turned out to be a none issue, and I didn't bother switching to keyboard + mouse.\n\nThe game uses a checkpoint save system, and the checkpoints are relatively rare, but I still found the game pretty easy perhaps because of the build I made.  The fully upgraded LaserBeam with the two Energy skills made short work of enemies, upgraded armor kept my health from coming to 0 too quickly, and the Nano Trader skill tree, when maxed, effectively gave me unlimited ammo and health packs.  Which kinda broke the game, probably.  I even won a fight I wasn't supposed to, which actually broke the game for real and forced me to quit and restart at the last checkpoint to lose the fight like a good little doggy.\n\nBut I was genuinely addicted to the game for the 11 or so hours I played it.  Could've probably finished it in half the time if I didn't spend so much time looking around for secrets, so I would recommend it to anyone who wouldn't mind that they're getting the equivalent of Fellowship of the Ring here.","August 16, 2014","true","12.6"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","0"

Here's what's wrong with it.\n\n1.  Combat is too generic.  Same strategy works on all foes, and there aren't enough different foes.\n\n2.  The 2D maps are a rambling, sprawling mess with too much repetition.\n\n3.  The story is all over the place.  There are just way too many concepts and plot threads flying around and the longer the game goes on, the more confusing it gets.\n\n4.

The problem is that it doesn't do any of these bits exceptionally well. The exploration and backtracking isn't any fun, and mostly a chore; the environments themselves are rarely interesting to look at; and the game is flat out ugly. The sprite animations on every character that isn't Laika are terrible and would be dated for a game released 20 years ago (think less pixelated Ultima graphics). The sound isn't much better, with stock effects for most sounds, and boring chiptune-esque music on constant loop in an area. All of these could be ignored if the gameplay was tight or the story interesting, but neither is true. Most of the NPCs have names, but little to no actual personality. Meanwhile the story wanders between boring cliches and pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\ntl;dr: An interesting idea wrapped up in bad design decisions, sloppy implementation, and a serious case of "developers first game."\n\n","December 14, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I liked it, but I won't deny that it's quite flawed.  It has a tendency to emphasize art and story at the expense of gameplay.\n\nFor example, the levels are frickin' huge!  Each chapter takes place in a massive complex with many rooms to explore.  This sounds like a good thing, but the rooms are also largely empty.  Some contain quest objectives or upgrade parts, but most contain either nothing or a journal entry.  The journals expand on the story a bit, but they don't affect the gameplay at all, so finding a journal and nothing else just doesn't feel satisfying.\n\nThe map doesn't help matters.  The levels are laid out as a series of 2D planes connected perpendicular to form a 3D whole - one of the store screenshots shows what this looks like on the map screen.  This results in a map which some players have found confusing.  I was able to navigate, but it still took me some time to figure out where I was and where I was going.\n\nThe backgrounds are fairly well detailed, but have a poor sense of depth.  Sometimes it's unclear what you can and can't jump on and what is and isn't a door.  Fortunately, the platforming doesn't get tricky enough to make this a major issue.\n\nSpeaking of platforming, the player character moves much faster than most platformer heroes and has no acceleration period.  Laika goes from stopped to full speed the moment you press the button.  This can take some getting used to, but the speed is nice for dodging bullets and moving through the oversize levels.\n\nCombat is decent enough.  You have six weapons, an activated shield, and a good variety of upgrades to weapons, defense and mobility.  You can aim with the mouse or a controller, whichever you prefer.  Enemies sometimes fire from off-screen, but you can fire back if you know where they are.  The combat's main problem is that there's not much feedback when things take damage, which makes fighting less satisfying than it could be.\n\nThe story is an ambitious alternate history.  Perhaps too ambitious, as it ends on a cliffhanger and answers very little by the end.  I hope that the sequel reveals more, but I know I shouldn't count on it.\n\nI recommend this game despite its problems, and I hope its sequel is able to fix them and offer more functional gameplay.  There's an indie darling in the making here, it just needs more refinement.","January 20, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Navigate confusing levels without a map, as you might as well not have one at all- the game's map is utter crap. Use your superior agility to bunnyhop around enemies and cheese them from afar, and explore all the areas; or don't. Large areas were created simply to house consumable health, ammo, shield etc. The extra areas are so unnecessary. There are four wings to a prison, each with a washcloset, shower, and officer area. Then there are tons of other unexplained robot rooms, and a massive library- all these house are more items! There is no direction to the game, a bland story, and useless micro-details scattered about for no reason.\n\nThis is a frustratingly pointless game.","March 30, 2015","false","18.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
