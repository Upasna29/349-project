The gun play is definitely original and will probably help define the genre as VR grows. It's really the social aspects that make this game though - feeling like you're really in a shoot out with other people, and making lewd gestures to each other in between rounds is pretty awesome. However I thnk the $35 price tag and other reviews are misleading.\n\nThis is not a complete game. As much as I understand that VR is in its infancy and having something now is better than nothing, this game being stamped with a 1.0 version number is kind of insulting. Here's a short list of why:\n\n- There are no tutorials to teach you anything about the game. The closest attempt is a practice range which tells you how to switch your weapons and reload. It is funny watching people play for the first time and struggle to figure out movement though.\n- There are only two guns. Come on...\n- Bugs. Half the time I played I wasn't able to control my hover thingy and would suddenly appear on top of another player. What's funny is everyone's characters had no lag at all - only our junkers did.\n- No depth. Once you get past the novelty of ducking and shooting, that's about it. I don't see any point right now in collecting junk other than replacing pieces you lose. There's a vacuum that adds to your loot score when you put scrap it in, but the scoring in the game is so ambiguous I felt like giving it junk was actually hurting my score. Anyway, really there just needs to be more to do in the game - more weapons, environment stuff to interact with, or game modes.\n\nI'm still recommending the game because I think what is there in the game is fun and that it's important to support the devs who are taking the first leap on this VR stuff. I felt like I had to write a review though that was a bit more honest than the marketing and other reviews are for this game.\n\nPay $35 to experience first person multiplayer VR shooting. Expect early access quality.","April 6","true","4.4"," 221 of 244 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","221","244","7","10"

Definitely needs more players!  Buy it now and we can shoot eachother!\n\nEDIT:  Well, since I'm getting downvoted I suppose I'll elaborate.\n\nThis game is great.  The first time I took control of the ship and started moving, I was put off balance and almost fell over - not an exaggeration, and I'm not a clutz - it was that intense.  Now, of course, it's second nature and flying the ship is smooth and enjoyable.  During matches I often find myself just enjoying the scenery, flying around collecting junk (the non-aggressive way to score points, as opposed to killing other players) and getting into epic chases with other players.  The thrill of flying around actively dodging player's shots with both my body and my vehicle is indescribable.\n\nFinding junk and properly using it to deck out your ship it is a game in and of itself, as different pieces of junk have different characteristics - they offer varying sizes, some offer slots to shoot through, and they all work independently of eachother.  Remembering which ones to slot together to form the best overall cover and offensive potential, while not required in the slightest, is rewarding just by itself.\n\nThen there are the gun fights.  Effectively using your custom-constructed cover is rewarding and thrilling.  There are often holes in the cover that you have to be aware of and avoid / shoot through.\n\nAll of this praise being said, it's not without its flaws - but they are slight.  The hand interactions leave a bit to be desired compared to a lot of the other games of its kind (obviously Job Simulator comes to mind), but they're not too terribly bad, and it's really only prevalent in the bar-room, which is just a menu anyway.\n\nHopefully my longer critique has been helpful for you in making your purchasing decision.  I was hesitant about shelling out the money at first - I thought it looked lame, the characters were clunky, and that I wouldn't like flying around the ship.  All of that was proven so very wrong after just minutes of play.  Do yourself a favor and get it.","April 7","true","2.3"," 191 of 224 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","191","224","8","8"

It's like playing Airsoft/Paintball in your room against a bunch of people online. I found myself ducking behind cover and even crawling on the ground to find the perfect spot to shoot the enemy from.\n\nWhat's really cool is the fact that they have different sized ships. My room isn't much of a looker when it comes to size (3m x 1,7m) and therefore I was scared at first to completely trash my furniture while playing. BUT they simply give you a ship fitting to your room size so you never have to worry about that. Naturally I don't want to walk against my ship's walls and that's really cool - it just feels so natural. So I'd say the controlls and movement and all that stuff is a solid 10/10.\n\nThe gameplay is something I've never seen before. I hope there will be more VR multiplayer shooters in the future because I truly believe this is what gaming will eventually become. It is so much fun, videos can't do it justice. At the beginning of each round you select your weapon of choice (although you can switch anytime between the pistol and the shotgun) and place some barricades around your ship for cover. And then you are good to go - kill everything that moves (although you should check for teammates first).\n\nThere is a basic ranking system in the game but it doesn't really have a purpose. You don't unlock weapons or anything with a higher rank. But it comes with a bunch of cool stats.\n\nThere are ~10 ships (maybe a bit more or less), 2 weapons and roughly 15 maps I want to say. Yes content is a bit short but the devs already have two new weapons in the making and promise regular updates.\n\nIn my opinion this is one of the few MUST HAVE games if you have a VR headset. I've never experienced something like it before. And by the way, this is the best way to exercise. After playing a few matches I had to stop because my legs hurt so much.\n\nGet it!

There is something about riding a hovercraft with a team mate with one driving while the other has both guns locked and loaded and aiming out of the side.  You can also work with the other teammates on another hovercraft to sandwich an enemy and blast them from both sides!\n\nAnother big plus is the accuracy of the barricades and weapons.  If you see ANY part of the body of your opponent, you can shoot at it and they will get shot.  Gone are the days when clipping would produce false target areas where you can waste precious ammo!\n\nGive this game a shot (pun intended).  You will not regret it.

However the hype created by Stress Level Zero around this game through all the vlogs in their youtube channel does not match the expectations and experience I had with this game.\n\nI completely agree with the other negative reviews in this thread:\n\n- the shooting range feels great, but once you go into multiplayer it's just a buggy unpolished mess\n- he junker controls are weird and non responsive\n- there's no proper hit feedback or at least some indication of how much damage you are doing/did to an enemy\n- the whole scraping for loot system in a fast paced shooter just doesn't work (takes ages to open then loot, then pick up each part, and attach it to your ship), by the time you are trying to attach it you're already dead or you wasted the whole round looting instead of shooting\n\nAlso the idea behind the multiplayer lobby getting everyone crammed in a small room, throwing stuff at the robot and just bugging it out to death til he starts warping is so annoying.  It even interferes with basic user interface elements by messing up with the flipboard which prevents me from changing to another ship, customizing my character or voting for a map!\n\nThey tried to make it "fun", but they missed the whole basics and point of shooters:\n\n- make it easy to join a server\n- allow me to see any ping handicap I may have vs other players\n- give me feedback of how much damage I'm doing or I did\n- get the movement mechanics right\n- make the guns register with proper network code\n\nAnyway, if you come from a hardcore FPS background like Quake or CS you'll be hugely disappointed and frustrated.\n\nAlthough I have tried to get into the game and accept its flaws for what it is (an Early Access game), I just get more annoyed and frustrated by the lack of polish and quality in this game.\n\nAs it stands there are better games or  free demos in the store that will give you a better experience than this.\n\n:(","May 9","false","4.6"," 79 of 128 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","79","128","0","6"

Seeing other people actually moving like a human makes it feel a lot more immersive and adds a lot of character to the game. There is a sort of social element to this with all of the hand gestures, and stuff like that. It can be really funny to lay down your weapons and mess around with the hand gestures and do stupid stuff, because everyone is so life-like. The social element is really a huge positive for this game.\n\nThis game does have a very short honeymoon phase as there isn't a big depth of content, but for my first couple matches it really felt like I was playing the coolest game ever. As you get used to it, it does start to feel quite same-y but the game is still fun and my favourite VR game right now.\n\nI was skeptical from claims about price being too high and lack of content, and I will say that is kind of fair enough, not many weapons right now, stuff like that, but the core gameplay is amazing fun, and the developers are working with community feedback on steam and reddit to provide good updates, like the SMG that is about to be added. I look forward to seeing the game grow, and the singleplayer oregon-trail mode that is planned sounds pretty neat.\n\nLiving in Australia lag was fairly noticeable sometimes in matches, but nothing too bad. And while player counts for this game are low, there is always a match available to hop into and you only need 3+ people for it to be good fun. Although I have yet to try the team co-op mode due to only finding FFA matches.\n\nAs for performance, this game actually ran surprisingly great for me. Seeing the recommended 970 and 980 was worrying me, but it wasn't too bad even on my 7950 3gb, a card from 2012. If you hold alt while starting the game you can turn down the desktop window resolution and in-game, you can put the graphics down to 'debug' or lower than low. I found the game running surprisingly well with only an occasional fps drop. I also had interleaved reprojection off.\n\n\nSo in short, it runs pretty nicely, no trouble finding a match, social element and VOIP is great fun, very replayable, combat and taking cover is intense, and you can be excited for future updates to come and watch the game grow.\n\nDefinitely my favourite VR title, multiplayer puts it on a whole new level.\n\nEDIT: I have since tried team/co-op mode, and it's really cool. It's good fun to interact with a ship crewmate, and shake hands and do silly stuff. Taking turns driving and duel wielding is pretty cool and there's a very social feel where it feels like your teammate is really with you.","April 15","true","13.6"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","3"

The visercal feeling of exchanging gunfire with another person in VR is something that really makes this game special.\n\nThe junk acts as a functional resource to incentivize movement around the map. The game starts with only a few pieces of junk onboard which won't cover the entire ship. Clever players will manuver themselves to exposed flanks, punishing unfortified ships.\n\nSome of the controls feel very natural, but others are harder to divine. To steer the ship, grab the steering column and tilt in the desired direction. Easy and responsive. To switch to team voice chat, change the channel on the welder to channel 2. A little less obvious. After a couple hours in the game, the controls are no longer an issue.\n\nThere are crashes here and there (mostly between matches), but noticably less so from patch to patch. My experience was purely on the United States servers, with the game and networking feeling very responsive the vast majority of the time. Finding a game has never been a problem. On a given weeknight, the US playerbase has been ~40, with weekends seeing 60+.\n\nI recommend favoring Team Deathmatch over Free-For-All for two reasons. First, the shootouts are more controlled than chaos; team-members open the door to more flanking strategies and yield less instances of being surronded and gunned down from behind. Second is the simple joy of riding shotgun with another player ; chase sequences and shooting side by side with another person are some of the best moments in this game.\n\nA whole lot of fun and handily worth the price.\n\n\n\n","May 21","true","5.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I'd say it's a beta proof of concept game mechanics test.\n\nThe controls are clumsy, shooting and hitting people sometimes feels like pure luck.\nEnemies appear to be always standing at the same place and don't move that much. I wonder if that's actually the real position. There's always some high lag going on, the netcode is far from being good. Sometimes the enemy dies 1 or 2 seconds after my last bullet was shot. (Ping was around 130ms)\nSometimes I unload 3 shotgun shells in an unaware standing person, maybe even a 4th, blood effects appear, he's not dying but he quickly returns fire and I die. Makes no sense to me. Does it have something to do with my tallness I wonder? The hitboxes seem to be completely messed up and I wonder how much the lag is adding to this.\n\nThen there's tons of fps drops when loading menus/levels, I wish the game would just go black.\nIn a few rounds I've played, the performance dropped insanely for no reason. Must be some bad coding, memory leak or whatever going on. After a couple of seconds/minutes this fixes by itself, but meanwhile the game is unplayable and hurts the eyes. Completely unacceptable.\n\nI also dislike the Lobby room. There's a bugged Bot in a bar. The physics bugs of this guy seem to be a feature (such as Goat Simulator) because some people may find it funny. I do not find this funny at all, it just shows how lazy and bad the physics coding is. It adds nothing to the game but broken first impression. There are also not enough objects to mess around with. Some are just glued to the map while you may THINk you could take them in the hands only to get dissapointed you cannot. That's bad design.\nAll players clipping into each other in the lobby room. It's a total mess when theres 6-8 players throwing stuff around and waving their hands. Not enjoyable at all... but maybe that depends on the players taste?\n\nThe game is too bloated imo. The developers wanted too much at the same time and nothing really works well enough.\nThere are a couple of maps and I can't really tell a difference from them. All of them seem to be flat ground and they are open space arenas with some obsactles here and there. They don't share the same colors/fogcolor and prefabs of course.\n\nI didn't fully understand the concept of looting neither. I thought it was for building the ship. But the last time I was looting it didn't give me extra parts for the ship, so maybe the looting is just for the scoreboard.\nIt is so fiddly to aim at the crates and wait for the stuff to come out (parts magically float into the air)\nJust like reloading the weapon often is fiddly and complicated. On the shotgun I keep pressing the touchpad maybe 5 times, swing the gun but it's still empty. Sometimes the chambers don't want to close, no matter how strong I swing the controller to close it (on shotgun and pistol). Usually pulling the trigger fixes it.\n\nI hope to see a "Tron" - typed game of this concept some day.

The shootouts are fun. Moving, ducking and unloading on your enemies is totally satisfying. I was surprised how hard I had to work -- in a good way. Unfortunately, some of the other mechanics are less refined, even clunky. Switching between guns, gravity welder and mini-map is awkward and slow. Search youtube for tutorials. They were the only thing that kept me from being completely lost. The lobby and menu system is manageable but confusing. I'd like to see more weapons and armor choices but I'm sure that will come later. It's my hope that as the VR gaming community grows the social aspect of Hover Junkers will kick in. I'm looking forward to virtually taunting my friends in the wasteland.

The first time I tried moving my junker in the game my stomach lurched and I thought "oh no, I won't be able to play this". I also couldn't figure out how to pick up more junk from the world to use as cover. The revolver seemed like it was shooting too low. After playing the game for 5 minutes I almost didn't come back.\n\nI am SUPER glad that a few days later I decided to give it another shot and it became one of my favorite Vive games. To get over the motion issues I played only about five minutes the first day and increased the time I played by a couple of minutes per day. After day five I've had no more issues with my stomach bugging me when playing this game. I figured out how to pick up junk from crates around the map (you use your welder gun, same one you drive the junkers with, you just have to click the touchpad to stop driving). The guns turned out to be incredibly accurate if you use the sights or if you just realize the barrel is at the bottom of the revolver rather than the top.\n\nThe devs are still adding content but it's already very polished and a total blast to play once you give it an hour or so to get used to the controls, reloading, shooting, putting up cover, etc. I cannot recommend this game highly enough.","May 10","true","24.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is exactly what you expect : ducking, shooting, sweating like a shower head, while sailing through a wasteland.\n\nFirst 30 minutes : I spent most of this time at the shooting range. As a non American, the only experiences I had with guns were shooting rockets at my feet in Quake 3, and getting a total make up when getting rekt in paintball. Mandatory to learn how to aim with both eyes, to understand which part of the sight to focus, but also to get the reload down. Reloading seemed quite confusing at first, but after a while, it seems like the best way between skill and immersion : tap your shotgun shells into the cannons, roll your revolver bullets into the barrel. And the most satisfying part : slap the barrels or magazines back in and go to town. Reloading becomes a crazy satisfying mechanism.\n\nNext 10 minutes : I'm in this bar, grabbing random metal plates and sauce bottles, trying to juggle around with these. The only person with me is this slightly cute and rusty robot behind the counter. I'm fiddling with all the options, which takes me 10 seconds. Suddenly the cute robot freaks out in front of my eyes, which is kind of unsettling. Devs say it will be fixed soon.\nThis lobby is cool, and I have no difficulty starting a match : the browser seem natural and very simple. Like every new comer, I make the mistake to join an FFA match with 5 players in it.\n\nNext 10 minutes : I'm in the ship. I quickly remind myself the videos I've seen about the game, and build my barricades, then proceed grabbing the gravity welder to sail aroudn the map. There was nothing to indicate me how to do it, so that might be a bit difficult to figure out how to drive the ship for those who have no clue about the game.\nI start chasing an opponent. The chase in itself is pure excitment : you sail at a good speed, trying to slalom around hills with one hand, the other hand unloading bullets like it is some gangsta car rumble in a random American city.\nThe immersion kicks in : I completely forget about where I am in real life, and sink into the skin of an angry and focused junker. The headset is not on my head anymore : I'm in too deep.\nAt one point, me an my opponent get stuck in a cluster♥♥♥♥ of other ships. Due to the ships nature, it is difficult to move around when too close from another ship. So it is when the "duck n cover" part comes in.\nGuns are precise, and I surprise myself dispatching 3 opponents with a fair accuracy since I never fired a gun before. The fight is frantic, as you try to move around your covers to find a good angle. The damage localisation i s great : one of my opponents was almost at point blank, and I managed to hit a bullseye, which rewarded me with an instakill.\nThe match goes on, and honestly, even though there is not much variety of situations to get in, every fight is exciting and frantic, and requires a lot of skill to win.\n\nNext minute : We are back in the bar, as I scored my first victory in FFA. The lobby becomes a huge mess, with all these hands and goggles reprensting the player floating in the air. One dude is kneeled down before me, with his hands grabbing my ankles and his head noding down my groin for some reason.\nAnother is throwing a ketchup bottle in an improvised basket.\n\nNext 10 minutes : I joined a TDM. We are 2 in the ship. My mate starts driving. We are able communicate through simple gestures, and proceed on a hit and run strategy. This is fast paced, and actually exhilarating.\nOne of the most fun I've ever had in an FPS match.\n\nNext week : I can't stop playing this game. It is frantic, rewarding, and beyond immersive, and I can't get myself to be bored yet.\n\nOverall : 8/10, needs a lot of polishing, more variety, even during matches, but most fun online VR game for this launch. Difficult for new comers because of the lack of tutorial.","May 27","true","13.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","2"

This game is better than I thought, not that I didn't think it was good but man am I addicated after today. The sessions I just had were out of this world.  The 1 on 1 fights you get in with players are so real, you do anything in your power to stay alive and kill the other guy. I think I learned the basics of the mechanics and feel really comfortable with the game. Took a couple mins when I first treid it to get my VR legs but once you do it never becomes a problem again, no motion sickness for me.\n\nHaven't been able to test too many social features out yet, joined some random lobbys and played both team and solo death match. I look forward to playing co op with a friend, playing with a random was fun but for I couldn't hear him. If there was one complaint I had it was I could barely hear anyone, both on my ship or in the lobby, maybe there is a setting for it but the game volume is pretty loud and drowns out the voices.\n\nIf you thought getting kills might have been satisfying in whatever game you play imagine ACTUALLY getting the kill yourself, so much more rewarding. But man am I glad I plunged and bought it, my favorite Vive game so far. Getting headshots with that pistol is oh so fun.","April 5","true","19.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","3"

There was a weird glitch in the shooting range area that made half my screen go crazy jerky and black. Once I got into the actual game areas with other players that didn't happen again yet.

In a fast-paced multiplayer game it just feels wrong to have to spend time arranging your junk while the others are blasting at you. This would feel much better if there was a pre-match setup step, and if your craft setup was persistent between matches.\n\nI don't like the junker controls. It seems intuitive at first, but sometimes it will only go very slowly when you want it to go faster and it is not obvious why that happens because there is no feedback. There is also the motion sickness problem, although it's not too bad most of the time, some specific combinations of real-world and artificial in-game movement can make it worse and I personally feel very uncomfortable by the end of a match. I didn't feel anything like that since the VR-hacked-in Oculus DK2 games.\n\nBut the most important problem for me is shooting. It feels "right" at the shooting range and I have no problems at all hitting the targets, but it just feels unsatisfying in the actual game. I had more than one occasion where I specifially stood still and aimed very carefully just to test it, but it didn't register when I thought I should have 100% hit them. This might have been caused by server latency, but I could find no latency indicator anywhere in the game. For mid to long-range shooting the resolution starts to become a problem. Some feedback for when you hit someone is absolutely necessary, like the "ding" in Quake 3.\n\nAnd finally, I don't feel that the price is justified. I get that the VR audience is very small at this point and the developers need money to continue, but this is not a fair price for what the game is. VR or not, it is very basic and the content is minimal.","April 29","false","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

You will get the most out of this game if you are a moderate to hardcore gamer, as it assumes that you have intimate knowledge of how games work. For example, you are someone who can pick up a controller with just about any game and be proficient without a tutorial or an explanation of mechanics. If you are someone who enjoys video games from time to time, or someone who relies on walkthroughs and strategy guides to solve puzzles when you get stuck, this is probably not the game for you. Not knocking that at all, just trying to paint an acturate picture of how this game plays. If you have bad knees or significant mobility limitations, this game is not for you. It also requires that a person have a wide range of motion, as you'll be ducking, diving, and even some jumping.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuclearfusion42/recommended/380220/","Nuclearfusion42","Nuclearfusion42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nuclearfusion42/","475 products in account","After seeing a few rather misleading negative reviews I thought I'd write my own.\n\nHover junkers is simply one of the best games I've played in VR. Where as other experiences have been just that - experiences - Hover Junkers is something I could see myself playing far into the future a bit like a VR overwatch or TF2.\n\nI'll start with performance and networking issues. I've had none apart from some lag with is to be expected as my connection isn't the greatest, but as with any PC game in the immortal words of out lord and saviour TotalBiscuit individual mileage may vary.\n\nShooting is both intuitive and fun provided you're a good shot, but most of all it's emergent. Shooting it feels extremely real (coming from someone who has never actually shot a gun). It's a feeling which is difficult to explain to someone because it's something which has to be experienced first and foremost. But if you've ever had a airsoft shoot-out with a friend, it feels a bit like that, but dialled up to 11. With a flare gun. Some of the tactics you can pull are amazing.\n\nWhat I mean by emergent is best explained like this. After playing Hover junkers for a couple of hours I started trying new thing rather than just rolling up one someone and shooting each other in the face until someone comes out on top. Things like blind-fire. Blind fire is not really a concept in a stand FPS because there is no way to really move your gun so to speak, it's only really applicable in TPS. But in hover junkers it is, if you're not making headway in a duel, a good way to catch someone out is to shoot over their cover from your own (Something where being tall gives you an advantage). The other thing I've found out is two hands are a lot more steady than one. At times I've been able to make distance shots by actually dropping a controller and letting it hang on my wrist while using both hands on a single controller. I've jety to try my Gun Kata skills yet though. This is something that actually works, when I first tried these things it just blew my mind. I'm no Tequila Yuen (the wires wouldn't allow for it), this game goes some way to making me feel like I am\n\nI'm not even going to start on co-op game-play because I've not experienced that much of it. But I have both shed tears over the limp bodies of my co-op partners and taken my revenge with hot lead.\n\nThat sort of game-play is something you just don't get out of a standard shooter like CS:GO.\n\nIt's strange, and nothing on the market really compares or competes.\n\nThe only other thing I wanted to mention is the fun that can be had in lobby, which is quite strange, usually in a game you'll just sit for a bit looking at stats, but in over Junkers you're dumped in a room with the people you were just trying to kill. And although they're floating hands and headsets you do feel like you're in a room with other people. It promotes this strange sense of comradery as you pelt Gunther (Voice by Justin Justin Roiland aka Morty off Rick and Morty) with various objects from around the bar.\n\nOh, and if you haven't found it yet there's a makeshift hoop you can throw objects in for points.\n\nIn conclusion. Fantastic game, although a little bare bones which I've no doubt will be solved improved upon in further updates, nothing is more exhilarating than rolling up on a fool and shooting him or her in the face with a revolver. Or two. Or a shotgun.","June 5","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gun mechanics (accuracy, aiming, etc.) are far from realistic, when you feel like they should be. I'm pretty sure the devs have never fired guns in real life. There's no real single-player mode, so it will just be you getting wrecked by people who were patient enough to figure out how to play the game while spraying random Uzi bullets.\n\nThis has potential, but the multiplayer mechanics need to be reimagined and the movement need to be reworked. The hovercrafts are just replacements for walking/movement via analog sticks, except it's more awkward.

There are a lot of features like more weapons and a singleplayer campaign that aren't in the game yet. As it is, however, it's still a really neat concept, and being able to see other players move realistically while you shoot each other is a really great experience. The guns are fun to use, and each of them have their own reloading processes that make them feel more engaging to use than in some other early VR games where the guns aren't that intesting. It has some problems, however; there isn't a tutorial that I could find, so learning how to do even basic things like driving your junker or fishing up junk essentially involve fumbling around your immobile boat and hoping you don't get shot before you figure out how to do anything, and since so few people have a Vive at the moment, you're lucky to find three or four active lobbies at a time. Hover Junkers maybe should've been launched in early access instead, but it's definitely a game to look out for in the future if you're getting a Vive.","April 16","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

It seemed like a cool idea, room scale on a virtually moving platform, but the platforms (junkers) move too rigidly, can't turn (strafing only, collisions don't even rotate them), don't interact in a physically meaningful way when they hit obstacles, and the movement controls for them are just weird and don't feel right to me.  They also partially clip through each other and the animations of other player's avatars could really use a little more interpolation to counteract the all too prevalent network latency.\n\nI probably would have given it another chance but the unnatural (IMHO) movement of the junkers was beginning to make me mildly nauseas, which is rare for me even in VR (been using VR for 3 years), so I went for a refund.  If they'd moved more realistically (based on my subjective definition) and had maintained my immersion I don't think this would have been an issue for me.  And yes, this was all at a good framerate.  The devs are adding more features and there are some good ideas here, though I just wish they'd called it early access and worked out the jankiness in the base game before adding more guns and modes.\n\nAlso, just throwing this out there: most of my gripes are totally subjective, so if you're curious there's no reason not to give it a go.  They're an indy dev and could probably use your support. Remember, Steam will usually grant refunds for less than two hours playtime within 14 days of purchase (but don't take my word for it, read the policy yourself).

I really enjoy this game and highly recommend it if you have VR with tracked controllers.\n\nThe basic flow of the combat in this game involves driving up to somebody and then dodging and ducking behind cover and popping out and shooting (or endlessly blind firing shotguns). They have a nice mechanic in this game that causes your ship to go slower when it's near someone, so, thankfully, it's not really a game of circle strafing around an opponent and stepping over your cord and trying to hit rapidly moving targets. You CAN move around a bit when near somebody but you're limited from going quickly. I've only seen a few players who tend to try to constantly move around during a gunfight, but I'm not yet convinced that it's a great strategy.\n\nIt may feel like there's a few things missing right now (a tutorial being one of them), but they've been very clear in their messaging that they will be continuing to update this game.\n\nOne of my favorite features is the leaderboards. It might've been enough to just have a multiplayer shooter with individual matches, but the leaderboards gives you that extra motivation to keep playing match after match and to try to get better. And even if you're not climbing the ranks on the leaderboards, they still provide an individual "level" that goes up as you get points in matches and gives you a sense of progress and a desire to keep going.\n\nBut I especially like how it rewards mastery of using the guns. If you go practice aiming and reloading and switching weapons in the shooting range, you WILL actually get better. Because of how the weapons work (they seem to basically be hitscan and they always hit wherever the barrel is pointing), you aren't dealing with a typical FPS situation where it's all about keeping the crosshairs over somebody as you spray a bunch of ammo in their general vicinity. There isn't weapon recoil or spread. Your aim is as good as you are able to make it. I highly recommend, before and probably after every session, going to the shooting range and practicing quickly bringing up your gun and aiming and using the sights properly to hit far away targets, and practicing alternating shooting with one hand while reloading with the other (especially with the shotguns). All it takes to kill somebody is 2 shots in the head, so if you can get to a point where you can reliably and quickly take aim and hit that small of a target, you can do really well in mutliplayer.\n\nOverall, I'd say this is a must-have for VR and I hope they continue to add more stuff to this already fun game.","April 6","true","16.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/erogebonner/recommended/380220/","erogebonner","Kieran","http://steamcommunity.com/id/erogebonner/","270 products in account","Currently I do not recommend this game, it has two extremely large flaws.\n\n\nThe first one is the biggest. I think the developers of this game built it without ever testing a rectangular playspace. Currently, if you have a rectangular playspace, it will ALWAYS be 90 degrees off from the shape of ships in Hover Junkers. There is no way to fix this, besides making your playspace a tiny square. This is an extremely huge bug in my opinion, that severely limits my ability to enjoy the game. If the playable area was simply rotated 90 degrees, I could use almost every craft in the game. As it stands I can only use one or two.\n\n\nThe other issue is that the netcode and hit detection are horrible. The uzi bullets have tracers, and you can consistently watch tracers travel directly through an enemy model. Often times a player with bad ping will teleport all over the place. Couple that with a revolver that can kill you in two headshots (there is no reason to use any other weapon, the revolver is perfectly accurate, can be reloaded almost instantly, and has a faster time to kill than anything in the game. The shotgun is worthless, and the uzi takes almost an entire magazine to kill someone even if you hit every shot.) and you have an extremely frustrating multiplayer experience.\n\n\nPerhaps my biggest issue with this game is that IT HAS NO REASON TO BE OUT OF EARLY ACCESS. All of these bugs, balance issues, and half-developed features are NOT indicative of a fully-released game that costs $35. I absolutely love this game, but for what I\'ve received, and knowing that the developers have no motivation to fix these issues, I feel I have no choice but to request a refund. Maybe I will purchase the game again when its features actually merit its price. It was a huge mistake to bring this game out of early access.\n\n\nI cannot recommend this game to anyone unless the developers address these issues. What is currently available is not worth anywhere near $35, and games that have much more content, many less bugs, and are still in early access cost less.\n\n\nEDIT: By the way yes, I do agree with other negative reviews of this game. This is too little for too much and it has lots of problems that a finished game would not. I look forward to seeing improvements in the future but for now I am refunding the game.","June 1","false","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This week i was excited  because i got to check out a new game for the steam console called Virtual Reactionry Hover Junkets. First thing i had to put on this scuba suit and then they droped me into the Virtual pool and then i was floating on a hover junket.\n\nAt first i felt sea sick and i vomited a lot but because i own 10 boats and am a captain i got over it quickly in 4 hours. When someone showed me how to get a gun i was excited and acidentaly shot them, but luckly we were in the vitual junkets so they were okay. But mad. So it took me a few rounds to get used to moving and shooting even though usually i am a marine marksmen and i move quite frequently. But once i got used to the scuba suit and cleaned up all the sea sick i found it much more like the reality world and have never died since. Not once.\n\nSo i  review this game a 8 thumbs up out of 10. If i were you i would buy it but i'm the best shot in the world and cant die and if you were me you wouldn't be the best because i would be you and im the best. so you might not want to buy it because you wont win because i'm you which means i bought the game and i'm the best and can't die, but if you are me and reviewing this game then you should probably buy it first.","April 19","true","22.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It could also make reloading a little less of a chore. I get that its part of the VR experience to have to flip something closed, but it detracts a bit from the fun, as the act of going to shoot should be what closes the gun after reloading.\n\nThe instructions need to also be a bit better at the beginning of the game. For example in my first match I had zero idea what the tool box and objects were about. During another match after having started getting the hang of my craft, the toolbox was at a point where it was just out of reach, I could not reach the back row of items, since I would run into my wall. It was not until later I realized I could use the driving hand to tractor beam the parts and place them.\n\nUltimately, despite those problems, it was an enjoyable experience for a "VR FPS"","May 5","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The control system is extremely difficult to get used to. Little things here and there made me think "why did they choose to do it this way?"\n\nIt is also not very friendly to new players, the gun range only helps so much. When you spawn in people will immediately start shooting you when all you want to do is figure out what the hell is going on. They really need a bot mode where you can fly the ships around where they don't fire back and you can just practice picking up gear and putting it on your ship, using the weapons.  The intro screen is very confusing with the "look here" to get into the game at first, and the "coming soon" on those guns on the right even more confusing.\n\nThe robot in the room bugs out and flys around all the time without anyone touching him, it's been like that for the last month and really surprised they haven't fixed it yet. It gets pretty annoying when he starts bugging out yelling behind the bar for no reason.\n\nIn the end though it is a lot of fun, it just needs a bit more of a tutorial to help people get started better.

As far as the VR integration goes the menus, reloading and shooting mechanics are fine. What kills the game for me are the total lack of hit feedback, both when shooting and being shot at. There is absolutely no tutorial it reminds me of old school quake where you were presented with a server browser and just expected to go.

The ship controls are "off" to put it mildly, they don't really turn as much as fly in a direction so you'll be moving about instead of mosly facing forward, and that really isn't a complaint it just doesn't feel right.  Definitely not finished product right.  Like others said only game so far that i've got motion sick in from an up and down movement going over a hill.  The combat feels clunky, the ship upgrade systems feels completely out of place.  Again like others have said stop and build your ship and miss most of the round leaving your buddies out to dry, or don't waste time building.  The only thing this game does is PvP, and it is small scale, doesn't seem to be an long reason to play other than get in, get it done and get out.  I think perhaps it was just a missed hope on my end that you would fight to "earn" scavenge that you would upgrade your ship with during the downtime that you'd be able to trick out your ship with.  Needless to say, this wasn't a game for me, and I didn't find it fun although this may be right up your alley.  If you're looking for something other than PvP or something like Borderlands in VR this is not it, keep on walking.  It might be eventually, but for now it just is small scale PvP on a proof of concept inside of VR.","June 3","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can\'t currently recommend this game and I\'m debating if I want to get a refund or just hang onto it with the hopes that things will be improved. To qualify my review, I play TF2, Chivalry, and a couple of other MOBA-style FPS games. I\'m not often #1, but I can hold my own. I\'m a pretty decent shot with actual guns as well.\n\nPROS:\n* Graphics for being an arena in a VR game are great. Models of characters is very well done for pushing what is probably low poly counts.\n* Gun reloading mechanic is pretty good.\n* At least the guns have instructions.\n* Shooting range.\n\nCONS:\n* Moving your junker requires you to hold a welding gun in one hand, and the control to do so was sort of wonky. I might need to try another ship, but I couldn\'t turn the one I was using, even rotating my hand.\n* Not much of a tutorial. There\'s an in-game video, I there\'s no way to pause, rewind, etc., so if you want something repeated, you just have to watch it over and over.\n* Not much variation from the basic guns. Guns are frustratingly inaccurate, to the point that they put a sign up saying if you feel like you can\'t hit anything, you need practice. I got pretty good with the pistol and shotgun on the range, but I felt like I couldn\'t hit crap in the actual arena. I think in my 30 minutes of play, I went 2-12.\n* As others have cited, no single-player mode. I don\'t require a large campaign, I\'ll settle for the ability to just drive my junker around and shoot targets, so I can get a low-pressure feel for how to play.\n\nReview might change in the future, but for now I\'m pretty frustrated with this game. I\'m okay with not being the top player, but if I\'m going to die repeatedly, I want to at least have fun while it\'s happening.\n","May 31","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a pretty simple game so I'll get straight to the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n- WOW ITS VR\n- Shooting is cool, reloading is interesting but not how I would have done it\n- Multiplayer is not dead on arrival\n- Placing ship parts for cover is neat\n\nCons:\n- No real co-op\n- No single player mode\n- Only has an arena mode\n- No way to orient your ship (makes fighting difficult if the other person comes at you head on)\n- Fighting lacks depth - there are only two guns and the gimmick of ducking and shooting gets old.  If you are fighting two people at once you will always lose because everyone has access to the exact same tools.  And the shotgun is pretty useless given that the boundaries of two junkers will make sure you're always outside of its effective range.\n- No progression - there is nothing to unlock.  You have all two guns when you buy the game.\n\nOverall I think this is a great vive launch title.  Perfect for introducing people to mechanics that will be standard in the future.  It is a bit on the expensive side for what it offers, but you already bought a vive.  It will become irrelevant in a few years when every VR games has ducking and shooting.\n\nOverall 7/10","April 5","true","0.5"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","3"

Now I'm running the minimum spec machine (6600k @ 4.4GHz, R9 290 @ 1200/6200), but to get judder, even in the shooting range, something is wrong. That happens even on Low presents with 0 AA and low Textures. Considering how important frame rates are, I wish more emphasis would be made on this before releasing a game. In saying all this, It might be SteamVR, it might be Drivers, but other games are fine and this one is one of the worst offenders.\n\nThe in game UI seems a bit strange. Your interface with your ship being the strangest thing, I can never quite get my ship to start first time and then steering seems oddly implemented. When selecting guns, I have to look at the wireframe menu that appears, as sometimes the gun I want is directly down, and sometimes it is down and inwards. It just doesn't feel polished.\n\nThe platforms having a partially locked attitude seems a bit hack-ish. Maybe this solves some of the motion sickness issue, but it makes the gameplay slightly less engaging when you cant spin to utilise your junk.\n\nIt's hard to tell if the network stack is acting up or not. More often than not people are jerking around the world (like the dialup days), but this might be a server issue or just that we're playing with people from all over the globe. There's no way to tell my ping to server, so I'm in the dark when selecting a server.\n\nUltimately, it just feels like the game isn't quite ready for release. I think it will be great, but it needs some polish.","April 24","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is such a fun and active game that you have no choice but to be engaged with it at all times.\n\nThe vast wastelands provide such a grand scale of depth to your environment that a lot of the times I just want to ride as far out as I'm allowed because I love to explore these world's.\n\nIt gives me a borderlands vibe which I love and I love even more because they could of been lazy and just stolen the ideas but they did what any great artist does,  and take inspiration from something they enjoyed and used it for their own.\nIt adds a personal touch that most games lack.\n\nI'm a fit guy who works our frequently so I didn't expect much fatigue, I was wrong, you don't realize how high or low your jumping or ducking until your overheating grasping for a bottle of water. Not only is it physically demanding (in a good way) it is also mentally demanding. You have to have 360 degree awareness at all times, always on edge and newer quite sure what is around the corner.\n\nAll in all this is just my personal opinion, it really shows what the vive and stress level zero is capable of.

Everything about the overall design seems very well thought out, from the visual style to the gunplay. This is a completely unique experience that at the moment can't be found anywhere else. Flying through the desert on a hovercraft, two others in pursuit, shooting over the back of the ship as you make your retreat, crouched over hoping you don't get hit. This and many other similar experiences you will find in this game.\n\nAt the moment there aren't too many people online outside of US peak times and usually from what I've found they are all playing on the US server, which is a pity because for me in Australia that means a lot of latency and rubberbanding. I hope this game gets a lot more players so we can play on local servers.\n\nAlso this game is one of the more physically demanding games you will find. If you're not very fit, you will be sore after playing this game. But that's another plus, right? Make Hover Junkers your leg day.\n\nTo those that are saying this is overpriced; at the moment the price is high but unlike many of the other cheaply priced VR games this is far more than just a tech demo or an arcade style game you will play for a few minutes at a time.

It really feels like a "real" game and not another "VR experience" or demo.\n\nPros:\n-Polished gameplay/gunplay/cover system.\n-Flying around in a hovercraft feels awesome.\n-Reloading revolver and shotgun makes you feel badass.\n-Variety of ships with different appeances and engine sounds. If you choose a big Hover vehicle, you have teammates moving around the ship -this really adds to the sense of presence.\n-Cool music and sound effects.\nLots of maps to choose from, from cargo bays, to grand canyons to alien worlds.\n-Gets you moving and sweating.\n\nCons:\n-Laggy - I have played probably 15 multiplayer games so far and id say 60% of those games had enemy ships lagging and skipping all over. I'm on FiOS with a super fast connection too, its just the peer-to-peer. This makes gun battles impossible because the enemy ship is never where you shoot, they just suddenly lag out and reappear and then youre dead - breaks immersion and gets annoying really fast.\n-Zipping around the hovercraft can cause a little bit of motion sickness at least the first time you pilot one.\n-Takes too many shots to kill enemy pilots - I unloaded 4 shotgun shells to a pilots head at point blank range and saw massive blood bursts each time yet he was  still alive, that's silly. EDIT: A player just told me over the Vive mic that the shotgun is primarily used to destroy cover and the pistol is designed to kill enemy pilots.\n-EDIT: Another con I found after some more playing is Spawn Campers. People will park their Junkers at spawn points and just destroy anyone that spawns.\n\nOverall, cons aside, this is an amazing VR game, not "experience", that I will definitely be playing on a regular basis. I look forward to future updates that add more guns and fix bugs.","April 26","true","54.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, Hover Junkers a must buy for Gen1 HTC Vive if for no other reason than nothing else is doing somehting this amazing.\n\nGameplay Breakdown:\nFull room-scale. Drive your junker around an arena by starting the engine with one hand, then tilting it in the direction your wish to travel. Build your defences around the edges of your junker to provide cover from enemy cover. Fight other players to secure loot and ultimately win the match. Dual wield two weapons, one in each hand to fight.\n\nPros:\n\n+Incredibly intuitive gameplay. Ducking, shooting, and otherwise moving about the cabin is responsive and satisfying. I really appreciate the different reloading procedures for the shotgun and pistol.\n+The Hitboxes are pretty fantastic when the network connection is good.\n+Driving is easy to learn.\n+Really the gunplay feels top notch currently.\n+The different ships all play very differently. I have not played enough to find the "best" one, or even if there is one. I have had a good time and luck with all the ships.\n\nCons:\n\n-I have a 980 and an i7-5960x. I get some moments of frame dropping that can be pretty nauseating. It occures both offline in menus and in game. Seems to be both client side and network related.\n-There is not much customisation. Preset character models and color, along with the ships are the only things you can change.\n-The map feels empty. It doesn't tell you where to drive to get loot (trick out your ship mid match) So sometimes youre just aimlessly driving around.\n-The Screen door effect / HTC Vive Consumer Gen 1 makes it harder to see the reticle than it probably should be. It is still very possible but it is not the best set of iron sights I've seen in a VR title.\n-No offline with bots.\n-Not worth $40 at launch with current content. It looks like the Developers are adding more free content soon, so this con may not apply in a bit.\n-Lag really makes this game unplayable.\n-I find switching weapons to be clunky compared to the rest of the game. It can be pretty annoying trying to switch weapons because of the low time-to-kill.","April 27","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many are just meh, this one is actually really cool.\n\nThere are only a few issues that jump to my mind, so let's touch on those.\n\n1) The playerbase is a little on the small size right now, but that will change as more people get their VIVEs.\n2) There aren't enough guns. Which should be addressed in the future with new content coming in.\n3) It takes *way* too much to actually kill someone. 4-5 direct shotgun blasts to bring someone down is excessive, particularily when you consider how much they can use cover to keep themselves alive. There is no reason for it to take so much to drop someone.\n\nStill, ducking and dodging behind cover is just insanely fun.

So far, I don't regret that decision one bit.

This and many other similar experiences you will find in this game.\n\nAt the moment there aren't too many people online outside of US peak times and usually from what I've found they are all playing on the US server, which is a pity because for me in Australia that means a lot of latency and rubberbanding.

It really feels like a "real" game and not another "VR experience" or demo.\n\nPros:\n-Polished gameplay/gunplay/cover system.\n-Flying around in a hovercraft feels awesome.\n-Reloading revolver and shotgun makes you feel badass.\n-Variety of ships with different appeances and engine sounds. If you choose a big Hover vehicle, you have teammates moving around the ship -this really adds to the sense of presence.\n-Cool music and sound effects.\nLots of maps to choose from, from cargo bays, to grand canyons to alien worlds.\n-Gets you moving and sweating.\n\nCons:\n-Laggy - I have played probably 15 multiplayer games so far and id say 60% of those games had enemy ships lagging and skipping all over. I'm on FiOS with a super fast connection too, its just the peer-to-peer. This makes gun battles impossible because the enemy ship is never where you shoot, they just suddenly lag out and reappear and then youre dead - breaks immersion and gets annoying really fast.\n-Zipping around the hovercraft can cause a little bit of motion sickness at least the first time you pilot one.\n-Takes too many shots to kill enemy pilots - I unloaded 4 shotgun shells to a pilots head at point blank range and saw massive blood bursts each time yet he was  still alive, that's silly. EDIT: A player just told me over the Vive mic that the shotgun is primarily used to destroy cover and the pistol is designed to kill enemy pilots.\n-EDIT: Another con I found after some more playing is Spawn Campers. People will park their Junkers at spawn points and just destroy anyone that spawns.\n\nOverall, cons aside, this is an amazing VR game, not "experience", that I will definitely be playing on a regular basis. I look forward to future updates that add more guns and fix bugs.","April 26","true","54.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Overall, Hover Junkers a must buy for Gen1 HTC Vive if for no other reason than nothing else is doing somehting this amazing.\n\nGameplay Breakdown:\nFull room-scale. Drive your junker around an arena by starting the engine with one hand, then tilting it in the direction your wish to travel. Build your defences around the edges of your junker to provide cover from enemy cover. Fight other players to secure loot and ultimately win the match. Dual wield two weapons, one in each hand to fight.\n\nPros:\n\n+Incredibly intuitive gameplay. Ducking, shooting, and otherwise moving about the cabin is responsive and satisfying. I really appreciate the different reloading procedures for the shotgun and pistol.\n+The Hitboxes are pretty fantastic when the network connection is good.\n+Driving is easy to learn.\n+Really the gunplay feels top notch currently.\n+The different ships all play very differently. I have not played enough to find the "best" one, or even if there is one. I have had a good time and luck with all the ships.\n\nCons:\n\n-I have a 980 and an i7-5960x. I get some moments of frame dropping that can be pretty nauseating. It occures both offline in menus and in game. Seems to be both client side and network related.\n-There is not much customisation. Preset character models and color, along with the ships are the only things you can change.\n-The map feels empty. It doesn't tell you where to drive to get loot (trick out your ship mid match) So sometimes youre just aimlessly driving around.\n-The Screen door effect / HTC Vive Consumer Gen 1 makes it harder to see the reticle than it probably should be. It is still very possible but it is not the best set of iron sights I've seen in a VR title.\n-No offline with bots.\n-Not worth $40 at launch with current content.

There's something extremely satisfying about physically moving up to and ducking behind cover while some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ junker rains shells down upon you. You quickly flick out your shotguns in pair, strain your arms up over your cover, and return a fast reply of buckshot while you scrambly to get your ships engine back online and get a more strategic position.\n\nThis excitement is accentuated when you enter Team Deathmatch and hop on the ship of another player. You both are slinging lead down range, or hiding behind cover. At one point I found myself physically lying on my floor, aiming my gun up through a crack in my cover to engage a target. Another junker pulled up along my other side, so I rolled towards my console and found myself reaching up to try to get my engine online and get the hell out of there. I've never felt a game that made me this immersed.\n\nWhile high in price for the actual amount of things to do, if you love arena shooters, you'll easily get your moneys worth out of this","April 9","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now I'm running the minimum spec machine (6600k @ 4.4GHz, R9 290 @ 1200/6200), but to get judder, even in the shooting range, something is wrong. That happens even on Low presents with 0 AA and low Textures. Considering how important frame rates are, I wish more emphasis would be made on this before releasing a game. In saying all this, It might be SteamVR, it might be Drivers, but other games are fine and this one is one of the worst offenders.\n\nThe in game UI seems a bit strange. Your interface with your ship being the strangest thing, I can never quite get my ship to start first time and then steering seems oddly implemented. When selecting guns, I have to look at the wireframe menu that appears, as sometimes the gun I want is directly down, and sometimes it is down and inwards. It just doesn't feel polished.\n\nThe platforms having a partially locked attitude seems a bit hack-ish. Maybe this solves some of the motion sickness issue, but it makes the gameplay slightly less engaging when you cant spin to utilise your junk.\n\nIt's hard to tell if the network stack is acting up or not. More often than not people are jerking around the world (like the dialup days), but this might be a server issue or just that we're playing with people from all over the globe. There's no way to tell my ping to server, so I'm in the dark when selecting a server.\n\nUltimately, it just feels like the game isn't quite ready for release. I think it will be great, but it needs some polish.","April 24","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gets totally crazy and intense when you have a teammate who wants to works together, collect loot (can get a rez coffin from crates if teammate dies) and destroy your opponents. Voice chat makes this even better but not mandatory.\n\nStick with this one and give it a real go, don't write it off after getting a little dizzy or entering your first few games and dying to people cuz you have no clue what to do.

This game definitely needs better tutorials (o.k. there is a great tutorial in the shooting range that explains everything, make sure you watch it starting out) because you're thrown into the game with no idea of what to do except for some practice at the shooting range.  The game at first seems to be a glitchy mess, but it's really not.  Once you get the hang of it (About 40 minutes) by asking people what to do and so on, the game becomes awesome.  Once you know the gist of what you need to do and practice until you know what buttons to hit and how to steer and shoot properly (as well as how to shield your ship), the game just clicks.","May 22","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It gives a whole new dimension to VR and how to experience it. The hiding is fun and the reload of the weapons could be a little better, but it also gives the game a fun element not being a 2e call of duty like mass shooter.","May 29","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you can practice and hit the objects in the practice range, you can be accurate with your shots and as for the controls, the ships are simulating a air lifted junker, that you have to risk be open to attach armor and loot. There are several things I would add for longevity. First I would add capture the area and maybe escort game modes, second i would add another like to add possibly the flare gun catching the junk on fire and you would have to put it out or a aingle shot rifle. Other than that, I love the game play, just not enough to come back to for long periods.","May 29","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Took me a while not to be just the prey... Always some player online. Works with my GTX 970. Also requires some physical exercise.\nMy preferred VR title along with Tilt Brush.\n\nEDIT: ...and Poolnation VR","April 27","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
