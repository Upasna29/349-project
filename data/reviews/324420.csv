Paired with the standard turn-based mechanics is a day/night cycle. The only difference I've noticed about it is, that the ocean / water freezes from 0:00 am to 4:00 am and you can walk over it with your units - a very viable blitzkrieg strategy, as most of the maps have a reasonable amounts of water. Beware though, if the day comes and your units are over water - they drown and you lose them.\nThe menu is really cool and reminds me of XrossMediaBar and you can have multiple "games" running at the same time - a single player campaign or two, a skirmish with the AI or even a multiplayer match, so you can continue advancing the single player campaign, while waiting for your opponent to end his turn. The switching between "games" is smooth and instantaneous. This leads us to the next interesting fact - there are no save games - you save the game by "cloning" it - so after the "save" you will have 2 instances of the same game running simultaneously. It's like by saving the game you create a different timeline in the multiverse :)\nAs far as I can tell, there are 3 single player campaigns, the first one is the tutorial one and I'm midway through the second ( or so I think). In both of those you're in charge of the winged crusade and fight versus the landians. I think in the 3d campaign you get to play the landians. In my opinion both "races" have similar units, just looking and named differently. As far as I can tell, each race has 10 different units : 2 air , 2 water and the rest are ground ones. The relationship between the units is the standard for strategies triangle : heavy>infantry>air>heavy so you need a good mixture of units in order to win, and I like that.\nBeside the single player campaign, the game offers Multiplayer and Skirmish(vs AI or local coop). Those will probably offer the most of the replayability value. In skirmish you can play Annihilation - kill all enemy units on the map to win, or Conquer - capture all the enemy H.Q., while in Multiplayer a third mode is available - Assassination - destroy a specific enemy unit to win, while protecting yours. I haven't had the pleasure to play anything, but the single player campaigns, so that's all I know about the other modes.\nI find the music of the game reasonable and fitting with the overall feel of the game. I couldn't find any keyboard shortcuts, but Enter, as the end turn key, but I think that's actually enough. The control over your units is pretty good, as you can move them into position, check what enemy you can attack, decide to attack it and see how much damage you're expected to inflict and then decide do you want to complete that action, or just cancel and return the unit in it initial state from the start of the turn. Once the unit has decided to attack or stay at a new position, that decision is final for the turn, as there is no remaining movement points or similar, as seen in another games of the genre.\nI think the game is easy to recommend with the current 50% sale, as it's a well rounded turn-based strategy, With online and local multiplayer, and skirmish vs AI, Steam achievements and trading cards, the game covers all the bases and it's definitely worth it!\nTL: DR you can check my overview video - where I complete the 2nd mission of the 2nd campaign :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=340170332","November 11, 2014","true","5.3"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","1"

It really does run like a beta. The concept is great, but there are bugs. Lots of bugs. I have been completely unable to log in to play a multiplayer game, and the website that hosts the game evidently does not exist. That's a big issue, especially since several of the achievements involve playing multiplayer games.\n\nAnother wierd bug is the way you can have several games running at once. Okay, not an issue per se. But here's the problem. Once you beat a campaign or skirmish, there's no credit role, no returning to the title screen. It just stays on the "game over" screen, and you have to go to the menu from there and select a new game. So now you just have a bunch of games running that aren't really games, they're just game over screens from the games that you beat. I would love for someone to tell me if there's a way to change this. Maybe I'm just missing something? It's quite frustrating.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the game is fun, if not a bit easy. I beat all three campaigns in under six hours. You want a turn based strategy game that's going to challenge you and take up all of your time? Check out Eador: Masters of the Broken World. I got about 300 hours into it before my computer broke and I had to start over again on a new machine. But I digress. In terms of units, Desert Ashes works like a complicated rock, paper, scissors game. Flyers are strong against heavy and naval units, heavies are best against infantry, and infantry take our flying units. And you have a nice selection of each of these kinds of units with varying degrees of power. But after the first few battles (which take like 10-30 minutes), you find a set of a few units that works for you and you can just exploit that for most of the game. The "unique day/night system" doesn't really do that much, and once you develop a strategy, you're pretty much good regardless of the day and night. And using terrain to your advantage only matters in one or two levels, and that's if you choose to worry about all of that. All of this has potential--it just needs to be beefed up a bit, made a bit more complicated and strategic.\n\nThe storyline is... um... well, there is one. But in the third campaign you play as the bad guys, which doesn't make sense. Why am I taking the role of the people that I was just fighting against and want to kill all the civilians? The storyline makes them almost sympathetic, but does all these little things to make us dislike them. And SPOILER ALERT: the game just kind of ends. There's no resolution. The bad guys get the upper hand because that's the last campaign and you play as them, and then... ? Seriously, five more dialogue boxes could have wrapped it up nicely, but it just ends, leaving you going "okay?"\n\nI got it on sale for five bucks. Fine. No biggie. That's less than two gallons of gas, and I get much less mileage out of that. I don't feel gypped, but I do feel underwhelmed. I hope the developers see this, because there is a lot of potential for this game (maybe the addition of a fourth campaign to finish the story?), but as it is, it needs tweaking.","November 18, 2014","false","8.3"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","33","42","0","7"

It manages to feel familiar, yet so alien at the same time. In traditional game of this genre you'd have infantry, cannons, ships, tanks, airplanes, battleships and so on, but with Desert Ashes you have spiders, dragons, demons and airborne creatures. The objective itself is simple, capture the enemy's base while defending your own. You get money with cities that belong to you and make units from fortresses. The game's biggest boast is a seasonal system that will freeze water allowing for ground based units to traverse them and naval units to get stuck. In practice this takes too long to be used that often.\n\nEach unit has its type, movement, attack range, strength and weakness. The larger the attack range, the slower and more expensive it is. Air units are weak to infantry. Infantry is weak to heavy and heavy is weak to air. Its a solid rock-paper-scissor mechanic. Then they all have their range of attack which becomes an issue, because you can move and then attack rather than a balance where long range units can only attack or move. Heavies can only travel on flat ground while infantry can go over mountains.\n\nOn paper, I like the game. Its a fun, easy to play game with unnecessary frustrations. The dynamics are simpler than other games of the genre and twist them in slight ways. There are no airports, rather factories that can generate any unit with the exception of water bases will generate naval units. In combination with the rock-paper-scissors mechanic, this makes every factory dangerous.\n\nWhen capturing a city, you first remove the opposition's capture rather than making your own. This will put more effort on the defender when their income has been nullified with a single turn. This allows you to free a city and stay moving at the cost of unclaimed cities that you never stuck around long enough to capture. Captures can be made only with infantry and an infantry of low health can capture just as quick as one with full health.\n\nThe terrain you're on gives you bonuses to your defense, but it feels like the rock-paper-scissor far outweighs any defense. Each unit has ten points of health that get whittled down until that unit is destroyed. Finding a cactus will replenish infantry and only infantry health in every season except the winter. Once again, as a dark fantasy game, cactus mean health. There is no health increase for standing on your own cities or factories nor any way to merge two damaged units of the same type. You can also sell a unit that is on a city for a refund.\n\nEach unit can move and attack in a turn. When attacking you see who you can attack and the damage you will do along with if that unit can counter strike. The battles are cut scenes where you see your hideous creature and its low budget animation attack. Then its followed by watching the defender get attacked and then a counterattack from any surviving members.\n\nThere are three modes to the game, a campaign with three episodes and multiple missions. The first episode feels like a rushed tutorial before the second episode lets you get into the game. There's a multiplayer and a single player skirmish mode. Beyond that are a slew of other menu items, but its awkward getting to those items because you need to click and drag to the left to find them before you click and drag to scroll through the items. I smell mobile game design. Another indication of mobile design is when purchasing a new unit, you need to click it twice. One to show the unit and a second to buy it.\n\nAs for multiplayer, I attempted to login, but the first party support must have been pulled for this game. Even more interesting than that, if you're offline from Steam you cannot even open the game. I assume its because your Steam account is your login for multiplayer, even if you only want single player.\n\nSkirmish mode lets you select from many different maps and face the computer or a friend in either conquer or annihilation game types. Kudos to dark ashes for making a map that looks like flesh peninsula extending up into water. There are two playable characters, but its sad there are no abilities to differentiate them in terms of gameplay. No strengths or weaknesses.\n\nWith each victory in the campaign, you're just shoved off to the next battle with no fanfare. A break to show you a score would have been nice and give a reason to replay each mission. Every new battle in the campaign kicks off with a lot of text that I just mash my way through. I have no investment with these creature characters.\n\nMy biggest hangup with the game is my inability to look at a spider and know that is a cannon, to look at a whale and know that is a battleship. To look at a depressed bird and see its a short range air vessel rather than a perky flying lizard to see that its a long range airborne cannon. Its easy to type what they are, but it seems so completely foreign.\n\nEven if you've mastered which of your units do what, the enemy units are different than yours. Clicking on them reveals they're an enemy, but what type is a mystery unless you recognize it. They do the same things, but you need to recognize and understand, so its as if the game is in three different languages. The military strategy game that is typical, your units and the enemies units. It turns into guesswork. Is my troop safe here or are they safe there?\n\nEvery creature is a different color, green, blue, red, yellow, white and so on, so its tough telling your army apart from your foe's. They all face south, so there's no help there. This becomes a major issue when you look at a crowded map and need to find all your units to play. If you chose to end a turn, the game never warns you there are unused units that need to move. Even though everything is on a grid, some units and your home base can obscure units behind them.\n\nOne of the infuriating things about the game is how I was able to dismiss a unit by accident several times. When you select a unit, you see flashes of red, units you can attack. So its easy just to select the unit and then attack. Well sometimes those highlighted units are out of range, so in place of attack is dismiss. There is no confirmation, they are just gone. It gets worse, because five percent of the time, the unit menu will start you on the dismiss command rather than the stay command or stay rather than attack. Repetition of always knowing that it will be stay leads to my own efficiency, but then when its sometimes something else boggles my mind. This is a major issue that needs consistency.\n\nI learned to take my time to avoid missteps and after two hours I was able to understand which unit does what. A longer learning curve than expected for a genre that I know so well.\n\nEach battle has a unit capacity, which is a good idea so its strategy rather than sheer numbers. If you reach your maximum capacity, you need to dismiss a unit and wait for the next turn before you are allowed to purchase a new one. To keep you on your toes, the unit capacity seems to shift, even during your turn itself. I've seen it go from twelve to fourteen.\n\nDesert Ashes is a tough game to get into, but there is still fun here. Its a dirt cheap game that might be worth a risk to pick up. It has depth, a healthy campaign for the price and skirmishes to keep you playing.","January 6","false","4.5"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","23","25","0","0"

It also have trading cards, making it extremely cheap to try. It may be also interesting for achievement hunters, as long as you have someone to complete the multiplayer achievements with. It may also appear to die-hand Advanced Wars fans as a nice title to feature on Steam.\n\nDetailed reviewFirst of all, let me start by stating that this game originally came as an indie title on PS Vita (which may make the game look better on PS Vita in the comparison to the PC). However, I will review this game as a PC title.\n\nIt's also worth noting, that the game mechnanics are basically the same as a Famicom/Advanced Wars game, probably the best known being the Advanced Wars for GBA.\n\nStarting with the review, however - the first feeling I got when launching the game was if at it was a tablet/mobile port, as the menu controls and overall feeling of the game feels so.  There is also no hints about that so it took me a while to figure. A short while but still - the menu controls feels definitely weird on the PC. Also when we're at it - the game allows to simultaneously play several matches. While the feature is not nice (though unneeded for single player most of the time) ending a match doesn't bring you to menu, which is a bit confusing. Other than that there are some minor issues with the interface, but overall it's okayish - none of it doesn't make the game unplayable at least.\n\nThe game is split into 3 campaigns you can start at any time. Each campaign have 7 maps though initially only the first one is unlocked although there is a little backstory that makes sense if they are played in order. However, it's a bit misleading, as the first campaign actually serves as the tutorial, making it weird to skip - the fact although is nowhere marked, so it may be a bit misleading.\n\nThe story and the whole setting overall have it's charm, although the story is a bit bland and lacking - some things are not explained well enough and the game ends in a cliffhanger - I would love to see the continuation though. The character designs are a bit hilarious and awkward looking sometimes, but that's just my personal opinion\n\nThe game mechanics are simple once you get hang of them, and if you like turn based strategies, I'm sire you will like it (I actually recommend trying out the Wars series, especially the Advanced Wars if you like the mechanics of the game). While the tutorial explains most of the basics, the most advanced features are not explained (like the terrain bonuses, win conditions and maximum number of troops. You will figure them out eventually, but there could be a help page in game with the reference of some kinds. Also, the info about the enemy troops is very limited. Until you learn which troop is which you may have hard time judging which troop is stronger than the other.\n\nThere is also a time mechanic, which is pretty nice, but unfortunately the only thing that happens as the time passes is freezing water. Id adds to the game mechanics but that aspect could be expanded more (like making certain troops stronger or terrain types more effective in certain hours). It is also worth noting that there is, unfortunately just a small variety of  the units and terrains. Map editor would be a nice addition too, unfortunately there is nothing like that in game :(.\n\nAnother shame of the game is that the enemy AI is really dump. Once you get the hang of the game's mechanics winning any of the game is not hard, even if you make some mistakes. There is a skirmish mode with AI but none of the missions are really challenging as there are no difficulty options or handicap settings. which makes the game challenging only vs the real opponent.\n\nSo - the multiplayer. First, let's mention that there is a hot-seat feature in skirmishes allowing playing on the same PC which is nice.  Now for the real multiplayer - you have to (I'm not sure, maybe it's optional though) create a new account on developer's website - mecho.net. While the in-game feature is working fine, the whole website was never set up as of January 2015, though it's nitpicking from my side, as the website is not really needed. It may be a good question though what would happen with the game's multiplayer in event the website is closed? There are some achievements related to playing online and one for leveling up, at the very least. However, as of now, the core feature works fine, so it's okay. Having an account allows you to level up and unlock new perks (something not available in single player). There are also leaderboards but I'm not sure if they work correctly (if they do, then I'm a level 2 with a world rank of #1 o.O.\n\nHowever - multiplayer IS buggy. Sometimes the game throws a "game error". Restarting seems to help, but before that, whole game progress is lost. There is also no turn limit, making the game possible to last for an extended period of time if your opponent isn't in front of the PC, as the games and invites seems to persist after you close the game. Unfortunately, there are no Steam Turn Notifications for this game :(. There is not much player too, unfortunately and you obviously can't cross-play with the PS Vita users which I'd have to admit, would potentially make multiplayer a lot better.\n\nIn terms of audio-visuals - the graphics are colorful, as you can see on the screens and generally look nice. However, the graphics are very basic and especially animations may look a bit amateurish (but again, it's a PS Vita port). The audio effects are, again, "okayish". A really nice feature though is the soundtrack which is amazing IMO! The soundtrack is not included, but the OGG files can be extracted from the game files easily with the help of 7-zip.\n\nIt's also worth noting, that while you can have multiple games launched at once, there are only two players on the map - and only two factions to choose from (which vary only aesthetically) and quite small maps to fit in. No big maps or 3+ players/AI on the same game.","January 22, 2015","false","16.2"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

(Sucks that 4 of its 11 achievements are based on winning multiplayer matches, though it only takes one for 2 of them.) Some problems are the port, but some are just built in.\n\nThe only way this game could be more casual is being pay-to-win (no freemium, yay), with its bright cheery graphics, easy money, and small levels that only take a dozen rounds each with little strategy. Although the day/night cycle SHOULD offer a game-changing twist, the water/ice is just an occasional convenience, and almost every single-player level can be easily won by zerg rushing the enemy. The AI isn't very strong, and the first player has an almost insurmountable advantage thanks to the order battles occur. There's zero randomness, zero specials, and once you know the units you can quickly min-max the game and win everything. A 4X player will find almost no depth here.\n\nAnd yet I think it's kind of cool. It gives some random casual iPhone-like entertainment in between meatier games, and making tons of units and wiping out everything can be surprisingly cathartic. I just wouldn't pay much for it.\n\nI wish it had been fully made for the PC, because so many things require you to sweep your mouse from one end of the screen and back just to give orders. It's ok for a touchscreen, though it'd still have some issues there, but a pain in the ♥♥♥ with a mouse. Aside from that, having no way to cancel an accidental order is annoying, the music sometimes skips, and the text and animations are interminable.

This game plays very similar to Advance Wars on the GBA, where you capture locations to earn money, which is used to purchase units. All the different units have different strengths and weaknesses against other units, and the game offers an excellent tutorial explaining each one.\nThis game has a very unique visual style that reminds me of a robotic fantasy world. I've never seen anything like it. The artwork is crisp and colorful, and the game has a very HD look to it. It supports a variety of display resolutions and audio settings. The music and sound effects are very average, and the game has typos in the english language. I also found the game to pause briefly a lot regardless of visual settings before unit attacks, but for the most part this was pretty minor.\nI should mention that the unique menu system in this game can be moved around if you click the mouse and hold the image and pull it to the left and down. You will find visual options and the exit game button with this method of menu interaction. It's rather unusual and not very obvious.\nThis unique menu system allows you to play a campaign mission while searching for a game room to join online and hosting one at the same time. You can then easily switch between the game windows and monitor many in progress games or online game searches. I think it's really useful.\nIf you like such games as Shining Force, Galaxy Admirals, or Advance Wars, you won't be dissappointed here. This is a solid turn based strategy game and deserves much more notice than it seems to get.\nI picked this game up while it was on sale for $1.09 CDN and I found that to be a great deal.

Turn-based, grid-based games are such a rarity these days and I generally like those games.\nGenerally, but not in this instance.\n\nFor readers that know advance wars or something similar:\nIt's advance wars with the complexity sandblasted off. And suffering for this sin.\n\n\nEvery single unit are aligned on the following scale:\n1 attack range, let's call them "cheap melee"\n1-2 attack range\n2-x attack range(x varies between 3 and 6), let's call them "expensive artillery"\n\nThen assign 4 movespeed to all 1 range units, 3 to pretty much every single other unit, and assign to only ground and sea artillery a speed of 2.\nSo the movement of units is both laughably predictable and absolutely unexciting. Less exciting than chess in in terms of movement.\n\n\nA huge majority of units also do 50% damage against their own type, and 100-150% damage against their rock-paper-scissors hard counter victims. So there is a lot of instant kills if you vaguely know what you do.\nWhat if a unit is damaged but not destroyed?\nSuicide attack to get rid of it.\nYou can't join damaged units together and you can't repair non infantry units. And infantry units are barely worth saving since they are incredibly cheap.\nOn top of that your army is not just limited by income and by being destroyed, but also by a limit of supply attached to money producing cities.\n\nTerrain is also simplistic. The movement changes are either 50% less movement(forests, mountains), or 50% more movement(streets). Water freezes for a couple of turns after "midnight", and frozen water is identical to boring old ground.\nAir units are unaffected by terrain. Only infantry can move over mountains. Cacti on the map can be used by infantry to suck on juice and repair themselves in exchange for not doing anything productive.\nSo every unit will probably spend most of their time running along streets and infantry will stand on buildings sometimes.\n\nAnd that is the extent of this games complexity.\n\n\nThe story is weak and at the same time barely there. There is so few dialogue, only at the beginning of a mission, and what little dialogue there is is riddled with spelling errors and entire missing words at one point.\nThe art seems to have received some love by the creators, but I don't really care much as long as it works.\n\n\nSo overall, I cannot recommend this game, as much as I would want to.","March 11, 2015","false","9.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

In the campaign the AI is competent but not a challenge, in the skirmish I got beated with no effort (maybe it was the difficulty setting, maybe the map, I don't know).\nThe main problem I found is that there can be too many units on each side, and the AI it's does not play fast, so you can spend a lot of time waiting for your turn. Something similar happened with the Banner Saga, but there was a story to follow and a bunch of characters with names, faces and personalities presented to you from the very beginning (I read that there's also a story in this game, but after finishing the tutorial I got a The End sceen and couldn't advance beyond that, then was when I played the skirmish).\nI may try to play the rest of the campaign, but after the first chapter I feel no interest in the story, I don't know who they are or why are they fighting, so the only reason to keep playing would be the game mechanics and the game has a competent design but is too slow paced, I found a setting to avoid watching the battles but I don't know if there's a way to skip the enemy's turn or something like that.","April 2, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then you have two shortish single player campaigns, playing as each of the two factions in the game, where the maps are reasonably diverse and the AI is kind of okay enough to make you pay attention to what you are doing, although it is not hard to beat all of the missions. Still I don't think there isn't really enough content in the single player campaigns, or the skirmishes that would really capture your attention for long, they are more an introduction/practice venue.\n\nThe game is pretty well balanced - all the unit types have their benefits and weaknesses, and nothing clearly is always the best thing to build (although on certain large open water maps the long range sea units are hard to beat if you have a few, and unlike the land artillery there is no way to use the cheap unit swarming countermeasure to overrun them for most of the day). Both sides have the same units with different names/graphics, so the sides are implicitly balanced. The freezing of water at night adds an extra angle on some maps - what was a deadlock and chokepointed map can suddenly spring wide open, or as mentioned suddenly your dominating whale artillery squadron is suddenly immobile and vulnerable.\n\nAs mentioned above you have to pay attention - the mechanics of buying units which then can't move or attack until the next turn means that if you start losing ground or end up short of units one turn then the opponent is probably going to stomp all over you very fast. This means you don't get long drawn out defensive rearguard actions slowing the end stages of the game, but also that you have to watch what you are doing - retreating your artillery a space or two before firing, or spawning a unit at a different factory so they are out of range of attackers, can be all the difference between winning and losing. Or using the nearest unit to attack rather than one moving up from the back so you leave the more forward one to capture a building, or attack the next unit further back which your other unit can't reach, etc.\n\nThe game menu UI is a little bit idiosyncratic (presumably designed for mobile devices), but usuable enough, and the in game UI is easy enough to use, with the odd exception where you want to move a unit in the corner of the map that is sitting under part of the UI, and dragging the screen to show the unit doesn't help as it snaps back and recentres before you can click on the unit. Checking your opponents movement/attack ranges in their next turn is also fairly easy/intuitive. However unlike, say, Hero Academy your moves play out immediately and there is no undo, so you can't experiment and work out an optimal strategy by trial and error, but there are far few variables in Desert Ashes so once you have experience this probably won't be a big loss...most of the time, until you start attack and suddenly realise there was a better option/order of doing things. On the other hand this does make for a more live/raw feel for the game when you can't just unkill a bunch of units and try something different as often as you like.\n\nThe multiplayer set up seems fine - you can set maximum turn lengths to suit how you want to play (24 hour limits for a more play by email type game, or 5 minutes if you want to play "live"), and you can play multiple games at once where appropriate, which is simple enough as you just exit one game, drag up and down the list if needed, and "zoom" into the other game to switch over, all fairly seamless and easy to use. Logging in seems to work from the Steam account, so no mucking about there, although there are sometimes connection issues with the login server it has always been pretty temporary for us. Creating new games is also fairly straightforward, picking either random internet people or friends as appropriate (although it doesn't filter to friends that have the game), and you have a few mildly different game types to try out.\n\nSo all that seems great so far - and up to this point it would be a definite recommendation for the sort of people that like these sorts of games. So the two core problems - lack of pickup multiplayer opponents (or at least ones that actually take a turn), which might not be a blocking issue for people who aren't reliant on pickup online gaming, and the regular and long lag to process turns. While some of the time (when playing inside the same room) we have had games where turns get processed and sent to the other person within a few seconds, most of the time we have tried to play it takes somewhere from a few minutes to sometimes maybe 10 minutes for a turn to start appearing on the other persons system - and even then it then takes 10-30 seconds per move the opponent made. So if you plan on playing people you know in 24 hour PBeM style games this might suit you. Otherwise, currently, it probably won't.","March 27, 2015","false","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would rate it neutral.\n\nI was a little worried to see it was mixed review, but honestly it was a lot better than I expected. There were some serious UI issues and bugged music (where if I pulled up steam overlay or the menu [can’t remember which] it would get stuck on repeating the same couple notes, until it fixed itself). I thought I completed the campaign in about 15 minutes and it was only the training section, but the UI is stupid in how you pick your episodes or some crap. The UI is also stupid in that if you miss the (admittedly giant) button it resets what move you’ve done. And some other little niggles. Mouse doesn’t always work, need to use arrows in menus, etc.\n\nGameplay wise, it was ok. a pretty simplified grid turn based strategy. Has some semblance of a story, but it’s just generally weird creatures vs. weird creatures.  On that note, the art is very bizarre, but actually pretty good. The animations are stiff, but they still look ok. Creatures remind me of something out of Zeno Clash (very weird game if you’ve tried that).\n\nThe fighting has 3 major unit types, air, infantry, and heavy. I think water units are considered heavy. Infantry > air > heavy > infantry. Standard triangle of force. You have different levels amongst each, and they have different ranges to attack from. Though oddly, if I attack with a long range, their short range can still counter.\n\nThere is a small environment change. Each turn is considered an hour and in the middle of the night in the cycle, the water freezes over so you can move land units across it. The color of environment changes each hour too. For how far I am into the game, that's the only environment changes that I've seen.\n\nI did not attempt multiplayer. I'd be pretty surprised if there were enough people playing to find a game. Another reviewer said the mp was completely broken and inaccessible.\n\nOverall review, love the weird art, the gameplay is kind of mediocre.","August 24, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It borrows heavily both in gameplay and in style from Advance Wars on the GBA but Desert Ashes is a bit more basic. Not that it suffers from that, in my opinion. Sometimes a bit of lightweight turn based strategy is just what I want.\nIt has come on since some of the 2014 reviews. I haven't noticed any bugs and the campaign maps don't require a return to the main menu screen any more. It's got a nice automatic save-game, which even saved the state of play when the game crashed once (I Alt-Tabbed).\nAll in all it's quite polished and does what it does well. It has some nice little touches like the ability to jump to any battle in the scenarios and the way it will save every unfinished game - even if you have several.\nThe only negative points are that you can't bypass the cut-scenes which can be a bit annoying when you are playing a scenario for the third or fourth time, the limited scenario battles (though it has a skirmish mode) and the rather basic AI of the computer opponent. So not for hard-core strategists but good fun for a quick turn-based blast if that's what you are after.","December 30, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
