Controls are simple, the graphics are GORGEOUS (and also quite trippy), and it's just plain fun. It's a bit simple at first but then gets a bit difficult (but not too difficult). I'm having a great nostalgic rush by just playing this. It gets a "Very good!" on the Hoovie Scale!","June 3","true","1.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Its like going back on time to the 90's arcade racing games. Simple gameplay (gear up, gear down, left and right), but really hard to master. The music is incredible too, what makes the game more amazing xD!\nAlso, this is a GAME, plug and play. Easy as that, you dont need to get by lots of menus, or anything like that. Juts open, and race.\n\nReally really happy to find this little game. 10!","June 3","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game itself was really shallow, not at all what I expected from reading the reviews and watching the videos/screenshots. Doesn't feel like a complete game.","June 4","false","0.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"
