"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mandalorez/recommended/313340/","mandalorez","The Deer Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mandalorez/","321 products in account","I don't think a lot of people don't see the value in Mountain, and when people do they tend to simply overcomplicate the game for what it is. It's not meant to be a 'game' exactly. The developers of the game purposefully say this originally: "Leave it open - it's designed to run in the periphery of your life. Only interact with it when you feel like it. You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself. ". Again Mountain is just mean to be left open and you can return to it when you feel like it. You might not see the aspect of it originally but you can find it later… hopefully. But then again, what are the standards of a 'game'? Are we to simply segregate Mountain simply because it is possibly outside of the norm? On the contrary! Different experiences lead to different viewpoints which make you more open-minded. So can people truly state that Mountain is not a game but a screensaver? There are many ways to view Mountain and seeing it as a screensaver is one of the more popular demoralizing viewpoints to which many have so acquired. So one can only view Mountain as simply a standalone and not compare it to more contemporary issues. Or one can compare it but by doing so one loses the face value of the game itself. I think I've settled for now the dispute that this 'game' might be a screensaver or simply not a 'game' at all.\n\nOn another note, the developers stated this: "If you're having an annoying storm or boring night, play a melody (using your keyboard) and time will accelerate." Mountain is there for you when you decide to return to it and play it. I think that is a common misconception. It's not as much meant to be a 'game' but rather a subsidiary and supporting game next to you. Yet there are many ways to view Mountain as with any form of issue in life. But the Way Mountain was constructed, at times unappealing to the eye, allows it to show you a different path and possibly one you may not have seen before hand.\n\nBut you don't have to follow what the developers say. A 'game' is meant to be played whichever way you feel like it. If you feel like you've been cheated off by buying this game, then take two steps back and think about the aspects of this 'game' and the elements. Perhaps you begin to notice that wonderful ambient sound that plays amidst the night, or perhaps you fall in love with the way the streaks of the sun touch your Mountain. But you might not have to like all these things to truly enjoy the game. Perhaps you have all these games and you developed a love for the game. Or perhaps you try to ridicule the game but in turn you've actually Grown accustomed to the game. I for one cannot answer that question of whether a gamer should like this or not, but it is all up to the gamer who buys it, and whether he is willing to open up his heart and mind.\n\nNow is the Mountain truly your Mountain and your own property? I think that is in the conception of the gamer alone for the gamer can make notion whether the Mountain truly is a self embodiment, or the player truly controls the Mountain. Does the Mountain not speak to us and tell us of its thoughts? Or is it conveying a hidden message to where we might be its own spawn and it is the master. Whichever way you see fit, there are quite a lot of ways to see Mountain, as with any game. Mountain might not have a storyline, no shooting, no love triangle (unless you begin to make one up between somehow the items, the Mountain, and the sky in which case you probably might have gone a bit too far), but Mountain contains a moment of solitude in which you might notice things in games that can be recurrent in Mountain. Perhaps Mountain might contain all these elements in which you create the story. Mountain can always be a storyline in which you, the gamer, is going along a path with the Mountain to a destination into your subconscious. There is much to do in Mountain and blocking your imagination and logic will only hinder it. But if you so choose to do so than you have not hurt no one but yourself in denying the possible powers in the 'game' itself. This review cannot display my neutrality toward the game but I only wish to explain to the gamer that Mountain can only be accentuated by only the gamer.\n\nAnd another thing many question is the role of the keyboard in the game. Although at first it may seem like the keys simply advance time and increase it in a way the human eye can perceive, Mountain is inevitably omnipresent and time is of little importance to him. Binding ourselves to this thought, we can perceive the passing of time as not one full of dread and dreariness, not one full of change and a different scenery, but becoming part of the universe and its infinite realm of possibilities. What we perceive as a minute can seem as nothing more than what has occurred to the Mountain. What we perceive as the future is simply the happening in the Mountain. What we perceive as the past is imply seen as the done by the Mountain.\n\nAnd another question still remains as to what is the value of the items that the Mountain contains and at times loses. Are those pieces of our memories or life lessons that we must cope to accept? Or are those as somewhat like to put it as simple items that simply 'fall' on the Mountain. No they are granted upon the Mountain and delivered first hand to the Mountain or possibly to you. And what is of this item leaving our grasp and floating off into space? Have we broken your heart, Mountain? Have we done some unforgivable act too which I've lost my pony? That alone can be answered only by the gamer and his affiliation with the mountain.\n\nAnd what of this inevitable destruction that reaches the doorsteps of the Mountain ever so often. Are we to simply ponder over the oblivion of the Mountain or sputter key notes to protect the Mountain? Or can we observe the Mountain and it's destruction in all its gloom and tidings of change too which a new Mountain is brought forth to bring new waves of joy to the gamer, too which the cycle is repeated. Why do we have the ability to protect the Mountain or is it even in our ability to protect it? Is it predestined that we protected or is it by our own free-will? That is something that neither I can answer you and only you can resolve either by justifying it or believing in something.\n\nThis setting that surrounds the Mountain is quite serene and yet the darkness around it is quite opposite. Is this serving as a contrast between dark and light? The battle of how light destroys the darkness. Or perhaps the story has been switched and light is simply a harbinger of this cycle of death that is ever so dreaded upon. Again, I am not in any sort of ability to answer that question, and it alone can be sought through the Mountain.\n\nSo if you ever feel hurt or saddened than perhaps a tune on the fashioned keyboard can mend your heart. Or perhaps a stressed out day simply requires a concerto done by your own imagination. And maybe in the end when you've discovered the infinite combinations on the keys that by which you alone and the Mountain as well contains in the hidden locks of memory, you realize all this and then come to think in terms of the Mountain, and how time is not congruent, but simply an assortment of things by which we alone can process and that by which we alone can control. Mountain is infinite and it is up to the gamer only to perceive the game as he wishes.","November 9, 2014","true","065.9"," 664 of 807 people (82%) found this review helpful 69 people found this review funny","82","664","807","69","57"

When you stop wanting it to be more than what it is, it blossoms into its own experience.  And what it is, is more virtual plant, than anything else; is that a bad thing? Read on!\n\nfull review.If you let it, the Mountain can be a soothing and relaxing experience if you need 5-10 minutes (taken) away from your life.  It's a slowly spinning Mountain in Space.  You can zoom out to see nearby galaxies and star clusters, or zoom in to fill your view with the mountain and the surrounding atmosphere.  There are so many variables that change and the changes/additions appear every 30 seconds or so, it has enough to keep your eyes trained and your mind engaged in thought.\n\nIn a nutshell: if you enjoy sitting on a bench watching nature around you (e.g., the ocean, a coast, a forest, a vista), then you will enjoy this experience.  But understand that virtual-mountain-in-space-watching is the only experience it can innately provide you.  Anything else you experience, is a result of where your thoughts and your psyche take you.  And that's Zen. :)\n\nThe Mountain does nothing in particular, but does it very well.\n\nPROS+Beautiful scenery/lighting effects\n+Soothing audio effects\n+Striking day/night cycle\n+Well-done weather and season cycles\n+Occasional random or pseudo-inspirational captions\n+Occasional random object collisions (some can be quite funny)\n+Some interactivity (POV, musical keys)\n\nCONS-You have to pay for it\n-Surprisingly resource intensive\n-wtf, ALT-F4 is how you close it?\n\n(suitable for all ages and skill levels)","May 19, 2015","true","3.8"," 127 of 141 people (90%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","90","127","141","16","8"

It is an ambient, casual, silly game that is entertaining to mess around with for an hour or three… and I don’t see the problem with that.  I thought it was very fun.\n\nThis is a perfect game to combat boredom in a lecture, or a slow day at work.  You can mess around with it a bit and then let it run in the background, so you are free to only partially pay attention to it.  Not everybody at every time is available to get immersed in an epic game; sometimes it is nice to mess around with something light and casual.  This is where Mountain shines brightest.\n\nOf note: in order to truly and actively “play” the game, you should probably look up the songs (i.e.: codes) that you can use to force things to happen in the game.  I feel like many people who disliked this game weren’t fully informed of all the things you actually can do to make it more interesting.\n\nI don’t normally focus on price in my reviews, because it is all relative.  Many people use Steam; people with a wide variety of incomes and who participate in very different economies.  I will make a brief exception here just to say that I think this game is very reasonably priced. Even at full price it costs less than a soda (at least where I live).  I mention this because I think it is important to recognize that the developers aren’t trying to rip you off; they acknowledge what the game is and what it isn’t, and have priced it accordingly.\n\nAnd so, I believe Mountain is a great little game which should appeal to those of you who may want to casually mess around with it for a few hours here and there.  It certainly isn’t some epic game, but it can be an enjoyable, quaint experience.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","July 24, 2015","true","1.1"," 100 of 123 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","100","123","3","4"

You could grab random objects, arrange them, see the seasons change, maybe there would be some birds flying around. It gave the impression that even though there wasn't a point to the game, the experience alone would be fun, and you'd stick to it just to see what would happen.\n\nBut I never saw that. I played for 20 minutes. I spun the camera, i played the keytar, I zoomed in and out, I found every feature on my mountain. It rained, i spun the mountain to make the clouds go away. I saw the little thoughts my mountain had. But nothing happened. I pressed every button, manipulated every control I could think of, and made as many patterns with my mouse as I could imagine, and nothing happened.\n\nI can't honestly recommend it, because I've had more enjoyment from that Windows '95 screensaver about a maze (with the rat in it) than I did from this game. Maybe there's more to it than I thought, maybe you need to leave it on overnight for something to happen. But it's not presented in a way that makes me want to stick around to find out.","August 18, 2014","false","0.4"," 2,380 of 3,531 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","380","3","5","99"

Mountain first and foremost feels almost like the modern gaming answer to the post-WWI Dada art movement. Where Dada used collages and pre-made works (such as a urinal) and presented them as high art by putting them into galleries in order to challenge the concept of art, Mountain puts itself on the steam store under 'rpg-games' when I think you'd be hard-pressed to find it fitting this term. The 'gameplay' in Mountain is virtually non-existent, since the act of playing Mountain is leaving in on in the background until you hear a sound and can view whatever new content pops up. Like a lot of (post)modern-art Mountain is ultimately making whatever artistic statement you get out of it, there's no real easy answer here.\n\nOk, but how is the "game" fun?:\nWell it's pretty relaxing, the visuals are amazingly surreal and serene. There's a lot of goofy items that will periodically crash into your mountain as you leave the program running and your Mountain will often present these funny faux-deep statements about its existence; this effectively works as a way of the game poking fun at its artistic ambitions. While it's hard to say these are of any real substance they're genuinely funny and will at least make you smile reading them. You can check up on your Mountain to see trees grow, seasons pass but the mountain remains a constant.\n\nThe only thing that really bothered me about Mountain was the clouds that will clip through the mountain rather than moving around in a way that doesn't make it look so artificial, also some shadow issues happen from time to time. These might seem like minor nitpicks but this can take you out of the expirence.\n\nIf you're in the market for a piece of relaxing software that you can leave on while you're working/using the internet/playing other "real" games the Mountain is great, it engages you by being fairly passive. With it being a $1 it's kind of hard not to recommend it to anyone interested.","August 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 181 of 258 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","181","258","4","7"

On some computers, this will cause overheating which is entirely unnecessary in a glorified screensaver.*\n\nThe game isn't limiting resource usage on its own, so it's causing components to run too hot. It's using more resources than much larger, graphically intensive titles. This is indicative of poor programming, not that any one persons computer is lacking. Any computer would have more trouble running this program than what is reasonable, and it's caused by the same lazy developer who decided to sell a thrown together mess of pretentious bile.  Any attempt to explain what this game is actually trying to say is going to end up being a guess at something the developer doesn't even understand.  A stream of conciousness has never been so dull and pathetically attention seeking, while still managing to turn your room into a furnace.\n\nIt's unacceptable, and nobody should fall victim to buying this abysmal excuse for a game.\n\nIf you "play" this "game" as if it were a screensaver, you'll get a somewhat interesting, passive piece of eyecandy that might grab your interest every once and a while","August 18, 2014","false","0.7"," 955 of 1,471 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","955","1","2","23"

I wondered what in the world it was so was compelled to go check out the store page.  Well to be honest it didn't look like much, a mountain floating in mid air with stuff growing on it.  But hey, at ninety nine cents what can you expect really.  I mean, sure I could have turned that same buck into a tasty cheeseburger or chili dog, maybe gotten a soda or ice cream cone but something made me want to buy this game....  So what did my dollar get me this time??\n\nWell so far I've drawn three pictures, and seen a mountain spinning around and around.  Not sure if they all start this way but mine seems to have a bare spot on one side.  I've seen pretty fireflies, watched night turn into day several times, winter came and went, and I've played a few notes on the keyboard as well as seen what the mountain is thinking from time to time.  And that's it, nearly an hour into the game and I've seemingly done all the interactivity you can do with it.\n\nWait, what's that? I just heard it talk in the background......something about seeing itself in this night.....  Uh..... Is that a mushroom, a red mushroom???  That wasn't there before.... and what happened to that lone shrub that was on the bare side?  Now it's even barer than before.....  And what's this deep rumbling noise I keep hearing??  Like thunder but it's sunny out...  And this, my friends is the lure and fun of Mountain.  Patience and a deep craving to see what happens next and then being in shock and awe when something does happen.  It’s not a high speed, boom, bang game.  It’s  a slow, lazy river kind of game you'll set in the background while doing something else.\n\nDid I mention that I love lava lamps?  No really I totally love lava lamps.  What does that have to do with this review??  Well Mountain is kind of like a lava lamp on steroids for your computer.  You don't really do much with it.  Not a lot to play with really.  Oh there are some secret tunes you can play to make things happen but honestly, at the end of the day; this "game" is about leaving it run and seeing what happens from time to time.  And much like the lava lamps in my bedroom you could just sit there watching this mountain spinning around and doing its thing and be absolutely mesmerized with it.  Why?  Because it's simple.  Because it's like life in the fact that you never know what's going to happen next.  Because there's something totally relaxing about it.  Now, if you'll excuse me, it's winter on my mountain and it's totally covered in snow.  Think I'm going to go watch it for a while....  Huh, there's a tiny planet now stuck in the side of my mountain...................weird..............\n","August 20, 2014","true","19.3"," 170 of 262 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","170","262","3","2"

But I'll try anyway.\n\nFirst of, this is not a game at all. Now let me describe it in detail so you won't misunderstand.\n\nAfter starting up the game, you will notice that there is no menu or any sort of interface. Instead, you will be asked to draw pictures in a blank white paper. The game then will randomly generate a mountain according to what you have draw (at least to my belief)\n\nAnd what do you do after that? Nothing.\n\nWhat is your goal? There is no goal.\n\nYou just, stare at the mountain, and that's that. You CAN type certain key on your keyboard to create piano sounds but that's it. The mountain is changing in weather and time which looks nice but it gets old really quick. Music will randomly pop up whenever dawn comes or weather changes or the mountain talks to you.\n\nSo... yeah. It's not a video game. It's more like a software "labeled" as a game.\n\nYou just watch the mountain moving, changing, and sometimes talk back to you. The developer could add some interaction to keep the "game" from becoming a boring screensaver. But no, that would be too much to ask appearantly.\n\nDo I recommend others to play this? I don't. For a "game" costing only 99 cents, it barely has any content at all. There are some graphical glitches in around the shadow texture and it always makes my dark side of the mountain looks ugly. I don't consider this art because there are more better looking "game" that have the same low price and have better "art".\n\nFor you people who got an extra 99 cents and wanted a screensaver labeled as a "game", well, here you go.\n\nBut for me, even at 99 cents, this game lacks content.","August 18, 2014","false","7.7"," 174 of 274 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","174","274","0","9"

This isn't some fancy philisophical statement. This is a game where you watch stuff happen to a mountain.

They make up all kinds of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t about frogs and flowers and ♥♥♥♥. The mountain is no different. Its an ambiance game, something to go asleep to, or to have in the back ground as you argue about dumb opinons on the internet. You don't do anything, press a few keys, make a few noises, and watch. Its not even that pretty. But its peaceful, and its kinda cool to see what changes over time. If you'd pay a dollar to see a neat thing, see this neat thing. Why not?

I didn't think that there was a point behind this game but until I read a guide "How to be a good Mountain". The guide I read was really helpful I decided to play it for another 9 hours. Mountain is a game where you can just run in the background but you need to be careful of a few things while you're doing that... I'll explain here,\n\nAt first, you'll find it quite boring. But what people don't realise is that there are alot of things you can do to your Mountain to make it less boring. There are commands that you can play music by typing in letters on your keyboard in a specific order. There are various songs you can play like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Happy Birthday. You can also play your own songs too. While playing songs with certain music keys, you enable specific items that rain down like Blood Mode -  it rains blood, Snowglobe mode - it snows, Raining frogs, Heart mode - it rains hearts and alot more. You can zoom in and out into space, and scroll to go closer to your Mountain.\nIf you want to feel less lonely, you can type the letters m,kj and it will talk to you. Your Mountain would share it's thoughts to you. But sadly, you can't actually "talk" to them. There are four seasons in the game (correct me if I'm wrong) in the game. Trees and plants will also grow on your Mountain from time to time.\n\nWhilst you're playing the game or running it in the background, there will be various debris (items) such as a plane, a giant phone, a giane piece of cake, a football, a baseball, a giant fan, books and pens and much more your Mountain will encounter and it will crash onto your Mountain. Nothing wrong with this. Random items will crash onto your Mountain at completely random times. The reason why I played this was because I wanted to collect the items, I would check everytime if a random item has crash landed onto my Mountain. You can also move your items and place them where ever you want by clicking them and dragging them. NOTE: Items may also dissapear from your Mountain at the order the item has crash landed onto your Mountain.\n\nOne of the few things you need to watch out for is annihilation. Annihilation is when a meteorite or a giant flame ball comes towards your Mountain from space, completely wipes out your Mountain and that would be game over. Signs of when annihilation is when you hear some ambient-like music in the background. One way to protect your Mountain is spamming random keys on your keyboard and it will create a shield around your Mountain. Spam your keyboard if you see annihilation coming. You should sucessfully survive annihilation.\n\nI would not recommend you to run this game while you're away, sleeping or doing something because annihilation can happen at any random time without notice. Always watch your Mountian from time to time. Your Mountain is too precious to be destroyed.\n\nMORE REVIEWS ON OUR CURATOR PAGE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Dle4DxuTEY","August 22, 2015","true","11.1"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","29","35","5","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tkmaki/recommended/313340/","tkmaki","t.k.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tkmaki/","20 products in account","Mountain is a semi-interactive screensaver masquerading as a game worth 99 cents.\n\nI say ‘semi’ interactive because while the game’s world—comprised of a single mountain dotted with trees, boulders, and random objects—can be spun around, examined from different angles, and viewed from the starlit vastness of space, I always felt distant from what little action I witnessed. The weather shifts from snowy to rainy to sunny whether you’re watching or not; random objects appear without any personal context (I received two trash bins, a bed, and a padlock, amongst others); and when Mountain expresses its thoughts, it does so with little to no awareness of my presence as a player.\n\nBut according to Mountain’s developer, David O’Reilly, this is sort of the point: “It's designed to run in the periphery of your life,” he writes in an August 2014 update. “You can play Mountain while playing other games. If you are not playing it, it will play itself.” In other words: You don’t really HAVE to play Mountain. Its contents are so inconsequential that it requires only a tiny fraction of your attention. It matters that little. But give me a dollar anyway! Thanks!\n\n(Ironic side note: For a game meant to run serenely “in the periphery of your life,” Mountain is a noticeable CPU hog that will likely overheat your computer, especially if you’re using a laptop.)\n\nThe only thing about Mountain that I found interesting or entertaining was how oddly bi-polar it was. In my hours of game play (or non-play), I began to notice that Mountain’s musings fell into distinct categories, ranging from Dalai Lama-esque mindfulness:\n\n“I see great purity in today’s utter perfection.”\n“I feel at one with the universe inside this foggy winter night.”\n“What is sadness?”\n\n…to a teenage girl’s volatile ‘feels’:\n\n“I’m super into this dreamy night.”\n“I couldn’t care less about today’s rain.”\n“Maybe I am alone because my rocks are ugly.”\n\n…to the nagging of a self-absorbed ex:\n\n“I’m a total babe.”\n“Helloooooo?”\n\nSorta cute, but ultimately, things most people will hear for free. While, you know, living their actual lives.\n\nAt the end of the day, Mountain falls in line with dozens of other titles lauded by some for pushing the boundaries of what a game can be and crucified by others for daring to call itself a game at all. I tend to side with the latter, though less harshly, as Mountain did serve as a pretty background time-waster for the few hours I played it. Mountain will definitely appeal to collectors of snow globes and people who like half-heartedly watching ennui-rich land masses against a faint ambient soundtrack. A niche market, for sure, but an “experience” some may enjoy.","January 4, 2015","false","3.1"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","30","40","0","0"

You zoom out and see the starts and galaxy and if you play the keys as you zoom you hear an echo which is a nice touch. After 30 mins or so I got a skull hit my mountain. That in itself made me want to play more just to see what else I could collect....O.O\n\nFor 99c this game is worth it as long as you are aware that you arn't really doing much besides relaxing and enjoying it.

"You are a god" - that's not. Well, if you are, you are a god that can do absolutely nothing. Mountain is not a game, as there's no way to play. You have a piano on the ASD... and ZXC... rows of the keyboard (hint to the developers: not everyone has a QWERTY-layout), and by playing, the mountain will rotate faster. That, and moving the camera around it with the mouse, is the only "control" you got in this "game. In a video, I saw someone bouncing a ball off the mountain. I didn't even get to do that.\n\nSo, why do I still recommend it? Simple: there's a lot of screensavers out there that cost more than 0.99€, but are of much lower quality.

The game makes an interesting point, being the mountain, you get no say or interaction in how the people progress. you just watch and observe the people as they grow in populace and in technology until their eventual demise, whether it be by destruction, or the graceful transition from existing, to ascending amongst the stars. either way, you, the mountain, remain, to watch the process happen again.\n\nthat would have been amazing. that would have made an ACTUAL statement.\n\nso, mountain is a dollar. why don't i recommend it? if you want pleasant sounds, go to http://www.rainymood.com/\n\nif you want a good idle-game, try cookie-clicker. the beta has a lot of updated mechanics and it's really turning into something amazing. also it's free.\n\nif you want a mountain... buy skyrim. it's a game, and debatably fun, plus you climb a mountain!\n\nif you want objects, try katamari damacy. it's also a game.\n\nsave your dollar.\n","December 8, 2014","false","5.5"," 41 of 67 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","41","67","2","0"

Though it's self running and normally events happen by random you can force him to tell you his thoughts (press "."). Or after pressing certain keycodes special events can be triggered (look the existing guides). Directly you can just spin your mountain view around and zoom in and out per mousewheel. Play spheric piano notes by pressing the keys from "A" to "K" and "Z" to ","\n\nHis thoughts are kind of philosophic/esoteric. Most amazing are the details in his "mountain life". By night (after 5 min) fireflies buzz around the trees, permanently clouds break at the peak and begin to rain, winter turns in (after 15 min), it begins to snow and wind is howling. The mountain does not only change his face during the playtime, even his underground breaks up and produces some earthquakes. In space there are threaten asteroids flying. And then comes the crazy part. Sometimes objects like a huge clock or an anvil crashes into your little planetoid and remain there. You'll become a collector of unforseen events.\n\nConsider you can only loose this game by not noticing its precious uniqueness ...","August 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 55 of 96 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","55","96","0","0"

You just have to play the games to understand. I have been going through depression and didn't know what to do with my life. But this game saved me. It saved me from everything. I had almost choked.

It cured my Grandpa's kidney stones. It cured my dad's smoking habits. It cured my Asian eye problem. It cured my sister's hearing problem. It cured my mom's cancer.

Never before have I seen such action, adventure, and carnage in one location. My concept of reality and how I view everyday life was completely altered by this game. My balls started filling up with acidic liquid which I quickly found pouring out of my eyelids, which proceeded to burn off, shrivel, and turn into mountains of their own. I started hallucinating and warped to a world where everyone, and everything, was a mountain. The people were mountains, the cities were mountains. I was a mountain, you were a mountain. And upon waking up, I realized I voided my bowels all over my desk chair. Luckily this game comes with a bendy straw, so I was able to drink it all up and proceed to play more mountain. I think the taste of my own excrement inspired creativity, as when I sat down again, I realized mountain comes with a beautiful implemented keytar, which I proceeded to learn to play, and make  my main profession in life. I dropped out of high school so I could devote more time to my beloved mountain. Boss fight after boss fight kept me engaged 24/7, and I had not a reason any more to leave my desk. I decided that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with this game, and made a blood pact with mountain to never leave him alona again, and always be with him. I began to talk to my mountain every night. He never said anything, however I know he understands how I truly feel. I slowly began to become one with my mountain. Whatever it felt, I felt. I had no need for anything else in my meaningless life. My mountain and I evolved to become exalted beings. And we are now constantly in stasis, waiting to be awakened by the deities of the mountain of the ten-fold path. I am happy. Happier than I ever have been. I cannot belive one dollar could enrich my life to this point.\n\nI say my last farewell to all that have lived on this earth.\n\nI am mountain.

Not only does the mountain show you the true meaning of life, but it made me believe in a higher power. I now pray to mountain every night, thanking it for everything life has ever given me. Mountain reminds me of myself in a way, we both are stuck in an infinite spiral of life. The mountain is hard, and so is the chub i get thinking of it when I'm away for more than a minute. Sometimes me and my friends will get together to compare mountains, Parkers mountain isnt as big as mine or Dan's, but what his mountain lacks in size it makes up for in Bush. The amount of shrub on the base of his mountain is so impressive, and when white stuff settles in it during winter.... I get jelous. I wish my mountain could make so much white stuff over night.\n\nAll in all, mountain is a Chub inducing, cave wettening beast, which starts soft, becomes rock hard, and takes your heart from behind. Pounding your feelings over and over till it releases its sweet load of atmospheric juices into your feel good center.

It penetrated my tightly knit landmass, and stayed there. The object was a fork. THis was my only friend, I never thought I would meet any friends in space. We laughed at eachother, but then we got in a small fight. I crate had landed on the other side of me, and the fork did not like him. I decided that they needed to get along. I pushed the fork from my dirt, and moved him to the crate. Whilst moving him, I hit the wrong melody key, and lost all strength in my meditation. The fork fell from my theoretical grasp, and into space. He floated for days until I could no longer see him.

You spin faster and seasons come and go in seconds. But what is the point? What meaning does time have to you? You're just an immortal lump of space rock, slowly acquiring meaningless knick-knacks.

It doesn’t have gameplay, story or even genre. You get to be a mountain, you can play the piano with your keyboard and some songs unlock events and Easter Eggs.\n\nAs time passes by, the seasons change, oh and you get hit by objects that get stuck within you. Not sure how many, but I've been hit by a plane, a paper plane, a beach ball, an umbrella, a giant skull and a lot of other random stuff.\n\nIt's not going to change the industry, but if most developers started thinking outside the box, like David O'Reilly did here, we could finally play something really new.

It doesn’t have all those preconceptions of what a game should be or have, it tried something totally new. When you read 'game' you usually think on graphics, gameplay, story and genre. But a game shouldn’t necessarily have those; games are ways of entertainment. There's no rule saying it should have good graphics, any story at all or even controls, as long as it entertains people. This game has no story, no controls, not genre. It's an experiment made to entertain without those, and I found it, personally, entertaining. It’s not going to change the industry, but if most developers started thinking outside the box, like David O'Reilly did here, we could finally play something really new.\n\nAs for those looking for gameplay, play the pianno (you can play a pianno with your keyboard in the game), something might happen.","August 31, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It was supershort, only 1 hour. (You can't imagine how I am tortured when getting other games installed.) And like a miracle after I click the "PLAY" button it only takes 4 secs for the game to start. So it must be a good choice for those whose PC or Internet environment is not so good.\nWhile the required space of Mountain is only 200MB+, it features tremendous in-game contents. And thanks to the awesome producer for not selling DLCs so we can enjoy all of it costing only 1 USD.\nIts grafics always make me bewildering (in a good sense). During the xx hours playing Mountain I never get bored and I will keep playing it until I reach my, let me say, sixties. Just watch some videos of Mountain, you can find those beautiful twinkle fireflies, mighty peaceful pine trees, howling freezing blizzard (actually there's no sound effect for the snow, just imagine it in your brain), etc.\nEverything is modified delicately to make this game so perfect. In my life so far, I've only got a similar feeling when watching a legendary Japanese artisan doing his works. This game is trying to lay out to gamers the beauty of nature and humanity.\nHowever, what attracts me most is that it has a in-game 16-tone virtual instrument. Easily hit your computer keyboard and you will have a real feeling of playing a real instrument. Personally I strongly recommend the game company release a VST version of this game so that gamers could produce music by simply applying it to their DAW/DTM.\nMountain randomly gives out background sounds, useful items and comments to the gamer, so it's also interesting to watch your mountain revolving while waiting your mountain to have some new changes.\nUntil now I haven't got this game cleared once. I have no idea about how to finish the game, either. But I'll let it go.\nI can still recall the game said in the first place "YOU ARE MOUNTAIN." Yes. I am mountain and I am this endless universe. I'll just keep on playing Mountain and playing as a mountain.

A game of true beauty. Let me say, that throughout all seventy-five of all my games, I have NEVER had the chance to become a mountain before. Ever since I was little, I have always wanted to become a professional mountain. But I never got the chance. My parents always told me "You will never become a mountain, and control the universe, your just a potato". WELL LOOK AT ME NOW WORLD! I have the power to grow trees and rocks, and I finally feel like a true mountain. This game is revoulutionary, and will truley break the bounds of the video game world! I feel like a new person after playing this game. So will you join me in this journey to become a true mountain?\n\nIn all seriousness, all this game is, is you get an all around view of a mountain that is growing and changes during seasons, at least from what i've seen. Also, for some reason, the mountain grows pies and chairs and umbrellas. So thats cool I guess. This game looks like it might actually have a lot of content though. For just a game with a mountain, it looks like there are still a lot of things to see and discover. I don't know. I bought it because, why not I guess. It looks interesting, and random. Plus, i'm going to get a ton of hours because I have no life.\n\nSo if your a person who doesn't like looking at mountains, this game is not recommended. I think for a dollar, this game is worth it. But thats just my opinion. I recommend you look at some of the other reviews. Peace Out!","August 18, 2014","true","62.9"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","29","52","0","0"

Honestly some of my most life changing moments were a result from me playing this game and having a realization.

While this is happening, weather changes, day and night cycles, and random objects crash into its surface. You can use the keyboard to craft/play songs, many of which unlock various weather and artifact features, thoughts, and so on.

Requiesta de Silencia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UncrownedPrince91/","242 products in account","Mountain is a neat little time-sink where you watch a chunk of rock slowly turn and grow while constantly making telltale games-style choices, like at what point the best time would be to blow it up.\n\nIn all seriousness, I don't get this game. I can appreciate a good art game like Dear Esther and Gone Home but at least there you had some level of agency. In this game you have gimmicks instead, such as raining frogs and raining hearts. I generated a new mountain several times and failed to see much of a difference between them.\n\nIt feels more like an artistic statement than an artistic game, and while I don't mind artistic statements I'm not sure I like being charged so that somebody else can make one. If I just wanted to stare at something moving and growing I have a really nice hourglass that I got as a gift (I mean REALLY nice!) and I feel like I'd get just as much enjoyment watching that. In fact I just confirmed it. It moves at more than 20 frames per second, has better sound effects, and if a celestial body comes crashing down it won't look like someone attached a translucent red glass texture to a very low polygon sphere.\n\nSo I can't recommend this artistic statement. It has some charm but that alone isn't enough. If you want to see my first impressions of this game, check out my video below. I do indie game first impressions every so often.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2jcSsICMTY","December 12, 2014","false","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It. Is. Simply. Amazing. Mountain has become an inspiring way to leave my computer open all night when a virus scan is running, and to wake up in the morning to see all sorts of new junk cluttering up my precious. When I can't connect to the internet and no other game will return the love that I want to gain from my free time, Mountain has been there, offering a safe hand to guide me though all trauma. I can't stress enough how great of a purchase this game was, and what it does to destress me. Seeing how you don't really do anything, you don't need to worry about meeting an objective, facing a threat, or really doing anything. Mountain... is simply a wonderful piece of work. With the full integrity of my heart, I endorse this game, and recomment anyone who can throw the $0.99 at it to do so.\n\n-10/25/14.\nRecently, I added another 30 hours of total playtime of Mountain. I remain 100% behind this review. Mountain remains an effective tool in my daily procrastination schedule, and provides me with hours of entertainment as an interactive background or screensaver while I work on other stuff. Really, buy this game. Buy it now, and enjoy it forever. Mountain can never turn its back to you; it has no back. The core fundamentals of this game should be made into a glorious religion to which we worship our wondrous Mountains. Disregard the hateful reviews, and listen to me; it is worth it. It is worth it. It is WORTH IT. Do I need to keep repeating that? Maybe; so, IT IS WORTH IT, AND STILL WORTH IT EVEN AFTER 90 HOURS OF MY LIFE.

You are god.\nMountain is a strange product on Steam. Note I said the word "product", not "game.\nThis product is not a game. "Mountain" is an experience.\n\nFor the very low price of $1.09, I highly recommend you purchase it.\nMountain is not a game where you actively participate, instead you keep it running in the background, or perhaps as a fancy wallpaper. There are 2 ways you can interact with your Mountain.\nYou can:\nA) Spin in around in circles.\nB) Use your keyboard as a piano. There are many guides on how to make your own music.\n\nAs you run Mountain in your background, occasionally switching back to the Mountain window to inspect any changes, you will notice trinkets that have crashed into your mountain, such as a plane, or perhaps a ball.\n\nHowever, if you don't give your mountain enough attention, such as occasionally playing a few random notes, or spinning your mountain, you will notice the trinkets you amassed over the hours begin to disappear off your island, as mysteriously and quickly as they arrived.\nThe next "obstacle" you may come across is a "meteorite" hurtling across the vast emptiness of space, directly at your mountain. There are 2 possible outcomes: You play a jumble of random notes and evade the impending doom, or accept your fate and watch on in horror as your mountain is obliterated into nothingness.\n\nPros of Mountain:\nRelaxing Atmosphere\nNo skill required\nFancy Wallpaper\nAmass a collection of trinkets for hoarders all over the Earth\nCasual "Gaming"\nInteresting experience\n\nCons:\nNo music (You must create your own)\nVery limited action (The only action is the "meteorite" that comes once in a blue moon)\nWill become old VERY fast\n\nIn conclusion, Mountain is a great product on Steam, and if you are looking for something new and different, look no further then Mountain. Observe your mountain change and amass a collection of trinkets.\n6/10\n\nEnjoy my review?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-rep/recommended/313340/","-rep","Silverr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-rep/","221 products in account","A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.\n\nHigh elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystem of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation, such as mountain climbing.\n\nThe highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia, whose summit is 8,849.868 m (29,035 ft) above mean sea level. The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m (69,459 ft).\nDefinition\nThe Matterhorn, Swiss Alps\nDôme du Goûter\n\nThere is no universally accepted definition of a mountain. Elevation, volume, relief, steepness, spacing and continuity have been used as criteria for defining a mountain. In the Oxford English Dictionary a mountain is defined as "a natural elevation of the earth surface rising more or less abruptly from the surrounding level and attaining an altitude which, relatively to the adjacent elevation, is impressive or notable."\n\nWhether a landform is called a mountain may depend on local usage. The highest point in San Francisco, California, is called Mount Davidson, notwithstanding its height of 300 m (980 ft), which makes it twenty feet short of the minimum for a mountain by American designations.[citation needed] Similarly, Mount Scott outside Lawton, Oklahoma is only 251 m (823 ft) from its base to its highest point. Whittow's Dictionary of Physical Geography states "Some authorities regard eminences above 600 m (2,000 ft) as mountains, those below being referred to as hills."\n\nIn the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, a mountain is usually defined as any summit at least 2,000 feet (or 610 metres) high, whilst the official United Kingdom government's definition of a mountain, for the purposes of access, is a summit of 600 metres or higher. In addition, some definitions also include a topographical prominence requirement, typically 100 or 500 feet (30 or 152 m). For a while, the US defined a mountain as being 1,000 feet (300 m) or taller. Any similar landform lower than this height was considered a hill. However, today, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) concludes that these terms do not have technical definitions in the US.\n\nThe UN Environmental Programme's definition of "mountainous environment" includes any of the following:\n\nElevation of at least 2,500 m (8,200 ft);\nElevation of at least 1,500 m (4,900 ft), with a slope greater than 2 degrees;\nElevation of at least 1,000 m (3,300 ft), with a slope greater than 5 degrees;\nElevation of at least 300 m (980 ft), with a 300 m (980 ft) elevation range within 7 km (4.3 mi).\n\nUsing these definitions, mountains cover 33% of Eurasia, 19% of South America, 24% of North America, and 14% of Africa. As a whole, 24% of the Earth's land mass is mountainous.\nGeology\nMain articles: Mountain formation and List of mountain types\nJeff Davis Peak seen from the glacier-carved summit of Wheeler Peak, Nevada\n\nThere are three main types of mountains: volcanic, fold, and block. All three types are formed from plate tectonics: when portions of the Earth's crust move, crumple, and dive. Compressional forces, isostatic uplift and intrusion of igneous matter forces surface rock upward, creating a landform higher than the surrounding features. The height of the feature makes it either a hill or, if higher and steeper, a mountain. Major mountains tend to occur in long linear arcs, indicating tectonic plate boundaries and activity.\nVolcanoes\nMain article: Volcano\nGeological cross-section of Fuji volcano\n\nVolcanoes are formed when a plate is pushed below another plate, or at a mid-ocean ridge or hotspot. At a depth of around 100 km, melting occurs in rock above the slab (due to the addition of water), and forms magma that reaches the surface. When the magma reaches the surface, it often builds a volcanic mountain, such as a shield volcano or a stratovolcano. Examples of volcanoes include Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. The magma does not have to reach the surface in order to create a mountain: magma that solidifies below ground can still form dome mountains, such as Navajo Mountain in the United States.\nFold mountains\nMain article: Fold mountains\n\nFold mountains occur when two plates collide: shortening occurs along thrust faults and the crust is overthickened. Since the less dense continental crust "floats" on the denser mantle rocks beneath, the weight of any crustal material forced upward to form hills, plateaus or mountains must be balanced by the buoyancy force of a much greater volume forced downward into the mantle. Thus the continental crust is normally much thicker under mountains, compared to lower lying areas. Rock can fold either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The upfolds are anticlines and the downfolds are synclines: in asymmetric folding there may also be recumbent and overturned folds. The Jura Mountains are an example of fold mountains.\nBlock mountains\nMain article: Block mountains\nThe Catskills are a dissected plateau.\n\nBlock mountains are caused by faults in the crust: a seam where rocks can move past each other. When rocks on one side of a fault rise relative to the other, it can form a mountain. The uplifted blocks are block mountains or horsts. The intervening dropped blocks are termed graben: these can be small or form extensive rift valley systems. This form of landscape can be seen in East Africa, the Vosges, the Basin and Range province of Western North America and the Rhine valley. These areas often occur when the regional stress is extensional and the crust is thinned.\nErosion\nMain article: Erosion\n\nDuring and following uplift, mountains are subjected to the agents of erosion (water, wind, ice and gravity) which gradually wear the uplifted area down. Erosion causes the surface of mountains to be younger than the rocks that form the mountains themselves. Glacial processes produce characteristic landforms, such as pyramidal peaks, knife-edge arêtes, and bowl-shaped cirques that can contain lakes. Plateau mountains, such as the Catskills, are formed from the erosion of an uplifted plateau.\nClimate\nMain article: Alpine climate\nA mountain in Carbon County, Utah\nThe Rockies - Valley of the Ten Peaks\n\nClimate on mountains become colder at high elevations, due to the way that the sun heats the surface of the Earth. The sun warms the ground directly, while the greenhouse effect acts as a blanket, reflecting heat back towards the Earth that would otherwise be lost to space. The greenhouse effect thus keeps the air at low elevations warm. As elevation increases, there is less greenhouse effect, so the ambient temperature goes down.\n","August 24, 2014","true","5.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

A game is a form of play or sport, usually competitive, involving rules that is decided by skill, strength, or luck. Mountain involves none of these things. This should not detract from what it is and not everything developed with tools often used to make games needs to be a game.\n\nThat aside, here is what you can expect from Mountain:\n\nWhen you launch it, you are asked to draw a few things on the screen with your mouse, to generate a random seed with which your mountain will be generated. After that, you will watch your mountain (a hunk of earth floating in outer space) spin slowly around. Sometimes the weather will change and foliage will change. Sometimes, an item will land on the mountain, like a ball, lollipop, jet engine, ladies shoes, or umbrella. Every so often, the mountain will say something to you, like "I feel at one with the universe, tonight".\n\nAfter a bunch of hours, something happens. I don't know what it is, because I fell asleep. When it hit about the 20th hour, it started making a ton of noise and went to a "game over" screen.\n\nEssentially, Mountain is what used to be considered a demo. A little program that someone would have distributed on a floppy disk for free -- or maybe sold for fifty cents at the local nicotine-filled hacker-computer-shop that we haven't seen much of since the mid 90s. It doesn't really do anything; you don't either. You just look at it until it stops. You can make the screen small and stick it in the corner of your screen, if you like.\n\nSo, would I recommend it? I wouldn't say it is garbage, by any means. If it seems like something you might be interested in and you buy it with the understanding that there's no game involved and you wont' be doing anything, then it is hard to complain about it costing a dollar -- which is absolutely the right price for this tiny curiosity. Therefore, with those reservations, I'd give this a recommendation.","August 21, 2014","true","21.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","3"

Experiencing the weather, the atmospheric pressure, the random items falling on me and getting stuck in my earthy complexion... it's just all so great. I just adore the structure of the game and the simplicity of it. There's so much you can do yet it's all so easy to get around! I love the feeling when it's raining and the clouds rushing through my grassy top. It just makes you feel so free as you're rotating on your very own axis. The scenery is breathtaking. I just love the random objects that fall and make their home on my mountainside. I feel like we're all a family and we get closer every day. The occasional rainbows are very intriguing and awesome to witness. I love the warm and fuzzy feeling I get in my soil after it rains and the sun comes out, it's just such a unique feeling. The snow brings many challenges but it's also very beautiful. When it's snowing, I have trouble breathing, on account of the snow covering every inch of me. But after... when the sun comes back out and greets me... I just get this rush of an icy-hot sensation as the snow melts. I feel rejuvenated! I feel fresh and clean. Overall, this game is the best I've experienced in my entire 8 years of being on Steam.","September 7, 2014","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The beginning of the game made me think of three simple things about life that were more complex than I had ever noticed. The deep thought process along with a blank page gave me an open mind ready to take in something. That something was the meaning of three simple words and then i expressed them with art onto my blank canvas. Afterwards my mountain erupted from seemingly... nothing. It was just there. It was all mine to control, not with controls, but with reason. I felt as if the blank pages that i had spread my deep thoughts on had emerged into something greater. Something self-sufficient. Something that knew where it was headed in the future. Trees began growing. Wind began blowing. Precipitation began falling from the universe around me. At first I was not sure, but now i know..

The beginning of the game made me think of three simple things about life that were more complex than I had ever noticed. The deep thought process along with a blank page gave me an open mind ready to take in something. That something was the meaning of three simple words and then i expressed them with art onto my blank canvas. Afterwards my mountain erupted from seemingly... nothing. It was just there. It was all mine to control, not with controls, but with reason. I felt as if the blank pages that i had spread my deep thoughts on had emerged into something greater. Something self-sufficient. Something that knew where it was headed in the future. Trees began growing. Wind began blowing. Precipitation began falling from the universe around me. At first I was not sure, but now i know.. This mountain is my life, my heart, my soul. It is me taking a journey through the world alone.. just waiting for the next time i experience something greater.

"Oh no, there's a pickaxe in my Icecream-cone!" "My mountain seems to use his teeth to play the violin", "Seems like there's a fan stuck between my brains", "Oh my god, a HUUUUGE telephone crushed my meteor-forest" or "Hit me gramophone! Hit me, please - Nooo! Come back, gramophone, come baaack!".\n\nAlso, after you spent some time with your mountain, you really feel connected to it. I named mine Bjørg (which is somewhat similar to the german "Berg", which means "mountain") and I already created a [OMGIJUSTGOTHITBYAGIANTLIGHTBULBTHISISTHEBESTDAYOFMYLIFE] folder to document my best moments with Bjørg. So far there is "Bjørgplayinginthesnow.png" and "Bjørdsmilinglikeanangel.png" in there.\n\nThe only thing I'm sorta missing would be a Multimountainmode, where you can come over to a friends mountain and let your mountain talk to your friends mountain for a while. You know, them kids have to learn from others of their kind. Maybe they'll fall in love, crush into each other and become a mothermountain with two tops which are eventually going to draw smaller mountains into their orbit which have some similar genes and what not. You know, the full potential of this just hasn't been reached yet.\n\nI highly recommend playing this game with some friends, you're gonna fun the hell out of it (for reals, a bunch of people in a skype-call, all playing this game for several hours is something that happened last night).","November 25, 2014","true","33.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Packed full of great things, I highly recommend this game.","December 26, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

(which I guess is just a simple summed up version of the description, but still)\n\nPlus it is cheap, so why not get it? It has a pleasent art style and is very relaxing to watch what happens to your somehow-though-noone-knows-why floating mountain as it collects the randomness our world has to offer it.\n\nI recommend this game because it is relaxing and enjoyable.

It is (like I have read in many reviews on this game posted before I posted my review about Mountain; so I cite everyone who has said this) a screensaver in a sense. You don't need to touch it. Stuff just happens. That mind as well be the description.\n\n"You don't need to touch it or do anything. Stuff just happens." (which I guess is just a simple summed up version of the description, but still)\n\nPlus it is cheap, so why not get it? It has a pleasent art style and is very relaxing to watch what happens to your somehow-though-noone-knows-why floating mountain as it collects the randomness our world has to offer it.\n\nI recommend this game because it is relaxing and enjoyable.

GONE HOME or Always Sometimes Monsters would have been a hell of a lot more engaging if they had more gameplay and stopped huffing their own farts from a paper bag but this is game puts them all to shame on the pretenti-ometer. Its just a ♥♥♥♥ing screensaver. Thats it. It's got a somewhat nice digital piano but at the end of the day is a just a ♥♥♥♥ing screensaver. The games I listed above are hardly games, they have no challenge, no real fail state, and no gameplay really to note. At least with those games you can call them a walking simulator but with this there's nothing to say other than why? Of course as is standard with pointless indie dreck the devs are practically shooting their own farts into their veins in a seedy backally like it was discount heroin. Don't give me the duality of existance crap I took a first year philosophy class in community college too and I can smell the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You didn't make a game you ♥♥♥♥ out a screensaver and wasted everyones time and money, for ♥♥♥♥s sake you can make whatever you want but this is just idiotic. And the worst part? It's not even a well designed screensaver! I noticed my rig was getting pretty warm when I messed around with it and I have a fairly well made system with adequate cooling, I hate to think what would happen to people with lower end rigs. Overall you have a waste of time and money run but pretentious devs that was given the most sumptous review ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this side of depressionnotagameitsjust♥♥♥♥inghyperlinksquest.

The graphics are amazing. The gameplay is next to none, it's deep and enriching and makes you want to come back for more every day. This, along with the sound design, which is top class, puts you into the world and your are instanly immersed in the lore and background of Mountain.\nThis brings us to the story of Mountain. The writing team should be given countless awards for this masterpiece. You will cry, laugh, and jump for joy along the ride. Your drawings at the begining of the game may seem odd at first but they dramaticaly effect the gameplay as a whole and I was very impressed in seeing that unfold throughout the story I forged. Its less of a game more of an experience.\nAnd story is beautiful paired with the greatest voice acting I've ever seen, or heard, in a game. I expect the voice acting budget was giant and the game lives up the hype. I really enjoyed the hint of a sequel at the end of the game. I hope we can see Mountain II, and jump back into this amazing world. Once again, a perfect 12/10. We may be looking at the next Elder Scrolls. I cant wait to jump into this newfound series for many years to come.\n\n-Michael "The Noice Master" Rosen, reviewer, childrens poet, prophet of the new faith.","April 28, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Never has a connection been so parallel and perpendicular at the same time. That doesn't really make much sense, but neither does Mountain.

Or should I let it accumulate with trash? Will there be real consequences of what I draw in the openning screen?  Was that baseball there 5 minutes ago? In 'Mountain'There's a persistent sense of "I wonder if something is about to happen..." Occasionally it does. In Mountain, you don't play. You expect, you question, you get hopeful, you get disapointed, you get inspired, but most importantly you think. The creator of Mountain specified that this game is best left running for you to occasionally check in on. I left mountain running for 6 hours while I did work. Every so often, I would hear the chyme indicating my Mountain was about to express its pure existential thoughts. What's the point of that thought? Why would a mountain care about the sunrise? Maybe it's not about that, maybe it's a statement. Maybe it's demonstrating the joy of pure life. Maybe not though, maybe it's touching on the cynicisms of life and time?\n\nArt is what makes people think. This interactive piece of art will let you poke at it all day and you'll never be satisfied with any conclusions you may create regarding its purpose. You will keep poking, keep wondering. I managed to get a dwarf planet to destroy my mountain - I was killed and the game offered me a 'retry.' Does this imply I failed a goal? What is my goal? Who IS Mountain? I may never find an answer, but I don't think I'll stop asking any time soon.\n\n"I don't really know what I am, is that weird?" Said Mountain just as I typed the last sentence. Don't worry, Mountain, I'm doing my best to find out.\n\nIf you've ever read the Catcher in the Rye, you know that someone's entire story and entire personality can be revealed through the way they observe the world around them. Not in their actions, necessarily, but the way they think. That's mountain. Don't buy for gameplay, you won't find it. Buy it to experience something new, to think, and to ask questions.","December 7, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Have you ever wanted to be God? Well, this game lets you be both, and it certainly informs you of that fact in its opening lines. "You are mountain. You are God." After only 5 hours staring at this virtual cone, I've already developed an inexplicable attraction to it. Its rambling, yet deep thoughts only lend to its personality, and bolster my affection for it. The items we have accumulated are a testament to the trials and tribulations we have been through. The duets we have played are a requiem of our love, and make time seem ethereal. The only issue I have with it is that I think its only engaging in this relationship to take my cpu away from me. Let me tell you, this game eats up more RAM than Minecraft with the munchies. Nonetheless, I will always love my mountain, and I recommend this game, no, experience, to anybody who is a fan of deeply thought provoking games, or any one who is going through a confusing, and questioning time in their life. Or I guess you'd like this game if you're a fan of mountain simulators. 19/21.","December 7, 2014","true","59.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Mountain, you draw a couple of things that it asks you to draw, and it supposedly forms a mountain based on it. I do not know how this affects the mountain's generation, but it is there. You can play music notes to speed up time, or make special things happen such as rain blood, or even rain frogs. This does not exactly add to the game's fun, but it is neat to watch. Music also speeds up time, to get out of storms and whatnot. However, "Mountain" is CPU intensive to the point where I could not run any other games with it up. There is nothing to do BUT look at the mountain after all is said and done, and the thoughts it gives are from what I assume a madlib system where it takes a base and adds adjectives. "I FEEL WONDERFUL ON THIS FIERY MORNING."\n\nDo I think this game should be $0.99? Not at all. You will play it for a few minutes, then forget about it as it does not entice you to look at it at all. I wish I had not spent the money on it, but I did it because you can be a mountain that floats through space while it is bombarded occaisionally by giant items that stick into it. The clouds also seem to pass right through the mountain as if it were not even there. Take from this what you will, but it is as it is advertised.","September 9, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simply put, it is a game that serves as a place for meditation and self-reflection. You can think of it as a substitute for that one place in your childhood that you always felt safe in.\n\nNot only is "Mountain" a game of self-reflection, it is a well thought out idea that, in my opinion, promotes setting time aside and devoting it to peaceful silence.\n\nMountain is quite possibly one of the best VR games I have ever stumbled upon. You can rest assured it is capable of being the most life changing game you will ever play.\n\nJust know, this game is not meant for those looking to play a game -- it is meant for those looking for a truly life changing experience.","April 23, 2015","true","61.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Or should I let it accumulate with trash? Will there be real consequences of what I draw in the openning screen?  Was that baseball there 5 minutes ago? In 'Mountain'There's a persistent sense of "I wonder if something is about to happen..." Occasionally it does. In Mountain, you don't play. You expect, you question, you get hopeful, you get disapointed, you get inspired, but most importantly you think. The creator of Mountain specified that this game is best left running for you to occasionally check in on. I left mountain running for 6 hours while I did work. Every so often, I would hear the chyme indicating my Mountain was about to express its pure existential thoughts. What's the point of that thought? Why would a mountain care about the sunrise? Maybe it's not about that, maybe it's a statement. Maybe it's demonstrating the joy of pure life. Maybe not though, maybe it's touching on the cynicisms of life and time?\n\nArt is what makes people think. This interactive piece of art will let you poke at it all day and you'll never be satisfied with any conclusions you may create regarding its purpose. You will keep poking, keep wondering. I managed to get a dwarf planet to destroy my mountain - I was killed and the game offered me a 'retry.' Does this imply I failed a goal? What is my goal? Who IS Mountain? I may never find an answer, but I don't think I'll stop asking any time soon.\n\n"I don't really know what I am, is that weird?" Said Mountain just as I typed the last sentence. Don't worry, Mountain, I'm doing my best to find out.\n\nIf you've ever read the Catcher in the Rye, you know that someone's entire story and entire personality can be revealed through the way they observe the world around them. Not in their actions, necessarily, but the way they think. That's mountain. Don't buy for gameplay, you won't find it.

Have you ever wanted to be God? Well, this game lets you be both, and it certainly informs you of that fact in its opening lines. "You are mountain. You are God." After only 5 hours staring at this virtual cone, I've already developed an inexplicable attraction to it. Its rambling, yet deep thoughts only lend to its personality, and bolster my affection for it. The items we have accumulated are a testament to the trials and tribulations we have been through. The duets we have played are a requiem of our love, and make time seem ethereal. The only issue I have with it is that I think its only engaging in this relationship to take my cpu away from me. Let me tell you, this game eats up more RAM than Minecraft with the munchies. Nonetheless, I will always love my mountain, and I recommend this game, no, experience, to anybody who is a fan of deeply thought provoking games, or any one who is going through a confusing, and questioning time in their life.

Personnally I really liked this. It is basically a screen saver, except it feels alive.\n\nI started to feel attached to the mountain I had made, I even found out a way to remove junk from my mountain by throwing it off, or by playing a melody. I was devastated when I played the melody from Close Encounters. My mountain was destroyed by the eye of blindness, it was sad. I ocasionally I leave this running in the background just to see if anything will happen. Its not a game, but its not really anything else other than a game. Just like making Bonsai trees isn't really like being a full-on gardener, but it basically is.\n\nWorth the $1? I don't know, you decide. It's not hard to figure out if you will hate this or appreciate this. I was glad I got it. If it's a game, then it is a really ammusing cheap take on what games are and how we play them (like Little Inferno). If it's a screen saver, then it is a really good interactive screen saver that has way more depth, beauty, and humor than any screensaver I have ever used.\n\nI will give it a thumbs up but you don't have to, and thats okay, just don't buy ignorantly and then complain. It is what it is and you are not forced to buy it. Just ask the mountain what he thinks of himself, he will tell you, and in a very contemplative way too.","August 26, 2014","true","67.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This celestial screensaver has connected with me on deeper levels than other video game character, and possibly even another human, has ever done before. When the mountain was bored, I was bored. Never has a connection been so parallel and perpendicular at the same time. That doesn't really make much sense, but neither does Mountain.

Well i think that it is well worth the 99 cent price due to it being a really interesting experience. When i have it running i tend to sit listening to some music or just listen to the peacefullness of the mountain. It looks very nice and has alot of very interesting cheat codes that you can use to create great effects. My only issue with this game is that it surprisingly has some FPS issues on lower end Pcs which surprised me. My desktop with a 280x easily gets 60 FPS on this but my Lenovo Y40 only gets 23-30 fps on medium. If they can optimize this better and release on mobile it would be great.

The game is widely known as a so-called "Mountain Simulator," but it is so much more. I remember the day like it was yesterday, my wife had left me and I had nothing but a dollar, a laptop, and my Steam account. I drank so much back then, shot after shot, it did nothing. While drunk, I pulled out my phone and bought this game which is called Mountain. Once sober, I opened my computer to see that I used my last dollar to buy a stupid game. I was ashamed, this led to more drinking. It eventually led to more than the hard liquor. I stole Cocaine, Valium, and Vicodin. I was addicted. I didn't know what to do. I finally opened Mountain after a long line of Coke. Then it hit me. The game was speaking to me. Not literally, but almost telepathically. After a couple of weeks, I sobered up nicely, got a job, and finally lived in a place that I could call home. I owe everything to Mountain.

Don't expect a huge fun game when buying this. It is a screensaver. A lot of people complain that you aren't actually "God". But you are. "God" gets to sit and watch us mess up the world, without being able to do anything about it. And that is exactly what happens in this game. You watch the mountain grow/be destroyed, and you cannot do a damn thing. I love it. I run it in the background while I work because the nature sounds are nice and enjoyable, and I like to tab to it to check on my mountain. I also keep it on while I sleep, so that I can look at it if I wake up, and it will slowly relax me and I can fall asleep. I love this screensaver "game" and I feel like people like me will enjoy it too. It's cute and calming. It's also good for panic attacks.

Once you feel that everything is great, you get things falling from space, a record player, a cup of coffee, a rock, you start to get addicted, trying to collect as many gadgets as possible. Then you start to wonder, why are you just a mountain? Where is the rest of your plantet? Why are there so many houshold items floating around in an unescapable abyss? Is this a sign of what is to come? Then you realize that it's up to you to rebuild the beutiful plantet that was once your home.

The Mountain is a peaceful, thought provoking, philosophical, possible even simulator of what our world is to us and how it is we overcome obstacles, or how we utterly fail and cause our own misfortune and demise.\n\nI may have not owned this game of sorts for many, many hours, but I've already experienced more than I ever would playing a couple hundred ours of any popular game on Steam, and then some. If you're looking for the type of game that provokes you to rethink your view on how the world truly works, I would invite you to come follow in the footsteps of those who bought this game and enjoy it's joyful, yet somewhat melancholy state of euphoria.\n\nIt's worth the price, I promise you.","August 17, 2015","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is widely known as a so-called "Mountain Simulator," but it is so much more. I remember the day like it was yesterday, my wife had left me and I had nothing but a dollar, a laptop, and my Steam account. I drank so much back then, shot after shot, it did nothing. While drunk, I pulled out my phone and bought this game which is called Mountain. Once sober, I opened my computer to see that I used my last dollar to buy a stupid game. I was ashamed, this led to more drinking. It eventually led to more than the hard liquor. I stole Cocaine, Valium, and Vicodin. I was addicted. I didn't know what to do. I finally opened Mountain after a long line of Coke. Then it hit me. The game was speaking to me. Not literally, but almost telepathically. After a couple of weeks, I sobered up nicely, got a job, and finally lived in a place that I could call home. I owe everything to Mountain.

However, being bored of mountain is ok, because sometimes mountain gets bored, of  you .\n\nPros\n- Relaxing\n- Majestic\n- Beautiful\n- Imaginative\n\nCons\n- You dont actually get to be a mountain\n- clouds clip through the mountain\n\nIf you want to try something new, pick this up, it is only a dollar, you cant really go wrong.\n\n#BeTheMountain2017\n","July 6, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
