There's no way to figure out or set controls, therefore I have no idea how to use grenades. There are only like two enemies I have encountered and you can only blow their heads off to which, for whatever reason, a ram's jaw bone falls down with a splatter of blood in the same animation for each enemy killed. It's pretty boring, but it was bought for me so I'm glad I didn't pay for it.","August 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","20","22","0","1"

Can't say I won't play it again though. Wasn't bad, but felt limited. Thing Thing comparisons are pretty accurate, which I found out later and now feel less favorable to this title. Also, you get the rocket launcher, you're a god, removing much of the strategy that existed prior to unleashing that beast in the arsenal.\n\nAppreciate the hand drawn artwork, really dig the music/score, ideas are good but purchasing/equipping could use with one less click of the keyboard, and I gotta say I'd probably like it more if it were a twin stick shooter than mouse and keyboard. Wouldn't mind bigger levels (these three are just too enclosed), and wouldn't mind on-line co-op or arena-style matches in the future.\n\nOnly thing I can say (and didn't notice when recording the above video) is the main character looks like he's just short of holding a watermelon with how close to early racist drawing or statues I've seen in antique shops, though it's probably more an accident than anything.\n\nSide note: Achievements don't seem to want to unlock at the time of posting this review.","August 18, 2015","false","1.4"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","24","36","2","0"

The game progresses so fast that there is no point in buying any weapon but the strongest (which you get fairly quick). The graphics are nice, but quickly become bland and boring. There are 4 enemy types, each with different 'abilities', and different damage required to kill (Unless the saw gun, everything is 1 shot kill). The main issue I had with this game is how it lags, each enemy produces a blood splat when killed (up to the demon enemy, which is lots of blood and an explosion), the problem with this is, if you kill too many enemies in succession (which it rapidly spawns) in a small area, the game laggs up and becomes unplayable.\n\nAll in all it's not bad for a flash game, where it should be, but by far from being a good one. Save your money and play a flash game instead, it will probably keep you occupied for longer.","August 30, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

There are 4 types of enemies, 7 weapons and 5 levels. There are no options other than mute or unmute sound. The game plays exactly the same as the Madness and Thing Thing series of flash games, but is less polished and has less depth. Rather than playing this game, you'd be better off playing one of those games.\n\nYou can do all the achievements in about 10 minutes though if you just buy the Rocket Launcher ASAP.","December 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That was easy.\nI got this game for free but for only $2 I definitely recommend you get it. This game has nice hand drawn graphics, good sound effects, nice music. Only a handfull of levels though, and only about 5 different guns. It's really easy to just use your basic pistol and save up for the overpowered rocket launcher and then it becomes super easy.\nFor about half an hour of fun I think it's worth getting. It is pretty easy though.","September 19, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"
