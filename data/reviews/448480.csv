There is some depth to the mechanics, but mostly what you'll be doing is applying markups, and watching for things like bandits attacks, (a countdown timer until you lose that you have to sink money into your defenses to avaid) and adjusting your merchant to auto-buy and auto-sell more expensive common commodities as your finances allow.\n\nWould be great for it to have more replayability, but at this price it's worth it if it entertains you for a few hours.","March 10","true","1.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

Buy the lowest priced items and sell them back for higher than market value. The games adds a few extra features to keep players on thier toes with multi-tasking, but the game itself is not very difficult.\n\nGameplayAs time goes on, so does the caravan - a group of camels with thier owners, going through the desert. These camels carry varying goods from, leaves to gold, thread to bananas, and a whole bunch of other items that have varying prices. Your job is to identify these items and remember thier market value as well as selling value. In the game, the amount you sell the items can be quite above market value and still be sold, your job, is to balance your profit with the time it will take that item to sell. Later in the game you will be able to have a merchant to buy and sell for you, youll have to pay off bandits, buy certain items to build reputation, be able to take a loan out, be able to use other shops to "transform" your item into a higher value one,  and will be able to speed up the entire process. Each of the games, 10 levels, has an objective, which is either to: collect X amount of gold or get X amount of reputation. As you can complete levels you unlock more and more levels with, "fame points", which is just a number on top of the screen. Completing the game usually takes around an hour or so to complete, and there is no real rewards for re-completing passed levels. So let us organize the benefits and deficits of the game into the common pro and cons chart.\n\nPros:\n+Unique idea\n+Amazing artwork\n+Fitting soundtrack\n+"Slow mode" for children\n+Cheap price\n\nCons:\n-Needs more levels\n-More content would step the game up\n\nOverallThe game is an amazing idea. A unique idea, resource management meets arcade. The game is easy to pick up and understand, caravan gets faster with level progression, has amazing artwork, a slow mode for children, and an amazingly cheap price. However, the game fails to deliver replayability, after an hour or two of the game, you basically see all the game has to offer. If this game gets more levels, and maybe more multi-tasking features, it could easily be a very successful product. As it stands, an amazing game for the price, but not alot of the great content.\n\nRecommended 7/10\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","April 26","true","5.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The margins are so high that there is basically nothing challenging about this game, even the added bonus mechanics of automatic trader and completely non-sensical transformation chains can't help this.","April 24","false","1.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Each caravan sets prices differently for their items and your job is to buy and resell whatever you see fit to turn a profit. There are 10 short levels, about half of which are an introduction to the mechanics.\n\nThese mechanics are, for example, a transformation of items (from a cheapter one to an expensive one), factions and loans, bandits attacking your fort from time to time, etc. Nothing too complicated.\nIf the game wasn't as loose, though, each of these may have provided quite an additional challenge (in a good way).\n\nI found out I'm quite conservative -- the first half of the game, I was selling things very close to the price that I bought them by, trying to observe everyone's price on a certain item, etc. etc. It took me quite a bit to finish the levels. Once I decided to risk it, though, I managed to beat the last levels in maybe a minute... which is not a good sign for game.\n\nBig spoilers ahead -- may be enough to make you avoid the game entirely.\n\nThe problem is, as I've mentioned, how loose the game is. You don't really need to pay attention to prices, as the game suggests. Instead, buy everything and sell it at a 150% price, for example. Higher may work as well, I wasn't very precise in my playing -- did not much time to be, either.\nSo, at this point, I start buying the most expensive stuff -- instead of buying items that cost 20-50, I buy things that cost 100-500 and get a high profit very quickly.\nOnce you figure that out, all of the tension and planning is gone. You don't have to take all of these other mechanics into account, which is unfortunate. It all becomes very simples and rather boring as a result.\n\nSo, another thing is how short the game is: 1 hour is what it took me, with a very slow first half.\n10 levels isn't enough to explore the mechanics. And the game doesn't really exploit most of its option: even if the game is very easy to "cheat", multiplayer would get everyone on the same level, which may open the doors to some more interesting gameplay. Everyone will start out with the same easy exploits -- figure out a way to beat them!\n\n\nSo yeah. The idea may be cool, but it's way too crude, as is. The framework is there, but there needs to be a lot more work put into making it an actually good game.","May 29","false","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

The concept is easy to understand.  It's an arcade game, but you don't really need fast reflexes to play.  The main thing being tested here is memory, since you need to keep track of how much each item sells for.\n\nIt's a nice little time-waster - it's not earth-shattering, but it's fun.  The current price ($2.99) seems fair to me.\n\nI would like to see achievements added, because I feel they would add more replayability.","March 20","true","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not an hours-long thriller, but a nice way to spend a few minutes.  The one drawback is the music; it's kind of jangly and grates on the ears after a little while.\n\nStill, fun and addicting.","June 4","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
