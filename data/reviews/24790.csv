See Conclusion\nNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:\nCommand & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath Review\nCommand & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight\n\nINTRODUCTION:Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a real-time strategy game that was developed and published by Electronic Arts mostly due to the acquisition of Westwood Studios by EA and Westwood's closure back in 2003. This game continues the Tiberian Sun story arc and is a direct sequel to Tiberian Sun & its expansion Tiberian Sun: Firestorm.\n\nFollowing the franchise tradition, this title follows the story of the almost never ending conflict between the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and an international paramilitary / militant religious organization called the Brotherhood of Nod. Unlike its predecessors however, this game introduces a new faction in an effort by EA to add more gameplay diversity. The new faction is known as the Scrin.\n\nPROS:+ The game has good art style and graphics: (Both of which aged really well specially since this game was released back in 2008.)\n+ Very good Sound design and unit voice acting.\n+ Quality live action cinematic played by very well known Hollywood stars and the ever iconic Joseph D. Kucan as “Kane.”\n+ Lengthy Campaign for each of the factions (about 20 hours if you play them in the Very Hard difficulty setting)\n+ Great story that is interwoven with each faction (meaning that each faction “wins” in their own right)\n+ New Faction that is fun to play and comes with an unlockable Campaign once you finish both GDI and NOD campaigns.\n+ Old factions (GDI and NOD) has been revamped with new units and playstyles without deviating from their respective origin stories.\n+ Fast paced and intense action.\n+ Lore heavy with story continuity from the old games.\n+ Fun and challenging missions during the campaign.\n+ Revamped game mechanics such as squad based infantry, super unit capture etc.\n\nCONS:- No online multiplayer due to GameSpy shutdown: FIX[cnc-online.net]\n- Some unit pathfinding quirks\n- Some balance issues (specially with the super units)\n- Relatively small maps\n- Limited tech-tree options and build orders\n- Campaign strategic options has no real effect\n- Random difficulty spikes between the campaign missions\n\nNEUTRAL+/- Mission objectives are immediately marked in the map thus depriving the player of map exploration. A.K.A. spoon feeding the player enemy locations.\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME that captures the fun and excitement of the old C&C games while adding its own modern ideas to mix thus making for a wonderful and action packed RTS experience.\n\nWORTH IT?The game at full price is $15 (or your regional equivalent) thus its a must have for RTS fans and Command & Conquer fans a like.\n\nAgain I have to stress out that the official multiplayer servers are now permanently offline so you'll have to use CNC:Online[cnc-online.net]  if you want to experience the game's online multiplayer feature.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/recommended/24790/","tedizslayer","Insano-Man","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tedizslayer/","166 products in account","I have long been a Command & Conquer fan, starting with Command & Conquer: Red Alert as one of the first PC games I experienced and have since loved to this day. I will side with many others in appreciation of what Command & Conquer 3 accomplished; a return to its roots from the brief transitional period of Generals and stupendous execution of it, at that.\n\nCommand & Conquer 3, as such, uses a far different method of base construction and economy as compared to traditional real-time strategy games; rather than workers, it relies on the construction yard as both the player's nerve center and primary construction unit. Buildings can be placed in control zones after they have been fully purchased, and are instantly constructed when placed. The player's economy functions through tiberium harvesters, which comb through a field of radioactive crystals rather than attaching themselves to a resource node. For 2007, even though it recalled much of older times in the RTS genre, it was quite a unique game.\n\nGameplay-wise, Command & Conquer 3 is a frantic game of hard counters. Anti-tank troops will rarely be able to take on rifle squads alone, and machine gun turrets will lose handily to main battle tanks. Units can vanish in the blink of an eye without warning, be it from high-potency artillery or sniper ambushes on isolated units. Economy plays a central role, as well; the player who establishes a powerful economy quickly and staunchly will often be the victor, as Command & Conquer games have never featured a supply cap or need for supply structures.\n\nFor some, this can be a headache. The leading role of economy, knowing troops will often die even with your keenest intervention, and the balancing act of fending off enemy counters in such a fast-paced environment leaves little room for the overly thorough in high-stakes games. Even a strong commander will find themselves in an unenviable position should they lose the economy war, as the frustration of losing harvesters on a stressed budget and watching one's veteran units dwindle with each skirmish can hardly be called a calming state of affairs. Some consider the workerless method of base construction to be backwards and that the over-reliance on economy to decide games is detrimental to the skill involved in playing the game.\n\nIn terms of storyline, Command & Conquer has always managed to captivate me. It may be nostalgia ballooning the series' writing and acting beyond what it should be, but the plot surrounding the intricate game of cat-and-mouse between GDI and Kane, the corruption of the planet by tiberium (most pointedly, the chilling depictions of red zones), and the live action cutscenes have all served to inspire me on many different levels. Command & Conquer 3's introduction of the Visitors and Kane's prophecy of their arrival have all served to bolster my apprecation of the storyline - C&C4 kept firmly out of mind.\n\nWhile it is unfortunate that Frank Klepacki did not return to grant C&C3 a score similar to the stupendous soundtracks of Red Alert 2 and prior, Steve Jablonsky and Trevor Morris lived up to his quality - if not necessarily style - and brought quality music to the title. Voice acting is more a toss-up, however; while most units offer fitting and well-acted lines, some - most notably Nod's two early scouting vehicles - are overacted to the verge of ridiculousness. Acting, while somewhat overdone in some areas, is enjoyable and mostly believable, and Joseph Kucan's applaudable return as Kane once more can hardly go without notice.\n\nGraphics and general sound quality are another toss-up, however. The SAGE engine - used originally for Generals in 2004 - was dated by 2007 standards, especially compared with the Essence engine used by Relic Entertainment in Company of Heroes a year prior. While effects and asset quality are undoubtedly good for their time, the SAGE engine often struggles to keep up, and some oddities can occur from certain situations. Notably, infantry cycling through "take cover" shouts on death and strangeness surrounding some explosion effects, such as the ion cannon strike. Audio, on the other hand, sports some noticeable stock sound effects, but is otherwise well-delivered and masterfully crafted for the various atmospheres in the game.\n\nOverall, a dedicated real-time strategy gamer could easily find joy in Tiberium Wars, and a dedicated Command & Conquer follower would be mental to let it slip from their library. With mod support aplenty (if not necessarily as accessible as previous C&C titles) and an official map editor freely available, it is hard to say that minor slights could prevent this game from earning its price and thensome.","December 7, 2013","true","0.1"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","59","68","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/solidkumar/recommended/24790/","solidkumar","Solid Kumar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/solidkumar/","175 products in account","Edit :- All Online Features of this Game are no Longer in Service.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of the Command & Conquer series, three small words are bound to get you excited: Kane is back. Indeed, so are a good number of beloved series hallmarks, like a huge amount of full-motion video and intense strategic combat. But Tiberium Wars is a lot more than just lip service to franchise enthusiasts, and you don't need the rose-hued glasses of nostalgia to appreciate its polish and intensity. It's simply a superb game that's fun and exciting to play both online and off.\n\nThe missions themselves are incredibly varied and involve a lot more than destroying an enemy base or defending a particular structure. You'll have to do these things, of course, but you have both primary and secondary objectives to complete, which include using engineers to capture certain buildings, amassing beam cannons to take out defenses, or teaming up with your sworn enemy to defend against alien attack. You'll be doing it all in a variety of real-world theaters, such as Washington, DC, downtown Sydney, and the eerily dry Amazon basin. The near-future take on familiar locales makes the intense battles feel even more thrilling, because the settings are recognizable and meaningful.\n\nThat's not to say the combat isn't gripping on its own. If you're usually content to turtle up in real-time strategy games, you're in for a surprise: Battles are intense and focused, and they give you little time to prepare. Like any RTS, you still need to build up resources, but it's a quick process of plopping down a bunch of tiberium refineries and power generators and finding the action, because if you don't, the action will quickly find you. Once you get past the first two acts of each campaign, you'll discover that Tiberium Wars' artificial intelligence is aggressive and resourceful, and it will take advantage of your strategic flaws. Don't expect to put your trust in one or two favored units, because even the most powerful units have noticeable weaknesses.\n\nIt's a rusher's paradise, but you shouldn't take it to mean that technological advancement and thoughtful strategy don't have their places. You won't need to deal with long, complex tech trees, and it makes Tiberium Wars feel somewhat limited in this aspect next to advancement-focused strategy games like Supreme Commander. However, you do have multiple powers and upgrades to earn by building various structures. The powers run the gamut from GDI's powerful ion strike to Nod's vapor bomb, and they fit each faction perfectly. As you use units they level up, making them more effective in battle, and in some cases you improve units by more unconventional means. For example, you can use a Nod warmech to destroy your own flame tank, and the mech will then spew fire in addition to its own native attack.\n\nHow differently each faction plays is impressive, especially with the new Scrin faction added to the mix. GDI units tend to be straightforward and powerful, and a huge force of mammoth tanks and juggernauts is a challenge to counter. Nod relies on sneakiness and smart use of unique abilities, and a small force of stealth tanks and viper bombers can cripple an enemy's economy. But playing as the Scrin is Tiberium Wars' greatest delight and challenge, since the alien faction is so different from the others. Your first encounters with the Scrin in the campaign are breathtaking, since even low-level units like buzzers look interesting and intimidating. In fact, the most threatening sight within the game is a fleet of Scrin assault carriers and their accompanying fighters. Yet while the Scrin have some potent units and other advantages, such as the ability to collect endless tiberium without building silos, they require a lot of micromanagement and intimate knowledge of each unit and structure.\n\nRegardless of your history with Kane and his cohorts, Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is one of the finest real-time strategy games in years. It's also a triumphant return to form for the series, because it's more than just a graphical update--it's an exciting, well-tuned experience with enough that's old and enough that's new to thrill old-timers and newcomers alike.\n\nSuffice it to say, you should play this game, and expect to be playing it for a long time to come.","December 26, 2013","true","26.3"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","27","27","0","0"

World is almost completelly infested with a strange, green substance, called Tiberium. This "thing" dropped down on Earth in 1990, and hell yeah, Earth will remember that day forever. Clearly an alien in origin, Tiberium (or Ichor - this is probably it's real name, given that the Scrins called it this way) has a very unlikely structure, and two very important abilities - 1st, it converts everything it touches, into itself, 2nd, its kind off... living. It is evolving.\n\nOn Earth, there are those, who want to get rid of this thing. And also those, who can claim it, worship it, and use it, maybe for greater good. These two sides can not go side by side. Thus - they are at an apocalyptic war across the entire planet !\n\nThis game, released in 2007, is still awesome. Yesterday, I was able to play it in Ultra High grafics with 3rd level AA - and I must say, this one still packs some power. Still amazingly smooth, still looking good. I like the story - and also cutscenes. Well, they could have been better, but this is no movie, this is just a game. And for a game, I can give those cutscenes 7/10. Textures are amazing, 8/10, but then you will see Scrins and you will have to give another point. Sounds are also very great, 8.5/10. Music is amazing, 9.5/10, it is not the best in the world, but it is very fiting and adictive.\n\nAlso mechanics, those are great as well. You have to consider at this point, that the game is 7 years old already, and back there... You know, technology and also programming went up. I still remmember how long I waited, together with my brother, to get this one in hand. I was 17 years old when it came out - and our poor old PC (2.4GHz Celeron - ONE core, 0.75GB RAM DDR2, and 0.5GB graphic card) can run it only on the lowest settings. But still, when I saw Mammoth tanks, Avatars and Tripods on one screen - hell yeah baby. I knew, that I will love this game one day.","August 21, 2014","true","23.6"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

I had this game on disk since it first came out, and honestly, its had more time put into it than any of my other strategy games put together.\n\nWhen Westwood still existed the C&C series always were wonderful to play - There was just that touch of polish and care which went into their games that you didn't quite get with others, even right down to the little animations of the commandos lighting a cigerrette and chucking it aside, quoting one of their infamous lines with a chuckle. So for 2D units  you were commanding quite a colourful and unique army.\n\nHowever when C&C3 came along... Oohh boy, that jump into 3D. It brought fresh life to the series!\n... too bad it was the last 'good' game beyond Red Alert 3 after that. EA had washed everything 'Westwood' down the drain.\n\n\nAs always the three factions are almost brilliantly balanced; They each have strengths and flaws which play a triangular role against one another, with similar but unique powers and tech trees. While they can be infamous for certain reasons - Scrin with their hordes of alien ships for example - there is no reason why a player cannot use either GDI or NOD to the same extent and counter it.\n\nFrom the previous two games the missions are also once again varied, can last you a while, and the AI can be dubious when you're unprepared, if not a little clumsy around the newly introduced slopes and hills, but you'll soon learn their routines and will be yearning for multiplayer - The true bread and butter of the game.\n\nModders have gone to town since it was released and patched to 1.9 - Maps. Game Modes. Entire campaign edits. New units, new customisation... Hell, they even have Tiberium Sun mods which adds the old units into the game.\n\n\nLike I said. Sad to see its the last 'good' game of the series.\nCommand & Conquer 4 'Twilight' ruined the finale to the story by ripping out the core gameplay mechanics, making maps capture-the-flag esque and point control, while plummeting the player into a final 'thats all folks!' with the ending.\nIf you want a true C&C game, get Tiberum Dawn or Sun. If you want an enjoyable 3d C&C game, get this, or Red Alert 3.","November 28, 2014","true","123.5"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMarsupialMaestro/recommended/24790/","TheMarsupialMaestro","Almighty Albatross","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMarsupialMaestro/","17 products in account","This is my first review so im glad I picked one of my favorite games to start off with (be warned its long, so if you want to skip to the end it sums up the review) . My hours don't do it justice but rest assured, I had this game for both PS3 and Xbox before buying it once again on Steam (Yes, I loved it that much, also theres no limit on units which is so much better than being capped on consoles). This game will never be RTS game that sets the bar for all other RTS style games, far from it, BUT, this is infact one of the best RTS games around nowadays.\n\nFirstly, you get THREE campaigns for three different factions, each with a very unique style. GDI which is basically your standard army relying on highly advanced tech to destroy your enemies *cough* Mammoth tanks OP *cough* . Then there is NOD (All hail Kane!), arguabley the one that takes the most skill, as you are usually going to end up using stealth units or surprise kamikaze runs in order to halt your more advanced enemies. They may not pack the biggest punch, but they have a really mean defense system which is every turtles dream and every player who likes to steamroll's nightmare. Then there is Scrin, take the ships from Stargate Atlantis and Independence day, throw in some Tripods from War of the worlds and some menacing alien-infantry and you have one of the most OP factions in any RTS ever. All campaigns are great and all have replay value, and trust me, when the difficulty is on hard, you will need an act of god to save you for almost every mission. All and all, the campaigns are really good and all are essentially a tutorial in some way for Skirmish mode. Straight to the point, Skirmish mode is your standard Team Deathmatch, you can do anything between 1v1 to 4v4, or if you want to be a god do a 1v7.\n\nNow lets talk about the cons. One of the biggest problems in the game is MASSING, in order words, spamming the same unit over and over cause you can't be bothered to use some real strategy and want to steam roll every skirmish or mission. Whether its creating a moving fortress of 20 Mammoth tanks, swarming the skies with 1000 (slight exageration) Venoms or just flat out crucifying everything in your path with some Scrin aircraft or tripods, if you want to mass, this is your game. However, there is an amazing array of different units with different abilities that the AI uses to its full potential and it takes quite a bit of skill to combat it, try to experiment with different units, massing isn't fun. Next con is the difficulty system. Easy is too easy, its a curbstomp and its the setting you'd use to teach your little sibling how to play. Medium/Normal is a step up but after a few games you should be fine although you can't 1v2 or 1v3 against Medium AI's. Then theres Hard/Brutal, whatever hate-induced state the developers were on when they made this setting, they wanted you to lose. Its nearly impossible to take down a Brutal opponent, it took myself and 2 other friends about 40 minutes to kill a Brutal enemy AI, its honestly that hard unless you mass/turtle. If you like a challenge, this is were you get one. I once did two Brutal AI vs myself and five mediums, after 10 minutes three of my allies were dead and we only won cause I turtled and spammed the super weapons.\n\nLastly the multiplayer servers are down, there is some fan-supported servers around but the official ones are down (♥♥♥♥ YOU EA).\n\nSo heres the summary, if you want a game for really good campaign and endless amounts of fun with Skirmishes, this is worth it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Battle8111/recommended/24790/","Battle8111","[E-D-G] Battle8111","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Battle8111/","305 products in account","Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium wars is one of my favorite games of my childhood and still continues on 8 years later into my adulthood. Being the first and best RTS games I ever played (originally I played it on Xbox 360 first as the demo when it came out and later the full copy). Here is why it's awesome.\n\n\nThe Single Player Campaign (SPOILERS):\nThis game has some fun RTS gameplay and a awesome story that has continued the Tiberium universe in this epic story from the GDI, NOD and Scrin sides. The story culminates into one arch with Kane's goal of Ascension, GDI's goal of stopping tiberium and the new faction the Scrin to take tiberium from Earth. As you play, you get high-quality cut-scenes. EA did a very good job of putting a good budget for the cut-scenes qualities and actors. Notable actors that play in the stories characters are Michael Ironside as Jack Granger, Jennifer Morrison as Kirce James and of course Joe Kucan as Kane. The high-production quality of the cut-scene alone is a damn good reason to play the campaign. The missions on the other hand though are...FANTASTIC! Great missions both challenging and interesting in their own ways. Most of them can be beat though through simple strategies (such as spam), others are very hard and require tactics and strategies to complete the objective. The intel you get throughout the campaign is quite fun to collect and read (you get the intel through completing the missions main and bonus objectives). Other notable things about the campaign that I enjoy is the small "Establishing Video Uplink" in-game cutscenes in the top right-hand corner uplink feel like you're actually being talked to while you prepare for battle. Ultimately outside of the great acting, lore and missions the game has a unique universe that makes it great for the players as you shape it as you play through this fun and amazing campaign.\n\nSkirmish and Multiplayer:\nThe skirmish and multiplayer for this game is quite fun. This is the 2nd primary reason you should get this game. Battling against enemy AI's is quite fun when you are alone and then going to multiplayer to survive against a brutal AI with friends is VERY fun. Battling against each-other is very enjoyable and requires skills either out-tech your opponent quickly (if you are GDI) or out-maneuver them through stealth and hit and run tactics as NOD. For the Scrin, simple air spam. (xD) The games can last for around 30 minutes to a hour at most depending on the AI you are going against or player. Other things to note is the lack of official servers for Tiberium Wars, I suggest using evolve or C&C Online if you plan to play with friends or regular players. Overall, its a great time to slug it out and annihilate each other in a war to end all wars game.\n\nMaps, Graphics and Performance:\nThis games map designs and graphics blend beautifully to make a wonderful looking tiberium-infested world. From battling in Egypt to Small Town USA, their are many maps types and many ways you can use these maps to your advantage for your faction. On maps you will notice Tech buildings. The different type of tech buildings are...\n\n-Tiberium spike Provides an initial bonus and then a constant stream of funds.\n-Mutant hovel Allows recruiting of Mutant Marauders.\n-Expansion Point Provides additional ground control.\n-Subway Hub Provides control over Subway entrances.\n-Subway Entrance Allow infantry to transfer between entrances.\n-Tiberium silo Provides a one-time bonus to the first player who captures it.\n-Reinforcement bay Provides reinforcements.(Campaign only)\n-EMP control center Allows the launch of an Electromagnetic Pulse at regular intervals.\n\nAs such straight from the cnc.wiki, the tech buildings allow a side to get a advantage over the other with these buildings using a engineer. They are pretty straight forward as the descriptions say above. But to continue with the graphics, the game looks fantastic. Maxing out all the settings and looking at the eye candy that comes aftward while building your base or leveling someone else's' is quite beautiful. The fidelity and visuals make the game look very wonderful compared to its previous title (Tiberium Sun) and allow the player to have visually stimulating good time. Performance wise, this game runs pretty good. 30 frame cap can be a issue for some, but it rarely dips below that while in-game as battles are usually short and decisive. If you have a decent computer (with at least 8 gigs of ram, a GTX750 or a AMD R7, you will be fine). If you have a gaming computer, prepare for max graphic and no lag. (Outside of that stupid frame cap)\n\nMods:\nThe modding community has kept this game alive and well for many years since its release. With mods that bring back old Tiberium Sun units and Structures or do crazy stuff with Chuck Norris, you will enjoy playing the mods made by the Community.\n\nBut to be more specific, I will list the categories and links to the mods I most enjoy and you should check out!\n(Total Conversation)Tiberium Esssense: http://www.moddb.com/mods/tiberium-essence\n(Total Conversation) CNC Fallout: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cnc-fallout\n(Crazy) The Chuck Norris Experience: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cc3-the-chuck-norris-experience\n(Total Conversation) Tiberian Sun Redux: http://www.moddb.com/mods/tiberian-sun\n(New Faction) The Forgotten: http://www.moddb.com/mods/cc-3-the-forgotten\n(Total Converstion) Command and Conquer: Tiberian History: http://www.moddb.com/mods/command-conquer-tiberian-history\n(Total Conversation) http://www.moddb.com/mods/dark2113\n(Total Conversation) Halo: Evoultions: http://www.moddb.com/mods/halo-evolutions\n\nWhat I really enjoy about this Modding community is the amount of successful and awesome total conversation mods that bring back many old units from previous games and make them better with the newer engine. I also enjoy the mods that bring in other universes to the engine.\nMy favorite of all of those has to be Tiberium Essence (Sorry Chuck) as it brings some wonderful units and buildings from Tiberian Sun. The mod also does well of improving some of the Units such as the Mammoth Mk2, as its Rocket Pods and Gun turret now actually function and are effective in battle. Also a upgrade on it allows either duel grande launcher turret (to kill enemy infantry in buildings more effectively or clear buildings of enemy infantry) or a Anti-Aircraft duel-railgun turret for shooting down most aircraft with ease. I also been following the mod for years and it has a wonderful developer, community and always more content on the way! The next update will contain The forgotten Faction (Also sorry Forgotten Mod).\n\nTo get off my box now on my favorite mod, please check out all those mods their, to install a mod and get it to work on steam, make sure you create a Mod folder in Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars folder that should be found in My Documents (You should also see another folder called replays, if you see that, your in the right place). Make sure [Mods] is spelled exactly like that without the brackets.\n\nAfter you make the mod folder, throw the mod into the Mods folder (make sure you have winrar to extract the mod, most mods use a rar file) and then go to your steam library.\nRight click on Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars in your Steam Library, click Properties, make sure your in the GENERAL tab and click on Set Launch Options. You should see a box come up with a blank text box. Type in the text box [-ui] (without brackets). (DASH_SPACE_LOWERCASEUI)\n\nNow the Game browser will appear! Select a mod & play!\n\n\nOverall, Command and Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a great game. Fantastic single player campaigns, great skirmish and multiplayer modes, wonderful maps, graphics and good performance. I Highly recommended it if you are a true RTS fan and honestly, this is the last best Command and Conquer game (including Kane's Wrath).","July 19, 2015","true","128.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

Do not get me wrong, all the story line of the Tiberium series was good up until the shocking twist in which Kane goes from terrorist cult leader to savior of himanity. This game is full of fun and challenging missions. Even easy, suprisingly, gives even a veteran CnC player like myself, who has played CnC since age 5 (12 years ago) a rough time. And for those who dont know whats in store.....your not only worrying about your factions nemesis....also to avoid spoilers, dont play skirmish or multiplayer. Heres my opinions on the game:\n\nMy Star Rating: 4.5\n\nGood things:\n1) Evolution of CnC base building and expansion\n2) Adding a new foe\n3) Change in difficulty\n4) Referances many things in the past, including Humvees, Titans, Wolverines, TW2 and occasional TW1 buildings that litter some later battlefields.\n5) Turned the commando into a faction specific unit, one being a bad ♥♥♥ demolitions expert, and other is a smoking hot red head.\n\nBad Things:\n1) Replaced the well beloved corny and crappy acting I loved to see with professional acting.\n\n\n\nWell worth the money!","January 25, 2014","true","149.7"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","4"

No, not just because of the graphics since that does not make a game great. I'll admit that being made in 2007: the graphics do hold very well to this very day. I'm talking about how the game feels to play, how much lore that you can unfold in this game and a very important point I will bring up later on.\n\nThe game itself is very easy to pick up and learn the basics such as what units do what, what your base does and many other things. As you progress through the story; you'll meet bonus objectives that you can complete for a different medal at the end (great for you completionists). The campaigns can have some very challenging moments for newer players but it will make you do what you're supposed to do: Come up with a strategy to win.\n\nNotice that I said campaigns. You can play the GDI (Global Defense Initiative), NOD campaign and a short Scrin campaign. The last being unlocked once you have completed both of the other two campaigns.\n\nThis game supports free building (allowing you to build almost anywhere on the map except impassable terrain), there is no unit limit and there is some decent to good balance in this game.\n\nNow, onto that point I mentioned earlier: It's the community. The C&C community has been part of me throughout my childhood and still is. People have constantly pushed out custom maps that have gamemodes for them such as No money, Art of Defense and Comp stomp. Command and Conquer Generals was my introduction to the community but not the series and I'm glad to see how much it has flourished.\n\nIf you wish to play this game online: Look into C&C Online. It's a community project that provides players to connect to their servers to play online so you can play with your friends or strangers. Downloading and installing custom maps is incredibly easy to do and can provide you more enjoyment in this game.\n\nNow, here's another important piece of the community: Mods. There are tonnes of them that bring things from the older games or whatever the team behind the mod wanted. I've played dozens upon dozens of mods and because of that; this game has continued to be something I love to play and relax with.\n\nTL;DR: I love this game and if you're wondering that if it is worth your time and money; I hope you do pick this amazing game up. This game has good replayability with custom maps and mods that you can find via Google.\n\nNeedless to say that this C&C fan will be giving this game a 10/10.","June 13, 2015","true","359.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

It's not that the game is really lacking but it was less than I had expected. The maps are smaller and defensive capabilities are really limited. This is alright if you really like small maps with constant intense combat. Also considering that infantry is setup to take cover against buildings and line of sight is important the fact that formations are missing seems like an oversight. There are some things lacking from previous editions as well, for instance nod laser fences. Overall, the price is right for what you get but don't expect everything that came with C&C.","February 26, 2014","true","35.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Up until this game it was all about the GDI and NOD forces pitted against one another. Someone at EA thought they could just include a new race and that is what they did.\n\nConsidering EA developed this it is understandable that there were no issues with production value. The graphics at the time were top notch and once again the cutscenes have famous actors (e.g. Michael Ironside).\n\nFinally, "building" soldiers does not happen one-by-one but instead this is now squad-based. You recruit squads and the good-old level-up feature from previous games were kept so the longer a squad survives the better it'll become. Also, upgrades are now important to add new features to the units. I liked how this was brought over from Generals.\n\nWe have a long and decent campaign with an interesting story. And this cannot be a true command and conquer game without Kane who also returns. You have some ingame database that helps you with the story-telling and entries are given once you complete sidequests within missions. Another likeable concept.\n\nAll in all, this is a decent follow-up to an already famous and successful franchise.

A game named Command and Conquer appeared... and paved the way for an entire genre. It's a name that many RTS veterans should be familiar with. The franchise had its ups and downs throughout the years. 2007, the long awaited sequel of Command and Conquer Tiberian Sun appears. Has it passed the test? Let's see...\n\nVisually, the game is downright gorgeous, even for today's standards. You can tell at first glance, whether the map is situated in a still pristine Blue zone, a conflict-torn Yellow zone or in an almost unearthly Red zone. The units are also well designed and their appearance alone tells something about the respective faction. Topped off with non-excessive and neat special effects, the visuals give a good impression.\n\nGameplaywise, the game has undergone major changes. Instead of one single build queue, where the amount of respective facilities only determined production speed, now each production facility has its own queue, and units have gained special abilities. These changes were not wellcomed by all fans of the franchise, but I'll allow myself to use a proverb: "I don't know if it's going to be good, but if it is to become better, it must change". Other than that, the "hard-counter" unit-system has finally reached a desireable level, unlike in previous titles, pretty much every unit can be put to a good use and has its weak points. Not every change is good though. The gameplay is kind of too fast-paced compared to its precedetors, and that signifficantly weakened the efficiency of commando-infiltrations, which were the brandmark of this franchise. Command and Conquer 3 lets you deploy a countermeasure in a matter of seconds, leaving little to no room for a classic commando rampage, which was possibly the most fun thing Command and Conquer could offer. That aside, the gameplay gets way more than a passing grade.\n\nThe audio: The first thing C&C fans will notice that the OST simply doesn't have the same magic as the ones composed by Frank Klepacki. Just thinking of "March to doom" playing as you scrape together leftovers of your army in late-game for a final desperate attempt to win sends chills down my spine. Still, the soundtrack is by no means bad. The sound effects are seamlessly implemented, and is good and bad at the same time. Remember how your hands started sweating when you hear the ominous thundering sound of the allied Cruiser's cannons in Red Alert? It was the sound saying: "say goodbye to your base". On the other hand, with the sound effects not standing out too much, you can keep being fully focused on the events on the battlefield and can clearly make out the very important and helpful announcements of your EVA unit, pointing out upcoming danger.\n\nDespite all the flaws pointed out, Command and Conquer 3 Tiberian Wars is a very enjoyable game and I recommend it to both newcommers and veterans.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10","March 19, 2014","true","243.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I also recommend everyone picks up the Kane's Wrath expansion which introduces 6 new factions.\npros\n- The live acting is not as cringy as it was in the red alert games, the story feels much more serious here.\n-  Each mission in all 3 campaigns can be very challenging especially near the end of the campaigns, theres always a wide variety of objectives to complete\n- The environments look awesome with different weather conditions, wartorn streets and abandoned bunkers ect\n- The units can earn promotions, once they hit the max rank they can even regenerate their health without being repaired\n- The alien faction known as Scrin has an awesome campaign filled with destruction\n-  Each unit has a cat and mouse situation but because there is such a wide variety of them it does not matter as much\n\ncons\n- Windows 10 cannot run this game for most players for some reason so be aware you may need to downgrade\n- Sometimes the AI uses a lot less tactics on the harder difficulty and just spams a mixture of units over and over again which can get frustrating\n\nOverall tiberium wars 3 gets a 10/10 its by far one of the best command and conquer games and is my personal most favourite real time strategy game of all time","April 14","true","6.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It is the last of the games to really stay true to the formula that made the series so successful but it was also the last of the series that failed to innovate and that is something that hurt it.\n\nThe great live action cutscenes make a return but instead of the wonderful b-movie quality of previous installments it is now little more than catwalk performances by semi-famous actors.\n\nThe gameplay is the same as in previous installments, although there has been some technical advancement you will immediately become comfortable with it. The poor unit AI and the lack of certain utility units common in other games does become frustrating rather quickly.\n\nIt is a good game if you liked the old C&C's in series but it is also a game that has become stagnant. A game that tries to innovate but fails every step of the way and although C&C will always hold a place in my heart, I am glad that the genre is advancing beyond it.","November 3, 2012","true","86.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The lengthy campaign provides for so many great and memorable missions. And thanks for it's entertaining story and high quality FMV scenes, played mostly by hollywood celebrities, you'll only find yourself thirsty for what the plot has to offer.The game has a huge variety of units and structures which let you imploment many strategies and seemingly unlimited ways to play, ending up with gameplay mechanics that are deep, fun and extremely addictive. The online community is still strong ,as this review written in december 1st 2012, that is mostly played by veteran players of the game and/or the series, a prime proof of why Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is considered to be the best C&C experience to date and why it's my personal favorite RTS game in the genre.","November 30, 2012","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's almost sad to look back at this game knowing how much potential the series has and how little is being done with it.\n\nPersonally, I absolutely love the GDI Mammoth tanks.  At this stage, most of my play time has come from setting a group of mammoths around a mobile defense platform (which repairs the tanks a they take damage), setting up some air defense, and ranking the tanks all the way up until they self repair.  There's almost nothing more satisfying than rampaging through an enemy base with an army of nearly invincible mammoths.\n\nBut there's a lot of variety here and the Nod Avatars are pretty sweet too.  No matter how you like to play, there's gonna be some units you'll love, some levels you'll love, and a few you'll love to hate.

This is basically one of the best rts games I've ever played. It has everything a good rts game needs in my opinion (as most of the previous C&C).\nYou can build huge bases and you don't have a unit limit.\nAGAIN NO UNIT LIMIT. This is a must have for me :)\nYou can upgrade your units and you can combine different units for different tactics. You can still buy this game nowdays cause the graphic is still good in my opinion. You can't use the original multiplayer anymore cause the servers are down. But there is a well working community project which you can join for free and play with or against others.\nIt's making me that they killed the franchise. You won't find any remotly compareable rts game nowdays. Most of the are designed for short matches. Basically choose your units and rush in.

There's three factions GDI, NOD and Scrin (aliens), the missions follow that classic live action look that C&C do, the story line is pretty decent and follows on from previous versions however if you start from here there's enough infomation to fill you in on any missing gaps. The graphics are pretty decent for it's age and still seem pleasing enough today, It was a shame they had to end the C&C collection with C&C4 the ruiner of the game.","February 11","true","39.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I used to be a Starcraft player, but Blizzard ruined the ♥♥♥♥ out of every ♥♥♥♥ing thing. So I changed my perspective on RTS genre, Westwood Studios is the best RTS maker of all times.\nTheir game may not be so competitve like Blizzard, but they are fast pace but FUN!\nCompetitiveness ruined the gaming industry, where it aimed only for FUN. C&C Tiberium War in this case exceeds most of its predecessors by being either fun (spamming units) and competitive. The AI in this game is very excellent and harder than Starcraft 2. The first time I played the campaign at easy level, the bots beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. In the skirmish game, the bots if you chose Steamroller, they will roll over you if in easy level.\n\nAlthough the multiplayer is no longer supported by EA, you still can go to online forums and download software to help the multiplayer section.\n\nThe game is best at:\n- Best cinematics (Blizzard looks cheesy, but Westwood looks serious)\n- Amazing actors\n- Stunning graphics\n- Great soundtrack\n- Large gamesize, it is beyond my expectation of previous games\n- Dangerous AIs, they simply focus on wiping your most dangerous units\n- Many special abilities\n- Challenging missions with many bonuses that hardly find in any RTS game\n- Best RTS Campaign of the decade (C&C games always pull me to be serious in watching briefing, tempting)\n- Great Balance system (This new C&C fixed the unit spamming in Red Alert 2)\n- Best modding community secondly after Skyrim Nexus (It composed of many foreigners, they are amazing)\n- Tiberium Essence! The best mod that made this game perfect, you need to download it on DB.\n\nSome flaws:\n- Many special abilities (Old Red Alert 2 is easier, this new thing is quite hard to use)\n- Chaotic graphic ( I feel the graphic is a little too oversaturated)\n- AIs are quite dumb at pathfinding\n- Still having some balancing flaws from the old C&C\n- Harvester!\n- Still no CABAL from Firestorm Crisis, I was waiting for an expansion on such amazing AI villain in video game history, yeah, ♥♥♥♥ EA.\n\nScore: 96/100\nGreatly Amazing, but underrated.\n\nStarcraft 2 should have been 78/100 instead of 91/100 on reviewing websites. Tiberium War just bought me back to the Command and Conquer franchise, let's hope there will be a fifth installment.\n","December 6, 2014","true","115.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is however one of the better RTS series I know. That said, this game does not come with the same feeling the first two games had. Part of me will always long for the classic C&C. There is a new addition to the factions however. The Scrin are an interesting faction to play with. It is just a shame that they were not expanded upon in the fourth game.","June 6, 2012","true","34.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Original. This one is pretty good. I do not like the not as defined style look. The whole future look i guess goes with the timeline. But since i played Tiberium Wars and RA2 (and expansions) last, and mainly to mess around in skirmishes, i was lost as to when and where stuff was happening and as to why. I dont like the missions themselves because i dont get the story right now. But to have a RTS to skirmish comp with this one is great. plus it is  C&C so yeah... They could make better skirmish maps cause the ones this comes with sucks balls.","May 20, 2014","true","71.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

WHy you ask.   Its down to the AI you face off against.   on the 360, you cam overwelhm the AI and they aren't as ovely aggressive, which means you can take your time,.   Also with the unit cap, it pretty much inhibits the AI to mass produce spam units to make you rip out your hair.   PC version.   with a 3.5ghz 6core, the AI is worse.   You must think and plan your attack, sometimes turtle down.   Sometimes have to restart the mission cause you literaly f**ked up and got zerg rushed into defeat, or just lost to the coutdown timer.   I hate to find out what its like later on in the camaign when the scrin come into play, and you have to square off against them and either gdi or nod.

I love this game. Would I recommend it? Absolutely! There's just one little pproblem... IT WON'T LET ME PLAY. Idk why, I got it to work for like 27 minutes once, but I can't now. Idk why but I cannot even get into the start menu. Windows 10 has some kind of issue with it and the support site is less than useless. Thanks EA for once again testing my faith in the video game world. Long story short, I loved this game on console, I wish so badly it would work, but alas, no such luck. Who knows? Maybe you'll be more fortunate than I was, maybe it will work, I hope so. However I sorely regret paying for a game I cannot play.

The good part, is that Joe Kucan nailed the acting.  What other RTS can get away with full motion video and have it look good in this day and age?  The downside is that once the single player campaign is done, the content drops off remarkably.  Also, the patches for the multiplayer balancing f**** up royally the single player missions.  There is one GDI mission that has approximately the same difficulty as the final mission because they forgot to retune the SP eleements.   Anyways, it is a AAA game that is well polished.

The game’s OK I guess though I’m really not that good at it.\n\nPros: This game has many different difficulty levels and AI tactical settings allowing for a great deal of replayability, There are two campaigns and a skirmish/simulated multiplayer mode in addition to actual multiplayer possibilities, the graphics are the best I have seen on any RTS tactical game other asides from the Homeworld games and yet the system requirements are relatively low. The game also runs fast. There are 3 playable factions to choose from, the music is adequate at worst and catchy at best, the sound is outstanding, the controls have an easy learning curve and work well. This is definitely a worthy successor to the previous primary command and conquer game (Tiberium Sun) and picks up the story where that game left off. Units and structures are interesting and yet easy to identify (particularly if you are familiar with this kind of game), the game appears to be completely free of any bugs, the game's menus and interfaces are fine and yet for all this...\n\nCons: This game is extremely difficult for a variety of reasons (and therein lies its main failing (or is it mine?). The AI on any setting rated medium or over can be extremely unforgiving of any tactical mistakes (as it appears to make no mistakes itself), the realism and realistic importance of the "tactics" involved in playing this game are questionable at best (and totally nonsensical at worst) as the game almost continually appears to encourage you to take 100 percent losses and attack without having all of your people and vehicles in order (or even constructed). Coordination between different types of vehicles and soldiers is a necessity but such vital elements such as airstrikes and artillery are given an odd, back-seat to the main, ground-based action (which is actually classic, normal gameplay for the Command and Conquer franchise). Air power is stronger in this iteration of the game than in previous Command and Conquer games but is still quite weak, requiring 4 or more aircraft of any type to have much of an affect in any battle (as was still true in past CC games)\n\nFor all of the game's futuristic appearances, units behave in an oddly World War II styled manner (with similar (or lesser) ranges applying to their weaponry (as was also shown in past CC games), the game still often manages to feel like an elaborate board game throughout (like its predecessors), the environments are interesting and often beautiful but fall under only 3 main categories (alien, war-ravaged desert, and cityscape with some greenery), The main campaigns become extremely frustrating very quickly as they begin to continually (to the extent that the game becomes extremely predictable) place you in situations wherein the enemy has a totally unfair advantage and your own forces are in a state of severe disarray (as in previous CC games).\n\nThe skirmish maps are perhaps the most fun part of the game but there is unfortunately not a great variety of them and they are often setup in an overly formal manner (it ends up looking sort of like you are having a battle in a war-ravaged formal french garden further adding to the feeling that you are playing a complicated board game). Perhaps the worst part of all this is however, how much raw potential for fun and interest which the game has but doesn't manage to live up to. The tactics in this tactical game rarely make much real-world sense....Or maybe I'm simply not very good at it or the tactical situations may simply be too nonsensical even for my tastes (but I never can seem to gather enough resources fast enough no matter how many refineries I build and regardless of where on the battlefield I build them).\nA friend of mine who tends to play more strategy/tactical games than I do also once told me he was having a hard time with this game too though...so maybe it's just a really, really hard game.\n\nKane’s Wrath is better in every respect. It’s too bad you have to install this to play Kane’s Wrath.","January 7","false","0.3"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Sure there are great graphics and the cutscenes that glorify you, the commander, with well known science fiction actresses playing the rolls are certain to make you feel like a conquering hero. But beyond that the gameplay is nearly unplayable unless you are an expert. I was playing on normal up until act 5 when I just got way to tired of having to restart. Because once you make a mistake, there is no recovering.\n\nThe tiberium crystal economy is always too slow to keep up your war machine with the constant enemy advances. And the worst part of it is that you are basically on a timer. Because once you are out of the initial crystal piles, there is no way to keep up production because the crystal piles grow out of the ground at a slugs pace.\n\nOn top of that, there seems to be no way to build up defences to use a 'turtle up' strategy, even while you are trying to build up your initial forces. And because of that, enemies are constantly getting inside of your base and wreaking havok on your very weak structures that cost more than an arm and a leg.\n\nOn top of that, there seems no other way to win than to build up a massive force and then sweep the map. Because there is no real use for scouting and no long range siege abilities except on the absolute most expensive units, when it would be a much better idea just to build up a lot of mammoth tanks. You can forget about skirmishing as the enemy will always either have a large number of base defenses that will wipe out any small force or their troops will be in constant production coming out of their buildings so you wind up doing no real damage and lose everything.\n\nI do not recommend this game to anybody, even if you are already bord of all your other games. Stick with the good old Age of Empires or Starcraft series for a much more enjoyable experience.\n\n","April 11","false","13.2"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","6","2","0"

It would have been a great ideal, if it would have been executed by the original developers of Command & Conquer, but EA lacks the ability to continue this dream, which is why they opted to buy, NOT the game, but basically, buy the fan base of the game, thinking it would put more money in their pockets...\n\nWhere they went wrong, is their inability to achieve the same success that had made Westwood Studios a great success... They created the franchise, they new how it worked, the mechanic's, the in's and out's, and when Westwood sold us out, they knew the game was finished, and that they would not release another title, but wanted one last payout.  I miss Westwood Studios...\n\nI rate this game 4.5/10\n\nThe best Westwood C&C in my opinion was Tiberian Sun, and the expansion pack, what was it?  Firestorm?  I don't remember...  But this game is not from Westwood, and if you waste your money on it, you'll only be paying for what it once was, by who once made it what it was...

First of all, it interupts the flow of gamplay every 5 seconds by pausing the action and moving the camera around the map to tell you what your objectives are. I don't see why they can't just tell you of your objectives without interupting the gameplay. This is really annoying.\n\nSecondly, the voice acting and dialouge is really cheesey and phoned-in. Generally RTS games don't excel in this area, and it's usually not a big deal. So the fact that I'm complaining about it really shows you how bad it is.\n\nThe first two things alone wouldn't be a dealbreaker by themselves. The real dealbreaker is that the campaign is ridiculously hard. The AI has infinite money the whole time while you run out of money in the first few minutes. There is no way to keep up with the computer's economy and production. I had to sell most of my structures and mine all the tiberium fields just to defend myself from constant attacks by epic armies of doom. I've played tons of RTS games and this is the worst balance and hardest campaign I have ever seen in an RTS. Starcraft 2 on brutal difficulty is easier than this on normal.\n\nSave your money. because this game sure isn't worth the price, even when it's really cheap for the summer sale.\n\nEDIT: I gave it another shot, and wow does this game handle bad. You units don't auto-attack buildings, meaning you have to constantly babysit them which isn't fun.","June 12, 2015","false","6.9"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","5","25","2","0"

First of all, I'd like to say "THANK YOU" to Westwood Studios for creating such a great & diplomatic approach to 'blowing things up'.  I've played C&C since it was a demo disk at a small town's discount store - which is a long, long time.  I remember The Purity, The Excitement, The Strategy : Command & Conquer, Command & Conquer RED ALERT...and maybe one / two more.  I haven't played this one, until 2015 - I had purchased the XBox 360 verision when it was 'ported' or released for console.  The disc wouldn't work !! Brand New Pro, Brand New Game - couldn't install on HD neither.  (WTH ?).\nI had to wait another 8 years before gathering the patience to give it another try, if you're into Great Games, you'll understand the 'Time Gap' needed between 'Disappointments'.\n\nI'll be honest - and ask a question - since I play on the Normal Difficultly, as any Non-Tense person might ; i'm NOT into 'Frantic Mode' and playing the Missions until I bleed SKIRMISH.  I've seen it, it gets that obcessive for some.  (I have always enjoyed the strategy)  "Are the enemy units more difficult to destroy on the harder levels of difficults, or are their weapons more powerful ??"  I find the continual, and predicatble, and then absurd hordes of 'Pound User's Base','Flood with Increasing #'s', and 'Have more units with LONGER  RANGE with Very High Attack Points Attack Base' - just plain foolish and lazy for any game developer to puke up and call it 'programming.\n\nWhere are the TOO SWEET (TOOLS !!!) !!!!\nSpy Satellite - NOPE\nNon-Diminishing 'Fog of War' for discovered areas - NOPE\nUnits that can coordinate a DEFENSE POSITION - without babysitting those METERS away who won't attack - NOPE\n\nI think the whole - Fizzle, Dazzle, and Dim-Lit Sparkle took place of War Strategy, Great Maps than didn't need 'sub-objectives completed' before 'expansion, and Ability to Utilize Individual Units for Strategic Purposes.\n\nI got, "can't get that (limited unit maps Primarily) Money / Rank crate, because....uh....there's NO GRID FOR THAT FRICKIN' POSITION" WOW !!  It's pathetic how you're units will :\n\nTANKS -\n1) Move forward, when you order a retreat.\n2) NEED TO HAVE WHEELS FACING ENEMY - The Turret alone - TO FIRE - ISN'T FRICKIN' POSSIBLE !! WTF !!!!!\n\nSNIPERS -\n1) Will not crawl or remain 'covert' when you order a move, wasn't there an ability to move 'discreetly' at one point ?\n2) Something about a Laser with Giant 3 Barrel Turtles - was I supposed to use this....or was it just something that got mixed up with Programming & Studio Production of Video Cuts ??\n\nAbandoned Building -\n1) Why is it - 80-85% of these are\nA) Non-Repariable - WHY ARE THEY THERE !!!! WTH ??  There's just there to crumble randomly 5 minutes later ?\nB) Any flame unit can knock out your Elite Snipers ('General' or STAR Rank), since their SUPER DENSE AND LIGHTWEIGHT Armor absorbs ANYTHING short of on Ion Cannon Blast\n\nNOD FLAME UNIT(s) - (ALL)\n1) Ground Troops - SUPER ARMOR, SUPER ATTACK POINTS.\n2) If tanks would RUN OVER these guys, without command on former games, why is it - they're (tanks) just sitting around, to see if it's enough to destroy them ???\n\nAPCs & Rocket Buggies -\nMaybe being lightweight would encourage you to attempt a Dash & Gash - not\nI'll work this guy over, NOD Tank Sqaud - with my LAME ROF (Rate of Fire)\nWhy can't you just be a Bad M-F'er and allow a COMMANDO to jump in the back....\nguess it wouldn't make sense to have 'Some Fun' with an Elite Unit.\n\nWhy the hell is Landed Casserole in this game...did he need a new cane, or just starving for work ???\n\nThis game is so dumb, lamb, weak, and disasterous - I would recommended you give it to someone you truly dislike with a smile, they'll be confused - but then befuddled to the point - you can go on with your life WITHOUT having to worry about them - because they'll be trapped trying to just get past the 'Act I' Campain Missions.\n\nWhy are there MULTIPLE sub slots for 'upgrades' you'll never see. Why not just 1 slot - are BOXES fun !! (??)\nI'm guess making unnecessary building is how someone collected a paycheck.\n\nIon Cannon Uplink\nEMP Space Uplink.\n\n"Well you can't put them together - since they would run off the Same Grid"\n(Ion) - this one is in space....\n(EMP Space Uplink...this on means an aircraft unit, or NAVAL Unit that you can only see offshore & NEVER UTILIZE is kicking them out.  Dunno. Maybe a Pelican with Bionic Wings, and a Payload Capacity for Bullsh*t is doing all the work.\n\nIt's just looking like something, someone wanted to drop off (C&C) - literally - since all the 'BUZZ' that created was good enough to slap EA on it, and just do 'whatever' since the Title will carry the weight, not the New Company with Lazy Programmers who were probably too busy playing Gay-Lo to give a sh*t about doing this thing right !\n\nPathetic.","January 11, 2015","false","33.6"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","13","3","23","0","2"

The story somehow feels out of place for a Command and Conquer game, especially regarding the new alien faction.

You play skirmishes, adapt your tactics and play style, play campaign, get struck on a level and put the game down.\nI like to know how the story ends and I've played my share of skirmishes but if the campaign A.I. has to cheat to make the game difficult no thank you.\nThe campaign A.I. certainly does cheat, massively! They have lower construction time and production time, superior units (even units considered as fodder can still beat half your military force) and vast abundance of resources.\nSo as I stated before if you can defeat the campaign A.I., have a hign stubborn level to keep trying over 30 attempts for a single campagin level, or don't want to play campaign, buy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nurdoidz/recommended/24790/","nurdoidz","Nurdoidz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nurdoidz/","109 products in account","Note: I have this game on Origin with 335 hours prior to purchasing on Steam.\n\nCommand & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a worthy addition to the C&C franchise. It runs well and is generally bug-free — though a few irritating bugs are present, such as: sometimes, while in a skirmish game against an AI, stealth is useless. Their units follow your stealthed units around as if the unit was visible.\n\nThe game butchered the 'tiberian' canon somewhat from the previous games. Originally, 'Tiberium' used to be some sort of organism; a plant that crystalizes minerals from the ground and emits poisonous gases. This entity was sent to the earth by the Scrin to transform Earth into a planet suitable for them. In this game, they completely changed the chemical composition of the entity. Instead of an alive plant-like organism, 'tiberium' is now a crystal that acts like some sort of lifeless radiative substance sent to Earth to crystalize the entire planet for mineral harvestation.\n\nAside from the canon, the storyline is... okay. It's not great, but if stories aren't your thing, it's passable. If you're joining the series without prior C&C experience, the story is not really that interesting.\n\nAs an RTS title, I would say it is disappointing. Work has gone into balancing and unit design, and generally works, but as a balance system alone, it is pathetic. In order to win, you need less strategy and more tank-rushing. Infantry are almost useless and aircraft aren't far behind.\n\nA good point of consideration is the availability of mods, however. There are some mods that add desperately-needed balancing changes to make the game require an actual brain. There are also mods that boost the total hours you are going to get out of this title by converting the game to fit with unique themes, such as: Dune II, Cold War era, modern warfare, etc.\n\nConclusion\nI would recommend this game only if you have been introduced to the C&C series prior to the release of this title. If were looking at it purely as an RTS, it does okay. You might want to pass it up if your standards are somewhat high. Otherwise, I suggest giving it a try. I love the game.","May 27, 2014","true","179.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a big CnC fan, you will love this, I have been a huge fan, I own every other CnC game, and the only one that really disappointed me was CnC 4.  If you have never played CnC before this would be a good start, especially if you have a newer PC that won't run the older games.  Even though EA made the game, not WestWood, this is still a great game, I am not disappointed at all at this game.\n\nHere are some of the good reasons\n\nThe game play is great, fun and challenging at the same time.\nThe graphics are very good for it being made in 2007.\nThe single player story is very fun, I have played it many time over, when your about half way through the new faction appears, whic is a great plot twist.\nThe controls are easy to understand.\nIf you buy multiple copies, it is very fun to play with your friends, and family either online or LAN.\n\nThis is the only bad thing about the game in my opinion.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that the multiplayer seems to have some connection issues, but other than that, it is a fun experience.","June 5, 2014","true","166.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My only complaints are:\n\nEA completeley changed the atmosphere of the game. It went from post-apocalyptic, dramatic and gloomy with some heavy science-fiction elements, to Modern Warfare as an RTS game with aliens. They completely got rid of a lot of aspects that made Tiberian Sun such an atmospheric game, such as map-wide ion storms, tiberium mutants (while they still exist canonically they only rarely make appearances), and NOD was dumbed down greatly in the sense that their technology now sucks pretty badly and their numbers/strength are fairly laughable.\n\n\nYou can't have a singleplayer skirmish without the AI spamming grenadiers/black hand/buzzers. Those are the only infantry units that the game's AI will make and it makes it extremely frustrating to employ infantry of your own because those three types of troops clear garrisons and kill infantry instantly.\n\nThe scrin are OP - it's mostly a matter of how you fight them but considering they get fighters that don't need to re-arm and gunships and frigates and all that and the NOD and GDI only have fighters and some light AA, it's not really fun to go up against them unless you know exactly what you're doing.\n-Another thing about the Scrin is that all or most of their units get shields. It's like playing against the protoss in Starcraft all over again.\n\nAnother thing is that defenses suck (unless you play with the old Tiberium Essence mod) - there's no walls and turrets are pretty weak.\n\nAll in all I'd give it a 7/10 because I loved the previous C&C games and EA did a good job of continuing the story for the Tiberium series, but it is lacking in some areas that could have been executed better.","August 25, 2014","true","48.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

EA Los Angeles had lived up to expectations with this game.\n\nC&C 3 is the first game in the franchise to use squad-based gameplay. Tiberium (the resource) is abundant and can be easily found on the map and can easily be told how valuable it is, as Blue Tiberium is more valuable than the common Green Tiberium.\n\nEven though using the same game engine as the previous game, Command & Conquer Generals, the game looks drastically different. The dark dystopian theme fits the game so well, showing that both of the main factions are fighting for there life. The units are made so that it is easy to tell which side they are one, as GDI units are more Gold and metallic, while Nod units are usually black and matted.\n\nEven though the game does try something new, it does not lose the 'Command & Conquer' Style, unlike the next game in the series...

It's certainly not as horrendous as C&C4 by any stretch, but it could also have been better.\n\nI do however have some gripes with this game that I need to mention.\n- The game varies from the typical image I felt fit GDI and Nod quite well, making Nod more of a religious fanatical force, and GDI more a modern-day military, which sadly seems to be an attempt at mirroring the whole 'middle eastern conflict' that even today stretches on.\n- The technology seems to have dumbed down; after the Second Tiberium War, a load of units (Titans, Subterannean units, etc) were decommissioned. Most of them are rectified in the expansion, but they were iconic to their factions and logical tech paths for them to have taken; removing them seems rather silly.\n- The atmosphere is lacking in comparison to its predecessor, Tiberian Sun; the tiberium wastelands sorely lack the same sort of apocalyptic feel that was present in TibSun.\n- The storyline of CABAL from TibSun: Firestorm seems as though it was completely ditched, which is a little sad.\n\nOverall, though, the gameplay is very much solid and even to this day works well.

The tanks look massive and the unique units Nod has like the Avatar are imposing but not impossible to down and watching your super weapon utterly annihilate the enemy base is always visually satisfying be it a nuclear bomb or the Ion Cannon.\nSounds as always are good. A tank firing a missle sounds like, well, a tank firing a missle. The music soundtrack is good as well but most times youll be to focused on dealing with an enemy onlsaught to really listen to it.\nThe story is rich and the FMV sequences are great and all feature famous actors such as Micheal Ironside. Theres 3 campaigns as well each telling the story from a different side. The first being the GDI's campaign and the second Brotherhood of Nod campaign but the third campaign (which i wont spoil here) is only unlocked after completing the first two campaigns.\nDifficulty can range anywhere from cakewalk to seemingly impossible. This is mostly in part to the games latest patch which balances some units more but breaks others. Example would be the Mammoth Tank and Black Hand. The mission the Tank is introduced for you to use is supposed to be an easy one due to it being GDI's best land vehicle but after the patch the tank is not nearly as powerful as it should be which in turn makes the mission a lot tougher. The Black Hand is a flamethrower unit for Nod and being infantry are supposed to be weaker to anti infantry turrets but after the patch not even 3 anti infantry turrents can down one squad of them. Post patch the only effective way to deal with them is either aircraft bombings or attempting to run them over with a tank which they seem to be able to chew up effectively too.\nOverall Command and Conquer 3 Tiberium Wars is worth the buy along with its expansion pack Kanes Wrath. Its definitely one of the greatest Command and Conquer games out there alongside Command and Conquer Generals. I give C&C TW3 an 8/10.","September 4, 2014","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being a fan of RTS games that feature diverse factions and in this case even races. Although that game resembles the classical Command & Conquer games of having a central building to 'deploy' other buildings to build up a FOB, the graphics (both for the environment of the maps and the animations/physics) are set to be very realistic, which as not always been the style of other installments in this series. The game can be rather unforgiving, forcing the player to act quickly and not slack off, yet this dynamic component alongside the 'diverse factions'-factor is something that true RTS fans, who also enjoy games such as Star Craft: Brood War, will welcome.","September 6, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alxetora/recommended/24790/","Alxetora","Alxetora","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alxetora/","83 products in account","Decent game. My only complaints are:\n\nEA completeley changed the atmosphere of the game. It went from post-apocalyptic, dramatic and gloomy with some heavy science-fiction elements, to Modern Warfare as an RTS game with aliens. They completely got rid of a lot of aspects that made Tiberian Sun such an atmospheric game, such as map-wide ion storms, tiberium mutants (while they still exist canonically they only rarely make appearances), and NOD was dumbed down greatly in the sense that their technology now sucks pretty badly and their numbers/strength are fairly laughable.\n\n\nYou can't have a singleplayer skirmish without the AI spamming grenadiers/black hand/buzzers. Those are the only infantry units that the game's AI will make and it makes it extremely frustrating to employ infantry of your own because those three types of troops clear garrisons and kill infantry instantly.\n\nThe scrin are OP - it's mostly a matter of how you fight them but considering they get fighters that don't need to re-arm and gunships and frigates and all that and the NOD and GDI only have fighters and some light AA, it's not really fun to go up against them unless you know exactly what you're doing.\n-Another thing about the Scrin is that all or most of their units get shields. It's like playing against the protoss in Starcraft all over again.\n\nAnother thing is that defenses suck (unless you play with the old Tiberium Essence mod) - there's no walls and turrets are pretty weak.\n\nAll in all I'd give it a 7/10 because I loved the previous C&C games and EA did a good job of continuing the story for the Tiberium series, but it is lacking in some areas that could have been executed better.","August 25, 2014","true","48.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a big CnC fan, you will love this, I have been a huge fan, I own every other CnC game, and the only one that really disappointed me was CnC 4.  If you have never played CnC before this would be a good start, especially if you have a newer PC that won't run the older games.  Even though EA made the game, not WestWood, this is still a great game, I am not disappointed at all at this game.\n\nHere are some of the good reasons\n\nThe game play is great, fun and challenging at the same time.\nThe graphics are very good for it being made in 2007.\nThe single player story is very fun, I have played it many time over, when your about half way through the new faction appears, whic is a great plot twist.\nThe controls are easy to understand.\nIf you buy multiple copies, it is very fun to play with your friends, and family either online or LAN.\n\nThis is the only bad thing about the game in my opinion.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that the multiplayer seems to have some connection issues, but other than that, it is a fun experience.","June 5, 2014","true","166.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are 3 factions to choose from, each of which are very well structured, yet still have their unique advantages and disadvantages.  This balances the gameplay beautifully.  Many RTS games have very complex gameplay mechanics, which often turns off newcomers of the genre.  The gameplay in Tiberium Wars is very easy to grasp and the customizable AI gives you a fun, comfortable learning curve, but there is a downside to this feature.  Tiberium Wars lacks any innovative RTS features and doesn’t bring anything new to the table.  In addition, the limited amount of custom maps restricts the fun Tiberium Wars has to offer in skirmish mode.  Fortunately, these imperfections are easily overlooked with its incredibly satisfying gameplay that deserves the attention of any RTS fan or gamers new to the genre.\n\nGameplay 17/20 … AWESOME\nStory: 0/0 … OMMITED (The campaign never appealed to me, but I never gave it a chance in the first place.)\nGraphics 3/5 … GOOD (The visuals and the customizable graphics config is incredible, but the game is capped at 30 FPS.  After a ton of research, I simply couldn’t find a way to unlock the framerate without messing up the game.  The speed of the actual gameplay directly relates to the framerate.  That means the game will slow down whenever the framerate dips below 30, which is incredibly bizarre.)\nSound/Music: 5/5 … PERFECT (Great theme and there’s some awesome music when combat triggers.)\nControls: 5/5 … PERFECT (Impressive UI and customizable hotkeys.)\n\nOverall: 86% (30/35) … GREAT\n","April 9, 2013","true","22.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It delivered better graphics and better netcode (the franchise's previous game "Generals" would crash every other time in multiuplayer) but the gameplay was a huge step backwards, with the only required tactics being to build tanks which could easily defeat defenses, infantry, air units and other tanks.  There was no need to build anything else and as a result the game became very simplistic and predictable.\n\nThe AI in CNC3 was also a step backwards from Generals.  It didn't attack with mixed units most of the time, and it rarely defended it's base at all.  When it did it often used just one type of defense, which of course makes for an easy attack.\n\nOut of frustration, a friend and I worked on a mod with the help of the rest of the TALON Clan.  The TALON Mod made a lot of changes to the game that made it much more balanced, fun, challenging and enjoyable to play.  Look for it on ModDB.","May 16, 2012","true","132.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love RTS's, and this one hits the mark for me. Out of the last 4 games that have came out recently, my opinion is that this is the best one. I have spent countless hours on this game just developing strategies for each race, learning weaknesses and strengths, and the advantages they have over military, economy, and defensive measures.\nI love the single player campaign as well, such an enticing story! Gets you sucked in, and you will be at the finish line before you know it!\n\nEverythinng about this game is golden! I really wish they could remake this game, maybe a new update or patch, but i read that they shut the company down who was overseeing this game. Cannot create clans, no patches or updates, and no exp. packs besides Kanes Wrath. So that is the only downside i see to this game, other than that, mappacks and mods really add to the complexity of this game!\n\nOver all scoring of all the C&C games for Command & Conquer 3,\n92/100.\n\nHope this review helps you choose this game.

Firstly, more than one build que. While there's nothing wrong with the originals build que, it didn't exactly let me build an army quick, or help me build units to defend my base. Second, the mods the community has made. ods like Tiberium Essence really balance out the gameplay and offer TRUELY different styles of gameplay. The original's balancing wasn't bad persay, but it did more often than not rsult with GDI/Scrin steamrolling everything. The community really tries to stay lore friendly aswell, with The Forgotten aiming to tell the story of the Forgotten mutant faction.\n\nAgain I really wish I grew up with the Command nad Conquer franchise, but I suppose it's heartwarming to see a newer generation appreciating these games.

Other than that however, it's fantastic (omg michael ironside <333).\nThe gameplay is quite amazing, very fun, though unit pathfinding is quite bad. Frequently, moving groups of units, mostly ground vehicles, will have them going all over the place, into different directions, and sometimes they'll just sit still and not move despite your orders to have them move. This can become frustrating very quickly, especially in skirmish and multiplayer games where this can delay an attack.\n\nBut overall, C&C3 is a brilliant game. Though it doesn't capture the dark and gloomy atmosphere of Tiberian Sun, somehow missing out the world looking like it was recently all on fire and the legendary ion storms, it is graphically stunning. From the maps in general down to individual units themselves, C&C3 looks just beautiful. It was a joy to play through.\n\nBuy this game. If someone doesn't like it then they probably only don't like EA and decide that means it's awful. Or maybe they legitimately have a reason. I don't know. I don't really care. Just buy it. 8/10\n","January 30, 2014","true","93.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are a big CnC fan, you will love this, I have been a huge fan, I own every other CnC game, and the only one that really disappointed me was CnC 4.  If you have never played CnC before this would be a good start, especially if you have a newer PC that won't run the older games.  Even though EA made the game, not WestWood, this is still a great game, I am not disappointed at all at this game.\n\nHere are some of the good reasons\n\nThe game play is great, fun and challenging at the same time.\nThe graphics are very good for it being made in 2007.\nThe single player story is very fun, I have played it many time over, when your about half way through the new faction appears, whic is a great plot twist.\nThe controls are easy to understand.\nIf you buy multiple copies, it is very fun to play with your friends, and family either online or LAN.\n\nThis is the only bad thing about the game in my opinion.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that the multiplayer seems to have some connection issues, but other than that, it is a fun experience.","June 5, 2014","true","166.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nurdoidz/recommended/24790/","nurdoidz","Nurdoidz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nurdoidz/","109 products in account","Note: I have this game on Origin with 335 hours prior to purchasing on Steam.\n\nCommand & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars is a worthy addition to the C&C franchise. It runs well and is generally bug-free — though a few irritating bugs are present, such as: sometimes, while in a skirmish game against an AI, stealth is useless. Their units follow your stealthed units around as if the unit was visible.\n\nThe game butchered the 'tiberian' canon somewhat from the previous games. Originally, 'Tiberium' used to be some sort of organism; a plant that crystalizes minerals from the ground and emits poisonous gases. This entity was sent to the earth by the Scrin to transform Earth into a planet suitable for them. In this game, they completely changed the chemical composition of the entity. Instead of an alive plant-like organism, 'tiberium' is now a crystal that acts like some sort of lifeless radiative substance sent to Earth to crystalize the entire planet for mineral harvestation.\n\nAside from the canon, the storyline is... okay. It's not great, but if stories aren't your thing, it's passable. If you're joining the series without prior C&C experience, the story is not really that interesting.\n\nAs an RTS title, I would say it is disappointing. Work has gone into balancing and unit design, and generally works, but as a balance system alone, it is pathetic. In order to win, you need less strategy and more tank-rushing. Infantry are almost useless and aircraft aren't far behind.\n\nA good point of consideration is the availability of mods, however. There are some mods that add desperately-needed balancing changes to make the game require an actual brain. There are also mods that boost the total hours you are going to get out of this title by converting the game to fit with unique themes, such as: Dune II, Cold War era, modern warfare, etc.\n\nConclusion\nI would recommend this game only if you have been introduced to the C&C series prior to the release of this title. If were looking at it purely as an RTS, it does okay. You might want to pass it up if your standards are somewhat high. Otherwise, I suggest giving it a try. I love the game.","May 27, 2014","true","179.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I was unable, however, to get it up and running in 4k, oh well, 1440 is plenty suffice.)\nThe amazing gameplay I have grown to know and love over 25 odd years is firmly entrenched in this version. Exceptional production values, great acting from Michael Ironsides (Starship Troopers) and Billy Dee Williams (Star Wars), and just overall brilliant polish throughout Tutorial, campaign and Skirmish.\n\nA steal at $4, but well worth any asking price in my humble opinion.","June 14, 2015","true","19.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mainly I think in my opinion, they made the game to futuristic but thats with a lot of Command & Conquer. If you only like Generals or Zerohour this game will take a lot of getting used to with the differences. 1 is that in the command center you build the buildings in there then you get to choose where to put it when its done. Tiberium exposure is extremely annoying because if they stay in tiberium for to long it poisons your troops and kills them. In my opinion this is the only good Command and Conquer on Steam. Otherwise my favorite is Generals. As for game play, even easy can defeat you if your new to the game. Easy just attacks you but doesn't make any super weapons. If you have a good defense you are fine. I will give this a thumbs up but they could have improved a bit more on graphics and campaign.","April 13","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All people have different opinions and perspectives.\nNot to mention, I just wanted to fill my review quota for today.\n\nSo I can say this is one of my most favorite stratagy games.\nAs I am huge on strategy games.\n\nFor the combat,\nIt's your base combat game, but detailed to a good perfection.\n\nSome examples are, well if you train infantry they might sit around a wall when they're near one.\nAnd they each have some interesting about them rather it be the spot on voice acting or the unit crouching when getting shot at by heavy fire. There's a lot of small bits of animation posing and it really brings the infantry alive.\n\nAs for vehicles, they are your standard.\nExcept what I love about them is some can actually run over units.\nAnd have interesting accuracy.\n\nThis allowing you to deter large swarms a of infantry by running them over with a tank.\n\nAs for factions\n(I'm going to sum this up Horribly lmao)\n\nYou have the Brotherhood Of Nod,\nThey're stealth oriented but can become a major threat even without stealth.\n\nYou have the GDI,\nThey're army oriented, kinda earths defense force. Not much stealth but more tank like.\n\nAnd the Scrin,\nThey're aliens and I can't describe them too well. They're faster at resource collecting with mediocre units (I presume?)\n\nAnd that's all.\nGDI<Scrin<Nod\nNod<GDI<Scrin\n(As far as I think the circle of life for these guys go)\n\nNow as for the game itself,\nGreat voice acting,\nFrostbite 2 engine really tops off some of the details for the time of release,\nAnd personally I can say this is close (besides for Kane's wrath and a few other C&C Titles released before C&C 4)\nThe last good C&C game EA released. As for C&C 4, if you enjoyed this, stay far away form C&C 4. Don't even try to touch it with a 10 foot pole.\nAlso again animations and good base building.\nIt all pays off to my liking.\n\nI'm no IGN,\nBut this is about a 8.5/10.\nNothing's perfect but this game is great!","May 20","true","82.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
