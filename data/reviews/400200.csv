Give that man a bonus! A huge bonus!  Now time to do damage control, figure out what happened by exploring the surroundings and if possible get off the planet again.\n\nGameplay: Runs in a linear fashion and once an area is completed it is "closed" off and can not be returned to.  What is  different about this game is there are two teams.  Half way through the game when the first team finishes their objective the gamer switches to the second team.  There is a point and click element to this game mostly in the gathering of inventory items to use for a specific task.  Yes, screwdrivers and hammers are needed and can actually be found.  And there are game comments concerning the use of other equally capable objects which basically state a better object is needed.\nI will note here there are some typos and the occassional skewed find for example a magnifying glass is called a lens and masks are not goggles.\n\nI suggest reading the hand held PC unit since it is the clue giver through pictures and instruction.  What needs to be done is more and less explained either through PC unit pictures, game comments, at times made by crew members, or through silhouette pictures shown above the task object in question.\n\nThere are three levels of difficulty casual, advanced, and hard.  As the difficulty level increases the less clues the gamer is given.  Note: Only on the hardest level will an extra NPC character appear (the survivor of a previous space crash) and this is the only way to achieve the final two achievements.\n\nAchievements: All are earned through gameplay.  Again the survivor and all complete achievements can only be earned on the hardest mode.\n\nHidden Objects scenes:  Many.  Ahh, to play a hidden object game that actually focuses on hidden object scenes, yes!  The HO scenes run from windowed area list finds with some interactive finds to complete game scene finds.  There are also "find x amount".  In one case of "find x amount objects", the search is over two game scenes.  The gamer can actually "walk" right through most find scenes to the next area and some find scenes have extra mini locations.\nA note here: Often after the HO scene is played the gamer needs to leave to progress the game then return to do some other task which was previously unavailable (either as an HO find or as an inventory pick up).  One comment about the HO objects:  They basically seem like random piles of junk, but then again these are crashed space crafts so randomness is expected.\n\nPuzzles: There are some head scratchers and a frustrating puzzle or three.  The puzzles break down into two catergories 1) the usual how do I do something like build a ladder or get that object over head and 2) actual puzzles which include rotating picture puzzles, sliders, matching, color, logic and code breakers (those door lock hacking puzzles which my son tells me are like those in Far Cry 4).  There is one lock picking puzzle which is very difficult to figure out.  The directions for some of the puzzles are vague or not explained well so feel no shame using the hint or skip buttons, especially since there is no penalty.\n\nOverall the game is a challenge but not needlessly so, and the overall gameplay logic makes sense.  My only complaint is the end game and can be summed up as What was that? and What just happened?  But who am I to question anything when the space craft gets miraculously repaired and is outer space flight worthy. (And no, I do not think that last line is a spoiler, especially since the mystery is never solved.)","December 25, 2015","true","8.2"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/400200/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1791 products in account","The Mystery of a Lost Planet is telling the tale of the crew of a spaceship that crashed on a mysterious planet, after being pulled down by a gravitational field. What will they discover? How will they go back to their homes?\n\nYou're not a particular member of the crew, you're playing all of them without disctintion. For example, the doc is asking you to find crystals and flowers, however, when you're using the flashlight, it's himself that says he lost it. Same for the other team... Because, in reality, you're playing two teams; the first one exploring the forest and the other one an older ship that crashed and the surroundings.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is focused on list of items, as you have many of them throughout the adventure. There are some puzzles too, true to the description, that they're rare in the genre: attempt to guess a password for example. But I must say that without proper instructions, you're often wondering what you have to, even in casual. I had an hard time at the beginning too because I couldn't find an area that was nearly obstructed by your PDA recording the finding. The hidden objects scenes themselves can be a challenge. You need to think: ball of thread was in reality a rope or lens is a magnifying glass.\n\nGiven the mysterious nature of the planet, the scenes are also superb with strange plants, caves and even an underwater passage. However, it's alternating with a ship that crashed, another one, more reminiscent of our own world, floating on the water... The soundtrack is also reflecting the ambiance of the game.\n\nAnyway, for 5 bucks, it's a nice little game. You can go ahead.\n\nPS: for those asking themselves where is the survivor of the wreck, play in Expert, he should appear quickly :p","December 20, 2015","true","2.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/recommended/400200/","Fluoxx","Fluoxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fluoxx/","472 products in account","PositivesPlot: I thought the plot and premise was quite good. I don't know why but I kept thinking of a game called The Dig whilst playing this, got a similar vibe for some reason. I'll comment later on in the review how this was let down in some ways but otherwise it's one of the more interesting hidden object games on Steam.\nAesthetics: Some locations look a bit too similar IMO but that doesn't stop the game looking pretty. The music was also quite atmospheric which is always nice in a HOG. The UI is okay but getting the inventory bar out of the way got a bit annoying sometimes ;)\nAchievements: While some might see this as a negative it was a nice break to play a HOG without any punishing achievements! Depending on the difficulty level you play through, you can also get them all in one run which may appeal to some people :)\nValue for money: I got just over 3 hours of play time out of this game and for once it wasn't one I'd leave running in the background while I wandered off to do something else. That was one full run through then a short play through just to get one of the achievements I'd missed, so to me this game has paid for itself in game time. There are games on Steam for more money than this that offer less content!\nHints: I was getting butt mad and was going to review this game differently until I realised it was my own fault I was struggling! Use the little mobile PC in the bottom left of the screen, it contains a lot of information that will help you. I assumed it would just be like the typical HOG diary and log what you had done but it actually gives you some nice little hints ;)\nPuzzles: The puzzles in this game are a lot easier than other HOGs on Steam IMO but I didn't see this as a bad thing, the game more than makes up for it with the hidden object puzzles, of which there are a-plenty ;)\nNegativesBackpedalling: Maybe it's just me but I get bored quite quickly with hidden object games that require a lot of clicking back and forth between screens to trigger events. There isn't too much of it in this game, but there are times where you will be looking around for ages trying to figure out where to go and it's because the screen you were on ten minutes ago has an event but because you didn't go back to it immediately after leaving that screen.\nCut scenes: Don't hate me but I can be super impatient, so waiting for an oiler to oil four seperate pieces of machinery really slowly just sets me off haha! I wish some of the actions and cut scenes were a bit faster, purely because I want to get back to the game. Just personal preference though ;D\nText: The only thing I really disliked with any depth was the text in this game. I think the vibe the developers were going for was great, but it was ruined by multiple typos and poor translations. This isn't the only HOG on Steam to have this problem, and it doesn't make me think any less of the game but I think it's selling the game and all the hard work put into it short.\nTLDR: A nice take plot wise, two seperate teams were an interesting concept. Marred by some poor translations/typos and occasional backpedal frenzies but otherwise a well thought out HOG that is definitely every bit a HOG! Lots of hidden object puzzles that are challenging at times. If you're looking for a relaxed game that is easy to 100% then Mystery of a Lost Planet is a bargain :)","January 10","true","3.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I only put positive due to it's very low price and Steam cards and achievements.\n\nThe graphics are pretty meh, at least in my opinion, in comparison to some of the beautiful HOG's I've played from Artifex Mundi or Madhead Games. I also play on a wide screen so it makes it worse with a bit of a stretched look but truthfully for the price and achievements I decided to keep the game. If anything it passes an afternoon.\n\n* I have been corrected thanks to Vic! No ending bug. The "survivor of the wreck" only appears in Expert Mode. So if you don't play the game on expert difficulty you will miss out on 2 achievements in the end.","December 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"
