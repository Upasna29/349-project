Maybe they're expecting it to be a fast-paced action game or something like that which it definitely isn't.\n\nIt's a detective game with an interesting story and characters that draws you in. It's also pretty novel in that you're playing a criminal-turned-detective's ghost who's trying to find the identity of his killer. You spend the game collecting clues to figure out your killer's identity while stopping along the way to help out other lost souls in little sidequests where you figure out how they died so they can pass on. There are also lots of collectibles, some of which provide background for the story, such as notes left by the main character's wife, or that unlock stories about unsolved crimes connected to hauntings. You end up collecting a lot of clues and you have to figure out which ones will help you solve whatever crime you're working on. They make sense and its fun. I've noticed a few negative reviews saying the clues don't make sense and you end up just clicking on everything till you get it right. I only did this once at the beginning of the game...and all I can say is, try thinking a bit and paying attention before just mashing your mouse. If you do this, you'll pretty quickly get a feel for how the clues work in the game and figure out which ones are useles. You can also posess the living, and while you can't move them, you can help them remember and eavesdrop on their conversations or thoughts. You can, however, posess cats which allow you to reach places you can't reach on your own. Everything about the game makes sense...you can't walk through the outdoor walls of buildings that have been consecrated, the demons you have to sneak past to take down from behind are souls who never passed on, etc. The mood the game sets just enhances the experience, being creepy and immersive.\n\nOverall, this game is a lot of fun. Story is great, gameplay is fun, voice acting is well done. Having finished the game now, the story is a pretty good detective story, with everything falling satisfyingly into place at the end and a few neat twists. There are only a few drawbacks: the graphics aren't the best, but they're still decent (especially the lip synching); sometimes when you posess someone and listen to their thoughts you'll hear the same thought in different people; the parts where you have to sneak behind demons and take them out can be a bit tedious. However, all these are definitly worth overlooking.\n\nThe other drawback is that the game is a bit short. I finished it in 7 hours, and if you check out my achievements you'll see I didn't get 100% completion. I did all the side-quests and found as many collectibles as I could. You could probably stretch it out to 10 hours if you wanted 100% completion which seems totally possible in a single playthrough. Its up to you to decide whether a 7-10 hour game is worth $60 or if you want to wait for a sale.\n\nIn short, if you like story-driven games, or mystery/adventure games then you'll probably like this game. If you want this game to be a gritty shooter, then go buy Max Payne instead, because you won't get that with this game. Having finished it, I would now give it between a 7 and an 8 out of 10.","June 3, 2014","true","7.5"," 902 of 1,030 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","902","1","0","40"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/233290/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Murdered: Soul Suspect is an adventure detective game, which was released in mid-2014 on PC, PS3, PS4, 360 and Xbox One. The game was developed by Airtight Games; which hadn't released anything worthwhile for a while before this game.\n\nYou play the role of detective Ronan O'Connor, based in a town called Salem in USA. The story is based around hunting down a serial killer by the name of "The Bell Killer". Ronan is killed by the serial killer at the beginning of the game and you are revived as a ghost and must find the killer before he can move on to the afterlife.\n\nThe game is played in a third person view as you wander around the town of Salem, the town is split into a couple of separate areas, such as churches, graveyards petrol stations etc. As you progress through the story, you learn a few different abilities, such as being able to teleport yourself short distances, being able to possess other living beings allowing you to read their minds or being able to influence their decisions in dialog scenes. The main game play element is solving the mystery of the killer; you do this by investigating the crime scenes for clues on the killer, and trying to predict their next move. This takes on a similar way of doing things as games like LA Noire has done; in that you have to find specific items of evidence scattered, and sometimes hidden around the crime scene in order for you to put them all together in order to resolve the scene. This can lead to quite a few moments of where you need to study all the evidence put in front of you in order to solve it giving it a real detective vibe.\n\nOn top of these detective scenes, there is a small element of combat in the game - as you are a ghost, living humans are not able to detect you; however the demon souls of the death world can. You have to remain hidden to these ghosts in shadows before being able to pounce out behind them to kill them by pressing a few key sequences in a small QTE - these combat scenes are very few and far between however and aren't really anything to rave about as they become very monotonous as you progress in the story.\n\nVisually, Murdered: Soul Suspect looks nice. The whole game takes place in the time frame of one evening, so the darkness of night gives the game a very eerie feel to it. It doesn't have ultra-realistic graphics, but all of the characters are well animated. There are a couple of poor quality textures, however given that this is a sort of open world game, this can be forgiven somewhat.\n\nThe story in Murdered: Soul Suspect is something really special. From the opening scene, I was completely drawn into the plot and was able to fully immerse myself in this world being unfolded in front of me. As you progress, you come across other characters who aid Ronan in his efforts to solve the mystery and you grow attached to them too. The story is 100% linear though; there are no game changing decisions which you have to make which disappointed me slightly. But the overall plot which is being shown here is really interesting.\n\nAs this game is being categorized in the horror genre, I would of expected a little more from the sound effects, but I was let down by the fact that there isn't anything really that scary in Murdered: Soul Suspect; the scariest I came across was the demon's you encounter; and even they are tame and the lack of any jump scares or horrifying scenes was a let-down too. Every character you find in the game is fully voice acted to a high quality though. None of the voicing sounds off or cringy which is always a plus.\n\nI found that there was next to zero levels of difficulty in Soul Suspect; the lack of any real combat leaves this game without any skill element, and is purely based on your ability to solve the crime scenes by finding the relevant clues - I was able to resolve all of the crime scenes with a 3 star rating 99% of the time (you are scored out of three). The hardest point I found has to be due to the game's controls which I will go into on the technical issues section of this review.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect is a vast open world game; you are able to go wherever you want, whenever you want (within reason). There is absolutely tons of stuff to explore and investigate not related to the main plot. There are a number of side investigations you can complete in the early chapters, but these slowly become less and less common as you progress and focus more on the main plot. Another huge part of this game is finding the collectables; this has to be the game with the most collectables in I have ever played - there are hundreds to find.  Each level has its own version of collectable items, and there are also the overall games collectables which unveil even more about the main character's past, and information about the killer. Due to the fact that there are so many of these to find; I felt a little overwhelmed by trying to find them all and just sort of with the approach of picking any up which I come across whilst completing the investigations.\n\nI finished Murdered: Soul Suspect in just over thirteen hours; this was with doing all of the side investigations, and collecting over a hundred collectables. I also took the time to playout all of the dialog options with all of the characters and spent a lot of time exploring the town of Salem. Sadly though; there is no reason what so ever to play through this game for a second time; you are not able to change the story in anyway nor are you able to ramp up the difficulty simply because there is no difficulty there in the first\n\nI had a couple of technical problems whilst playing. Firstly I was playing on my high end rig, on 1080p settings and even though the majority of the time the frame rate was over 100 fps, it still felt like it was stuttering at times. I had to play with v-sync off because otherwise this locked gameplay to 30fps which looked horrendous. Cut scenes are also played out in 30fps in the game graphics, which makes the transitions between gameplay and cut scenes feel a little off too. The game's controls during the combat scenes also came across as clunky too; I often found myself not actually completing the QTE presented because it's not clear which buttons you have to press and what you can let go of which meant a lot of running and hiding from the demons due to failed attempts at killing them.  Finally the last issue I had was there are quite a few invisible walls to be found to, these often are in places where you would not expect them, leading to moments where you'll find you are suddenly floating in mid-air because you've walked into a wall and are trying to climb up it - this is something which can affect the immersion of the game and it's a shame that it is still in it given it's been out for well over a year now.\n\nI am going to recommend Murdered: Soul Suspect; it has an amazing story which you really do need to experience in order to fully appreciate it, and has an original concept. The linear gameplay, lack of any many action scenes, and a couple of technical issues renders me unable to recommend it more than just that, a recommendation to play. The full price of £19, 99 is also slightly over marked too, so you may even want to wait for it to hit the sales before purchasing.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroesorghosts/recommended/233290/","heroesorghosts","Ann-Marie_D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heroesorghosts/","85 products in account","From the first article I read about this game I was hooked. Investigating your own murder and other crime scenes as a ghost? Yes please! The idea seemed so original and any screen shots I had seen looked awesome.\n\nSo I get the game and the first half hour is awesome. You'll have fun getting used to the controls and your own abilities as a ghost, but it didn't take me long to lose interest in walking through walls and making printers/TV's malfunction because at the end of the day, you rarely stumble across anything interesting or you get little to no reaction from the living people in the area. I mean come on! if I'm a ghost I want to be able to scare the living. Not just distract them from guarding that door for 20 seconds.\n\nSo let's get down to the things that really got on my nerves.\n\n(1) Gameplay - It gets repetitive. Honestly, you'll find yourself running across the city/buildings where  your obstacles will be either one of  two things.\n\n- Oh there's a demon there? better sneak up on them and extract their soul.\n\nOr\n\n- Oh would you look at that, a fiery pit straight to hell is blocking my path. Luckily for me there's  this person here I can possess, who's sole propose seems to be walking down this hall for the rest of their lives.\n\nOh which leads me to another thing, if you give us the ability to read minds, actually have the characters think interesting stuff that's personal to them, instead of the same thing like, "Oh its cold outside" or "I hope they find that killer" Seriously, a little variety never killed anyone. (There's a pun in there somewhere.)\n\n(2) Skills/abilities - You will pick up skills as the story progresses, skills like teleportation....eh and umm teleportation. So on top of being able to posses people,(and don't be fooled, the most exciting thing you might get them to do is move their hand from blocking that page you want to read.) reveal the events that lead up to peoples deaths and maybe another ability that I have forgotten about, that leaves you with about 5 (give or take) skills. Not much and nothing that's gonna make you sit up and go F*** Yeah!! with excitement, which is disappointing.\n\n(3) NPC's - If we were back in the early 2000's I might forgive this but there is a serious lack of character models for the npc's (there's about four different character's for each sex, who will either have  one of three different voices, all of whom usually say the same dialogue.)\n\n(4) Collectables - For example once you've collected the 15 or whatever amount of saws, a memory is unlocked. Now considering some of these can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ to collect, you'd expect maybe a flash back to the event. You know a cutscene, an animation. No, what you get is one image that is some what relateable to the story, with a bunch of  text in front of it (and I mean a bunch) and possibly the most life draining narration I've ever had to injure.\n\n(5) Game length - The game is short! I finished it in under 10 hours and this is coming from someone who went out of her way to find as many collectables and whatever other extras there was. (Near the end I gave up, not caring any more and just wanted to finish the game so I stopped putting in any effort.) So for someone who'd only be interested in the story you might be able to get this game finished in 6-7 hours.\n\n(6) Connecting crime scene clues. - Honestly I don't know how to describe this. Once you collect all the clues you'll be brought to a window that asks you a question. You have to click on a clue (or three) that answers that question. Being the generation brought up on CSI you're more than likely going to put on your Horatioto glasses and think long and hard about the choices and outcomes. My advice don't. Pick the clue that when you read it you think "Nah, that's not even a clue. more like a statement/common sense." Watch a lets play of one of these, you'll see what I'm talking about.\n\n(7) Deus Ex desktop screens - Awesome the first computer screen I saw it on but when every police officer in the station seems to be playing Deus Ex on their work computer no wonder you haven't found the killer.\n\n\n\nWhoa, okay I've complained a lot about this game. I don't want to come off too hard on it. There are some pro's.\n\nPro's\nSpooky S*** - There are some legitimate scary scenes and dark deaths and twists in this game. Some that will really make you feel for the characters.\n\nVillian - I never wanted to punch someone in the face more. Well done on making a completle d*** of a villian.\n\nYou get to posses a cat. Press A to meow.\n\nOkay I ran out of pro's..... but it isn't that bad. To me I feel that the idea behind the story had so much potential but failed to deliver. The end result is that it seems lazy and half ♥♥♥♥♥, which you will feel while playing the game. It's worth a play through but do not buy this at full price.\n\nLast word: If Patrick Swayze was a cop in Ghost and Whoopi Goldberg an annoying emo teenager this would basically be the game adaptation.","January 22, 2015","false","9.8"," 235 of 287 people (82%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","82","235","287","63","5"

The story is OK and the ending twist is OK. But it is simply not worth the asking price of anything over $10 bucks.\n\nYou play the ghost of a murder victim in the town of modern Salem, MA. The goal is to solve your own murder...as a ghost! In the same town where the witch trials took place in real life! How could this possibly be bad?!? Well, you'd be surprised. On paper, this should make for an awesome adventure game. Too bad the execution is horrendous. It's certainly not an action game and it's one step above a Fisher Price point-and-click adventure game (and I love adventure games). The world is as linear as the story. The entire game boils down to "walk around and spam E (maybe R, before E occasionally)" until you hit the cutscene. It's impossible to fail any "investigation" (a very strong word to use in this game) until literally the last mission in the game. And even then, you just repeat it until you get it right. Investigations aren’t dynamic, they never change regardless of what you do. You can't ♥♥♥♥ up investigations in any way. But if you pick the wrong item, the developers decided it would be a good idea to make you re-enter the "which item is it?" screen over and over until you get it right. No, it couldn’t just stay open, that would make too much sense. The controls in general are bad. You can’t mouse click anything and the camera sensitivity is high no matter which setting you use.\n\nThe NPCs standing around are useless. If you're like me, and you like to absorb story in your games, you'll learn pretty quickly to not even bother "possessing" them because nothing they say is ever relevant or interesting.\n\nThere are demons in this game. Demons, in a game about souls....whodathunk. Too bad they're the most irritating part of the game. They are obviously in the game as filler and annoying filler at that because they tend to pop up when you have to backtrack (which you do a lot of, btw). It's like the devs knew this game was short so they needed to find a way to stretch it out. You “fight” the same type of demon throughout the entire game and how you deal with them never changes. They have pre-determined patrol paths and you simply wait until they have their backs turned and then you "execute" them during a quicktime event.\n\nNone of the characters are very likeable. The main character is kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it’s very easy to forget the name of the others. In a game filled with ghost, you would think there would be some awesome death or haunting stories, but there really isn’t. Maybe one or two are interesting (mostly in a sick way), but the rest are “waaaaaahhhh, I’m dead! Whhhhhhhhyyy” that you quickly get tired of.\n\nAnd it’s all topped off by credits that are unskippable and seem to go on for 3 hours. Shame, this game had some really interesting ideas that I feel would have been better realized by a more capable studio. The sound effects are really good, and the environment with the old Salem blending with modern Salem is nice to look at. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game filled with souls, but ultimately, it’s really lacking one of its own.\n","June 6, 2014","false","7.0"," 548 of 719 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","548","719","0","17"

A serial killer known as The Bell Killer is terrorizing Salem, stalking and butchering young woman in a gruesome fashion reminiscent of its famous past. Taking on the role of Detective Ronan O'Connor, a former juvenile delinquent and all round bad boy turned good, your fate appears to be initially quite simple: Wrong place, wrong time - or is it?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330033152\nMURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT, the new supernatural thriller from Airtight games who brought us the wonderful Quantum Conundrum and the not so wonderful reboot of Dark Void, is a pleasantly passable affair for any armchair detective out there. It has an interesting story filled with twists and turns and red-herrings galore (not all of them making much sense in the cold light of day unfortunately) and it evokes a fantastically eerie atmosphere (think the movie The Skeleton Key) thanks to some really creepy and creative environments and a back-story that involves the Salem Witch Hunt trials from the late seventeenth century. Impeccably voiced by a cast of seasoned voice professionals and featuring sound and audio design only the best publisher money can buy, MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT plays out like any modern day thriller you would catch on a Friday night at the movies to ebb away the toils of a hard week at school, university or work.\n\nWhile the central mystery to MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT is indeed a thrilling journey, its rather heavy-handed approach to giving its main protagonist some definition is often so blunt it may as well be walking around town dropping anvils on peoples heads. It borders on being almost too puritanical especially for a game with such a modern day setting. Rather than subtly hint at Ronan's past as a boy with a murky past the gamer is constantly hit on the head with a jack-hammer as it drives its points home. I am not entirely sure in what world an obscenely tattooed man (given that in today's climate, tattooing oneself excessively can be a rather expensive en devour) is grounds for defining a poor and violent upbringing but MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT appears to be madly in love with its clichés.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=327624985\nMost of MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT requires the player to move from A to B and solve puzzles in the process and this where the game commits murder most foul. I am not sure if it's because the game was designed particularly for consoles (and the limitations that brings) but the game mechanics I found were too simplistic and held no challenge whatsoever. Not once did I feel like I was doing any worthy detective work to unmasked this unhinged killer but simply pressing buttons. When I look back at games like Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father or Gabriel Knight: The Beast Within (two very similar themed games that married murder, the supernatural and mystery together perfectly) - both made the player work to unravel the mystery and there was a sense of accomplishment the player felt when finally cracking a particularity difficult section that required all the players wits. None of that is present in MURDERED: SOUL SUSPECT. In fact a monkey can solve this riddle which I found rather disappointing.\n\nWhile graphically the game looks great, thanks to some excellent level design, exploring the town of Salem does start to loose its appeal quite early in. Many environments and character models are re-used add infinium and for such a small game (there isn't a whole lot to explore here) seeing townsfolk that look identical to the previous townsfolk starts to break the immersion the game is so desperately trying to create. The game also features the ability to possess passers by, witnesses and police guards but it's never brought to its full potential with the gamer mostly only being given the opportunity to listen to their thoughts which to be honest are all duller than the dirtiest of dish water. These inner monologues also start to repeat fairly quickly which results in a Salem that feels more like Stepford. The game also tries to introduce stealth sections into the gameplay but these felt totally out of place and every time the game forced me into this mode I stopped caring for it until they had passed. They are not particularly enjoyable and once again they play out more like stealth-lite for 5 year olds.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=328177727\nMURDERD: SOUL SUSPECT could have been the next Gabriel Knight supernatural mystery for a new generation of gamers but unfortunately it falls a bit short. While it has an engrossing story that should please most fans who care for anything supernatural or anything that involves hunting for serial killers; it unfortunately performs quite a few mystery adventure cardinal sins that ultimately ends up placing it squarely in camp mediocre. One for a sale definitely.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 25, 2014","true","11.4"," 368 of 474 people (78%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","78","368","474","11","22"

It is a wondrous detective story with a supernatural background that takes place in the timeline of one evening in Salem, present time. Salem? Does that ring any "bells"?\n\nAside my unintentionally cheesy joke, this game is about Ronan O'Connor, an ex-con and street dog turned his way straight and decided to become a detective to atone for all his past misdeeds, with a pretty gal for him to impress in the mix, of course. The events of our game start with the untimely demise of our main character. We watch Ronan as his life passes before his eyes in a stream of memories - recorded on his body as tattoos representing milestones in his life. The Bell Killer, notorious series killer who was terrorizing Salem for months now, killed Ronan. But surprisingly, this is the beginning for him rather than an end. Now, he is a ghost, stuck in between worlds until he manages to solve his own murder. Ronan's persistence to seek the truth will take him through an old, dark ordeal in Salem history: Salem Witch Trials.\n\nAs I continue, I have to note that I loved the character of Ronan O'Connor himself. Aside being an ordinary bad boy, he has vulnerabilities, character flaws and a short temper. His death isn't even heroic as most main characters in video games as we see nowadays. He just ventures out, without having anything to loose and without a thought; and bang! He ends up getting hunted and falling to his death. We are able to read an in-depth backstory for Ronan, with Julie's perception from many collectible memory notes within the game, and put together, it portrays the story of a life. I salute developers for presenting Ronan as an original character, different from any darkened vigilante or street thug. As I was playing, I found myself recalling Mickey O'Neil, a gypsy character that Brad Pitt portrayed in Guy Ritchie's Snatch: a reckless and wild rascal, a swindler with a golden heart. He feels much real than any old book knight in shining armor, at least for me.\n\nIf we are to talk about the atmosphere, well, sure. It is a success. Graphics and textures are impressive, alongside the modelling of each and every character. The game manages to present you the feel of an open world: the ghostly, dark remains of the old Salem clashing with the modern, physical environment, Airtight presents us a ghost's perception. It is uncanny and impressive. Combined with a successful voice acting for all characters present: this game is basically L.A. Noire quality with less action packed and more on the supernatural side.\n\nGameplay? Sure, it's nothing extraordinary. We run about the town - collecting a huge number of collectibles for either background story, or some independent creepy ghost stories, or trivial facts about Salem history if we feel like so, by the way - and try to predict the movements of the killer. We even gain a living side-kick as we progress: Joy, a snarky teenage who will become our involuntary aid in the world of the living. There are three defining elements to the game: item collecting, demon hunting and investigation. None of these parts are incredibly well-put, but the story being absorbing, you keep playing. Investigations are quite basic, with little to no chance of guessing wrong and combat section consists of a basic stealth kill for some demons in each new area. Could have been much more, but I won't complain.\n\nIs it worth your time? It surely is, but still I'd recommend grabbing it on sale, so 30 dollars would be a grand exaggeration for what you're getting yourself. The greatest plus of the game for me, was its story. For one time, I really wasn't able to guess the ending, and the precise position of characters involved. I so hope that Ronan's story wouldn't end here. Would it be so much to hope for? Well, we'll see.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 2, 2015","true","20.0"," 91 of 103 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","91","103","9","3"

The trailer alone had me clapping my hands from excitement. However, there's a lot to say about the game itself.\n\nThe concept seems unique at first; a murdered cop who is forced to solve his own murder before he can pass on to the other side, where he can be reunited with his dead wife. It's not an angle you see often. That being said, the game feels empty when it comes to gameplay and the semi-original plot can't make up for it. It feels like all your abilities seem to have huge potential and you have fun playing with them for an hour or so, excited about what more you can do along the way. Then you realise that you're limited to distracting people with flashing lights and walking through a wall (but not all walls, only some walls, obviously) every now and again.\n\nYou also have the ability to possess people, which seems wicked awesome at first. You can possess pretty much anyone you meet and you have the options of mind reading or influencing them. However, the reality of possession is that you possess a person, read their mind and they're like "Oh man, it's sort of chilly today" or "I hate my job" and you lose interest pretty fast when that's all you hear.\n\nIn the end, I'm unsure about whether or not to recommend this game. It's visually pleasing, the voice acting is decent and the idea behind it is worth the time. But the final product is just not satisfying in the long run.\nMurdered: Soul Suspect is another one of those games that you should get if it's 60-75% off, but it's not worth the full price. Overall, it's like a lukewarm bowl of pudding. It's not entirely done and feels a little lacking, but hey, it's still pudding in the end.","July 7, 2015","false","14.4"," 104 of 128 people (81%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","81","104","128","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/233290/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Murdered: Soul Suspect is detective-ghost story told through the interactive-medium of gaming. Murdered is kind of like a combination between a TellTale game, LA Noire, and Alan Wake... But honestly the game is more often than not more like an interactive movie, and I think it's with these expectations that you best experience Murdered.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect tells the tale of a man named Ronan, who at the game's start experiences his own death. He is pushed out of the window by a notorious murderer, who is known as the Bell Killer, who then commences to shoot him seven times in the chest. Ronan grew-up as a criminal in Salem, but changed his ways late in life to become a detective, partially for the woman he loved, Julia. However, he was torn apart a few months earlier, when Julia's life was taken at the hands of a street mugger. At death's door, Ronan discovers he is a spirit to this world, trapped here until he can move on from something that's keeping him bounded here. He finds out that he can be with Julia again in the world beyond our own if he can resolve whatever is keeping him here, so he goes out to try and solve the case of his own murder.\n\nGameplay is rather simplistic in Murdered. You will spend most of your time exploring around, using your ghost powers, and looking for items and clues in the environment. As a ghost, you can freely pass through human-world objects, which essentially makes clipping a gameplay mechanic, but you might be surprised how natural it ends up feeling and due to some good visual cues and sounds it ends up not looking or feeling weird, and makes sense with everything else built up with the game. The only objects you can't pass through are ghost-world objects (relics from the past which are present in the ghost world, and tell-able they're ghost world as they glow with a blue aura), and into or out of buildings freely (ghosts can only enter or exit buildings through open doors or windows). Other powers at your disposal include the ability to possess people, to either read their minds or influence their thoughts, to poltergeist and make objects (mostly machinery) act up, to teleport around by choice, and a few other underutilized but still interesting powers.\n\nThe game splits-up between 'stages' (bigger interior areas usually), and a Salem hub-world. The stages I thought generally got better as the game went on, and Salem was a joy to explore... At first. The problem is that not much really happens in Salem, it stays the same mostly for the whole game so you can literally almost do everything in it the first time you enter the hub-area (with only a few things you can only do once you gain the teleportation power).\n\nAs you explore, there's a variety of content to immerse yourself in the world. There's a lot of side areas and areas off the beaten path. You can approach living people to listen in to conversations they're having with each other, made more amusing you can then possess them and see what they're REALLY thinking. You can approach ghosts, and either talk to them briefly, question them about something they're up too, and very occasionally help them via a side-quest to move onto from this world to the next. However, there are literally only about 3-4 side-quest in the game, and there is obvious content and characters that were left around for more side-quests, but were left-out as cut content. Things like items you can observe for no real reason, characters it looks like you would be able to help but then they cut you short from actually helping them.\n\nAnd then there's the collectibles. This game kind of goes overboard with it's collectibles, but they're pretty enjoyable and expand a lot on the plot, the lore, Salem's history, character background's, additional cinematics, and my personal favorite, ghost stories. Extended from this, the investigation scenes usually have you looking for and going about collecting clues, and then putting together the clues that matter to a particular solution or outcome. These typically were rather simple, and sometimes felt more like sort of mindless collecting to get to the point. However, other times they actually felt kind of rewarding. None were really 'puzzles' I would say, but were a mixed bag.\n\nThe only other real gameplay mechanic is demons, which are rather underutilized. I didn't find them offensive, and I'll admit there was a few times when their screeches or them detecting me legitimately startled and scared me. However, there's only one type of demon in the game, you only face a few of them in the game, and their encounters are often brief and they're easy enough to deal with (you sneak up behind them to execute them, otherwise they spot you and chase you down, where you hide in things until they lose interest).\n\nBut then this is a game I'd argue isn't really about winning or losing, it's an interactive film essentially, and on that account it pulls some things off really well.\n\nFirstly, the audio design is fantastic in this game. The voice acting for the main characters are all well-done and performed, and even most minor characters are rather well-voiced (though you'll find a few reoccurring VAs). The ghost stories you can get via collectibles deserve particular praise, as the acting done here really adds a lot to the story, and honestly are really well-done.\n\nBut it's not just the voice acting. The music is very good too, with some good creepy vibes, emotional melodies, and songs to go well to the mystery. The ambiance of sounds in the environment also add a lot, with a lot of attention to detail to help bring the locations alive. And even the game sounds, for solving cases, getting clues, etc., are all satisfying and fitting.\n\nThe story is quite good, especially if you like detective-ghost stories, ala' The Frighteners, Sixth Sense, or the like. While the writing can be a bit hammy at times, they do have some believable dialogue between characters, the story has interesting developments as it goes on, and there are some rather well-done plot twists throughout.\n\nCinematics deserve special mention. The cinematography is really well-done, with fantastic angles, focus, artistic direction, and were a joy to watch.\n\nAnd the characters are well-realized, trope-ish, but manage to be developed and become more than their tropes and have rather realistic relationships with each other. They have fights and don't agree, but come together (sometimes reluctantly), and there are a few heart-warming moments and real development with each other as it goes on.\n\nGraphically it looks good for the sort of niche budget title it is. Some nice attention to detail in environments, some good art direction, and some of the models are rather well poly'd. There's some visual quality dips in certain areas, textures... But not a bad looking game at all.\n\nGenerally, I would label this as a game for gamers who like story, exploring, and world-building above all else. Gameplay really takes a step-down to the game's other elements, and it will definitely strike with its niche. But its lack of action, focus on making what is usually the 'extra' parts of games the main part, and just the general styling and minimal gameplay make it lack that mainstream appeal. I'd also say it isn't worth its $50 pricetag, but felt it was worth it for the $15-25 range.\n\nI'd say if the game interests you, it is worth experiencing... Just maybe not at full price. It is different than your typical budgeted game in this day and age, and is sure to find a cult audience. In some aspects, it's a bit disappointing or under-cooked, but as a whole, this may be one of the best realized classic-styled ghost stories to appear in the gaming medium for years. Like the Fedora or not, Ronan is the perfect tour guide into a very different look at ghosts, Salem, and games with a budget.","June 8, 2014","true","27.9"," 71 of 80 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","71","80","0","1"

Pass through walls, posses people, teleporting,  making the T.V. go wild, things like this make it fun to be one. Of course, being a ghost has to be somewhat dark and taken seriously. After all, being a ghost means you’re dead.\nMurdered Soul Suspect is a game where Ronan, a detective that follows a lead, dies but stays in this world as a ghost and the only thing that keeps him from finding peace is solving the case. The story is very noir like, despite the presence of modern objects, since the dark atmosphere and the mystery  are the things that are unavoidable in this game.  The plot is as it should be,  clear, logic and ended with enough closure to make you realize what a good story it is. In a world where ghosts have many questions, where are mediums that can see that and a killer that hunts those people down, you are the one that provides the answers.  There are ghosts that you can help find peace. There are collectibles that give you a lot of backstory on various topics and characters. There is one murderer that can’t be stopped still loose in this town. All of this is obvious throughout the game and that’s what will keep you hooked.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=412829954\nGameplay wise, the game is easy. To put it simply, you’ll  take walks,  find clues, conclude investigations with the correct solution, execute demons by taking them from behind and collecting stuff if you feel like it. To put it as it is, things are more complex than that, but not much more.  In order to gain clues, you’ll need to look for them at the crime scene , you’ll need to interact with someone or something to find more, which sometimes mean possessing a person, influencing them to think about the topic you need or looking through their eyes.  The things that present a challenge in this game are the demons, that are very much alike with the dementors. They’ll consume your soul if you are exposed to them for long enough.  You can pass by them, or you can execute them by going behind them and using one of your ghostly abilities. Ronan can hide from them by possessing people or hiding in different entities. At the player disposal is also the ability to see the demon from afar, even through walls.Facing the demons are the stealthy section of the game, but they’re not frustrating enough to make the game challenging at all. For completitionists, there are a lot of collectibles to be found, which contain backstories of characters and places, or a separate story.  They aren’t hard to be found and there are more than one good guides, so you could say it’s easy to get all the achievements. The town of Salem is beautiful, varied but after you explore it all, it feels like a small place.  There is free roam until the last mission, but that is useful for those who want to get back to specific locations to get the rest of the collectibles.  Also, if you see an NPC that looks interesting to you, you can posses him and hear what he thinks.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=412831624\nIs the game a great one? No, it’s simply good. It lasts for about 10 hours, it has great concepts and executes them simply, which may be a fault for it, since many said about the game that it had great potential. Still, there’s no other game that can make you have fun for being a ghost like this one.  Passing through walls, possessing people, talking with other ghosts, potterghasting different object to perturb the living ones, it’s all very enjoyable. The theme is dark, some details are gritty, it’s a game where you solve a mystery which has a solution that isn’t obvious at all(the plot-twists turned out to be mind-blowing).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=412830626\nAll in all, Murdered Soul Suspect is a good game that delivers on what it describes itself to be and doesn’t take risks in being something more.\n","March 24, 2015","true","11.8"," 54 of 64 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","54","64","6","1"

I expected an engaging story focused 3rd person game with puzzles and minimal to no combat and in a way thats what you get here, just not well executed.\n\nGraphical Fidelty is mediocre as you would expect from a Console Port and i wouldnt mind if the mechanics and story were up to compensate for that. The Main mechanic of conducting an investigation is for them to designate an area where you look for a set number of clues to tell you what happened. This almost plays like a hidden object game and its really not interesting. At the end you are supposed to select some of the clues to conclude your investigatoin into a story and a little cutscene tells you what you gathered from that.\n\nSometimes you can possess a witness where you can peek through his eyes to find a clue on a screen or notepad, influence his memory by selecting a clue you found so that he reveals more information about that or you can eavesdrop on a conversation. The Problem with all this is that you do it maybe 5 times in the game with some effect while the rest of the time, it doesnt do anything at all. Mindreading in Salem is really boring and i hope the real inhabitants have more going though their head than these NPCs.\n\nThe Game has two types of collectibles which reveal some lore about your former life or a criminal story. The lore bits about your former life or you girlfriend reveal information one at a time which you can access by going into a horrible menu where you have to click on each piece individually to see what it says. And the Navigatoin of the Menu is horrible, the most basic pc-conversion where using your mouse is a pain, they put no effort into adjusting a system for pc which is badly designed from the start. Why dont you let me just click on this! You just dont want to navigate through this to get 2 sentences about the meaning of your tattoos, or how you met your deceased wife.\n\nThe second tye which reveals a little story is even worse, because these are collectibles in a major areas which only reveal their story after you collected all of them. This means you can run around the levels for ages looking for that last piece which extends the game time in a very boring and artificial way. Only some true OCD guys will suffer through that.\n\nAnd they even have more ideas how to prolong their game time. Sometimes there are areas with demons which can end your undead life unless you sneak up behind them and press a button+mouse combination to ban them. So you jump from hiding point to hiding point to get behind them and banish all of them. This is neither challenging nor interesting, its only annoying because you want to get through this part which adds nothing to the game.\n\nAll in all i am very disappointed and if i had payed full price for this i would be furious. The game doesnt know how to tell its story through its mechanics. the mechanics are uninspired and boring and there is a lot of filler to prolong a game wich doesnt have much to offer. I took 7h for the main story line and there was an infuriating bit at the end, where i had a lot of respawns right on top of these black spot which draw you into the abyss. So i got to spawn found myself  dying and reloading several times in a row before i could continue to the end.\n\nI am Sorry but A resounding: Dont Buy! from me\n\n\n\n","October 29, 2014","false","7.7"," 133 of 200 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","133","200","2","3"

The concept was interesting, and I love the genre; however, the excution of the game play mechanics was lacking in any real dept. All of the crime scenes were a fixed camera angle away from being a point and click adventure, and putting the clues together could be done by random guessing without penalty. The characters felt forced, and fell deeply into non-relatable stereotypes that were hard to really care about. I really wanted to like the story, but I kept finding myself just grinding through everything to see it end.\n\nI couldn't see me much functionally wrong with the game, and didn't encounter many bugs; however it just got down right boring. The stealth/combat whatever they were going for with the demons, ended up becoming an annoyance, and half the time I could just run by them without worry. The voice acting, music, and ambient atmosphere were excuted well, and they created the emotions the story was trying to encourage. Unfortunatly the writting its self was too forced, and anti-climatic at best.\n\nI completed the game in about 7 hours without collecting everything, but I did all the side cases I could find.

It is different from those games though, because this is you solving your own crime. That means your a ghost, wandering around the town looking for clues. I would say this is a very unique game, and that's rare these days.\n\nGameplay wise it's simple, look around for clues, draw a conclusion and go to the next place. it's very interesting because you are a ghost and you can simply walk through walls. However you cant go through solid buildings, unless someone opens the door for you. You can also use abillities like poltergeist, mind control and even take over a cat.\n\nThis game is extremely story heavy, and the story is really intresting. It kept me coming back until I was done. Even the simple sidequests really intrigued me and made me want to collect every little collectible I could find.\n\nAbout 1,5 hour of the game is cutscenes and the others are gameplay. It's not that long of a game, but I would actually say this was the perfect lenght. It didn't overstay its welcome and drag out for to long. The story was exciting all the way through, and you could never figure out who it was until the end.\n\nA lot of plot twists in this game, which reminded me of Heavy Rain. The story is great thanks to impressive cutscenes and good voice acting. Any downsides with this game? Only that the demons and the elements were quite repetitive, but that isn't that big of a complaint since the game didn't go on for that long, and I can clearly see that they put the work on cutscenes and story instead.\n\nI really enjoyed my time in this dark and gritty town. This is a game that everyone should play at some point in my honest opinion, it's that damn good. I really hope they will make a sequel or something along those lines.","March 11, 2015","true","18.5"," 37 of 45 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","37","45","2","4"

Murdered: Soul Suspect is a crime drama about a murdered cop on the hunt for his killer. The story ended up being pretty good, a lot of twists and turns throughout, very well done and well written dialogue. If you're looking for a decent story that doesn't drag on, an interactive movie, this is a good purchase. However, if you're looking for more game elements? You won't really find it here. Gameplay is abysmally easy, the hardest parts coming in quicktime events, which are no more than two button combos. The puzzles are no more difficult than "Which one of these reminds you of a cheese sandwich?" *picks the picture of a cheese sandwich*.\n\nThe setting is great, if albeit a little heavy handed (Wait... Salem... has witches?!), and the graphics are nice. The rest of it... just isn't really there. I completed the game (not 100%... like 75%, maybe) in about 10 hours, and do not feel the need to replay it or go back and hunt for the avalanche of clickies throughout.\n\nUnless this drops to about the same amount I paid, I would give it a pass, but $6 feels about right.","December 9, 2014","false","10.6"," 66 of 95 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","66","95","6","0"

I've seen the reviews that put the game at around a 5-6 (mediocre) and on one hand I can see that. The graphics aren't anything amazing and for fifty bucks I'd like to have spent longer than 8 hours to finish the main story. On the other hand, what a fun (if somewhat predictable) story. I especially enjoyed the investigation elements; they're reminiscent of games like L.A. Noire or Condemned: Criminal Origins. Even more, the game is focused exclusively on the storytelling and there's really no combat or action -- it's all about the mystery and puzzles. What little combat there is in the game is mostly based on sneaking around and running away from enemies (you can only attack them from behind).\n\nWhere the game really shines is in characterization and story development. The two main characters, Ronan and Joy, have a great odd couple vibe that had me laughing in spots. Most of the character development for everyone else (and even backstory for Joy and Ronan) happen through collectibles but provide really deep storytelling that is (occasionally) historically accurate and interesting.\n\nI'd recommend this to mystery or noir fans but suggest you wait for the price to come down since the game is so short. I finished all the main story, the "interactive" sidequests AND managed to collect about 75 percent of all the collectibles in my 8 hour play through.","June 3, 2014","true","8.1"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","27","36","0","0"

I would only recommend getting this game when there is a deep sale.\n\nThe pro/con section will be at the bottom of this review .\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect is a detective adventure game where you play as Ronan, an ex-con badass who became a cop to atone for his wrong doings. You get killed by a man in a hoodie and become a ghost. You learn that you need to find clues to figure out who killed you in order to complete your "unfinished business" and be at peace. This game had so much potential to be something great but fell short and left me with an unsatisfactory experience.\n\nGameplay\nThis is a detective game where you play as a ghost in the mortal world. Think about all the things you can do as a ghost, it's going to be awesome!.. Or at least that's what you are led to believe. You start off the game learning that can you can walk through walls, only to realise that there are "ghost walls" all over the town Salem that you can't walk through. These walls are just there to hinder you from exploring the town of Salem and become extremely annoying after a while. Next you learn that you could possess random people and read their minds, only for it to get boring and repetitive after 20 minutes. The people around the town were bland and shamelessly copy pasted and the only thing you get from reading their minds were always something along the lines of "Oh dear a murder, that’s terrible" or "I wish it wasn't so cold". It's the same thing over and over again and eventually you just won't bother with the possessions. Their scripted dialogue with each other is pretty interesting to listen to though.\n\nThe core gameplay has you travel from place to place in order to investigate scenes and solve puzzles. You have to find a couple of clues and then come to a conclusion about what the killer was doing or where he was going to next, much like the crime scene investigations in L.A Noire . However the puzzles are so painfully simple and boring that it doesn't take you long to come to a conclusion. In the end it just becomes a sort of glorified find the object game with an extremely obvious "which one of these objects are related to the crime?" conclusion (seriously, a spoon , a fork, or a key that belonged to the killer? I wonder which of these are relevant).\n\nThe combat system is an extremely basic stealth system where you have to hide from patrolling demons and then execute them when they weren't looking at you. However, like most of the game, demons pose little to no challenge and are just there to hinder you and fill time. The combat didn't evolve over the course of the game and after the 4th or 5th time I heard the demons arrive I just thought to myself "ugh not again".\n\nYou also have several dialogue options to choose from during the story, but these have no effect on the story at all. There are also side quests where you go about helping other ghosts to finish their business and these quests are rather interesting.\n\nThere are collectibles hidden all around the map for you to collect, these will allow you to learn about the town of Salem, Ronan's background as well as give some insight on the killer. Unfortunately there is no map function and also no way for you to check which collectible you already have and which ones you still need to find.  I enjoyed listening and reading the stories about the artifacts I collected and make exploring the town enjoyable, I just wished the damned ghost walls weren't so restrictive and annoying.\n\nGraphics\nThe game is quite good looking and the town of Salem looks great. The ghost structures and mortal buildings complemented each other well to give this dark and gloomy feeling.\nThe main characters looked unique and well designed. There is a 30fps when you have v-sync on, but you can turn off v-sync in game and use v-sync from an external program such as Nvidia's control panel and the game will run at 60fps.\n\nSound\nThe music in this game was pretty good. It set the mood really well and occasionally the music would go eerily quiet to build tension. The combat music also tries its best to build excitement and tension but was unfortunately unable to complement or help the poor combat system.\nThe voice acting in this game was superb and was one of the only reasons why I could finish this game. I enjoyed listening to the conversations between the main characters and especially liked listening to many of Ronan's monologues.\n\nPros\n+ Town looks great when the "ghostly" and "mortal" buildings are mixed together to form a unique hybrid look\n+ Voice acting is superb\n+ Interesting lore and backstory about the town as well as the protagonist\n+ Good chemistry between the main characters\n+ Interesting storyline\n+ Side quests are a nice change of pace\n\nCons\n- Basic and boring combat system\n- Core puzzle solving is too simple and repetitive\n- Extremely linear game\n- Ghost walls are a hindrance\n- Somewhat clunky controls\n- Choices make no difference to the story's conclusion\n- No replay value\n\nIn conclusion this game is an overly simplified detective game with a boring stealth combat system slapped on it. It fails to impress, and with a price tag of $30 I certainly cannot recommend it over other detective games such as L.A Noire","November 6, 2015","false","9.7"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","33","47","0","0"

The voice acting is solid, the writing is generally okay (it's cliched at times, but has some decent moments) and it looks good.\n\nUnfortunately, it is hampered by gameplay which ranges from mediocre to bad.\n\nOn the mediocre side, you are given a mere handful of skills, which are used remarkably infrequently and only in very obvious situations. The detective aspect has some good aspects, but while it mostly avoids LA Noire's tendency towards arbitrary and frustrating sleuthing, it does so by making things terribly obvious and having no consequences for failure. My favourite was a scene where you have to find a key. Not only does the game tell you how to go about getting to the key, it then presents you with a puzzle to pick it up, where you have to choose between the key, a fork and a spoon. Spoiler: the correct answer is the key.\n\nAs for the bad, the combat is hideous. Awkward controls, very limited options and overwhelming noise make for a frustrating experience.\n\nThere's plenty of collectables in the game, some of which are at least a mild challenge to get, but unless you're really into that aspect of it, you're better off just watching the story on YouTube.","July 17, 2015","false","9.2"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","33","47","7","0"

This is a third-person view adventure game that employs some stealth elements and lots of crime scene investigation gameplay mechanics.\n\nThe story follows Ronan, a con-turned-detective who has just been murdered and whose soul - for some reason - cannot leave this world and proceed to Heaven where his wife awaits. We soon learn his killer is the one he was originally after - a couple of cutscenes later his memory is refreshed and he is certain he needs to solve the mystery of the Bell Killer who has been haunting his residential town for a while so that by solving the murder case he can peacefully enter Paradise.\n\nNow, when playing this game I was constantly thinking of the adventure games released by Telltale Games. Why? Because the puzzles are easy and there is a great emphasis on the story immersion. Unlike those Telltale adventures Murdered allows you to control the protagonist and freely walk around in Salem.\n\nStill, I wouldn't really call this an open-world journey as many places are only accessible if the story demands it - the "hub area" is mainly for collectibles and a couple of side missions where you help other ghosts finish their business and ascend once and for all.\n\nThen come the demons. Certain sections require you to hide from the beasts and approach them while they turn away - execution is not mandatory but collecting evidence and other "artifacts" in the areas require you to rid Salem of them for good.\n\nWhile the game is not difficult, at all, and lacks any real combat it does have a great story. I almost completed it in one sitting as I really wanted to see the antagonist dealt with. Murdered has a great atmosphere which is accompanied by a great score and very well done voice acting.\n\nTo summarise: if you are in for a great story and for something new and you do not mind that one playthrough gives you all the experience (a 2nd should only be done for the collectibles) then Soul Suspect is an easy grab - especially with a discount!","November 2, 2015","true","19.4"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","21","26","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/recommended/233290/","Thomas-","Chargeback Thomas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thomas-/","748 products in account","Murdered: Soul Suspect is a detective puzzle(?) game, with some action(?) elements.\n\nYou play as Ronan O’Connor, a cop whose wife died. That's all the back story the game has to offer. Though there was a bunch of collectables, each one had around 2-3 sentences of boring info. So I never bothered to read them, as it wasn't engaging or well wrote at all (much like this review).\n\nRonan is murdered at the start of the game by the Bell-Tower Killer, who Ronan was hunting down. He soon discovers he is a ghost, and he must solve his death to move on to the afterlife.\n\nThe game is open world, in the sense it has a hub of sorts between missions. It's literally just filler to add time to the game as you walk a short distance to the next area. The hub is littered with collectables to find, but they glow up so it's easy to get them all quickly.\n\nInvestigations are poorly done. The only game I could compare this to is L.A Noire. But this feels like the poor man's L.A Noire. It's a total cheap knock-off. Asians are not only making fake American clothing, but games now too.\n\nYou are thrown into an area and must walk about looking for clues. There is no indication of what might be a clue, so sometimes you could be spending upwards 10 minutes looking for the final one. Only to stumble upon by sheer luck, Whereas in L.A Noire, the controller would vibrate, or a jingle would play.\n\nThe clues are also really badly thought out. Most of them are just one word, or a little phrase. Instead of finding proper evidence, you'll get one word like "damage", or "scratch". It's as if no thought was poured into the game.\n\nThe only action in the game consists of you running up behind demons and holding a key, then pressing a QTE prompt that's displayed. There are no more than 20-30 demons in the entire game, so this was very lackluster.\n\nConcluding investigations was poorly done. You'd be shown all the evidence you have found, and must select 1-3 different pieces you think are most relevant to the question asked. But this could be rather arbitrary. As the clues were poorly explained, it was hard at times to figure out the most relevant ones. There are 3 badges displayed at the bottom of the screen. I at first assumed these were lives, and that if I messed up 3 times I would have to start again. But it turned out they are not. There is no failing. If you get it wrong, there are no consequences at all. As there is no point/scoring system, or achievement for getting all 3 badges in every case.\n\nOverall, the story was pretty meh. There was not much to it, and it was rather cliché. Nothing was really explained either, or made much sense. The main focus was figuring out the murders, but there were random things to do with other people tacked in, which seemed silly.\n\nGameplay was pretty bad. Being a ghost was cool, but there were issues with walking through walls. Investigations were poorly done. Again, if you expect another L.A Noire, you're gonna be seriously disappointed. Most actions were performed with pressing a key or two, and there was just nothing to it. You walk up to an item and hit E. There was no examining it, or any of that jazz. Action was non-existent. The whole demon business was stupid and pointless.\n\nThe game takes around 9 hours to complete 100%. Rushing the story and ignoring the collectables will probably reduce that time by around 3-4 hours.\n\nI do not recommend this game, even on sale. It was a drag to play, and I only did so because of the Playfire Rewards.","June 16, 2014","false","8.5"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","31","44","0","0"

It’s amazing I lived as long as I did.” ~Ronan\n\nMURDERED: Soul Suspect is a new game made by Airtight Games, known from their other, warmly acclaimed production: Quantum Conundrum. This time, instead of a puzzle-adventure game devs made sure to provide us with a polished action-adventure suspense story backed with a supernatural mystery. Although professional reviewers are mostly critical about this game, I’ll try to convince You that it’s actually worth both its price and Your attention.\n\nThe Game starts on a high note, with our protagonist – reformed cop Ronan - falling to his death after brutal fight with a mysterious murderer haunting the streets of modern day Salem. Soon he comes to his senses, only to discover that death itself was just a beginning. We end up being trapped on earth, but in a new ghostly form, with our mind set on a one simple goal: to complete our unfinished business, and finally move on to the other side.\n\nUnfortunately for Ronan, this unfinished business involves solving this one last case, which ultimately led him to his own demise by the hand of a dreadful Bell Killer. Luckily our hero is a fast learner, and easily adapts to the new state he’s woken up to. On our quest to hunt down the killer we’ll be using Ronans wits and experience gained as a police detective to find new leads, connect evidences and even access past memories imprinted into the ghost-realms fabric.\n\nThe game consists of two different gameplay modes – first being a free roam explorations, during which we use our ability to pass through objects, summon or cast away solid fragments of the past Salem, and later even teleport to pass beautifully designed locations while finding as much collectibles as we can, and second being much slower ‘investigation mode.’\n\nThe investigations are the most iconic moments of the game, and thanks to their presence many players felt obliged to describe Soul Suspect as “L.A. Noirish”. I’d argue with this opinion, because although in both games we progress through solving some cases the feeling of those is definitely different. In Soul Suspect we conduct our investigations with appropriate supernatural twist by correctly influencing possessed people, linking uncovered evidences or even accessing past memories lingering in the ghostly Salem. In turn Soul Suspects system feels much more simple, and dynamic in comparison to L.A. Noires ‘adjust and question’ model.\n\nLeaving gameplay behind, the strongest point of the game is definitely its scenario. With perfectly written characters and interesting plot twists, Ronans crusade against Bell Killer will be a memorable experience appealing to every gamer. The locations inspired by some of the Salems most iconic buildings are recreated in a great detail, and greatly contributes to the games spooky atmosphere. The whole experience is polished by believable voice overs and sounds, with only minor flaw being games music which felt somehow nonexistent.\n\nThe only serious drawback of the game, is the large amount of collectibles, that makes even ‘Alan Wake’ blush in shame. It’s actually hard to move more than 5 ft without stumbling upon some new note, item or a graffiti flooding us with new information either related to our investigation or the Ronans past. All those stories are pretty well written, but the sheer number of those papers seriously affects immersion preventing us from fully diving into the games world.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect is definitely worth getting and trying especially for its captivating story. The game is definitely a must have for every supernatural events enthusiast, shining brightly in comparison with other productions picking up this subject.

You collect clues and make deductions in the case you are working on in the primary story arc.  The game is pretty linear, which is to be expected for something so focused on story telling; but there is some freedom of exploration.  Much of the backstory and lore can be learned about through the extensive amount of collectibles scattered throughout the levels.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice at max settings and the atmosphere of the game is fitting and done well.  The voice acting is among the best you will find in the realm of video games, which is important since the whole appeal of the game is the story.  It’s a pretty short game, perhaps medium-sized if you decide to get all the collectibles— but it is paced very well, and wraps up right around the time it starts to get stale.\n\nThere is really only one mechanic to the game, which is to move around and pick up clues or artifacts... and maybe use a few bland abilities here and there.  The combat is rare and one-dimensional and never evolves into anything more.  So it feels a lot like a show/movie where you control the main character.  To keep you busy, you can explore the levels to search for collectibles as you play through the campaign.\n\nSo in conclusion I would posit that I enjoyed my playthrough of this game.  It is pretty minimal in terms of gameplay mechanics; but if you are one who enjoys good story-driven games with atmosphere, and who enjoys collectibles in a 3rd-person adventure setting: then you will probably enjoy Murdered: Soul Suspect.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 12, 2015","true","10.9"," 38 of 57 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","38","57","0","1"

You figure out that your purpose why you are still in the ghost world is finding out the killers identity. Last thing you remember is that you were called somewhere to the city centre where was spotted The Bell Killer, a serious killer who terrifies Salem in last weeks. Through the story you are finding out more about The Bell Killer murders with newly obtained abilities, like posses, read mind or influence someone. You are also finding out more about your main character detective Ronan with very difficult to understand past full of criminal records, and also about his dead wife Julia. Identity of your killer is unknown until the last minutes of the game, unfortunately its not that simple and just finding out the who actualy kills is not enought...During the gameplay you have also option to help some of the other ghosts to find peace using your detective skills which is a nice variegation of the game.\n\nI really enjoyed this game, for me it is a game full of interesting stories and some detective elements. In some moments it reminded me of Batman Arkham series, where I was always checking every corner for collectibles and seeking everywhere to reveal and solve another mystery. You can find out some information about history of city of Salem which is known for the witch trials and few ghost stories and of course some of main character's past and thoughts of his wife.\n\nI must admit the ending of the game really surprised me, you really need to play this game until the end to be satisfied. Nevertheless the last part of the game seems tacky, it hurt the game and I would appreciate longer and better ending cutscene.\n\n7/10","February 21, 2015","true","10.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","0"

This is a unique game to be honest, because it surprised me, a whole lot.\nImma do it like they all do, cus it's easier to understand reviews, so here:\n\nPROS:\n-An unique experience (for now)\nThere aren't many games with it's concept being you die and become a ghost solving your murder (not really a spoiler, because the title spoils it all then), and this one is from my perspective done exceptionally well.\n-Voice Quality\nI can't say this is the best voice quality I heard, but the voice is mixed and put together, doing its job of keeping you on your toes, really well.\n-Graphics\nFor the graphics maniacs and the graphicsrexics this is a meet down the middle. For its scenery and location, the graphics fit really good, since it gives this dark, mysterious vibe with a dash of detectiveness.\n-Story\nOh. I absolutely loved the story (I haven't finished it yet (at about 7,5 hrs right now) but I know I'll be too lazy to edit this review, but I know I'll love it, so y'know), and some moments in it are a really well done,unique, some other important adjective of a moment. It's what it is - great.\n-Demons\nWell, I wasn't really expecting them and I was scared sh*tless at first (still am at times ;D), but you get used to them. They offer a new type of enemy, but in an interesting form, making it something you probably won't see soon.\n-Clues\nThese little sons'a'b*tches are tricky but fo' real entertaining and I think that with time I started enjoying myself, when I got the answers to various questions about, ''why this happened'', ''why that happened'' and them putting them together, reminds me of Sherlock Holmes in a way, yet unclear to me. Checking IGN guides on where stuff is also happens quite often (often being almost everytime).\n-Collectibles\nA lot of em. A lot. Which is good (?), but what's even better is, that at any time when you're in the town, you can go to various interiors (since collectibles are more or less spread out across interiors), and collect the ones you might've missed.\n\nCONS:\n-There aren't any cons\n\nI enjoyed it, and the achievements make for some work, but you get the hang of it.\nAlso, when this first came out, I was oh-so-not interested in it, but after time (time being about a year later), it was on sale and I said ''why not''.\nP.S I don't think I regret it.

Because of this unfinished business, he gets stuck between hell and heaven, wandering in the world of living, invisible to the naked eye, only able to interact with human mediums. As you learn the ropes of this supernatural world, you start collecting clues and putting all the stuff together. The ending blew my mind, really. Some people may say it's too short for a fully priced title but I think the time was appropriate for the told story and filler missions would only ruin the ambience of certain urgency in the air. Perhaps this should have been something episodic, one murder story - one episode. But we all know that is not happening anytime soon.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect has an awesome story and I enjoyed uncovering the case in L.A. Noire-ish style. Playing as a ghost? Very nice, not a common thing in games. Possesing people, reading minds, communicating with mediums? Sounds awesome, seems like these devs are taking the ghost business seriously. Being a murdered detective investigating his own murder? I'm sold.\n\nThese ideas are great but something went wrong and they were kind of poorly executed. My guess is the developers either got lazy and told the janitor to put together some pieces of the game because they were busy actually working on the main storyline and side quests that really got some love. Or they were rushed by the greedy publisher, what do I know. But some details are just like whatever. Details so strong in numbers that I couldn't just ignore them after a while. For example: Reading minds of the entire city - extremely few lines that keep repeating even between different people. Musicless, slow, unskippable credits. Overdesigned main protagonists while other models are just copy pasted - even in the story, totally destroys the overall pleasant graphics. Some controls are weird, whole main menu and "press start" while using k+m. And a few more.\n\nEven though I needed to vent my frustration with this game in here, it was mostly because of the lost game of the year potential. (For me) I still enjoyed it. There is nothing like it on the gaming market and I very much like originality. Mixed with amazing story makes a great, underdeveloped game. I feel bad to rate it 6,9/10.

I mean, really REALLY love collecting ♥♥♥♥? Is all you ask of a game that you push a button, hear a pleasing jingle, and see the "X out of Y" counter increment? Because if you do, you will love this game. And if you don't... well, let's talk.\n\nMurdered is the tale of the tragically-named Ronan O'Connor, loose cannon of the Salem PD with nothing to lose. The game opens with him getting ventilated by the world's least-subtle-slash-least-catchable murderer, the Bell Killer, and you spend the rest of the running time trying to figure out why. Well, that's a lie. You spend most of the running time wandering around Salem, ghosting through walls and people in search of the 242 collectable knick-knacks scattered throughout the city. While some require your ghostly powers to reach or reveal, most are just sitting out, waiting for you to mash X on. Each one gives you a tiny snippet of backstory on the characters or Salem if you bother to open the menu, and a few let you hear a cute creepypasta story if you collect the whole set.\n\nIf you're wondering why I haven't talked about the core gameplay yet, that's because it's dogshit. No lie, the investigations in Murdered are probably the worst of their kind. At every major story beat, you have a crime scene you need to investigate for clues to answer a specific question. Around the scene you'll find plenty more doodads sitting out for you to mash X on, each giving you a clue. After finding all the clues, you have to pick the clues that are the most relevant to answering the question at hand. This is where it all falls apart, because the expectations of the developers in picking answers ranges from so obvious you'll miss it to absolutely non-nonsensical. You're either going to breeze through every investigation or stumble over every answer depending on how well your brain is wired like the developers. Not that it matters either way, because there is literally no penalty for ♥♥♥♥ing up an answer, you just try again.\n\nSo that's how Murdered plays, terrible detective sequences broken up by fits of collection-sperging. If that was all, we could flip it the bird and move on with our lives. The weird part is, everything else about the game is fantastic. The graphics are gorgeous and detailed, bringing the town of Salem and its residents (living or dead) alive. Sound direction is on point with satisfying effects and a moody, fitting soundtrack. The characters are charming and memorable despite what seems like every effort to make them obnoxious. Bad-boy Ronan is vulnerable and compassionate, manic goth-girl Joy is plucky and nuanced, and the entire supporting cast is interesting in their own ways. Your ghost powers also keep things fresh, allowing you to possess people to intrude on their idle thoughts, or poltergeist their appliances to freak them out. There's even some stealth combat against some pretty horrifying demons that's simple, engaging, and a welcome break from the running and collecting.\n\nI'm not going to pretend Murdered is a great game, or great for everyone. But even after identifying its flaws, I had a blast with it. Full disclosure, I watched my buddy stream the entire game months ago, and still had enough fun with it to play through the whole thing myself. A lot of your enjoyment is certainly going to hinge on the collect-a-thon aspect, but if you get into the story and learn to love Salem and its characters, there's a perfectly good game to be had here.","October 17, 2015","true","8.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","15","18","2","2"

The only down side is that it doesn't run so well at times. Entering new areas make you lag & stutter on any setting I tried (and I spent about two hours combining different settings). If you can have a little patience while it chugs a bit in new areas, then you're in for a treat. I would have paid for this (won it in a contest), but I wouldn't have paid full price.

Let me start by saying if you are looking for action, adventure, and shooting in a run and gun style look elsewhere (You don't shoot a gun at all, not even once). If you are looking for a solid game with a great storyline, reading, thinking, and a great mystery plot that keeps you guessing look here.\n\nIs the game scary? No I would not say it is scary, maybe creepy or atmospheric. The Dev does a good job of making you feel and realize that you are not among the living. There is the occassional disappearing ghosts and scary music but nothing like silent hill, dead space, or amnesia. The point of the game is not to scare or freak you out. It's to tell a great story and for you to solve a mystery.\n\nOn top of figuring out your own mystery there are about 6-10 little side quests if you will. None are very long, but they are each enjoyable and have a little story of their own. There are also hundreds of little collectables to find and to keep you busy. I am not usually a fan of finding and hunting for hidden objects; but for some reason in this game it does not seem to tedious or difficult. The style of game just seems to lend itself towards finding lost or hidden items.\n\nAll that being said I would recommend this game overall score 8/10. I picked it up at 75% off and am not disapointed. I think for me even %50 off would justify the purchase. If it's on sale and you are a story driven gamer I would strongly urge you to pick this one up at some point.\n\nOh and if that's not convincing enough did I mention you have the ability to posses cats, and you have a never ending cigarette?!

Playing as Ronan's ghost, investigate a series of crime scenes (sometimes with the help of teenage medium Joy), searching for identity of the killer. Many supernatural elements come into play – ghosts, witches, demons – and some flashbacks of the witch trials are pretty gruesome (drowning, burning, hanging).\n\nAs the investigation progresses, you'll explore a graveyard, an apartment house, an old mansion, a police station and of course the obligatory asylum level. While the game world is small, it is open, with the ability to just wander around the town of Salem. It's a gloomy place – the game occurs entirely at night – but is well-dotted with NPCs and collectibles. Obtaining collectibles can unlock other stories (usually brief, narrated cut-scenes), and some NPCs will provide side-missions. There's a decent amount of stuff to do, but most collectibles were easily found as I explored the town or a level.\n\nInvestigations require exploring a a crime scene, finding evidence (“Press E to analyze”) and sorting through the collected evidence (“Press Q to conclude the investigation”). Walking (or later, teleporting) around as a ghost feels fun; Ronan can walk through walls, possess people (mind-reading), and turn on random stuff to mess with the townsfolk (poltergeisting). Especially cool were the impenetrable “ghost walls” from past times that can block Ronan from exploring – or even provide new hazards (watch out for the ghost train!). Oh, and you can possess cats, too. This is actually crucial to progress through several stages of the game.\n\nThe demon sections, though, dragged the experience down a bit. Demons will sometimes spawn after completing an investigation. Their existence does have a crucial part to play, and they're easy enough to defeat with a little patience. Given that this is a supernatural tale, it would be rather weird if demons of some kind weren't in the game, and having some stealth sections added some variety to the gameplay. But after a while the demons became annoying distractions from the story.\n\nAnd the narrative is where Murdered: Soul Suspect stands strongest. There is a lot of backstory to be found about Ronan and his wife (via collectibles). Sometimes collectibles are merely annoying, but they are worth pursuing here. Jason Brooks (as Ronan) and Cassidy Lehrman (as the medium, Joy) provide stand-out vocal performances. The graphics (Unreal 3) are great – murky and dark. Jason Graves' score provides a classic horror-story undertone. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a well-crafted detective game with a few quirks that holds its story aloft as its best attribute. If that sounds good to you, then go ahead and get this one.","May 24","true","21.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

While the general idea of the game sounds very interesting, the gameplay doesn’t hold up strongly enough to back this promising premise.\n\nThe game offers fairly solid visuals; they aren’t anything that will knock your socks off but they get the job done and provide an immersive, bone chilling, spooky experience. The game is fittingly set in Salem Massachusetts, but you won’t be exploring much of the town, as the game is designed to give you the false sense of free roam when it is in fact painfully linear. The game has a fairly expanse world, however due to the ghostly limitations the game places on you, you are unable to enter any buildings unless the door or window is already opened for you. This leads to the game being extremely linear, with what appears to be a vast explorable world turns out to be an empty ghost town in and of itself.\nThe core gameplay mechanics consists of incredibly disappointing “Detective Work”. Detective work is conducted by entering the crime scene (which usually consist of about 3 fairly small rooms) and meandering about the room pressing the interact key on all the shiny clues that are sprinkled throughout the crime scenes. The game requires that you find a painstaking amount of these clues for each question and at some points you may find yourself spamming the interact key repeatedly hoping you will blindly click on the last elusive clue that you need to proceed, imagine it as the Easter egg hunt from hell. The game does introduce some fairly interesting puzzle mechanics on certain clues, such as word association deciphers where you are presented with an image and around 15 words and have to pick the 3 or 4 words that are most related to the image to crack the clue, however these interesting tidbits are never truly fleshed out to their true potential.\n\nDon’t go into this game expecting any form of combat whatsoever, the combat is almost nonexistent and consists of walking behind the demonic enemies and performing a series of simple quick time events to eliminate them. The demons themselves look genuinely terrifying and if you do happen to mess up the quick time event then you will be chased by the demon and have to escape by quickly transporting through preplaced ghostly rifts that allow you to hide until the demon gives up on searching for you.\n\nThe only thing this game really has going for it that makes it worth playing is the intriguing, twist filled story. The stories pacing is done very well and at times you almost wish Murdered: Soul Suspect was a movie rather than a game. The voice acting is pretty solid and one of the best aspects of the game; being such a story driven game it benefits greatly from making sure that it has some good quality voice acting. While there are many cut scenes, they are enjoyable and emotion filled. It’s just a shame that the rest of the game feels like such a grinding chore just to get to the next cut scene to watch the story unfold.\n\nOverall Murdered: Soul Suspect seems like it has so much potential but never truly takes advantage of anything that it has going for it. The game holds your hand through a painfully linear environment and offers absolutely no challenge or difficulty. The only thing that makes Murdered: Soul Suspect even remotely worth playing is the fairly enjoyable story delivered through the cut scenes. The game plays out like a very good movie with obnoxious, tedious, burdensome, gameplay in between. What seemed like a very promising premise wasn’t strongly supported enough by the overall weak puzzles and lack of difficulty.\n\nI would only recommend this game if you get it at a ridiculous sale price\n\nhttp://noobsthatplaygames.com/\n","February 5, 2015","true","4.9"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

Starting off interesting enough, Ronan goes through the process of dying, which is a surreal experience but the game quickly becomes stale after the basics are covered and it actually stays boring until around mid to late game. The story seems to slowly string you along and the reason you continue is because you're interested in finding the culprit. Various unrelated background stories are discovered through collectibles scattered around Salem and are worth checking into if you enjoy a little treat to break you off from the main story for a bit. Sure, it does get frustrating at times because dealing with the demons becomes tedious after the first few tries but you'll come to a point where you'll realize it's worth the patience so you can finally get to the end and solve this giant mystery. Murdered may not live up to its hype but that doesn't prevent it from being an enjoyable game.","July 26, 2014","true","21.4"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","25","40","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/STINGER_LP/recommended/233290/","STINGER_LP","STINGER_LP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/STINGER_LP/","148 products in account","Well, nearly made myself to finish it. This one started as a promising story-driven atmospheric paranormal detective about ghosts and investigation of death of your own character while actually being a ghost: walking through walls, spy on citizens, possess them and read their minds, do stuff in yout favor, collect evidence and make conclusions... Yeah, very promising. And this all also wrapped with pretty good graphics with good visual art and detail, good score and voice acting. As a fan of atmospheric story-driven games I was really looking forward to Murdered: Soul Suspect. And at the beginning it was good. But it failed for me eventually.\n\nThe catch? - Dull story and mainly boring and repetitive gameplay.\n\nThe story had a good potential but authors were unable to pull it off. Eventually it slipped to so trivial and dull finale, that I began to regret for my wasted time. Authors tried to fill it with the notes of Salem's history, Ronan's personal story and love tragedy, but it didn't worked, something was missing and the main story felt... shallow. The ending of the game is plain ridiculous both gameplay- and storywise.\n\nThroughout the game there is almost no progression in gameplay: after you learned how to discover things, collect evidence, solve the case, possess people, counteract the opponents - you'll do it till the end with almost no diversity or new meaningful mechanics. The investigation part is very dull and making conclusions is not particularly interesting - especially when doing it dozen of times.\n\nI know this might look silly to blame a story-driven game for lack of gameplay (it's not Dear Esther though), but we're talking about the game with also sort of 'open' locations for your discovery, where you can freely go and explore it, solve some side-quests (they are also trivial and repetitive). On the contrary, I never got bored in story-driven Spec Ops: The Line, even though it's mere third-person shooter, because of its constant progression in fascinating story, locations design, changing circumstances, obstacles and gameplay.\n\nIn Murdered, besides that you can wonder around the locations doing side-quests, looking for collectibles (fun at first, become boring and useless later) or navigating your way from point A to B there are a lot of times during the second half of the game when you forced to revisit old locations and more often than not run through it from one end to another.\n\nThe locations themselves are not very distinctive and did I mention you can't run through every wall? At first that part with looking your way through the labyrinth of real and paranormal walls was OK, but quickly faded since they all looks the same, same blurred bluish corridors all the time. This is an unnecessary protraction of the game - you simply getting bored and 'felling off' the game's reality and story.\n\nThe enemies? Man, I wished that part of the game's 'features' never ended up in final version. It's just wrong, unnecessary, badly designed gameplaywise, and... oh, that console port QTEs... Quickly press W+RMB / D+LMB... etc.\n\nNo, I don't recommend this game, because I don't want more games of such quality of game design.","March 18, 2015","false","13.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","2"

Reviewers and websites want to insure business, They do that by "pleasing" the majority, and they do that by guessing what the majority would and wouldnt like and let that bias affect their own review of the games. This works sadly. But that is also why many who would enjoy a game such as Murdered Soul Suspect won't even try it. Sad reality.\n\nThis game doesnt have "action" it doesnt have shooting, stealing cars, and destruction. And it is better for it. In its own genre and taken as a separate entity, this game shines.\nIt is a mix of old school adventure atmosphere, smartass detective work, it is slow but it is great.

If you enjoy story driven games, this game is a good fit.  A well fleshed out storyline with excellent voice acting, cinematics, and live action gameplay.  I didn't find any silly time wasting quests or non-sensical gameplay at all.\nI had no idea what the gameplay would involve, and it's an interesting mix.  You are a detective who becomes a ghost and needs to find out who killed you and why. So, lots of investigations.  To me, the investigative parts of the game are most like a hidden object game.  You walk around a small area and find the clues to solve the inquiry.  Very straightforward.  There is a bit of action involved with demons to dispose of. You play stealthy while sneaking up on them.  Later in the game, it gets more intense with up to 4 demons simultaneously and can be a little challenging to sneak up on.\nThere are clues, letters, special bad guy info bits, historical parts, human mind reading, and some side quests too.  I didn't enjoy these as much.  They just aren't interesting and add little to the game story.  Mostly, the human mind reading gets boring to the point where I stopped bothering to read minds one third of the way through the game.  There are also ghost stories to unlock.  Some are good, some are so-so.  I liked the asylum one best.  Those are optional and require going through the rooms quite a bit more to search out hidden unlockables.  If anything was time wasting, that was it.  But, it's not mandatory.\nTo me, the story dragged up until about halfway.  After the cemetery I was hooked and kept on playing without any lack of interest. Before then, I was getting a bit bored, so slow gameplay and story up until midway.\nTwo things that stood out to me that may interest others:\n1) It's not an adventure game.  Don't go in expecting an adventure game of any kind.  This wasn't clear to me from the onset until I had been playing a bit.\n2) If you like action or fast paced horror games, this may not be for you.  This game is laid back, not terribly scary, and takes it's time.  More for the detective story fans IMO and fans of hidden secrets.\nThe ending is good and don't watch a vid of it please or it really ruins the experience.  If the initial half of the game wasn't so slow and a bit scarier, I would probably rate it higher. Still a good game, lots of love went into it, and it's optimized very well too.\n\n","June 8, 2015","true","19.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

He goes in alone and tries to stop the Bell Killer, but is quickly over powered, thrown out of a window, then shot seven times.  now you are now stuck in limbo and have to find out whom killed you before you can go into the vast world beyond. This is where your story begins.\n\nPros. Great voice acting, almost no loading screens (I only got 3 during my whole play through.), a great cinematic story (7 hours of gameplay for most users), a very pretty game. Graphics don't always matter, but I still have to throw this in.\n\nCons. Almost no real fighting in this game.  The Demons are too easy. , very linear story, little to no replay value, cliffhanger ending. I never liked them.\n\nTLDR. It's a great game, if you like playing a cinematic story. The $20 price tag may actually be worth it, but I always go for game when they are on sale or in a bundle. Got this little gem in Humble Bundle myself.","March 14, 2015","true","16.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

If you enjoy story driven games, this game is a good fit.  A well fleshed out storyline with excellent voice acting, cinematics, and live action gameplay.  I didn't find any silly time wasting quests or non-sensical gameplay at all.\nI had no idea what the gameplay would involve, and it's an interesting mix.  You are a detective who becomes a ghost and needs to find out who killed you and why. So, lots of investigations.  To me, the investigative parts of the game are most like a hidden object game.  You walk around a small area and find the clues to solve the inquiry.  Very straightforward.  There is a bit of action involved with demons to dispose of. You play stealthy while sneaking up on them.  Later in the game, it gets more intense with up to 4 demons simultaneously and can be a little challenging to sneak up on.\nThere are clues, letters, special bad guy info bits, historical parts, human mind reading, and some side quests too.  I didn't enjoy these as much.  They just aren't interesting and add little to the game story.  Mostly, the human mind reading gets boring to the point where I stopped bothering to read minds one third of the way through the game.  There are also ghost stories to unlock.  Some are good, some are so-so.  I liked the asylum one best.  Those are optional and require going through the rooms quite a bit more to search out hidden unlockables.  If anything was time wasting, that was it.  But, it's not mandatory.\nTo me, the story dragged up until about halfway.  After the cemetery I was hooked and kept on playing without any lack of interest. Before then, I was getting a bit bored, so slow gameplay and story up until midway.\nTwo things that stood out to me that may interest others:\n1) It's not an adventure game.  Don't go in expecting an adventure game of any kind.  This wasn't clear to me from the onset until I had been playing a bit.\n2) If you like action or fast paced horror games, this may not be for you.  This game is laid back, not terribly scary, and takes it's time.  More for the detective story fans IMO and fans of hidden secrets.\nThe ending is good and don't watch a vid of it please or it really ruins the experience.  If the initial half of the game wasn't so slow and a bit scarier, I would probably rate it higher. Still a good game, lots of love went into it, and it's optimized very well too.\n\n","June 8, 2015","true","19.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

The primary goal of him is to find his murderer and be released from his ghostly form.\n\nSecondly, the setting is pretty believable and rich in detail. There are so much innovative things I only can scratch the survface of it in my review:\n\nThe trains of thought to find out the truth are pretty great depicted: There are a bunch of clues which you have to find and then you have to find the link between them by clicking the most important one or figure out the right order of events. Only game of this type I played was The Vanishing of Ethan Carter.\nYou can posses people and read or influence their minds to get clues.\nYou can posses cats (This is pretty cool) and climb/jump around in trees.\nThe atmosphere is pretty dense and unique.\nOutstanding voice acting!!!!\nGreat story telling (This is no action game!).\nThe only action element of this game is that you get hunted by demons. This is sometime kind of intense but nothing extreme scaring\nThe only thing which spoils this game a bit are the darn bad technics of this game. You notice every second of playing that it’s a console porting. You can’t change the assignment of keys. For that’s unacceptable: sprinting on shift..WTF?! Another thing which bothered me is hat you can‘t disable 30 FPS lock with V-Sync enabled. So it’s either "tearing" or no FPS over 30! Sometimes there are some strange glitches, too. One time I was falling into nothing (see the video at the bottom), the other time there was no background sound and one time I got stuck in the menue. Only solution was restarting the game. Well, sometimes, when you go back to the desktop via Alt + Tab, the whole game just gets stuck to your screen and the only thing to do is restart....Again!\n\nAll in all, a great and very unique game with some technical glitches and confounding factors\nPS: Thanks to khay★jeet ( http://steamcommunity.com/id/blaybleet/ ) for gifting me this game!!

The puzzles are interesting, but their internal logic is inconsistant - you end up having to think like the designer.  Unfortunately, it's obvious that each of the puzzles had a different writer each time, meaning that every time you approach a problem it's sometimes hard to know what it is that is being asked of you.  This is a problem as the game has a rating system that punishes you if any mistakes are made.  The punishment is only the loss of a points on a system that doesnt seem to have any real bearing upon the game at large, but it is irritating to feel that failure is more due to an inconsistant mechanic than a mistake.\n\nThe worst aspect of the game is undoubtably the action sequences involving the hunting or avoiding of deadly shades, trapped between the our world and the next.  Sound intersting? In practice, it's not.\nUnfortunately, these sections feel rushed; a knee-jerk attempt at introducing some action into the otherwise slow pace of the game.\nNot a bad idea in principle, but the problem is that these fights vary little from the start of the game to the end.\nThe shades don't do anything other than follow very short, pre-set paths which occasionaly pass something that may be used to distract them.  The "challenge" comes from the fact that as the game progresses increasing numbers are put in your path - not exactly imaginative. Mistakes result in dashing about trying to hide from the shades that hunt you more aggressively, which would make these sequences more exiting, execpt that some areas seem to lack an appropriate number of places to hide.  This leads to you dashing between the few available, never quite caught but still unable to shake the shades off.  In the end it becomes nessecery to let the shades catch you, just so you get the opportunity to try again from the start.\n\nI  would often find myself wishing that I skip these sections so I could get back to the story, which is far more interesting.  If - of course - you ignore the feeling that the check-list of horror settings is being almost audibly ticked as you progress from graveyard to asylum to church, etc.\n\nIt's worth a go if you see a deep, deeeep, discount on it but I wouldn't recommend it at any other time, the feeling that the game is constructed of hedged bets is just too prevelent.","June 24, 2014","false","5.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/233290/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I am recommending this game as I personally like it. I will give my reader a huge WARNING before purchasing : the game play isn't super immerse, it's more the genre of the game. The controls/abilities are a bit limited. The game itself, however is comparable to a beautiful painting.\n\nMurdered : Soul Suspect follows a detective who was pushed out of a window and then shot repeatedly as he was trying to get up. The (bell tower) killer is an unknown assailant who has been attacking random individuals. After being shot, the detective is now a ghost and has to figure out why he's still roaming the Earth and hasn't passed on.\n\nYou are in third person view of Ronan (the detective) and have identical controls/movements (not actions though) to Hitman Absolution. What is probably the most outstanding feature in the game is the fact you can walk through walls. Of course, you cannot walk through any wall you wish. This will be made obvious with a solid white fill on a few walls or other "ghostly" objects will appear that will not let you pass. None the less, something completely different I have never been able to do in any game I've played yet. The combat is quite minimal. I should add if you are looking for a cop fighting action game, this isn't it. The most you'll be able to do is pull lost souls from demons that roam nearby areas. Demons are to be approached from behind when they cannot see you and soul extraction happens when you press RT. Again, not much to it but there is a rush associated with it. If you are seen, you will be chased and killed. You may hide in "ghost remnants" (small ghost cracks in levels) and can fast travel to each one in an attempt to evade the demon. There will be other obstacles in your way such as demon traps in which you require to possess a person while they walk across it. Being a ghost, you are able to possess literally anyone. NPC's will have general thoughts you can read while certain characters (usually for missions), you're able to "peek" (see what they're seeing) or "influence" (use a clue to job their memory in an attempt to force an action). They made jumping/possessing person to person quite easy to do. The game even goes as far as allowing you to posses a cat (with a purpose of course). Over time you will acquire new skills such as teleportation, poltergeist (setting a printer or phone off) and detect mode which lets you see through walls. You may also run in game but you do not have the ability to crouch or jump. Most of the time you will be free roaming until you come across a crime scene. Once in investigation mode, you will be looking around for clues and sometimes need to hit RT to reveal the complete evidence. Often times than not, you will need to find certain clues in order to find other clues (meaning intervention or possessing others to get a complete answer). Once you think you've found enough, you can conclude your investigation with the clues you've found. The game basically follows one crime scene to another and in between there are small side quests. Doesn't really sound appealing (which I'm sure is why people don't like the game) but it appealed to this extremely picky gamer.\n\nThe visuals are pretty good (not super fantastic but good). I have an AMD card and have tried to get more than 30 FPS. The graphics really resemble those of Hitman Absolution. They do have a lot of symbols and ghost writing that does pop up which enriches the environment. The sounds are suitable to the environment the game provides. It's not super over the top but I would assume it's hard to imagine what a demon would sound like.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game. I think it's cool to play through but leaves the player with no replayability. I got this game on extreme sale in a bundle. I would say it was worth it for what I paid. I would highly recommend people do their homework before buying such a game. I like to play it, you may not due to it's lack of actual gameplay activity.\n\nRATING : 7/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nIf you didn't believe me about the cat thing\n\nCommon sense questions will come up in which you'll have to be able to connect the dots\n\nSomething oddly satisfying walking through walls\n\nWhat a cinematic looks like\n\nHaving a short term memory will bite you in the bum\n\nJust like in Hitman Absolution, you can press a button to see through walls and avoid danger\n\nMe attempting to execute a demon and save a soul","December 29, 2015","true","6.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/recommended/233290/","ashdot","Callietrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashdot/","1456 products in account","Oh dear, I'm dead - pretty much the main mechanic of the game.  MURDERED: Soul Suspect starts out with the death of the main character who goes by the name of Ronan, a local Detective investigating a murder. It's not the most unique premise out there, but it handles it in such a way that makes it intriguing, but can ultimately fall a little short thanks to the way the game itself is structured.\n\nA Clean Cut Ghost\nWhile Ronan and the other main characters look pretty good and the environments themselves look pretty top notch, I can't really say the same for the NPCs. I noticed they re used qutite a LOT of NPCs without as much as trying to hide it somehow, which can definately break the immersion this game tries to set in with it's dark and drab setting. The lighting is top notch also, and really helps give the game the sense that you're in some ghostly world in an already dark setting.\n\nThe environments, as stated above, look very nice and I really like how they themselves tell their own stories because of the way the game places just random objects in an area. You can have, for example, a train inside a museum to let the player know that in the past, where the museum stands now used to be a regularly used train track and the game's chock full of little things like that, as well as it uses flat and ghostly images that sorta just fade out as you get closer to them to help accentuate that you are indeed in a ghost world. It's really good.\n\nEven greatly influencing the atmosphere the game has, is it's sound design. You can occasionally hear ghostly wails in the backgrounds, and the game is very light on music, only really playing it during tense moments like when there are Demons around, it knows when and when not to play music and it handles it pretty well. Voice acting is pretty par for the course, Ronan and the main characters sound decent, but some of the VA's for the NPCs can be pretty hit or miss.\n\nSolving the Case\nMurdered: Soul Suspect  is pretty much a glorified adventure game. The very linear structure the game has is done to help accentuate the story, making it feel actually more like a 3D Visual Novel than an Adventure game. The game is pretty much divided up by "stage" sections and an overworld (The Town). Each "Stage" has it's own set of collectibles that, once fully completed, gives you insight into a usually very dark and grim backstory into those items you collect as well as having it's own story section and more in general collectibles.\n\nWhat can feel detrimental to the game's pacing, is the way each stage is handled. It always ends up being a straight up Move from Point A to Point B sort of ordeal while exploring through every nook and cranny to find collectibles.\n\nAs far as mechanics go, the game can sometimes feel a little messy since there's no map to indicate an overall layout of the area you're in, thankfully, no one area looks exactly like another so it's usually easy to tell when you're going the wrong way - you can also walk through certain walls, and railings on stairs but not all of them. You can also posses people and read their thoughts (random NPCs) but sometimes they just end up repeating lines, other times, for story purposes, you can posses people to get over obstacles, you can posses objects to cause noises and distract NPCs and you can influence people to think about certain events by using clues. Clues are items you inspect during an "Investigation" phase which can be used occasionally only during said investigation, or sometimes long term throughout the whole game.\n\nThat being said, the only challenge this game does bring, is some half baked stealth sections involving "demons", creatures that live to suck out a spirit's soul and re-kill them I guess? These sections can be very tense thanks to the musical cues and the great wails they tend to do, but they merely serve to give the game padding and often can break up the pace of the story. The demons are also never used in any meaningful way to complement the story.\n\nMurdered is a pretty fun and short adventure game that can clock you in anywhere from 4-12 hours depending on how much you decide to focus on collectibles. There's no real punishing methods the game uses outside of demons catching you, it has a fairly uneven pace that can otherwise dull a pretty nice Murder thriller story.\n\nPros\n+ Amazing atmosphere   + Great sound design accentuates further the atmosphere  + Decent Voice Work\n+ Interesting and fun story  + Fun mechanics that makes you feel like a ghost.\n\nCons\n- Uneven Pacing  -  Game is on the short side, story alone clocks in at about 4 hours or so  - Repeated use of NPC models can break immersion.  -Demons serve no purpose to the story and are used as padding.\n\nOverall, if you can pick this game up at a decent price range, it's definately worth a playthrough if you enjoy Murder/Crime Thrillers, outside of that, this has very limited appeal.","February 26, 2015","true","9.3"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","3"

It began as a cool detective story with looking for clues and observing things. When the demons becomes a part of the game it turns into a surreal horror stealth hide & seek game and it puts the whole detective lore and theme to the background.

Playing as Ronan's ghost, investigate a series of crime scenes (sometimes with the help of teenage medium Joy), searching for identity of the killer. Many supernatural elements come into play – ghosts, witches, demons – and some  flashbacks of the witch trials are pretty gruesome (drowning, burning, hanging).\n\nAs the investigation progresses, you'll explore a graveyard, an apartment house, an old mansion, a police station and of course the obligatory asylum level. While the game world is small, it is open, with the ability to just wander around the town of Salem. It's a gloomy place – the game occurs entirely at night – but is well-dotted with NPCs and collectibles. Obtaining collectibles can unlock other stories (usually brief, narrated cut-scenes), and some NPCs will provide side-missions. There's a decent amount of stuff to do, but most collectibles were easily found as I explored the town or a level.\n\nInvestigations require exploring a a crime scene, finding evidence (“Press E to analyze”) and sorting through the collected evidence (“Press Q to conclude the investigation”). Walking (or later, teleporting) around as a ghost feels fun;  Ronan can walk through walls, possess people (mind-reading), and turn on random stuff to mess with the townsfolk (poltergeisting). Especially cool were the impenetrable “ghost walls” from past times that can block Ronan from exploring – or even provide new hazards (watch out for the ghost train!). Oh, and you can possess cats, too. This is actually crucial to progress through several stages of the game.\n\nThe demon sections, though, dragged the experience down a bit. Demons will sometimes spawn after completing an investigation. Their existence does have a crucial part to play, and they're easy enough to defeat with a little patience. Given that this is a supernatural tale, it would be rather weird if demons of some kind weren't in the game, and having some stealth sections added some variety to the gameplay.  But after a while the demons became annoying distractions from the story.\n\nAnd the narrative is where Murdered: Soul Suspect stands strongest. There is a lot of backstory to be found about Ronan and his wife (via collectibles). Sometimes collectibles are merely annoying, but they are worth pursuing here. Jason Brooks (as Ronan) and Cassidy Lehrman (as the medium, Joy) provide stand-out vocal performances. The graphics (Unreal 3) are great – murky and dark. Jason Graves' score provides a classic horror-story undertone. Murdered: Soul Suspect is a well-crafted detective game with a few quirks that holds its story aloft as its best attribute. If that sounds good to you, then go ahead and get this one.","February 11","true","11.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Investigating areas is basic, you walk around until you get to item/object you can interact with. A few times you are given a list of clues and must select the right clues in order to advance, as far as I can tell there is no way you can fail any of these. No matter how many times you get it wrong the game will always let you keep choosing until you get it right. As a dead man you have a few tricks which you can use, such as possessing people to influence them or causing disturbances in the environment to distract people.\n\nThe second portion of gameplay involves stealth which can be a bit frustrating at times but it does help break up the gameplay a bit. Every once in a while you will have to hide from demons, luckily, if they see you, you can easily run and hide in hiding spots until they decide to stop searching for you. Sneaking up from behind and pressing the appropriate buttons will kill them.\n\nThe game is also littered with collectables that give back-story to characters or provide history of the surrounding locations.\n\nThere are a few side quests but they are very basic and amount to nothing more than investigating an area until you found everything.\n\nThis is not an action game. If you enjoy point and click adventure games you will find this somewhat enjoyable. The problem is this game offers very little puzzle solving and the entire game can be completed in 4-6 hours. I do however commend Square Enix for publishing a game like this.\n","June 6, 2015","true","14.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Yeah, there are side quests, but there's little motivation for anyone to waste time trying to complete them, except maybe for achievement hunters, since they're not connected to the main story too closely. Since the combat, the action part of the gameplay is very simplistic (just attack the enemy from behind and press some key combinations), the exploration part could've saved the day if it weren't just as simplistic as well.\n\nAnyway, if you're like me and care more for a good story than sophisticated gameplay, Murdered: Soul Suspect will be a nice experience.\n\nPros:\n- the story is complex and captivating, the ending is pretty unexpected\n- the visuals are nice\n- good voice acting\n- interesting characters\n- nice noir/dark atmosphere\n- interesting basic concept (some kind of "walking dead" but not the "usual" kind of "walking deads" :)  you die right in the start and then just play as a ghost  )\n\nCons:\n- kinda short\n- the gameplay is quite simplistic, in terms of both fighting and exploring\n- there's only one type of enemy to fight\n- horror is hardly a good keyword to describe it, there's pretty much nothing scary about it\n- the full price doesn't seem very reasonable considering the gameplay's length","March 10, 2015","true","10.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/recommended/233290/","Duskspark","Duskspark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskspark/","484 products in account","Despite having its flaws, Murdered: Soul Suspect is quite possibly one of the most enjoyable single-player games I've played this year.\n\nThe Pros:\n· A unique story that feels like a combination of Silent Hill and L.A. Noire, and the beginning does a great job of introducing you to its atmosphere.\n· You start at the point where Ronan O'Connor (the game's protagonist, of course) starts the hunt on his murderer, the Bell Killer. This makes you feel like you know as much about the afterlife as Ronan himself does and creates a sort of connection, right from the get-go.\n· The town of Salem is pretty small, but its yours to explore... and it's worth exploring. Tons of side missions and collectibles can be found in Salem, and the eerie mood that constantly lingers around really immerses you into Ronan's role.\n· The atmosphere is incredibly unique and satisfying. The ghostly white glow around certain object make the bridge-world connect with the world of the living. Seeing the flickering souls of dead children sitting next to a swing or a dead corpse dangling from a tree by its neck is oddly disturbing and makes you feel uncomfortable, which a bridge-world should.\n· Pretty cool characters. Ronan is your typical rebel-turned-cop tough guy, but his tattoo's reflect his life and the sins in it, and the detail to him is quite impressive. Even though he's partially see-through (because you know, he's a ghost and stuff), the orange bullet holes give Ronan a distinctive look from the other ghosts in Salem.\n\nThe Cons:\n· The mechanics feel a bit underused at times. As a ghost you could be able to do so much more, like possessing and controlling others for example. Sure, you can influence people and read their minds and control a cat (10/10), but it limits the player.\n· For a detective game, it doesn't really require too much thinking. You have to find clues and connect the dots (sometimes those dots connect in an unlogical way), and that's basically it.\n· The NPCs are mostly the same. Salem doesn't have many people walking its streets, but two of the same people might be sitting a few feet from each other. Plus, they have the same thoughts, which is weird. Like freaky weird.\n· The combat is there, but its simplistic and repetetive. You hide in lost souls, sneak up to a demon and quickly rip him apart. It's satisfying and it even feels as if you're helping those tormented souls, but it's just too much of the same.\n\nThe Visuals:\n· Most of its atmosphere comes from the visuals. Ghostly white silhouettes and detailed environments may not look next-gen, but they're stunning none the less.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n· Murdered: Soul Suspect sure has its flaws, but it's a unique and highly enjoyable experience and easily one of my favorites of the year. 8/10","June 10, 2014","true","2.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","2"

The storyline of this game is what makes you want to keep playing , there are alot of broken or just bad mechanics in the game - inspecting and collecting things seems to be very hit or miss whether u get the button prompt based on camera orientation on the object. They tried to add in a aspect of danger to the game via "demons" in my opinion this was only a negative aspect as the combat system is very unfullfling and tedious , i found my self just running past most of these parts of the game ( which i suppose is the stealth aspect they were trying to include).\n\nThe storyline isnt exactly ground breaking and its probably what you expect from a game set in modern day "Town of Salem" it does try to have a few plot twist and turns to keep you immersed in the main story though. There are also side quest investigations in the town which really dont advance the main story and only serve to distract you for  a few minutes.\n\nThe Graphics and art style of the game are very well done and do a good job of setting the atmospheric scene in the town/game.

Well, don't let it. This game has some good and some bad, but the good wins in the end.\n\nFirst thing's first. Play this with a controller. I started this game with my keyboard/mouse and I immediately hated this game. The controls are a joke. The FOV is WAY too sensitive (even after changing settings). I was almost ready to give up on this game when I decided to try my Xbox controller. This choice saved the game for me.\n\nThe Bad\n- Crappy save system. You can browse the discussion boards and find people have issues with the autosave. You can't make your own save and have to rely on it... trouble is, it's not that reliable. (you can however copy the save file from your steam folder. You have to look up how though. I think it's titled 233290. So it's a random number, not a name)\n\n- Limited action. This game is a walk around and talk to people and find clues game. There is only one type of monster (demon) and you have to sneak up behind him to banish him. So it's all about timing. I think there are probably less than 20 of them in this entire game.\n\n- Collectables. There are a lot of clues to find. Some are necessary, some aren't. The necessary ones will be located in a limited area, so you can eventually find them. The other collectables are scattered around and you have to find them. This is going to either be great because you love these kinds of things or frustrating because some of them are hard to find. Each one tells a little bit more about the story and it's characters.\n\nThe Good\n- Cutscenes. There are a lot of them, and I found them to be good. I know some folks hate games with lots of cutscenes. If that's you, look elsewhere.\n\n- Story. I really enjoyed the story. It's a dark mystery that you just can't help but want to solve. I felt the characters were engaging. They felt real and their struggles were believable.\n\n- Easy achievements. You will get most of the achievements without trying. There are some for collections too. Those ones I used a video walkthrough to help me find them all.\n\n- Simple investigations. So your job is to get clues and solve a mystery. This isn't the kind of game where the answer makes little sense. You collect as many clues as you can find and pick the answers based on them. You can solve a mystery without finding all the clues, but I recommend you find them all.\n\n- Time. This game didn't take long to complete and to get all of the achievements.\n\nOverall, I would recommend adding this to your wishlist. It's a really good game as long as you know what you are getting into. If you want an action packed game, this isn't for you. If you want to sit back, relax, and listen to a really cool story -- this game will be perfect.","January 4, 2015","true","17.7"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","8"

My thoughts are as follows:\n\nGOOD:\n\nUnique concept with some cool abilities - passing through walls, posession and teleportation\nTONS of collectibles reveal more of the characters' backgrounds as well as history of the city\nDecent voice acting, characters with believable motivations\nInteresing blend of spirit world into the material world.  Ghosts are a nice touch, add to atmosphere\nEducational - I learned a lot about Salem and its history and locations - and enjoyed learning it (gasp!)\n\nBAD:\n\nRepetitive\nEasy - no difficulty setting, no incentive to replay\nGraphics are.... meh.  I know it's nighttime, but expect LOTS of grays, browns, and fog\nDEMONS! Not scary, not difficult, just.... annoying.\nFairly short.  Took me longer because I was hunting down collectibles, but expect much shorter completion times\nif you're just following the story\n\nUGLY:\n\nFOR GAWDS SAKE!  Would it have hurt to include an in-game map???\n\nSo.  I liked the game, yet I can't help but feel it doesn't really live up to its potential.  Although there are some cool/unique or original mechanics, they are rare little glimmers in an overall sea of....meh.  By a small margin, I DO recommend it, but only some time down the road when it goes on sale, or as a rental (if you own a console).\n\n7/10\n\n\n\n","June 6, 2014","true","12.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

I have seen good metascore on games that sucked and vice versa such as in this case. And so obviously, Metascore is not a thing to be trusted.\n\nAs for the game, this was a really good and intriguing game. The things you find such as books or side stories which have lots of text to read to follow up but you can skip on it, this is one of those games that made me want to read every bit of text i found. The back stories for characters were really good, the plot is fine and unique, the animation and the artstyle is spot on. The voice acting for all the characters is damn great. This was like an adventure game following a story with no action or shooting as one might maybe expect. A game with story and interaction that not even for a moment felt boring or made me want to rush through and end this.\n\nThe gameplay in this consists of looking for clues and collectibles and evading demons at times while in the story, you're chasing your own killer trying to solve your own mystery from one place to another. This is a free roaming game and gives you the liberty to roam around the Salem city which is filled with collectibles and cats and other spirits whom you can help and set them free by solving their deaths.\n\nAs for my recommendation, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone even mildly interested in this. This game might not appeal to everyone, certainly not to ones looking for an action/shooter. 7/10.","September 12, 2014","true","13.4"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","4"

It's pretty fun and the entire enviroment is filled with scary stories. Finding collectables is easy and upon completion of a set you get a decent horror story narated to you. Which is the kind of vibe the entire game has, horror. But not scary horror, more like classic horror.\n\nIt's an extremely easy game, "combat" is just pushing the right button to kill an enemy that only floats back and forth. Gamepley is heavily based on looking for clues and picking out which ones are the most important. Which is refreshing because solving the mysteries requires a type of thinking that I haven't seen in any other game.\n\nExtremely well made, but too short for its price when it doesn't really hold much of a replayability value. I would reccomend it as a $25 dollar game, maybe $30 but not at $50. I was fortunate enough to get it as a gift.\n\n10/10 Gameplay\n\nUnique puzzle play\n\nEasy as Mario\n\nEnjoyed myself\n\nTL;DR: You're an invisble man that can run through walls but no one is ever naked.","July 16, 2014","false","9.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

You run around solving different aspects of a serial killers murders, and along the way you collect items, for little side stories, on your own account... Sometimes it is not always obvious, how to solve some of the problems, but for the most part, if you follow the story and read the clues, it's quite logical... One part, I was not too fond of, myself, was the demons you have to fight... Mostly because I panic, and press the wrong buttons, and then I have to do the whole thing all over again... And cause they freak me out!\nI'm a panicky person, so the whole fighting/stressful aspect of that did not really tickle my fancy...\nThe map you're running around on, is not that big, to be honest, but because you can run through walls, and into every little nook and cranny, the world just seems so much bigger... And of course there are the cats, that also helps make it bigger... (When you play it, it will make sense)\nStory wise, it was a good story... Sometimes a little predictable, but when it was important, it wasn't... Or maybe my story predicting skills failed me for once...\nIn all accounts... Great game...

The idea behind this game is totally unique and works pretty well. You play a ghost and you solve murders and eventually yours with other things along the way.\n- Good solid storyline which is easily transferable to a decent horror movie.\n- Collectables everywhere.\n- Nice dark supernatural style to the game.\n- Cool demonic enemies which look as if they're inspired by the Azkaban guards from Harry Potter.\n- Ghosting through walls and the use of shadows in the environment is pretty well done.\n\nCONS:\n- That ending, what a disappointment. In terms of story it's fine but the gameplay for the final level is just pointless.\n- Gameplay overall just lacks something, I mean the combat is a little lame and became a chore having to evade demons and its a little quick timed in a way.\n- Detective? Okay so clue finding isn't as good as it should be. You uncover shadows, look at objects which just describe what they are and then he tells you what's happened. Sometimes it's okay cause you have to link to a past clue using initiative but it's far too easy!\n- Possession isn't utilized well enough, you can occasionally influence people to uncover something or use them to move, or peek at things but this is too few. Most of the time you listen to absolutely pointless thoughts which are uninteresting, irrelevant and sometimes repeated.\n- Graphics, not sure if I think they're up to AAA scratch. Whilst it's a good port this is no biggie.\n- Too short with no replayability. Yet it can be found cheap.\n\nVERDICT?\nDecent game if you enjoy mystery games like me, I enjoyed the story, game play is easy and not too thought provoking so suits a casual gamer but this game could have been a lot better for sure.","June 23, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You play a ghost and you solve murders and eventually yours with other things along the way.\n- Good solid storyline which is easily transferable to a decent horror movie.\n- Collectables everywhere.\n- Nice dark supernatural style to the game.\n- Cool demonic enemies which look as if they're inspired by the Azkaban guards from Harry Potter.\n- Ghosting through walls and the use of shadows in the environment is pretty well done.\n\nCONS:\n- That ending, what a disappointment. In terms of story it's fine but the gameplay for the final level is just pointless.\n- Gameplay overall just lacks something, I mean the combat is a little lame and became a chore having to evade demons and its a little quick timed in a way.\n- Detective? Okay so clue finding isn't as good as it should be. You uncover shadows, look at objects which just describe what they are and then he tells you what's happened. Sometimes it's okay cause you have to link to a past clue using initiative but it's far too easy!\n- Possession isn't utilized well enough, you can occasionally influence people to uncover something or use them to move, or peek at things but this is too few. Most of the time you listen to absolutely pointless thoughts which are uninteresting, irrelevant and sometimes repeated.\n- Graphics, not sure if I think they're up to AAA scratch. Whilst it's a good port this is no biggie.\n- Too short with no replayability. Yet it can be found cheap.\n\nVERDICT?\nDecent game if you enjoy mystery games like me, I enjoyed the story, game play is easy and not too thought provoking so suits a casual gamer but this game could have been a lot better for sure.","June 23, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

'What is it about?', you may ask, so the answer is below:\n\nYou are local of Salem, Massachusetts, the place which is mostly associated with XVII-century's history about witches, that people were hunting at and then, after catching them, they were burned at the stake. In game, there is mystical climat exposing supernatural skills of Ronan O'Connor, the main character, who had been killed at the beginning of the game and then he transformed to a ghost, who had to face demons, solve a mystery of his death and find out, who had killed him. Ronan, while getting the 'new himself', gets new skills, which allow him to move through the walls, be invisible to people, read in people's minds and even control them! During investigation he meets some demons hunting for souls, so he needs to eliminate them, or move around the place to get safer way.\n\nThe game reminds me of L.A. Noire, because you need to solve problems by getting some details and then connecting them into one, making sense trace. If you complete it successfully, you'll see what happened before.\n\nGraphic effects are nice, the gameplay is happening during the twilight, so colours are darky, but they keep you even closer, because of usage them in thrilling details around. The Unreal Engine 3 is helping the game to get high details of buildings, models and characters, as well as good animations. The last thing I want to mention about is sound - thrilling music showing overwhelming atmosphere of Salem and live comments of O'Connor's adventures, which lead us to equating with Ronan even more.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect and its story completely touched my heartstrings and that's one of the reasons, why my note is very high! Great compilation of story, graphics and sound is forcing me to put 10/10.\n\nHope you enjoy!","April 14","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I'll go through some pros and cons that I came across while playing through the game quickly.\n\nPros:\n\n+The concept. It is so extremely interesting and makes for some great gameplay. Ghosts are cool. :3c\n\n+The deduction segments. You actually have to remember stuff that you uncovered way back in order to advance, which I found enjoyable and realistic. No need for a pen and paper though as the game keeps your previous discoveries and presents them when needed.\n\n+The collectibles. These withhold some very interesting bits of history, character development and a few creepy-♥♥♥ ghost stories.\n\n+The setting. Salem is a town with an extremely rich and interesting history, which is uncovered through the collectibles.\n\n+Cats.\n\nCons.\n\n-Character development. There isn't any really, apart from some of the collectibles.\n\n-The story. You will either like the story or be disappointed. You are kept in the shade until the very end, despite all your detective work. The ending is also Shayamalan levels of twisty,\n\n-The collectibles. Yes, these were both good and bad. The good thing is the info they contain, the bad thing is they are way too easy to collect. On my first playthrough, without using any walkthroughs and not stopping to explore every square inch of every area, I found around 80% of everything there is to be found. Most of them aren't even hidden in any way. Really cuts down on replay value.\n\n-The game is very short. My very first playthrough, which I went into completely blind, only took me 6 hours from start to finish while getting 80% of all the collectibles <_>. This is also the main reason for the lack of character development. The story takes place during just one night though, so I guess the plan was to make the game short from the get-go.\n\n-No new game plus. After finishing the game, if you continue from the last checkpoint you are placed right at the last scene, which the takes you to the credits again. The only other option is a new game.\n\n-The enemies. Too easy to get rid of. They pose no real challenge and don't even really slow you down.\n\n-The town. It is way too small to really bring that feel of exploration, and the various areas are split into separate zones.\n\nOverall the concept delivered really well. The game really puts you in that fantasy of being a ghost. I would've wished for more varied gameplay and more gameplay in general. The shortness of the game really destroys it. I wanted to love this game with all my heart but I just can't. The flaws are too numerous and too big to ignore.\n\nI feel it deserves to be played, but the price right now is way too high. Definitely grab it when it's put on sale","June 13, 2014","false","14.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/233290/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","This is going to be a bit of an odd review.  I DO recommend the game when it's cheaper - just for the experience, but with several caveats mentioned below.  Before starting, I should warn you that this is a HORRIBLE PC port.  It has been designed for the gamepad, and any game that opens with "Press START to continue" is always a bad omen.  It's a frankly horrible and frustrating experience with keyboard and mouse (it really hasn't been converted very well).  I resorted to my trusty XBox 360 gamepad to save myself the headache...\n\nSorry about the long review, but for tl;dr, just scroll to the very last para...\n_________________________\n\nWhen I started this game, I was pretty wowed by the concept.  Think back to the late, great Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldburg and the film Ghost and you basically have the plot of this game - sorta (no Demi or Whoopi-alikes, and no Swayze personality).  You play Ronan, a rather bland, non-uniform detective who is murdered in the opening scene (great start!) and in that typical way (of ghosty-films) his soul rises out of his body and he looks down on himself, realising the very worst has just happened!  And it's a BRILLIANT start!  It really is.  I was so excited that I couldn't wait to throw myself right in the game.  Cops soon arrive at the scene of your murder, and there are priceless scenes like someone leaving the building in front of you, happily unaware of a ghost who slips out right behind them and then vanishes.  Absent-mindedly, you walk THROUGH a cop who suddenly shudders as you pass through them, and if you have a rumble feature on your gamepad, it too mimics that shudder whenever you pass through objects and people - fabulous!  I thought: "this is going to be GREAT!"\n\nSo, you're a ghost.  You quickly learn that you are to remain behind to catch your murderer (Swayze theme again).  You learn that you can 'possess' people and read their minds and, on occasion, influence their decisions.  You can enact 'poltergeist' activity by making phones ring, switch on desk fans and the like.  You can even possess a CAT!  That alone is beautifully done - exceptional animation and effects.  The game style is closer to a 3D point-and-click adventure with some action parts, and it's mostly themed around collecting clues and solving the "Bleeding Obvious"...  There are side missions to collect odd objects, like 9 rifles, or 5 boilers (yes, boilers) and if you collect them you will be told a very short spooky story about that area.  It's a novelty, but it could have been improved by some quick-time spooky movie to watch instead of listening to a blind reading.\n\nWhat started really well soon goes downhill and I just want to scream about the potential this game doesn't quite reach!!!  It could have been so BRILLIANT but it fails pretty much throughout.  At the beginning, instead of flailing and wailing and trying to understand what's happening, you instead walk off happy as anything to just be a ghost as if you'd been a ghost for YEARS!  You died literally two minutes back but you're already fine with everything - off to do ghost-business right off the bat!  Remember Ghost where Swayze had to learn to touch things, who encountered other ghosts of very different kinds, who badly wanted to make contact and to find his way back to life and love, dear Demi Moore?  Ronan is not like this at all.  He's now suddenly and happily engaged in not only his own quest, but solving everybody else's problems - everybody else being people who have presumably been ghosts for much longer than our dead-2-mins hero who can magically solve problems (find clues in the immediate vicinity) of these other apparently clueless ghosts who are much more experienced ghosts than he is - surely.  But they're all stupidly incapable and you must gather the clues blatantly laid all around them.  Not good for a concept, but it's doable (he's a detective after all, and maybe only detectives can spot clues on the ground around the victims' feet...).\n\nMoving on, you will see ghostly apparitions continually.  The vast majority just do nothing.  They're not even animated - just 2D transparencies that shimmer to fade out when you approach the image.  At first, the early ones are done well, like a girl in a shower who simply vanishes whenever you try to get closer, quite eerie and clever.  But after a while you realise they're all merely static images that don't even move (very obvious when looking top-down at one from a stairway) - and often it's the same image repeated.  It would have been SO much better to have some background ghost characters just lurking around, some of them sad or lost, some angry or frightening - all of them at least moving.\n\nYour ghostly powers are okay, though the game explains to you right away that external walls are "consecrated" so ghosts can't pass through those (ergo: the boundary of the map!) but what is SO disappointing is that, beyond the opening scene hardly anyone ever reacts!  Switch on their TV, ring their phones, WALK through them!  Mostly, they notice absolutely nothing unless you reach a case where you must distract people (in which case they react predictably to you triggering a phone or vending machine).  Mostly though, your haunting torments make no difference and cause no reaction.  It would have been such a greater game to be given a moral choice whether to haunt or help, but for what it's worth you hardly need to be a ghost really.  It's a shame - it would have been FUN to cause some haunted-house things.   Possessing people soon loses its fun too when you realise that most characters only have two lines to 'say' (always about not feeling safe or the murderer being at large), and only a couple of times do you influence them.  No Watch_dogs random thoughts here!  It gets to be boring after a while.\n\nYou will encounter 'demons' for the action bit - nastly brown/orange things that will 'suck up your soul' (ie game-over - go all the way back to that ages-ago checkpoint...) and demon-holes (where they come from, of course).  You can hide from the demons in areas where past spirits wandered and left a timestamp (ie a blue foggy area vaguely shaped like a ghost).  You become invisible from demons when you are in these, and you can hop from one ghost-space to the next until you are behind the demon, and you can dispatch it with a quick-time event that, in a split second, expects you to register a thumbstick direction AND a button press.  As for the demon holes, they're nearly all just used as pathway blockers to force you along another route.\n\nFinally, there's Ronan himself.  It's impossible to empathise or feel this character at all, or sympathise with his story.  A dude in a fedora, cigarette permanently hanging out of one corner of his curled lip and a cocky swagger, and as is video-game fashion, he's the gruff, growly white male as always, but not even likeable.  You will uncover snippets of his story and wonder why on earth he was ever a cop at all.  It's difficult to be interested.  He should have been confused, angry, frightened and determined, but he is for all the world like a regular guy just sauntering along to the corner store.\n________________\n\nIt's a relatively short game, and for the full price I really can't recommend it, but if it comes down to a more casual-game sensible price (the $15/$10 mark) then yes, I would say it was worth buying just to experience where the game NEARLY goes, because it is such a clever and original idea!  It's worth it just for the opening 30 mins.  It's worth it just to possess the cat, for crying out loud!  But it's not a game with any real replay value, and it's certainly not LA Noire ghost-style.  It should have been, and it could have been epic, but it misses the mark in every direction and fails to deliver on everything it hinted at when the game first opened to your murder scene, and that's such a shame.","July 23, 2014","true","10.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/withnobreadwinner/recommended/233290/","withnobreadwinner","Mr Chingle Changle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/withnobreadwinner/","984 products in account","A game in which a Yahtzee Crowshaw cosplayer gets killed by a man and then, as a ghost, follows a fairly predictable plotline to find out who the killer was.  Also the killer kills some other people and there is ghosts hanging about the place.  If you, for whatever reason, struggle to follow the story, just think of it as Ghost, the 1990 film about a ghost, but in a video game.\n\nThe game starts out in media res after showing the protagonist getting lots of tattoos.  Apparently this is important, somehow, because he was a criminal but is now a cop?  Dunno.  The game then moves on to demonstrating just how bad of a PC port it is.  When I first use my ghostly powers to possess someone, when using a keyboard, I got stuck and was unable to move.  The controls were unresponsive and I had to end the game’s process in task manager.  Definitely use a controller for this one.\n\nShortly after you will meet the game’s deuteragonist, Joy, who is a young girl able to see Ronan, the player, even though he is a ghost.  She isn’t too happy about that because she is always seeing them.  She tells you to ♥♥♥♥ off even after she is informed that you are able to help her find her mother who’s buggered off somewhere (it really is just “somewhere”, you never find out where).  Eventually she resigns herself to helping you if for no other reason than to get Ronan to shut the ♥♥♥♥ up.  What a great partnership.\n\nRonan himself is a fairly likeable character.  If you can get passed his ridiculous attire, plethora of edgy tattoos and the Phantom Cigarette which he never seems to stop smoking, he’s kind of alright.  He reminded me a little of Bigby from The Wolf Among Us; rolled up shirt sleeves, nasty smoking habit and devil-may-care attitude.  His hat is still stupid, though.  He’s basically a modern time discount Cole Phelps.\n\nThe game itself is quite short.  While I am not usually bothered by the time it takes to complete a game, I was somewhat miffed when I played for around four and a half hours, went to bed, woke up the following morning and managed to finish the game off in about half an hour.  The game’s ending itself appears rushed, scrambling to tie the plot together by showing various scenes with aspects of the story being finalised, but at least it tries.\n\nLike many other developers, Airtight Games felt compelled to shoehorn in combat any way they could.  This means that occasionally you’ll come across Demons which you must kill by sneaking up behind them and performing a QTE.  This serves to do nothing else by distract the player and ruin the pace of an otherwise good gameplay loop.  Fortunately, there is a way to edit one of the game’s .ini files in order to stop the Demons spotting you.  They will still spawn, but ignore you completely.  Some may see this as cheating, I see this as an improvement.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD: The ghost girl you meet at the beginning of the game, Abigail, is the killer.  This comes as absolutely no surprise.  It is quickly established that the people stuck in what is ostensibly Purgatory may only leave if they resolve and move on from a key event in their life.  Ronan’s problem is that he never figured out who the Bell Killer was.  And what about Abigail?  Well, Ronan has a very basic possession ability, allowing him to go inside the mind of living beings (and control cats).  But Abigail’s are far more advanced than that.  Yes, she possess people and then kills other people.  Well, mediums, specifically.  Because they’re, like, witches or something.  Her motives are flimsy at best, completely balls-to-the-wall ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and ungrounded at worst.\n\nUnlike a similar game, L.A. Noire, I found myself always one or two steps ahead of Ronan in the story.  Many times he would receive sudden clarity on something, and I would be sitting there thinking “Really?  Well, duh.  How did you not already figure that out?”.  At one point, when Ronan finally figures out the thing I’d already clocked onto hours before (the killer’s identity) he asked “But how did she do it?”.  BECAUSE SHE IS A GHOST WHO CAN POSSESS PEOPLE.  YOU CAN DO THE EXACT SAME THING.\n\nIt might seem like I completely hate the game, but I don’t really.  It’s flawed, but it’s also quite compelling.  While the story’s conclusion was foreseeable, it was still enjoyable to watch the characters make their way to it.  I still haven’t figured out why the ghosts could pass through walls, but not fall through the ground, though.  ‘Tis a mystery which plagues many stories like these.\n","November 27, 2015","true","5.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

The story had me very interested.  Maybe that's because I'm a sucker for detective stories?  Either way, the game itself is... very standard.  The "battling" of the demons is literally a repetitive quick-time palooza.  I felt stressed throughout the entire game because I was more focused on trying to find the collectibles moreso than solving the mystery.  Some may argue this is a great addition to the game, but you get nothing except acheivements for completing this tasks, and it felt less-rewarding then usual.\n\nThere is no newgame+.  Once you beat the game, you restart from your last checkpoint, which happens to be a point of no return.  If you happen to miss some collectibles after this point: tough ♥♥♥♥; you're going to have to restart your entire file.\n\nI, personally enjoyed playing the game and getting involved with the characters and the story, but I CANNOT support the outragous price Square-Enix is asking for on this game.  I managed to spend 20$ on this bugger and I still feel like I might have overpayed by a small margine.\n\nGive or take, I'd pick this up in the future for like, 5-15$ to give it a try.

All I know is, I wish I could get my money back so I don't just have a steam game lying in the library taunting me with its broken and money whoring ways.

For those of you who have played the Blackwell series (look at my review), I feel that Square Enix programmers played the games and thought, "Hey, we can make a non-P&C, grittier, updated graphics version of Blackwell!". In some respects, it really feels that way. A ghost needs to solve his own murder, plus help lost ghosts solve their issues so that they can move on with the help of a medium. Only instead of Roseangela we get a whiny teenager by the name of Joy. The crime solving isn't that difficult, but when the story is this enjoyable who really cares? The game takes place in Salem, and I feel that the town is one of the big stars of the game. The developers knew they had a lot to work with and they did a great job. You get to discover artifacts that uncover Salem's dark history, uncover artifacts that reveal haunting stories, and help ghosts piece together their untimely end. The main characters are a mixed bag. Ronan, is a detective who spent most of his life on the wrong side of Lady Law before joining the force. He's a great character. His sidekick is a gothic emo of a teenager named Joy. I see why they think she needs to be here, but I just didn't like her that much. Luckily, she only appears as much as she needs to, leaving you free to take your time between levels to explore Salem and backtrack for achievements or artifacts if need be. For you artifact and achievement junkies, there is a ton to find. Most will be able to find a lot of the stuff, in the first playthrough, but it is worth playing again. I highly recommend this supernatural detective game.","November 20, 2014","true","18.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

(This also leads into the next point)\n\n3) Detective score - 0 reasons for this to be there, every investigation will rank you out of 5 stars.\nTrying to jolt someones memory in the game? Well ignore the stars and just click on everything, as you wont get penalised.\n(Same with the uncovering evidence, just get the main parts you need and move on, the only reason to listen and view all parts is for the story - i have a positive for this later as well)\n\n4) Bugged side quests - Meet a ghost and solve their tale, only for the large amount of times that you exit and reload the game for them to be still wailing on about something when you return.\n(They are supposed to go to heaven... i think after you do the mission - Though it never really says, they just get ingulfed by a white light and float off)\n\n5) Masses of the same character models all throughout the game.\n\n6) Map hub world -  I can see what they were tryng to convey, what with the ghost buildings... almost like a tear in time.\nIt's just a shame that theres not much acually happening, just a lot of weirdo human NPC's hanging around in parks and on benchs in the middle of the night complaining of a murderer hanging around (Your in a park in the middle of the night... errr)\n\n7) Lack of locations.\n\n8) Possessing people - It wears thin, especially when they only have two lines of internal monologue to listen to at best.\n(Most people also have set paths if they aren't just sitting)\n\nOk, what i liked\n\n1) Character development to a degree was pretty good, the main characters are fairly well fleshed out throughout the game.\n\n2) The story, although you know it's going to be a supernatural sort of tale, it actually just ignores most of the witchcraft side of Salem until about 70% of the way through.\n\n3) The ghost stories and tales are fairly well done.\n\n4) What little locations are in the game are nice enough to look at.\n\n5) Some times the random ghosts freaked me out a bit.\n\nWhat could have made it better -\n\n1) More sections with the whole "Cat" possession :-)\n\n2) The ability to scare people and freak them out with possessions.\n\n3) More locations and places to explore.\n\n4) More... way more, NPC's and things to interact with.\n\nSo, thats all i got, i think when i was playing it i came up with a lot more negatives, but the story was pretty engaging.\nIf i had to give a score and some final comments i'd say -\n\n6/10 - Only buy if you can pick it up for less than £10.00","June 29, 2014","false","14.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/233290/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","Murdered Soul Suspect won't blow anyone away, but it's a fun game with some good ideas that are unfortunately poorly implemented at times.\n\nTo be honest, I was a bit excited when I first heard of Murdered, but the lack of advertising and previews always make me worry about the final product. By the time it released it seems the studio was already closing down and no effort was made to promote it and that way try and earn some extra money with it. This was already obvious by the unusually high amount of discounts, months ahead of its release date. This game wasn't going to win any awards, and they knew that for quite some time then.\n\nGraphically the game isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either. Models look nice and detailed, as well as the vilage. There are plenty of people walking around, ghosts and human, and there's a nice mix of still standing buildings and buildings that were destroyed in a fire a long time ago (and, like all the other ghosts, are being shown with a ghostly aura around them).\nIn the beginning it's explained why you can't just enter any building you see which sounds ridiculous when you hear it. It's obvious things were changed because of its low(er) budget. Still, it's more disappointing than it is frustrating. It would've been nice if you could go anywhere you want, but ok, that's just my opinion, of course.\nA nice touch is the addition of static ghosts in the backgrounds that disappear once you get closer to them. Nothing eery or scary but cool evertheless (and maybe even underused).\n\nThe voice acting is actually very good, especially that of Ronan and Joy. I also can't complain about the music and sounds, which range from very decent to very good.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned; it's ok-ish. I was hoping for a mysterious story and while you keep guessing until the end it didn't have the payoff I was hoping to get. About three quarters in, the story becomes clearer and your expectations will probably change. Some might like it, others might like it less. I am part of the group that liked it less. The story became less personal near the end and I was disappointed by it.\nGhosts can also be found standing and hanging around certain places. They have some creepy stories to tell, and this is one of the things the game does right. But talking to some of these ghosts will give you a conversation tree to choose from. These are absolutely worthless and add nothing to the story or game. Again a case of wanting to add too much and where it's obvious they eventually had to cut it out because of time/money constraints.\nThe real sidequests have deeper stories than the other ghosts found in the game and solving these is fun and worth the time.\n\nThe gameplay consists of walking around and pressing context-sensitive buttons. Solving cases usually require you to search the area in search of items or people and press a specific button. Once you have enough evidence to solve a case you can do this, again, by pressing a button. You then have to click a memory (which basically is a piece of evidence you found) or click on memories in a certain order (like; how something may have happened).\nStealth is also used but it's so minimal that it's barely even worth mentioning. I think these can be counted on one hand. Still, it adds some variety to the game and it's something that makes the games a little harder. They should've used it more frequently because it works well.\n\nThere are a few groundbreaking bugs in the game. Mine started with the first investigation when things are still being explained to you. The buttons and tutorial overlays didn't work so I couldn't trigger anything. After a few minutes I reloaded the checkpoint and this time it worked just fine. This happened 3 or 4 more times during the course of the game. Annoying bugs that shouldn't be there because the other elements of the game work fine and even feel polished.\n\nMurdered Soul Suspect isn't the game I originally wanted to have but it's still fun if you like ghost and detective stories. Don't expect a hardcore game here, but something a bit more casual; a game that anyone can play and finish.\nIt's not a great game, but not something mediocre either.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","June 9, 2014","true","9.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If feels more like watching a movie than playing a game. You get to play as detective Ronan O’Connor. Objective - solve your own murder, and save the terrorized Salem from The Bell Killer. Murdered: Soul Suspect offers a compelling story with several twists, and manages to entertain till the very end. There are also some side quests you can complete by helping several ghost you'll encounter during the game. These ones are optional, but are recommended to complete in order to get a better perspective of the game and your detective skills, especially since the main story is quite short. If you decide to buy it i would advice not to put much hope in the gameplay. It's quite repetitive - explore the location, gather clues on the case, escape the demons, watch the cut scene, and over again...\n\nOverall, it somehow felt intriguing and mysterious, also quite different from most of the adventure games i've played. However, even after the recent price cut from $50 to $30 i still find it a bit overpriced and would recommend to get it on sale since it's too short, and has almost no replayability value, except if you're an achievement hunter and would need to play it a second time to get the ones you've missed.","December 7, 2014","true","13.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","1"

I would say a modern adventure game, but I can't even call it that with it's lacking gameplay.\n\nYeah, it lacks action, and the puzzles are silly easy. You'll be mainly collecting "clues" and stating the obvious in "puzzles". In short it's nothing more than an elaborate scavenger hunt.\n\nOn the other hand the game's got a nice atmosphere and a good story. And ofcourse decent cinematics, being an interactive movie 'n all. Plus you can possess cats. =)\n\nSo what does the game actually have?\nThere's only a few locations, so there's not much ground to cover. But they certainly look great.\nThere are however a ton of collectibles; a few in each location about ghost stories, a bunch background story and ofcourse the main clues that get you further.\n\nSince you're a ghost, you can walk straight through walls and such, with a sublte ghostly sound and visual effect. Details like that are nicely done in the game. There's also the old city, buildings that have been brought down are still standing as a ghost, sometimes standing in your way.\nYou're not the only ghost on the block by the way, there's also a few others, but apart from the 4 sidequests, they won't have much interesting to tell. Apart from the nice Caspers, there's also demons lurking around, easy prey when they're not looking, but you're just as easy prey when they do find you.\n\nVery early on you can also possess people to read their minds and sometimes influence them in a certain direction. There's not alot you can do with it as everyone seems to be thinking the same thing, but it's a cool ghost skill I guess.\nAnd you can even play the poltergeist and make electronic devices go crazy. Maybe that'll get some attention from the living. lol.\n\nI guess it really boils down on whether you like this kind of thing.\nIt's certainly interesting if you like the story genre but don't need any heavy action and horror in a game.","August 15, 2014","true","12.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

Gameplay is 95% walking around finding hidden clues and talking to people.  The other 5% are quicktime events to defeat demons which are quite easy (and you can avoid some of them if you want).  I enjoyed the game's premise of trying to solve your own murder as a ghost.  The story is good - not great - but good.  Your character is likable, the dialog is reasonably well written, and the locations and plot points are well realized.  I enjoy hunting down hidden items in games, and this game offers that in plenty.  Most are reasonably easy to achieve, and some are quite cleverly hidden.  One set of collectibles though, the ghost girl drawings, are very difficult because you do not see them in the environment - you have to walk close to the walls and a "reveal" prompt will pop up if there is one there.\n\nIf you like adventure games and murder mysteries I think you will enjoy this game.

I never got around to playing it when it came out, money reasons mostly, but I was able to play it through a friend's library.  The game is based in Salem and follows the story of a cop who dies at the very start of the game (not a spoiler).  The "combat" in the game is mostly stealth based, there are demons, who you have to sneak up on to kill, and if they spot you, you must flee until they resume their normal patrols, but asides from that there is no real combat to speak of.  That is not a bad thing though, as the story is really nice and has a few pretty good twists in it.  The sounds in the game are really nice, and the screech that is made when demons pops up could catch you off guard, I know it did to me a few times.  There are papers, and different things to collect throughout the game, including area specific items that unlock hidden ghost stories to flesh out the town even more.  I played with my xbox one controller so I don't know how good or well the key binding is, but the controls were really nice.  I was actually quite surprised by this game, as I wasn't expecting the good story that I got.  This is not a game for everyone as there is not a whole lot to speak of for combat.  I really enjoyed the story, the somewhat unique combat system and the atmosphere.  Not much in the way of replay value, as I am not sure if there is a difficulty option, unless you wanted to 100% it there is not a whole lot of reasons to replay it.  8/10","May 18, 2015","true","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Speaking of which the detective mode is also something of an oddity, find a crime and solve it with clues found in the environment and placed together like pieces of a puzzle, I found a lot of pleasure recreating crimes to try and figure out what had happened and who the culprit was.\n\nNow onto the main meat of the game combat…. There is none. Well that’s not true, there are a few enemies and by few I mean around 12 in the whole game and the only thing that happens is when they see you a QTE begins, win and you can proceed, lose and you have to start a short ways back.

Not that it’s a bad thing, but just be sure that’s what you are looking for before you delve in.\n\nThis game offers a lot and is a great distraction if you are looking for a unique experience that’s heavy on the narrative but light in most other places.

Gaffney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141733817/","127 products in account","I enjoyed it tremendously.  Absolutely a unique experience.\n\nPlaying as a ghost was well implemented in my opinion.  They used what I found were convincing concepts in order to limit your navigation where needed, establishing clear rules from the outset.\n\nThe mystery-solving was great.  It reminded me of L.A. Noire some (but I much preferred L.A. Noire I must say, as a game and specifically in its mystery-solving methods).  My one problem with it is that there really isn't a penalty for being a poor detective.  It's up to you to challenge yourself by not selecting all the answers until you get it right.  Of course, your 'ranking' is lowered for each incorrect guess but that's not a gameplay penalty as much as a pride penalty.\n\nThe story was compelling and the voice-acting was brilliant for anyone with a name you learn in the game.  Unfortunately, most of the NPCs with names you don't know, are comically wooden and not remotely human.  I loved Joy, notable given I thought I'd hate an angsty teen written by someone that's not an angsty teen, moreover one that's meant to be comedic and have an attitude; the media don't seem to be good at that in general, so this was a nice change.\n\nThen there's the voice acting in the ghost stories.  That was phenomenal.  The stories were well written and well performed.  Absolutely a brilliant touch.\n\nI really felt connected to Julia, your wife in the game.  She's hardly in the game, but you can collect her memories, and they're written.  If you read them, you begin to develop a real sense of who she is.  I have to commend that sort of characterisation.\n\nThe main character is believable.  Probably someone I'd laugh at in real life (even though I'd still like him; he's a good person and he certainly takes things in stride), but I can't say I haven't known people like him.  And the writing and acting make that believeable.\n\nSpeaking of taking things in stride, that's one flaw in the writing; too many people take too many things in stride.  But that's negligible in the face of everything else.\n\nThe combat system isn't much of a combat system, but I felt it worked well.  In fact, had they called your one move 'exorcise' or something instead of 'execute', you could have had a true example of a great game utterly devoid of combat, where overcoming your enemy isthe best thing you can do for them.  There's a nice stealth element alongside the one move you have.\n\nThe dæmons are extremely creepy in design.  I love it.\n\nThe music is great, but I wish that in a place where it becomes tense for enemies, that it would become less tense once the enemies are neutralised.  It doesn't.  A minor flaw I suppose.\n\nThe game feels like an indie game and was developed by Airtight Games, who were apparently independent according to Wikipedia.  I say this because the graphics are rather poor compared to contemporary games, and like many indie developers, the engine used was the old UE3 engine, rather than what was most current.\n\nThere's a lot of history in the game.  Old Salem bleeds into the modern Salem as the main character (and all ghosts I imagine) sees things.  You can collect snippets of history, which were probably all accurate, as the ones I was familiar with were all correct.\n\nBonus:\nI'm a linguist, and I liked that a lot of the accents were notably correct.  The game takes placein Salem, which isn't too far from Boston.  I'm very familiar with the Boston accent as it's rather high-profile in dialects of English, and moreover as it has a significant Irish influence.  I'm not terribly familiar with Salem's accent but a lot of characters possess Boston traits so I assume they were trying to localise the accent at least as Massachusetts, which is really interesting to someone like me.  Also, a lot of Irish turns of phrase are used, which on looking them up are apparently common in that area of America, from Irish emigrants.  Nice.  Not only that, a lot of people have Irish names, which is rather realistic and once again interesting.\nOh, but the old-time Puritan accents were cat.  Absolute rubbish they were.\n\nSpeaking of cats, you can possess cats and meow and climb things and jump on things.  Another nice touch.\n","March 4, 2015","true","18.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Okay, maybe that's an overstatement, but I really enjoyed it's approach to detective work and solving the mystery of your own murder as well as the recent string of murders in Salem in a single night.\n\nYou play Ronan O'Connor, a former petty criminal/turned detective who is hot on the trail of the Bell Killer, only the opening cutscene is your own death. The game picks up right from there as you search for clues and get used to being a ghost. The devs handled the ghost mechanics rather well as far as being unable to walk into buildings from the outside unless there's an open doorway or window. But you can move through walls, bushes, benches, etc.\n\nThe story is really intriguing and it seemed like it was going to be predictable, but I was wrong. I didn't know who the killer was from the get go. So, I tip my hat to the devs for pulling a decent M Night Shamalamadingdong. Sound design is eerie, as it should be. Unnamed NPC's that walk around Salem that you can possess, well, a lot of them looked the same and had the same responses when reading their minds, that bugged me. And for being an open world town, it seemed more restricted than anything because of the ghost walls that you can't pass through. It just made the town section of the game seem a lot more linear, but like a maze.\n\nThe graphics were decent enough, but it's clear that the game was held back due to last gen consoles. I mean, some of the modeling and textures look like games from 2010.\n\nThe mystery work was a lot of fun though, searching for clues and whatnot. Good game.\n\n7.5/10","March 14, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/srs995/recommended/233290/","srs995","SRS 995","http://steamcommunity.com/id/srs995/","424 products in account","If your dream has always been playing an undead fedora-wearing douchbag neckbeard solving criminal cases like some try-hard Maltese Falcon reject who can't come to terms with the fact that he neither lives in the 1940s, nor understands the actual era (dress code included) - this might just be the game for you. Douchehat McNeckbeard might be laughably slow in how he connects clues, but he comes with a full package of mangst in the form of a fridged (of course) Manic Pixie Dreamgirl wife, and the attitude you'd expect from a 40-year-old basement dweller. If that is what you enjoy in a game, this will be a dream for you - albeit an admittedly short one, since the game is as the most 10 hours, and that's when you take your time as I did.\n\nOn a more serious note, this game did have potential, and I really wanted to like it. Tuning out the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ protagonist and his ridiculous and frankly embarrassing fashion sense (which is explained away in the most ridiculous 'didn't even try' manner possible in the game), parts of the gameplay, particularly in the beginning, were fun. Sadly the really fun parts are tragically underused, and for the course of the game following the opening mission, you experience practically nothing new. The first bigger investigation was fun especially through learning all the things you could do to get clues - connect existing clues in your head for new revelations, possess people and prompt them to reveal what they knew by triggering the right clues in their heads, seeing through their eyes into computer files, etc - but there it ended. You acquire a few more fine-tuned skills later on (teleporting, most notably), but nothing that really stands out. The fun experimental trying and testing which witness might have seen what and respond to which clues turns into a tedious button-smashing 'where's the one tiny object in the room that I keep missing?' adventure. Gameplay stagnates and turns into the same thing over and over and over again, only for Mr Fedora to finally come to a conclusion that quite frankly you could have told him after or even before entering the building.\n\nThe worst part by far is the writing. Not only are the main characters (most notably the supposed 'tough cops' who only come across as petty, ♥♥♥♥♥y, and whiny) utterly unlikeable, but the main story itself lacks any originality. For the sake of avoiding spoilers if you are for whatever reason still interested in playing, I won't go into the details further, but whatever 'twists' were apparently thought up by the writers have been done before and repeated to death, were foreseeable to the point I don't even want to call it foreshadowing anymore, and - due to the absolutely flat character writing - lacked any sort of emotional impact. I never thought a game centring around a murder investigation done by a GHOST in ♥♥♥♥ing SALEM could be boring, but this is. It's plain and simply boring, with slightly awkward, incredibly repetitice gameplay, and with the added disadvantage of the most obnoxious, annoying, self-centred, whiny wannabe-tough guy fedora-wearing neckbeard Gary Stu of a protagonist I have ever seen. It's like a bad '40s film noir rip off (BUT IN SALEM, WOOO SUPERNATURAL THINGS) gone completely wrong. And not even spectacularly wrong, just underwhelming, tedious, and most of all - disappointing.\n\nThere are worse games, of course, but this game stands out mainly because it doesn't - it's all been done before, been done better, and there is literally nothing that this game has to offer. It's not the worst, not a spectacular train wreck, but it's poor, and it's sad. Good for a few minutes of fun, and if you really have to kill time and have absolutely nothing else to do.\n\nOverall, 2/5, and that's me being nice, because I enjoyed parts of the early gameplay. Suggested time to buy: at 90% off.","July 30, 2014","false","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

At first the story is so good because you get everything told in the first few minutes. The story is interesting and will be unexpected and different the whole game. You're shocked, thrilled, scared and even sad with the characters.\n\nThis game doesn't have an open world or big levels to explore and the gamer has to follow straight the story more or less. Very, very much things can be collected, like memories, part of ghost tales and pieces of the past of the main character. An easy gameplay leads you through MURDERED and it's easy to learn. So something about the main characters: Ronan O'Connor is great designed. A taff, sometimes joking but at the same time a heartwarming person exploring the reason of his death and the murder.\n\nA little negative point: For the ghost tales you need to collect in one level around 8-14 things and when the story is told you just see a picture. Something like a simple and small film after 15 minutes seeking would be better. BUT it's a great, game and it was very cool to play.

I expected something along the lines of Ghost Trick mixed with L.A. Noire. What I got instead was essentially a much better Beyond Two Souls and that in of itself isn't a bad thing.\n\nTaking place in Salem, Massachusetts, you play as the deceased Detective Ronan O'Connor. Murdered by a mysterious serial-killer, he finds out that the only way to pass on to the afterlife and reunite with his dead wife is to figure out the murders identity identity so he may leave this mortal plane. It's a decent Whodunit story with a lot of interesting side-stories unlocked through collectibles.\n\nMy biggest problem with this game is the gameplay or lack thereof. For what it's worth, I did enjoy Murdered: Soul Suspect when you realize the game isn't trying to be Ghost Trick or LA Noire, but this is something you'll notice more and more as you'll go along. I actually think it starts out pretty well. You walk through walls, talk to fellow ghosts, discover their stories through detective work. It all seemed fine until you find out that's that where it stops. It never gets any harder, better more complex, better. The game doesn't offer much depth and at worse, becomes less interesting for the player. All you do is press X to evidence. There are no fail states in the investigation sections. There are no incentives to actually think logically and not randomly guess at what the game throws at you besides meaningless tokens and even then the game is incredibly easy. "Oh, I wonder what memory will remind this witness of the killer. Hmm... could it perhaps be this thought bubble right here called THE KILLER?" I admit, sometimes possessing a human and hearing his thoughts can be kinda cool, but it really doesn't enough with the concept. You never manipulate their actions unless it's for something incredibly mundane, never use them to walk around, there are no puzzles to solve, it just feels like a missed opportunity.\n\nBesides there's not really much to talk about. You can occasionally posses cats to find a new path to your objectives, you can try to find these loads of collectibles or.... fight random demons? Yeah, even though it's not relevant to the plot at all, you have to sneak past these dementor-like creatures or take these things down from behind stealthily, the latter being the most common. This isn't even a rare occurrence, this happened more then I could count. It's not all bad and sneaking past them does sometimes work, but why is this even here? This has no point other then to waste my time! The combat in this game couldn't be more tacked on even if you tried. I also thought using quicktime events to defeat them was incredibly annoying, because the buttons you need to press are randomized every time, but at the very least, you're given a surprisingly large amount of of time to get the right ones down so if there's one thing to praise them for it's that.\n\nIt's with this that I realized that the game isn't trying to deep in terms of gameplay and that it's going for a specific audience who don't really want to put much thought into their gaming. With that said, I still had a good time with Murdered: Soul suspect. Like I said before, the story is good and that's really what they wanted to tell here. The lightning effects and shading are some of the best I've ever seen in a computer game however this comes with the unfortunate side effect of your game for thirty seconds just to load the next area. This isn't exclusive to the PC version, even the next-gen versions suffer from frame rate drops, stutters and others but technical hiccups aside, I'd say the game is still worth a purchase, but not for full price obviously. If you're still not convinced: all I'm saying is that I'll take a Murdered: Soul Suspect which simplifies a lot of aspects about its genre then the latest 6 Final Fantasy games or so.","August 17, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Noire was like a big budget, 3D version of Ace Attorney, then this is sort of like a big budget, 3D version of Ghost Trick (which was made by the same people as Ace Attorney). Also pardon the pun, but this does feel a bit like a 'spiritual successor' to L.A. Noire, except with the focus mostly on the investigating, and some action-ish segments. Basically, if you like any of the other three games I mentioned above, you'll probably like this.\n\nIt is a little on the short and easy side, but that just means that no frustrating gameplay gets in the way of the player ploughing through the plot. The writing is a little predictable, and I managed to call most of the major plot developments within the first hour, but I still wanted to know what happened next, and to be fair I was wrong about a few things. The investigating of crime scenes is pretty fun and easy, and there's also some stealth sections where you have to sneak about excorcising some genuinely creepy demons.\n\nThere's also collectable story bits, like the thoughts of Ronan's wife or newspaper articles about the killer. In addition, each level and the over world has a unique set of collectable items (or rather, the same item you have to scavenge for 8-19 times) that, when all collected, get you a little narraration of a ghost story. Fair Warning: some of those are an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ to find if you want to 100% them.","June 5, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Is it bad? Not at all. It's the defitintion of "average".\nYou play as Ronan, a badass detective who wears a black fedora and a stupid vest and still managed to get married, who's following a lead to stop "the Bell" serial killer, who enjoys murdering women in pretty babaric ways. But the protagonist ends up dying in the first minute of the game and becomes a ghost. But not even this undead form can stop him to unravel this mistery and stop this murder once and for all with the help of Joy, a psychic teenagers who's looking for her mom. Also, she's a total ♥♥♥♥♥, almost as boring as the main character.\n\nThe gameplay takes a lot of inspiration from L.A. Noire: you have to inspect the area to find clues to answer questions about murders or misteries. Except it doesen't do that stupid sound every time you're close to a clue; I can actually say that it's a bit improved in comparison of the Rockstar game.\nYou can pass through certain walls to access secret areas, and trust me, there's a lot of secrets (about 240 in total).\n\nSo, the detective mechanic are pretty fun, but sadly, the devs though it was a good idea to add some kind of fighting system. Sometimes, random flying demons will appear, announcing themselvs with a ♥♥♥♥ing loud scream that will ♥♥♥♥ your ears every single time; how to fight them? Go on their back and click 2 buttons. It's just a time-waster mechanic, and could have easly been removed.\n\nThe mistery itself in the game is pretty ok, but honestly, I figured out most of it during the middle of the game, while Mr. Spoopi Detective realized only at the end. THOSE MURDEREDS ARE CONNECTED? AND IT'S ABOUT WITCHES? IN THE CITY OF SALEM?! WHAT A COINCIDENCE! ..Yea, is pretty lacking story whise, and most of the characters are pretty obnoxious.\n\nMusic is almost non existent in this game, so I can't really recommend anything from the soundtrack.\n\nEven tho this game is not that great, I can't help but recommend it. But why? Because at least is trying to do something different. Sure, it's borrowing a lot of mechanic and ideas from other games, but at least it's really trying to bring something that is not a classic story "kill the bad guys and win the lady". Sure, you might argue that it's kinda following that path, but it's the way they're getting there that at least is trying to be different.\n\nFinal Score: 6/10\nI highly suggest to pick this game up during a sale, or if you have the chance, get it for cheap at humblebundle.com","December 28, 2015","true","9.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

It took me about 7.5 hours(played it offline and steam doesn't track offline play) to complete this game and that is including time spent searching for collectibles and finding probably about 85-90% of them. So the complaints that the game is short are pretty valid. Had I skipped the collectibles I probably would have completed it in around 6 hours. That said, I loved every second of this game. The game probably doesn't have a lot of replay value either unless you want to go back through to finish the collectible stories or help any ghosts you passed up on your original playthough (there are only 3-4 of them though I think unfortunately.)\n\nSo I played this game until 3 am and could barely drag myself away from the keyboard to go to sleep. I am absolutely enthralled by this game and I love it. If the rest of the game is as good as the first 4 hours I've played of it then it will easily be contender for my GOTY.\n\nThe voice acting is awesome. A lot of the random civilians share the same voice actors but thats a minor thing. I recognize most of the random civilian voice actors from other big budget games. They are all great voice actors. So it seems the devs went with quality over quantity.\n\nThe visuals are great. I feel like most unreal engine games have models that look like they are made of clay, but this game does not. The ghostly effects are really cool. The way the demons move is absolutely terrifying. Animations are great all around with the possible exception of some lip syncing here and there on the minor characters.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the demons and being forced to run and hide until they lose your scent is pretty terrifying. Finding collectibles is awesome because once you find all of a set you unlock an audio short story with a piece of art and the stories are really REALLY good so far. Your ghost powers are pretty freaking awesome and the game rewards exploration with collectibles littered all over the levels.\n\nHelping other ghosts solve questions regarding their deaths and helping them move on is a great feeling. These little side mission stories are very well written and acted.\n\nFinding clues is somewhat similar to but much more enjoyable than it was in LA Noire. Once you find all the clues you do a little solving... puzzle I guess. You get three attempts to solve the puzzle. I don't know what happens if you fail all three attempts yet. But they are generally pretty self explanatory for the most part. It asks a question on the screen and you answer it by selecting the proper clue(s), sometimes in a certain order too.\n\nThe game actually makes me feel like a ghostly detective. And the story itself is amazing so far. The 63/100 metascore completely baffles me because this game is great and easily one of the best gaming experiences of the year so far.\n\nI loved the ending. It wraps everything up in a smart way. I immensely enjoyed this game. If you have any interest in ghost stories or detective mysteries then you will love this game.","June 29, 2014","true","4.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I wasn't disappointed - personally I really enjoyed the game.  The story is engaging, the acting is very good, the visuals and mood of the game are great.  I think a lot of people hating on it are either bandwagon-jumpers who haven't played it, or were just expecting a different kind of game.  A lot of complaints seem to revolve around a lack of action - you just sort of walk around and click where it tells you to.  And in reality there's not too much more to the gameplay, so if you want more then you probably won't like it.  I went in treating it as more of an interactive story - a glossed-up point-and-click adventure, if you will, and I wasn't let down.  The game does have legitimate problems, but for me none of them were deal-breakers, and were outweighed by the pros:\n\nCons:\n- suffered from performance issues and fairly frequent frame rate drops, which got worse as the game went on\n- no ability to remap keys\n- the mouse didn't work for all the menu items\n- no chance to go back and finish collecting items once you've entered the final level, meaning you'd have to play through the game again in order to try and get everything.  As much as I like the game, I'm not interested in playing it all again just to finish up a few achievements\n- the demons were really more of an annoyance than anything - they should have played more of a roll or just been pulled altogether\n- a lot of the investigations were far too simple to solve, while a small few were unreasonably obscure\n\nPros:\n- Great voice acting\n- Great camera work\n- Great atmosphere\n- Great story\n- NOT too short - I put 12-13 hours into the game by taking my time, doing the side missions, collecting artifacts, and generally immersing myself into the really good story.  I'd rather play a really enjoyable 8-12 hour game than spend 2 or 3 times that on something I end up barely able to finish because I've gotten so sick of it (L.A. Noire springs to mind).  Besides, at 12 hours I spent barely over a buck per hour on it - that's pretty good value in my book.\n\nSo overall it's probably not worth full price, but easily worth $15-$25, as long as you enjoy story-driven adventure games.","August 7, 2014","true","13.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

I like the idea about being a ghost who searches his murderer very much. Mindreading people is fun for 10 minutes until you realize that it is good for nothing if you are not currently searching for clues.\n\nThe bad clues:It starts with the bad experience in the first scene, you have to search for clues. You are even told how many there are and how many you already have.\nYou think, "cool, searching a murder scene for clues".\nYou saw in a video what happened, you were thrown through a window from high above. So why is broken glass a "clue"? Why? Why is your gun a clue? You have to find.. don't know 7 or 9 clues and you get NO new info out of these clues.\nAnd it is really as bad as in my first adventures, more than 20 years ago. You have to find the pixel which is the clue. But is worse than 20 years ago, because you do not just move your mouse, you move a character and the character has too look at the pixel.\n\nNext scene, you have to find x/y clues. After a while you realize, it is again moving around until you get the info that you are looking at a clue. Cool...not. It gets worse. You don't believe me? It GETS worse.\nYou will get no hint in that direction, but sometimes, for example in the second scene, you will not find all clues, but you have to conclude from your already found "clues".\nThese conclusions are the worst you can imagine. Nope. That is not true. They are worse.\nThere is NO logic (no human logic at least) behind the decision which picture is the right to chose.\nThen, after this is done, sometimes you have new sensitive pixels in the scene. Somewhere.\nSometimes it is so bad, you KNOW that there, at exact that spot has to be the pixel you want to "find" (google, walkthrough or load game), but you have to move and turn and snake around the pixel until you get it.\n\nSo, what have we until now? Pixel searching, clues which give you no clue and missing logic in the conclusions you HAVE to make.\n\nCan it get worse?\n\nIt can.\nBut at least it is a taste thing. Some - adventure lovers - will see it as normal, some - as me - will start to hate.\nYou see, there will be puzzles. These will be of the kind: "I am a ghost and have no clue, help me". Then you search a radus of 5 meters around the ghost for x/y clues (you remember that one, right?) and will come to totally unlogic conclusions and "puff", the ghost is happy and goes away to heaven. Yeah, real police stuff, you know.\n\nAnd then, then there are the demons. In a game about ghosts, why should be there no demons you ask?\nBecause they are used as action/stealth elements which make the game longer, have you die and get you to curse a lot.\nIf you find in the steam forum some message about "how to disable demons", then you know, you are not alone with your frustration. These demons do not really make sense for the story of the game. STOP! NO THEY DON'T!\nThey just get in your way when you want to continue with the story.\n\nOh oh. The story.\nI have to say, the story is kind of good and interesting. But had I known how brutal the game (what is told and what you see in backflashes) will become, I would not have bought it.\nI do not like brutality or sadism in my games. And I like really happy endings in my games.\n\nI was sad when the story ended, not because the game was finished, I was so happy that I was done with it,\nbut I was sad because the story told about horrid fates of young friendly girls who just had wanted to help others.\n\nConclusionIf you a an adult adventure lover, get it. You will love it, I fear.\nFor all others, keep away, don't get it, not even cheap. Just DO NOT GET IT!\nAnd do NOT give it to your children to play it. I think, the story is just too brutal.

You take the role of Ronan O'Connor, a former bad boy turned good guy. Everything begins seconds after you've just been thrown from a fourth story window by the game's primary antagonist. The fall almost kills you and the subsequent bullets to the chest finish the job, meaning you play through the entire game as a ghost. Murdered: Soul Suspect plays out like a puzzle game along the lines of L.A. Noire. As a detective Ronan must uncover clues and evidence to track down the Bell Killer. As a ghost in limbo, Ronan has a number of abilities at his disposal. Although he cannot walk through external doors unless they are opened by someone else, once inside a building Ronan can walk through walls and other obstacles. He can fall great distances and not get hurt and he is able to possess people to read their thoughts, influence their actions and peek at their notes or at their computer screens. He can even possess other creatures such as cats to get to hard to reach areas. In addition to the primary plotline being very interesting, the game generally has a very well-designed backdrop, numerous side quests, and superfluous opportunities to discover more about the characters and places featured in the game.Another part of Murdered that works pretty well is the look of the game. When Ronan walks through the streets of Salem, he sees a mixture of how it is now interspersed with what it looked like during the witch trials of the 17th century. The modern Salem is in full color, but the old Salem is in blue and white, and the contrast is striking. The character models and cut scenes are also rendered well. Really, the production values for Murdered are about as good as you’re going to see in a game. The audio multiplies the eerie feeling as well, with some haunting background music. The music, combined with the sound effects works marvellously.I really liked the look, the atmosphere, and the story behind Murdered: Soul Suspect.Although at times the pace of the game can seem a little slow, I have found that Murdered: Soul Suspect to be an enjoyable detective experience – even if it is somewhat simplified detective work.If you’re a fan of mysteries, Murdered: Soul Suspect would be a worthy purchase.

The writing is good for the most part but the delivery can be a bit strange sometimes. It took me just under six and a half hours to beat the game and I would recommend if you enjoy the games mentioned earlier. I also recommend going in without knowing too much about the game, which is why I don't want to write too much here.","November 23, 2014","true","6.4"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","3"

This game has alot of mixed reviews but none great ones, this is because it falls very short on some expectations gameplay-wise because its freaking boring and empty. What isnt boring and empty is the story....I could go so far as to compare this as a story driven game. It can be very much enjoyble if you are not bothered by the "run everywhere and pick everything up" <basicly all the gameplay in a nutshell for this game. Of course there are some "detective" work though its basicly click on the words or events which are related (somehow) or that describe this scene by clicking words like "Panic", "Begging" or "Happy". Its impossible to fail the game, you could get caught by demons, click on all wrong "detective" events and it will just keep giving you chances to try again unles you do it.\n\nFor my overall opinion I guess I can call this a relaxing game with basic puzzle-solving elements that you can stare at and let your mind go blank, its not a bad game even though its no challange and one time I nearly got stuck possessing a woman walking outside of a gas station. I enjoyed the story and there is a hell of alot of stuff collectables you can pick up and read. Thought its always worth finding all the collectables to unlock a "ghost story" audio, they can be a little cliche but damn they are entertaining to listen in. Oh and one last thing, sometimes its hard finding stuff to click on like clues, the detection on some of these are really small but they are always in the tiny area you search in....though just a heads up for the last thing you do near the end of the game where you only have 3 seconds to find something to click on... clue: "hand" Literally impossible with the 3 seconds you have to click on this tiny ♥♥♥ thing, I had to google it after clicking everywhere. >.<","October 6, 2014","true","11.1"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

This game got 1/5 for gameplay 3/5 for story.\n\n-The game basically holds your hand through the whole game. There is no punishment for getting anything wrong, and some clues are really stupid. I figured out the run button long ago and the game tried to teach me that after a while.\n\n-Gameplay sucks, basically you run around and collect garbage. That is what you do, the only thing that made it even get that score was the story which isn't that great.\n\n-Characters are all have the same faces with the same thoughts. Salem had too many people with the same faces that if the killer was one of them, we wouldn't find him.\n\n-Demons are just in the way, they didn't make the gameplay any better. It made it worse since the design for the Ghost things to hid in was far away from you, or covered by a wall, or all of them in the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ room which the demons don't even go in. Ravens that supposed to help you are either far away or the range of their screams doesn't reach the demon that you wana kill. And quick time event is not my idea of a fun game. Wish they didn't created the so called demons because they always delayed me from continuing the storyline. Boring @ss obstacles on the ground, forcing you to go around them because they are demon pits or something.\n\n-All the cats have the same color which is black in Salem.\n\n-Some places you think it should be possible to teleport to but you can't even though you did it during a story mode.\n\n-Some escorting missions are stupid and *Spoiler* HOW the hell would July sneak into the church without the police even noticing her?\n\n-*Spoiler* there is a Ghost train, so how the hell does an object have a ghost? Why doesn't animals get ghost too, since objects with no soul can have ghosts.  Throw the logic on the ground when you play the game.\n\n- You can't recollect the other stuff once you reach a check point in the game. I tried to see the story about the (Need Gas) but with the game desgin you MUST replay the whole thing once you enter the Judgment house. Another example of  terrible game design (wish they had the chapter saving to return to the point you need to finish any achievement you missed during your first play through) instead you have autosave.\n\n+ The only thing I liked about this game was the graveyard thief story and nothing else.\n\nI pre-ordered this game and just got to play it. Wait for a sale to buy it, and don't waste more than 10$ on it.","October 12, 2014","false","13.0"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

The graphics are just amazing, and thanks to the Unreal engine, the game runs smooth as butther with everything maxed out.\n\nV-sync limits the game to 30FPS, but you can switch that off and just enable V-sync in your GPU options (Catalyst Control or Nvidia center) which gives you all the smooth awesomeness of 60FPS.\n\nThe story of this game is brilliant, and the spooky atmosphere just adds to the overall setting of the game. The way you interact with your surrounding and figure out the clues is great, but I was hoping getting stuff wrong would give you a penalty of some kind... Then again, it is an adventure game and most of them are very linear.\n\nThere is no combat apart from banishing demons witch can be really difficult at some parts but nothing an average gamer can't figure out.\n\nI was afraid that the ending will be a dissapointment compared to the massive build up of the story (and the bodies murdered) but the game really delivered. After YEARS of trying to find something different and new in the adventure game genre, Murdered: Soul suspect finally brings tons of new mechanics, great voice acting, an amazing story and a beautiful engine to finally burst life into a slumbered genre.\n\nHats off to the devs and the writters.","February 10, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend this game if you're looking for something new in your roguelike/dungeon-crawling experiences... it was *the* most polished Early Access Alpha I had ever played, and is even better now that it is released.\n\n\nGraphics\nVery nice and consistently styled, even in the character screen. The choice in what a friend of mine put as "playful yet macabre" is spot-on, and a very nice change of pace from other roguelikes (not that those are bad, but FMR is a unique breath of fresh air).\n\nSound\nEverything from the music to the effects is lovely and fitting to the visual theme. Moody, atmospheric, ethereal, magical, mysterious, spooky... that is what comes to mind while playing and it's a joy to listen to! Some of the tracks really remind me of the greatness that was the soundtrack for Psychonauts (my favorite game of all-time).\n\nControls\nSmooth and intuitive when using the keyboard+mouse (controls are customizeable as well, so you can play however you want). I don't play games this twitch-reliant with a controller, but feedback about it in general has been very positive.\n\nGameplay\nThe randomization, pin/item/relic/Loa/leveling "build" system works really well but isn't so random that you're screwed if you get bad drops. Since your core setup is however you want to do it (and very easy to experiment with), there is enough consistency to do theorycraft and gameplay mastery... a *very* nice change from the *completely* random roguelikes. I love randomization, but it's nice to have something to play that is a good mix of random and static.\n\nThe variety in gameplay is great, giving a pleasurable dose of strategic fighting and completely chaotic shmup-style play. Because FMR has this kind of variety, you never really get sick of it. Just when you're tired of one style, you roll a level that's totally different. I'm over 125 hours into it as of this writing, and I'm still not even close to be tired of any of it.\n\nProgression is incredibly satisfying, but I'll speak more to that below.\n\nGenre\nWhile the game is most commonly categorized as a roguelike (or rogue-lite), I see it as a mix of roguelike, bullet-hell/shmup, and dungeon-crawler. It's a fantastic mix, and adds a ton to the scale and variety of traditional roguelikes.\n\nDifficulty\nSome may find their intital play sessions to be too easy, but the difficulty curve is not even remotely a cakewalk later on. If you feel it's too easy, just keep playing... later difficulties/quests are *much* harder and varied. You'll soon find yourself cursing (joyfully) at failed runs. Because of this, I do *not* consider this game a rogue-lite... if anything, it's just one that isn't ultra hardcore in the start and eases you into the insanity. A perfect game to introduce someone to the genre, but has enough hardcore craziness to keep even the most experienced of players happy.\n\nDifficulty in this game is where the real progression and satisfaction resides. Leveling/etc. is a nice way to ease the player into the various mechanics of the game, but the meat of it all is in the variety of difficulties you unlock. Don't expect to be carrot-and-sticked the entire time with pointless leveling and unlocks... instead, expect to get your satisfaction from mastering incredibly difficult situations that (in the later difficulties especially) require perfected playing skills.\n\nContent\nLevel modifiers, difficulties, level palletes, mission objectives, mobs (and their variations), bosses, items, Loas, etc. all have a great amount of variety already, and further post-release patches are planned which is just icing on the already delicious cake. I was already very happy with the content amount in the early alpha, and that has far more than doubled between then and release. Because of the amount there is, and because of how it's sectioned out between the different quests, you always have a ton of choice depending on your mood and a helluva lot to experience, master, and be surprised by.\n\n\n\nA quick note: I am in the credits for the game for the QA work I was voluntarily doing (a nice surprise, so thank you devs!). I am not a developer or paid contractor for this game and have no bias in that regards... I just love testing, and the community was silent during a time when they really needed feedback so I stepped up. My review would be exactly the same even if I hadn't done testing for it.\n","August 2, 2014","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can get 100% without any guides in about 10 hours, even less if you just rush the main story. Yet the game (or should I say "the movie"?) is also fun and well made. Not an AAA-title, but it's definitely a game I sincerely enjoyed.\n\nI liked the dark setting, the overall style and visuals and all the little details here and there. Also the detective story is not bad. The first half of the game is the best because you don't really understand what is going on. After that the rough outline of the story becomes more and more clear which made it a bit less interesting for me. This game may also be for you if you like to just wander and see all what there is to see in the world (though it's definitely not Skyrim).\n\nAlso it is an easy game. You can't fail even if you try really hard! The gameplay is linear as a stick, the investigations can be brute forced (although they are not difficult anyway) and there no story choices to make at all, even cosmetic ones. Action sequences (the demons) become a chore rather quick.

I really enjoyed the gameplay however there is very little combat so if you don't like games without combat you're probably not going to enjoy this. So if you're not interested in the story then I'm almost certain you wont enjoy the game.\nThe only bit of combat in the game is very boring and frustrating, as you will be investigating when suddenly a demon will appear and chase you and you will have to keep hiding in these little spectral gas bubbles. This is very tedious and in my opinion something that the game would be better without.\nThe ending of the game is one of the best endings I've played in a while, it is a bit annoying that you are not able to return to the town of Salem after completion of the game but this is not disastrous as this will only bother serious completionists who want every collectible.\nThe game took me about 12 hours with exploring pretty much everything I saw so I guess it would take 8 hours or so without that.

While it doesn't take long to play it through (I needed 8 hours and I took my time) it was fun while it lasted. I am not sure about the replay value, though. The game heavily relies on its thick atmosphere and the story twists to drive you along and I imagine it will be less fun the second time around.\n\nIf you don't care for pages after pages of story or lots of cut scenes or do expect a certain amount of fighting in your games you should skip this one, though. There are a few "fight" scenes but you have to solve them through misdirection and stealth. No open combat.\n\nStill, if you do enoy a good story and an atmospheric game you should give this one a try. I recommend playing it at night or in a darkened room - both for the atmosphere and to see all the details on the screen. You should also take the time and gather as many clues as possible, especially for the small side quests.

That little mechanic made it feel more immersive considering the story wasn't riding on backtracking or extra digging.\nSomething that stood out for me in the way of dialoge was that everyone who speaks doesn't necessarily talk one at a time. Characters will get cut off and complete their thoughts later in a way that doesn't sound like a script nor rehearsed, with exception to the protagonist's classic-detective style inner monolouges.\nHowever, the quick-time controls felt awkward, the game was too short (beat it within twelve hours with a majority of the achievements done), and many "clues" didn't seem to make sense when trying to piece crimescenes together.\nThe promise of unique abilities ("personal strengths becoming abilities) was limited to maybe one or two involving revealing information (which felt closer to the protagonist's job rather than his actual strengths). Even only one other ghost displayed only one unique ability that didn't seem to connect to their character. All of the other abilities you gain belong to the other ghosts you find as well, making the protagonist (and the other ghost with a unique ability) possess very cookie-cutter characteristics.\nVery little direction is taken towards obstacles you run into like the demons, spiteful cops, or paranoia plaguing the area, thus leaving much more to be desired in character development.\n"Extra" characters aren't even kept within the game for very long, making it feel as though there are only four real characters, and many filler characters.\nI "did" enjoy the game and do recommend it for those who enjoy dark, investigative, or easy-paced games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidid/recommended/233290/","liquidid","Liquid ID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidid/","131 products in account","Murdered: Soul Suspect is a story driven game in it's entirety.  The initial events and investigations that followed kept me interested enough to keep playing to the end.  In that regard, Murdered succeeds and is why I'm giving it a thumbs up recommendation.  However, if I was able to vote with both thumbs, it would be one up and one down... I was on the fence about this one.   Why?\n\nOn the positive side, the story of a modern murder mystery slowly unraveling as the victim himself uncovers the truth is satisfying.  It starts very strong and doesn't end the way you might expect, so that was refreshing.  But there comes a point when as a player you piece together the basic gist of what is happening but Ronan takes a while longer to 'get it'.  This is about mid-point in the game and it was quite frustrating because Ronan is supposed to be an investigator but due to his inability to make the connections before the player does, the game seems to drag until Ronan catches up.  The ending does leave a lot of 'huh?' questions in your mind and does feel a little anti-climactic.  I think this is mostly due to discovering several things all at once in once scene, then end credits.  There is no pacing to the final shocking revelations, and therefore no real chance to feel closure, empathy, relief, satisfaction... none of it.  It's there but it happens too fast.  So fast that Ronan doesn't even react to a world-shattering personal discovery.\n\nThe characters are memorable.  Pairing the main character Ronan with a mostly reticent, feisty, but intelligent teen Joy adds a lot of chemistry.  Joy is well written and performed.  For me she was the star.  Ronan was a rough and tumble kind of guy before meeting his soulmate, and the mellow, tolerant side of him is done well but that's the only side we get to see.  I was severely disappointed by the lack of strong emotion or raw aggression that could have bled through on many occassions but doesn't.  Sadly Ronan comes off as deadpan.\nThe environment is very well done, with a quiet moody setting where the grim nature of it's history can be seen through your dead eyes.\n\nOn the negative side, this is a game.  Or more precisely, it tries to be a game.  Almost every single game aspect  just gets in the way, slows things down, and makes you wish the substance it hides was more fleshed out.  The presence of demons and the need to evade and/or exorcise them is haphazardly thrown into the mix.  They look cool and scare the crap out of you when they start chasing you, but these notably gameplay moments seem so disjointed from the story.  It's like the developers said 'OK let's just throw some game in right here'.\nThere is a heavy collecting element to this game if you want your story fleshed out.  From Ronan's background, to his relationship with his lost wife, to history of the setpieces... it's all locked away in the text granted to you when you find something which is not always related.  I'd say maybe half of these were worth reading for good background info.  The rest were all useless to the story and the game.  Of special note are the area specific ghost stories you can unlock.  Most of them are interesting and I really wish they had been incorporated into the story somehow.\nThe investigation and possession elements were great concepts that were presented so incredibly poorly.  When you attempt to solve an investigation the premise is that you take clues and piece them together to come to a conclusion.  Among those pieces are clues that don't help.  If you get one clue wrong, it exits the minigame and you start again.  So all you have to do is keep trying each one until you get it right, and there aren't that many to choose from anyways.  It feels really pointless.  You can inhabit the body of people and read or influence their thoughts, but the thoughts are so plain and boring and the chances to influence people are few and far between.  More wasted potential.\n\nMy recommendation is to enjoy the game for the story and just follow the carrot.  The gameplay is easy enough to just get through so you can keep the main story moving along.  Collecting and killing demons and exploration are entirely not necessary (unless you want achievements in which case you will be forced to grind through everything).  The game length felt good for a story driven game; not so short that I felt ripped off but not too long that I felt it was watered down or needless.\nI'd also recommend getting this at $15 or less, which I feel is a fair price point.","March 31, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The collectables add little bits of information and stories on their own which I enjoyed finding. Playing as a ghost, you are able to walk through most walls and furniture, possess people and read their thoughts (the latter not as good as it sounds, basically generic two liners for each person, not all different), find clues and piece it all together. The bit I enjoyed most was helping other ghosts discover what had happened to them, collecting the clues and setting them at peace. I wish there'd been a lot more of that.

The story did have me interested, but mostly i was too distracted searching far and wide for the many MANY collectable side story items/collectable intel.\n\nLoved the idea of being able to walk through walls, i've never played a game with that kind of mechanic and i liked it.

Ronan travels around the town of Salem investigating his own murder case as well as those of other townsfolk. Main story was enjoyable, as well as the side mini-stories fueled by the collection of 'evidence' around the town. The ghost aspect was neat, as you could walk through walls, possess people and animals, influence their thoughts and more of that nature. Could have used some variety in the options of interacting with NPCs, but I didn't mind it much. The game has a simple combat system which I found to work out great in the end as it allowed you to continue focusing on the story rather than get distracted and spending hours sneaking by monsters as some other games have you do. In the end, I am very satisfied with how this game played out and do not regret purchasing it one bit. However, I would not recommend purchasing this at full price (~$30), but if it can be found on sale below that, I would definitely suggest picking it up.","February 16, 2015","true","25.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So here's my take on the game.\n\nGameplay:Many people compare this with L.A. Noire but I think the two games are vastly different. This game leans more towards an adventure game, if I have to find another game to compare it with, this game is pretty close in concept to the Blackwell Series (which is awesome, go grab it) in that the game asks you to solve a murder mistery and also help other spirits move on by helping them to know why they died and resolve their situation. In a way, it's almost a 3D version of the Blackwell series, with the emphasis on adventure, finding clues and solving puzzles.\n\nSome people complained that the stealth action parts of this game (exorcising demons) are too difficult and annoying. I think it's not that difficult, but if you DO find it hard and it breaks the game for you, there's a simple cheat/patch out there that you can use to completely nullify the stealth action parts and turn it entirely into an adventure game, which might help make this game infinitely better for you.\n\nStory:Personally, I think the story is the main strong point of this game. As a lover of classic supernatural adventure games, such as the Gabriel Knight series, this IS the game for me. I also love games that are based on history or cult stories (such as the Assassin's Creed series), and knowing that this game mixed some real history (the Salem witch trials) to the plot just makes it more immersive for me. There is even one character from the Salem witch trials history that appears here, which might surprise some that are in the know of this story.\n\nBut as with any story out there, like when watching a movie or reading a book, this section is entirely subjective and either you like it or you don't. If you find out that you don't like the premise, then you have no reason to play this game at all, as there is nothing else to find here if you dislike the story. It will quickly get boring for you.\n\nGraphics:Played this game on my ASUS laptop with GeForce GT650M 2GB DDR3 graphics and the game runs fine on mostly high settings (see the screenshot I posted of this game for more details) with no stuttering framerates or slowdowns. The graphic quality is awesome and totally realistic, from the facial expressions of the characters to the textures and clothings. Ronan, especially, is rendered with truly amazing detail, I was a bit speechless when I saw his semi-transparent ultra-detailed character model during the opening moments. If you have a decent graphics card, this game can render truly amazing details for your enjoyment.\n\nSound:Voice acting is very good, especially for the lead character Ronan. The music and ambient sounds successfully brings out the haunting and crreepy atmosphere of the story. The sound effect is carefully designed to great effect, especially the shrieks of those demons which can literally get you jumping out of your seat if you're playing with headphones on during the middle of the night.\n\nWeakness:There is no in-game map. But the town of Salem is not that large and pretty soon you will be able to get your bearings around town by memory alone. The only difficult route to remember was probably the one that leads to the church, because you need to take a specific route to get there. If you're worried about getting all the collectibles, there are a lot of guides and videos out there that can help you, so you don't have to worry about that at all.\n\nVerdict:7.0 - A must buy for mystery/murder/detective adventure game lovers out there, especially those who loved the Gabriel Knight or the Blackwell series.\n\nTIP: Don't buy it with the full price. This game often goes on sale, so better wait for it to go on sale and grab it. I got it for just $3.99 during the most recent Square Enix sale.\n\nTIP #2: Play with a game controller, not with a keyboard and mouse. It will make a whole lot of difference and can make or break the game for some people.","February 17, 2015","true","14.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play a cop who gets killed by the serial killer he is investigating only for him to become a ghost. Even worse for him he can't move on until he finds out who the serial killer is and then stop him. Playing a ghost is actually quite fun as you can walk through walls and objects as well as possess living characters and listen to their thoughts and influence them. The gameplay is a bit lacking though as most of the game involves investigating by searching for clues and then concluding the investigation by picking the most important clues thus moving the story along. The only enemies you encounter are demons which are easily dispatched by sneaking up behind them and killing them and the encounters with them are too few and far between to be a problem. The biggest dissappointment with this game is that they could have done so much more with the ghost stuff to make the gameplay better.\n\nThe Good:\n-Interesting idea for a game and it works quite well.\n-Decent story which is the games main strength. Also the setting of Salem is brilliant and the atmosphere is great.\n-Playing as a ghost is quite fun even if they could have done so much more with it.\n\nThe Bad:\n-Game is really easy and doesn't provide much in the way of a challenge.\n- Pretty short and padded out with having loads of collectibles.\n\nOverall this is a decent game if not perfect.Worth picking up on sale.","April 19, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054050389/recommended/233290/","76561198054050389","Sársauki","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054050389/","54 products in account","Short version:+ Amazing detective story\n+ Background stories of characters to uncover\n+ Possess cats and never ending cigarette\n+ No need to use doors, just walk through walls\n- Obviously made for consoles\n-- Boring and linear gameplay\n-- No action, apart from demons\n\n= 6.5/10\n\nLong version:First of all, this game has a Metascore of 59/100 and I can kind of understand why. This is not about the story or the characters, but mainly because of the gameplay.\n\nWARNING: minor spoilers (not really spoilers, but just in case, you know). Marked them.\n\nStory: The story is simply ah-ma-zing. In my opinion, it’s a great murder mystery in which you have to solve your own death (and prevent others from dying too). The whole ghost-idea is greatly elaborated in the story and makes the whole thing quite original: you’re not the usual cop who has to solve the usual murder mystery. The game has some great (and by that I mean unexpected and mind-blowing) plot twists. And, honestly, I didn’t expect the actual murderer to be the murderer, if you know what I mean.\n\nCharacters: I LOVE how the characters’ stories become clear throughout the game. Most of the characters’ stories are quite vague when you start the game, but as you progress and collect artifacts, you learn more about each one of them. It made me want to keep playing, not only to know who my killer was, but also to know more about other people’s lives and deaths (and Ronan’s tattoos, for example). The side quests are nice additions to the story; they aren’t very long, but quite interesting, too. The main characters aren't really stereotypes, in my opinion. For example, the fact that Ronan was a gangster himself while he was young, doesn’t make him the stereotype cop (not really sure if spoiler, but marked just in case). It makes the game much more interesting than your usual detective story. The side characters, on the other hand, are much more flat and typical.\n\nGameplay: Not great. Even boring, after a while. You walk around in Salem, investigate surroundings to find clues, possess people (and cats!), hide from and defeat demons, poltergeist stuff, and, well, that’s about it. It’s the same thing over and over again, for the maximum of 15 hours of gameplay the game has to offer (one playthrough). No real puzzles, just looking around and finding things. No real action, I believe there’s a maximum of 20 demons to defeat throughout the game. The combat is boring: you have to sneak up to them and kill them with nothing but your bare hands. You have no defense apart from some hiding spots. The demons are in my opinion unnecessary and only a burden to the game. The game’s pretty linear, too. You have no choice but to follow the storyline. Between cutscenes, you can walk around freely in Salem and the areas you’ve already visited throughout the story.\n\nAlso, it’s obvious this is a game made for consoles, not for pc. I mean, “Press START”? You’re joking, right? You’re unable to change the controls, so if you’re playing with an AZERTY-keyboard, you’ll have to change the language settings of your pc. I really recommend playing this with a controller, if you have one: it suits the overall gameplay much better.\n\nOther: Great graphics. The creepy music fits the atmosphere and story perfectly. Good voice acting. Achievements are relatively easy to obtain, apart from some artifacts. Also, DO NOT ENTER THE MUSEUM IN THE END OF THE GAME before you’ve collected all artifacts! You won’t be able to return, or play the whole game from the start to collect the missing ones.\n\nConclusion: I was doubting whether I would go for recommended or not, since the gameplay is such a disappointment. I did go for recommended, because I haven’t seen such a great and original detective story in all my life.\n\nI wouldn’t recommend buying this game if it’s not on sale: €30 ($37.5?) is way too pricey in my opinion.\nLike detectives, murder mysteries and story-driven games? I guess you can give this a shot.\nWant action, adventure and shooting? Not the right game for you.","December 29, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The best part of the game is slowly unlocking the riddle surrounding your own murder and many others, as well as piecing together the stories of lost souls you encounter along the way.

It doesn't pull punches when it comes to death cut scenes however, so if you're adverse to gunshots, spontanious screaming and the like, put it on mute and turn on subtitles.\n\nThe only complaints that I have is the fact that there is no adjustable difficulty level, which isn't super important unless you are playing on the PC and find it hard to properly exorcise demons. Pressing and holding R plus A and right clicking all at once while only being given less than 5 seconds gets super frustrating after a while.\n\n\n","June 18, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can get 100% without any guides in about 10 hours, even less if you just rush the main story. Yet the game (or should I say "the movie"?) is also fun and well made. Not an AAA-title, but it's definitely a game I sincerely enjoyed.\n\nI liked the dark setting, the overall style and visuals and all the little details here and there. Also the detective story is not bad. The first half of the game is the best because you don't really understand what is going on. After that the rough outline of the story becomes more and more clear which made it a bit less interesting for me. This game may also be for you if you like to just wander and see all what there is to see in the world (though it's definitely not Skyrim).\n\nAlso it is an easy game. You can't fail even if you try really hard! The gameplay is linear as a stick, the investigations can be brute forced (although they are not difficult anyway) and there no story choices to make at all, even cosmetic ones. Action sequences (the demons) become a chore rather quick. Overall it was not a problem since I played not for challenge but rather for relaxation.","September 21, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I guess because of the different path options of another certain "poltergeist simulator" if you like i.e. Beyond Two Souls it is often a shame when I play games like this now and there aren't multiple endings (even Silent Hill 2 had different endings on replays), but I guess we are a little spoilt, and this isn't trying to be a David Chase or a Deus Ex game.\n\nThe idea itself was so novel and appealing I knew I had to grab this eventually, it reminded me of the basic premise of the old PS2 game Shadow of Memories in which you travel back in time to solve your own murder. In this moody, supernatural almost LA Noire style of setting I knew I couldn't resist. It wasn't until I played it I realised it's all set in Salem, so given that the backstory and local folklore have a large presence in this game, this was one hell of a bonus for me given my interest in the witch hunts and magic.\n\nThe music and atmosphere didn't disappoint. The backstory and tragic history is incorporated into it very well, and the way in which this game combined supernatural elements with crime scene investigation was really inventive and original.  As said, there are things you can miss as well, but this is mostly side missions. I guess few games if any have really matched LA Noire in this department.\n\nThe graphics look great, can't fault the voice acting either. In terms of the horror elements, as a puzzle game it's challenging enough, but seeing the same ghouls everywhere gets very repetitive very quickly, and it just becomes a chore of running, hiding and timing. It's different enough but just has no variety, still I can see how hard it is to do something really novel and inventive with the ghost-themed survival horror format. Especially if you are a ghost yourself.\n\nOverall great game worth getting, worth experiencing and worth playing again, just don't be too disappointed by the length and lack of variety in gameplay....Salem does allow for some exploration, though.","June 7, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The features they implemented in it (like going through stuff, blocking off places thus hiding object from you, etc.) are good.\nHowever the controls are a little bit wonky. Sometimes you need to perfectly aim your sight to get what you want. One of the main features of the game is introduced late and not used as often as they could have.\nThe story is is entertaining, but not the best. Eventually everything's coming together and there's a big surprise at the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/recommended/233290/","yourtipoftheday","MadeUnderground","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/","127 products in account","To be honest, I feel that this game got a lot more flack than was deserved. Is it perfect? No, but I think the criticisms were a bit extreme. Mind you, most of the criticisms I read were during the time that it was initially released and some of it had to do with bugs.\nI'm guessing that by the time I bought the game (4 months after release) all those bugs were fixed because I didn't really have any of the issues that they were talking about. There were times, however, I noticed that the narration would cut out. This happened in maybe 3-5 different cutscenes were there was just no sound at all - the only way I knew what was supposed to have been said during the scene was because I always have subtitles on.\n\nI think what hurt the game more than anything else was the story. It was okay, but I feel that it could have been better - more developed maybe. Also I feel like the characters were poorly written.\nI say this because I felt no emotion towards any of them whatsover. The wife was annoying, and there were too many random collectibles of her memories with him - I'm guessing like finding pages of her diary or something scattered around. I felt myself annoyed with all of these and couldn't care less about her or their relationship.\n\nThe friendship or, partnership I guess, between Ronan and Joy felt really shallow. Since Joy is the character Ronan interacts with the most throughout the game, I was hoping for more development in their friendship.  Also the way Joy treated Ronan after he saves her from The Bell Killer is ridiculous. I'm not expecting her to want to help him right away but it was a bit much imho\n\nI couldn't even find myself caring about Ronan himself. None of the characters in the game were developed enough for me to root for them or care about them in anyway.\n\nAlso I felt it was strange that all the events in the entire game takes place in one night. Why on earth was that one couple getting married in the middle of the night / wee hours of the morning?\n\nThe demons in the game were laughable. It felt like it was just thrown in at the last minute to give the game some kind of combat in it. They should have either given the combat more diversity or taken the demons out completely, in my opinion. I didn't play the game with combat in mind so I wouldn't have cared if there was no combat in this game. There are perfectly good Adventure Mystery games with absolutely no combat in it (the majority of Sherlock Holmes titles for example).\n\nWith all that negative out of the way now for the positives: I appreciate the game trying to do something different. I'm a big fan of Adventure Mystery type games and one that approaches it from the perspective of a ghost is innovative and interesting. I enjoyed walking through walls and possessing adorable felines, as well as the people around town.\nIt would have been great if they expanded a bit more on this - more animals to possess, control over individuals in town like how Abigail was able to control humans to do her killings  , as well as being able to poltergeist more items.\n\nTo sum up my review, I would recommend people to give the game a go. It's enjoyable and fun and I definitely don't think it deserved 59 on metacritic. I would rate it more of a 6/10. It's worth a play through to get to play and experience something different. The mystery is also relatively engaging.\nI just wouldn't get this game at full price - wait for a sale. I was able to scoop it up during one for 4.99.","June 25, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, when it appeared on sale for £5 I decided to give it a chance and I am very glad I did.\n\nThe star of this game is its story, where you play as the ghost of Ronan O'Connor, a detective in modern day Salem. For a large part it feels like a point and click adventure game where the emphasis is on finding the pieces and putting them together rather than on any sort of direct action. Gameplay revolves around investigations that are heavily reminiscent of L.A. Noire (another game I really enjoyed) except you can walk through walls and interrogating people is mostly replaced with possessing them to influence their mind. Perhaps owing to the length of the story (it only took me around 8hrs to complete the main quest, all side quests and most collectibles) both the story and gameplay never outstayed their welcome and remained entertaining to the very end.\n\nThe main negative in this game is the repetitive forced stealth segments where you are forced to sneak up on demonic spirits before a simple quick time event is entered in place of combat. I felt even after the first of these that it was an unnecessary mechanic designed as a buffer between me and the enjoyable parts of the game. I would commonly find myself sweeping an area of these "enemies" before returning to start the section proper. Thankfully, they don't take too long and aren't difficult, but this just emphasises how needless they are.\n\nI would definitely recommend this as a sale pickup if you are even remotely curious.","May 14, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are just amazing, and thanks to the Unreal engine, the game runs smooth as butther with everything maxed out.\n\nV-sync limits the game to 30FPS, but you can switch that off and just enable V-sync in your GPU options (Catalyst Control or Nvidia center) which gives you all the smooth awesomeness of 60FPS.\n\nThe story of this game is brilliant, and the spooky atmosphere just adds to the overall setting of the game. The way you interact with your surrounding and figure out the clues is great, but I was hoping getting stuff wrong would give you a penalty of some kind... Then again, it is an adventure game and most of them are very linear.\n\nThere is no combat apart from banishing demons witch can be really difficult at some parts but nothing an average gamer can't figure out.\n\nI was afraid that the ending will be a dissapointment compared to the massive build up of the story (and the bodies murdered) but the game really delivered.

I guess because of the different path options of another certain "poltergeist simulator" if you like i.e. Beyond Two Souls it is often a shame when I play games like this now and there aren't multiple endings (even Silent Hill 2 had different endings on replays), but I guess we are a little spoilt, and this isn't trying to be a David Chase or a Deus Ex game.\n\nThe idea itself was so novel and appealing I knew I had to grab this eventually, it reminded me of the basic premise of the old PS2 game Shadow of Memories in which you travel back in time to solve your own murder. In this moody, supernatural almost LA Noire style of setting I knew I couldn't resist. It wasn't until I played it I realised it's all set in Salem, so given that the backstory and local folklore have a large presence in this game, this was one hell of a bonus for me given my interest in the witch hunts and magic.\n\nThe music and atmosphere didn't disappoint. The backstory and tragic history is incorporated into it very well, and the way in which this game combined supernatural elements with crime scene investigation was really inventive and original.  As said, there are things you can miss as well, but this is mostly side missions. I guess few games if any have really matched LA Noire in this department.\n\nThe graphics look great, can't fault the voice acting either. In terms of the horror elements, as a puzzle game it's challenging enough, but seeing the same ghouls everywhere gets very repetitive very quickly, and it just becomes a chore of running, hiding and timing. It's different enough but just has no variety, still I can see how hard it is to do something really novel and inventive with the ghost-themed survival horror format. Especially if you are a ghost yourself.\n\nOverall great game worth getting, worth experiencing and worth playing again, just don't be too disappointed by the length and lack of variety in gameplay....Salem does allow for some exploration, though.","June 7, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere and graphics are great.  You explore Salem and 'ghost Salem' as a ghost and as a detective, solving your case and many side cases along the way.  Ghost Salem physically exists for ghosts, as a barrier which prevents you from accessing areas of Salem too easily and as a mode of access to collectables in areas you wouldn't have access to in normal Salem e.g. ghost stairs.\nThere is a lot to engage with: collectables (too many, in my opinion), stories to unlock, ghosts hanging around (they say the best things in the graveyard).  It does get repetative and there isn't a challange.  The game is easy to beat but there's still a small amount of action such as dealing with demons.  I find the game satisfactory for entertaining, easy gameplay but I wouldn't pay $30 for it.  Maybe if it was more challanging, everything down to the puzzles are simple.","February 28, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/recommended/233290/","yourtipoftheday","MadeUnderground","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/","127 products in account","To be honest, I feel that this game got a lot more flack than was deserved. Is it perfect? No, but I think the criticisms were a bit extreme. Mind you, most of the criticisms I read were during the time that it was initially released and some of it had to do with bugs.\nI'm guessing that by the time I bought the game (4 months after release) all those bugs were fixed because I didn't really have any of the issues that they were talking about. There were times, however, I noticed that the narration would cut out. This happened in maybe 3-5 different cutscenes were there was just no sound at all - the only way I knew what was supposed to have been said during the scene was because I always have subtitles on.\n\nI think what hurt the game more than anything else was the story. It was okay, but I feel that it could have been better - more developed maybe. Also I feel like the characters were poorly written.\nI say this because I felt no emotion towards any of them whatsover. The wife was annoying, and there were too many random collectibles of her memories with him - I'm guessing like finding pages of her diary or something scattered around. I felt myself annoyed with all of these and couldn't care less about her or their relationship.\n\nThe friendship or, partnership I guess, between Ronan and Joy felt really shallow. Since Joy is the character Ronan interacts with the most throughout the game, I was hoping for more development in their friendship.  Also the way Joy treated Ronan after he saves her from The Bell Killer is ridiculous. I'm not expecting her to want to help him right away but it was a bit much imho\n\nI couldn't even find myself caring about Ronan himself. None of the characters in the game were developed enough for me to root for them or care about them in anyway.\n\nAlso I felt it was strange that all the events in the entire game takes place in one night. Why on earth was that one couple getting married in the middle of the night / wee hours of the morning?\n\nThe demons in the game were laughable. It felt like it was just thrown in at the last minute to give the game some kind of combat in it. They should have either given the combat more diversity or taken the demons out completely, in my opinion. I didn't play the game with combat in mind so I wouldn't have cared if there was no combat in this game. There are perfectly good Adventure Mystery games with absolutely no combat in it (the majority of Sherlock Holmes titles for example).\n\nWith all that negative out of the way now for the positives: I appreciate the game trying to do something different. I'm a big fan of Adventure Mystery type games and one that approaches it from the perspective of a ghost is innovative and interesting. I enjoyed walking through walls and possessing adorable felines, as well as the people around town.\nIt would have been great if they expanded a bit more on this - more animals to possess, control over individuals in town like how Abigail was able to control humans to do her killings  , as well as being able to poltergeist more items.\n\nTo sum up my review, I would recommend people to give the game a go. It's enjoyable and fun and I definitely don't think it deserved 59 on metacritic. I would rate it more of a 6/10. It's worth a play through to get to play and experience something different. The mystery is also relatively engaging.\nI just wouldn't get this game at full price - wait for a sale. I was able to scoop it up during one for 4.99.","June 25, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The features they implemented in it (like going through stuff, blocking off places thus hiding object from you, etc.) are good.\nHowever the controls are a little bit wonky. Sometimes you need to perfectly aim your sight to get what you want. One of the main features of the game is introduced late and not used as often as they could have.\nThe story is is entertaining, but not the best. Eventually everything's coming together and there's a big surprise at the end. However if the bad guy had more role throughout the game, it could had a better score.\nI really can't tell anything on the graphics, my computer can't handle it on full details.

It was definitely an interesting title combining LA Noire's use of interacting with objects and no hand holding while you piece the scene together and choose the correct action from a list that is revealed once you reveal parts of what happened. However I would have liked to see more of a choice in how you progress making some choices lead you down the wrong path and some that if you dig deep enough into the scene it could progress you closer to the killer. To a trained eye a lot of the story becomes easy to pick up but still has some twists like any good murder mystery would.

I guess because of the different path options of another certain "poltergeist simulator" if you like i.e. Beyond Two Souls it is often a shame when I play games like this now and there aren't multiple endings (even Silent Hill 2 had different endings on replays), but I guess we are a little spoilt, and this isn't trying to be a David Chase or a Deus Ex game.\n\nThe idea itself was so novel and appealing I knew I had to grab this eventually, it reminded me of the basic premise of the old PS2 game Shadow of Memories in which you travel back in time to solve your own murder. In this moody, supernatural almost LA Noire style of setting I knew I couldn't resist. It wasn't until I played it I realised it's all set in Salem, so given that the backstory and local folklore have a large presence in this game, this was one hell of a bonus for me given my interest in the witch hunts and magic.\n\nThe music and atmosphere didn't disappoint. The backstory and tragic history is incorporated into it very well, and the way in which this game combined supernatural elements with crime scene investigation was really inventive and original.  As said, there are things you can miss as well, but this is mostly side missions. I guess few games if any have really matched LA Noire in this department.\n\nThe graphics look great, can't fault the voice acting either. In terms of the horror elements, as a puzzle game it's challenging enough, but seeing the same ghouls everywhere gets very repetitive very quickly, and it just becomes a chore of running, hiding and timing. It's different enough but just has no variety, still I can see how hard it is to do something really novel and inventive with the ghost-themed survival horror format. Especially if you are a ghost yourself.\n\nOverall great game worth getting, worth experiencing and worth playing again, just don't be too disappointed by the length and lack of variety in gameplay....Salem does allow for some exploration, though.","June 7, 2015","true","15.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere and graphics are great.  You explore Salem and 'ghost Salem' as a ghost and as a detective, solving your case and many side cases along the way.  Ghost Salem physically exists for ghosts, as a barrier which prevents you from accessing areas of Salem too easily and as a mode of access to collectables in areas you wouldn't have access to in normal Salem e.g. ghost stairs.\nThere is a lot to engage with: collectables (too many, in my opinion), stories to unlock, ghosts hanging around (they say the best things in the graveyard).  It does get repetative and there isn't a challange.  The game is easy to beat but there's still a small amount of action such as dealing with demons.  I find the game satisfactory for entertaining, easy gameplay but I wouldn't pay $30 for it.

I enjoyed the game with it's very unique style, and the story full of twists and turns, so I do recommend it, but there are a few issues that prevent this from being as good as it could have been.\n\nSome of the puzzles require you to choose "most relevant" clues, so you might pick 3 from 10, but it often feels like guesswork. Not guesswork into your character or the story, but guesswork into the developers minds. This can lead to frustration, but doesn't prevent progress.\n\nIf you miss a clue earlier in the game, even though you can return to that location, the clue isn't always there. A lot of people get stuck on the 15/16 issue with Apartment 4A, for example, and that was the one clue preventing me from a perfect score.\n\nThe final area does give you a warning message, but once you enter it, you cannot return to a previous save to hunt down any remaining clues. As soon as you enter the area, you are either choosing to give up on side quests, or planning to replay the entire game again.\n\nThose issues aside, it's a great experience and worth playing if you can pick it up on sale.","January 2","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Would not buy it for full price though.  The only thing that sucks about the game are the demon encounters, they just feel out of place and unnecessary.  The game has a good enough story and investigation/exploration sections that it doesn't need the demon sections at all.  It's a real shame because the idea had potential too.  I was hoping for something in the vein of demons being disguised as regular ghosts trying to trick you into making bad decisions via dialogue options to steal your soul but instead they're patrolling enemies that you have to avoid and stealth kill.  The most annoying thing is when they detect you for no reason whatsoever or when you are in exactly the correct position to execute them and get no prompt to do so.  These sections are a pretty small portion of the game though and there's only a handful of them.  Anyone whose played any stealth oriented games will have no problems with them outside of the issues mentioned above.\n\nOverall, it was a great story with a couple twists on the end that I just didn't see coming.  The game is worth a playthrough if you're looking for something different that's story driven and not action packed.  Voice acting was great too, Ronan and Joy are both likable characters with tons of personality.  Will probably play this again at some point to get all the collectables and do the side missions that I missed.","January 2","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, it is a pretty decent unfinished business ghost story. It comes equipped with the ex-con cop, lovable scamp sidekick, some plot twists, and posessing cats and people to get to locations your short-range ghost teleport can't reach. The setting was interesting to me, and there were some small jokes in a few levels such as ghost hunters in the cemetary, and a ghost right in front of the camera smiling and waving - that nobody can see.\n\nThe levels are fairly well designed, although some clues require more accuracy in placement with how close to other clues they are. The demons were interesting at first but quickly became just an annoyance once you near the end of the game. Most areas are once and done, although you do revisit one of the opening areas as part of the plot and can return to areas up until the finale.\n\nThis is mostly an adventure game - the only notable action sequences are exorcising demons, a single section where you have to deal with a ghost train ( which was pretty neat ), and the finale, and even then they are more or less quick time events. The rest of the game is spent navigating the hub\n\nYou are unable to change the controls if you use the mouse and keyboard. The game itself doesn't have too many poor performance spots aside from some area transitions and, at least in my case, antialiasing smoke/fog during the opening sequence.\n\nThe collectables were mostly pointless - the story parts, such as the water tank, rifles, saws, gas tanks, etc. were brief ghost stories - generic, but not poorly written.\n\nOverall, I feel the main issue is how short the game is - the entire plot encompasses a single night and will only really take three or four hours at most, and feels like a large chunk of that time was exorcising demons and getting to the next area. If you remove the travel time and scavenger hunt, it was rather short and would probably fit inside two hours.","December 31, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A grim detective story with such a vivid characters, voice acting and visual style. This is a great game, which contsits a half of exploration and a half of interactive movie. Exploration, even if limited, is done in really interesting plain - you're a ghost, and thus you can walk through walls, collect and read ghostly notes and hints, learn about places and their stories. You will investigate some simple problems by collecting evidence, looking and listening. The 'movie' part is done nice. The plot is pretty interesting, although so simple. Sometimes I was wondering, when my character will figure out the killer. I mean, I partly looked through it before the game called the killer. However even by figuring out what was happening I've never seen who exactly was the one to blame. And there was yet another unexpected twist. So even if plot is slightly predictable, It's written dam-good. Definitely a movie I liked to play.\nI loved cats in this game. Just like cats should be in games. Fast, black, agile, a little glitchy. What I didn't like about them was how people react them. Like zero F-s were given that night.\nI loved that monitor reference in police station. You'll know when you see it. Square Enix, oh you.\nNow to the downsides:\n1. This is a game best played with a gamepad. I mean it. It wasn't made to be on PC, it was made to be cross-platform. So even if it supports keyboard+mouse, use a controller, if you have one.\n2. There is no free roam after you've reached the last checkpoint. The main menu will offer you to continue, but this is merely a last checkpoint, no way to collect something you've left for later.\n3. Not sure about the reason, but sometimes I've experienced minor graphic glitches while ui showed/hided collected piece of evidence. Might be just my laptop.\n4. Repetative faces of pedestrians. There's something like two or three models for each gender. Nuff said.\n5. Really strange placement of hiding spots. Some places have plenty of them, but never needed. The others feature but a few spots, but you will need more if you need them. And some are too far to jump between them.\n6. Font. Handwriting fonts in games never work as easy-to-read fonts. And this game has tons of handwritten text. Although I managed to read without problems, some might have them.\n\nBut in the end, I really enjoyed this game. It's certainly a great experience.","December 31, 2015","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The voice acting is good, the characters are overall quite believeable, and you get quite invested in the game's narrative.\n\nOn the negative side, the game gives you a huge sandbox to play in with a bunch of new toys, but what few activities you are able to complete within this open world are fairly lacklustre and are basic extensions of the same game mechanics you use during the main story. It would have been a lot more engaging if you were free to roam within this world, and had interesting things to do in it.\n\nOverall, recommended for its mechanics, artstyle and interesting story.

Not really exceptional in any way, but the story and mechanics are interesting. You play a detective who becomes a ghost and thus can walk through walls and do other ghostly stuff while investigating a series of murders. While item collection is heavily featured, it doesn't seem simply shoehorned in to increase the game's length. Each item you collect contributes in some way to the story background/context.

It uses some new gameplay mechanics I had never seen in any other game, yet they are not always available, and you can only use most of them when the game requires you to use them. I'd say that its greatest thing is its plot. Although it is somewhat predictable, the story will probably surprise you at some point or another with something you were not expecting. I think the characters were well-defined (specially as you find out more about them in the many collectable items the game has) and some things will only make sense at the very end of the game, keeping you intrigued until then.\n\nI really liked all the new abilities you get as a ghost, but I wish some of them (as possessing people) would be more useful outside of any actual mission.  I was more interested in the plot and exploring the world as a ghost than anything else, so it was a bit annoying whenever they made me fight those flying demons, as it eventually gets a bit... repetitive. But oh well, there aren't so many after all and the game is more oriented towards exploration than "fighting". The side stories are also interesting and it isn't too hard to unlock them. I didn't like that there were no consequences whenever you guess something wrong, or if you make a mistake when solving a mystery or investigating something. If that happens, you can just try again until you get it right, which makes the detective work kind of pointless sometimes.\n\nThere's no doubt that the best thing about Murdered: Soul Suspect is its plot, so if you like ghost stories, or ghost movies/TV shows (I'm looking at you, Ghost Whisperer!) you're probably going to enjoy this game. It may not be perfect, but it definitely does its job. I only encountered one bug (couldn't exit the menu) at the beginning, but restarting the game fixed it and it never happened again in 10 hours of gameplay. I'd also like to congratulate the Spanish dubbers and localization team for the great job they've done adapting the game. Oh, and one last thing!

Actually, it could have been one of those interactive movies if not these two things.\n\nFirst of all, it's completely linear. The main story and a few side quests. The only variable is whether you find all the collectibles (they are all related to the lore) or not. More likely, not - looking for every collectible is just too boring and doesn't provide much new information.\n\nSecondly, for some reason the creators tried to add more depth to gameplay and introduced demons that you need to hide from or kill stealthily. And it just doesn't work. Too easy for any Thief (Splinter Cell, Hitman, etc) player and too boring on top of that. Thankfully, those moments with demons are really short and sometimes you can simply run through them and then hide.\n\nDespide the flaws, I still recommend playing it.

I enjoyed the story, and the level of player engagement seemed spot-on for this quick, story-driven game.\n\nOn the other hand; I did encounter some repetitiveness in the dialog after a bit. The puzzle solving felt a little forced, and didn't have alternative scenarios if you chased down the wrong lead.\n\nGameplay: I usually don't like the over-the-shoulder gameplay style. I found it gave me some issue when trying to interact with some objects, but it wasn't too obtrusive.\n\nCombat: The enemies were laughable, all you had to do was sneak up behind them and perform an action - a random button/mouseclick which is a direct port over to the button/paddle on the console. I found these enemies to be more of an obsticle than an actual challenge. But I belive this is intended, as to keep the game story focused and not combat driven. I actually salute the developers for remaining story focused and not bogging down the player with ubsurd mechanics or prolonged battles... or health bars for that matter (You're already dead! No health for you!)\n\nCollectables & Achievements: Many players have complained that they were unable to go back and complete the collectable achievements, as this has a very linear progression in the story.

Don't get fooled by swapped mouse icons and other oddities in the GUI screens, also try to ignore the weird flickering and pixelation in the main menu.\n\nThe main part of the game had no glitches, and only one bug I noticed: the entering cut-scene playing again after leaving the cemetery.

The voice acting is good, the characters are overall quite believeable, and you get quite invested in the game's narrative.\n\nOn the negative side, the game gives you a huge sandbox to play in with a bunch of new toys, but what few activities you are able to complete within this open world are fairly lacklustre and are basic extensions of the same game mechanics you use during the main story. It would have been a lot more engaging if you were free to roam within this world, and had interesting things to do in it.\n\nOverall, recommended for its mechanics, artstyle and interesting story.

The two main characters are good written and works well together. It's a nice spooky feeling throughout the game even tho it's not a horror game.\n\nIn addition to the main story you can solve a handful of side cases for lost spirits around the world to give them peace and in addition to that there is a lot of collectables scattered around.\nThe collectables tells you about the town, the murderer, your character and ghost stories. The ghost stories is a really nice addition, I appreciated them a lot.\n\nIt took me around eleven hours to finish and I did most of the side stuff, I missed some collectables.\n\nIf you see this game on a sale I would recommand you to pick it up but not for the current pricetag (29,99€).","January 16","true","11.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Putting routes on stories and additional mini quest is fine\n- Demons  Stealth in a detective mystery game sounds good but really, screeching demons who chase you but they leave you once you move in a specific spot. Also, sometimes annoying...\n- Save slots would be fine. You have to replay the game once you finish/restart to the last checkpoint (A bit of a hassle when it comes to achievement farming)\n- Point and click. Investigations are kind of easy since they already tell you where the clues are. You can just spam E in the map and you'll probably find the clue\n- NPCs - just remove some of the  mind reading  or just  keep them silent .

I enjoyed the story, and the level of player engagement seemed spot-on for this quick, story-driven game.\n\nOn the other hand; I did encounter some repetitiveness in the dialog after a bit. The puzzle solving felt a little forced, and didn't have alternative scenarios if you chased down the wrong lead.\n\nGameplay: I usually don't like the over-the-shoulder gameplay style. I found it gave me some issue when trying to interact with some objects, but it wasn't too obtrusive.\n\nCombat: The enemies were laughable, all you had to do was sneak up behind them and perform an action - a random button/mouseclick which is a direct port over to the button/paddle on the console. I found these enemies to be more of an obsticle than an actual challenge. But I belive this is intended, as to keep the game story focused and not combat driven. I actually salute the developers for remaining story focused and not bogging down the player with ubsurd mechanics or prolonged battles... or health bars for that matter (You're already dead! No health for you!)\n\nCollectables & Achievements: Many players have complained that they were unable to go back and complete the collectable achievements, as this has a very linear progression in the story. This will often require a second playthrough, stopping at each location, and clearing the zone to ensure you have collected everything. I kept catching myself thinking in normal gameplay rules, where I would walk around walls and objects. Just remember, you can walk through that.

He awakens to find himself temporarily disembodied but that state soon becomes permanent upon the arrival of the Bell Witch Killer.  Shot 7 times with his own gun, Ronan must now solve the mystery of his own murder and in the process uncover dark secrets that have haunted Salem for centuries.\n\nQuite a build up eh?\n\nIt is and it's worthy of it.  The story is intriguing with twists, turns and dead ends to thrill any devotee of the mystery genre.  Add in a tastefully done horror component supported by an eerie backdrop of a dark and gloomy Salem complete with lost souls, haunted houses, and frightful demons.\n\nThe game is gorgeous even on my creaky old gaming laptop ( circa 2008 ) and the controls simple.  You're led on a path similar to the Call of Duty campaign modes on the hunt for clues to your own murder.  On the way you'll find ample opportunity to complete side quests but be warned if like me you seek to earn all of the Steam achievements you must be methodical in your approach.  For me it took 2 playthroughs as there is no quicksave nor any way to go back once you've completed the final chapter of the game.\n\nIt's a casual game but it can be maddening at times.  For one, you have no onscreen map nor any way to mark your progress toward achievements.  Meaning you'll spend a lot of time running in circles to find the way forward and backtracking for that one elusive clue.\n\nThen there's the demons.  I understand that a game in the horror genre has to have some kind of threat but they're all over the place.  It breaks the flow of the narrative and it's jarring to go from a casual detective story to a flurry of button mashing every 10 minutes.\n\nStill, even with the more "gamey" aspects, it's still more ghost story than game which explains some of its mechanical shortcomings.  My first playthrough was simply for the sake of taking it all in.  The second was purely for my own desire to see everything and in the process earn every Steam achievement.\n\nAll tolled I've spent a bit over 30 hours and enjoyed every minute of it.","January 28","true","33.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The features they implemented in it (like going through stuff, blocking off places thus hiding object from you, etc.) are good.\nHowever the controls are a little bit wonky.

One of the main features of the game is introduced late and not used as often as they could have.\nThe story is is entertaining, but not the best. Eventually everything's coming together and there's a big surprise at the end. However if the bad guy had more role throughout the game, it could had a better score.\nI really can't tell anything on the graphics, my computer can't handle it on full details.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/recommended/233290/","yourtipoftheday","MadeUnderground","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yourtipoftheday/","127 products in account","To be honest, I feel that this game got a lot more flack than was deserved. Is it perfect? No, but I think the criticisms were a bit extreme. Mind you, most of the criticisms I read were during the time that it was initially released and some of it had to do with bugs.\nI'm guessing that by the time I bought the game (4 months after release) all those bugs were fixed because I didn't really have any of the issues that they were talking about. There were times, however, I noticed that the narration would cut out. This happened in maybe 3-5 different cutscenes were there was just no sound at all - the only way I knew what was supposed to have been said during the scene was because I always have subtitles on.\n\nI think what hurt the game more than anything else was the story. It was okay, but I feel that it could have been better - more developed maybe. Also I feel like the characters were poorly written.\nI say this because I felt no emotion towards any of them whatsover. The wife was annoying, and there were too many random collectibles of her memories with him - I'm guessing like finding pages of her diary or something scattered around. I felt myself annoyed with all of these and couldn't care less about her or their relationship.\n\nThe friendship or, partnership I guess, between Ronan and Joy felt really shallow. Since Joy is the character Ronan interacts with the most throughout the game, I was hoping for more development in their friendship.  Also the way Joy treated Ronan after he saves her from The Bell Killer is ridiculous. I'm not expecting her to want to help him right away but it was a bit much imho\n\nI couldn't even find myself caring about Ronan himself. None of the characters in the game were developed enough for me to root for them or care about them in anyway.\n\nAlso I felt it was strange that all the events in the entire game takes place in one night. Why on earth was that one couple getting married in the middle of the night / wee hours of the morning?\n\nThe demons in the game were laughable. It felt like it was just thrown in at the last minute to give the game some kind of combat in it. They should have either given the combat more diversity or taken the demons out completely, in my opinion. I didn't play the game with combat in mind so I wouldn't have cared if there was no combat in this game. There are perfectly good Adventure Mystery games with absolutely no combat in it (the majority of Sherlock Holmes titles for example).\n\nWith all that negative out of the way now for the positives: I appreciate the game trying to do something different. I'm a big fan of Adventure Mystery type games and one that approaches it from the perspective of a ghost is innovative and interesting. I enjoyed walking through walls and possessing adorable felines, as well as the people around town.\nIt would have been great if they expanded a bit more on this - more animals to possess, control over individuals in town like how Abigail was able to control humans to do her killings  , as well as being able to poltergeist more items.\n\nTo sum up my review, I would recommend people to give the game a go. It's enjoyable and fun and I definitely don't think it deserved 59 on metacritic. I would rate it more of a 6/10. It's worth a play through to get to play and experience something different. The mystery is also relatively engaging.\nI just wouldn't get this game at full price - wait for a sale. I was able to scoop it up during one for 4.99.","June 25, 2015","true","9.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'd think being dead would put something of a cramp on your investigative abilities, but no, it seems all the best cops are the dead ones. Maybe it's because it's late at night, but everybody except you seems to be doing about as much police activity as can be accomplished by standing around rubbing their noses.\n\nYou run into a teenage medium called Joy who's looking for her missing mom, and she comes in really handy for opening drawers, crossing glowing holes into hell that try and suck Ronan down, and so that Ronan's musing is cut by about 20%. The rest of the time she's a regular whiny teenager you have to play daddy wolf to and pretend you give a pooper about her mom.\n\nThe game revolves around investigating crime scenes - yours and other people's - talking to the many ghosts in Salem, uncovering lost memories, being the cause of poltergeist activity and posessing people to read their minds.\n\nOccasionally to try and make you feel like there's more to the game than prodding at a crime-scene and musing over a cigarette, Demons spawn. Since they just float around on a set path looking for something to kill, and you creep up from behind to kill them, it feels very tacked on and a really crappy attempt at adding any challenge to the game.\n\nAll in all, the game feels a lot like an interactive horror movie, but it's a GOOD movie, and it feels like worthwhile interaction. Voice acting and character animation of faces is great. Is it worth full-price? That's a personal thing, seeing as it's quite a short game. But if you can get it at a discount, it's definitely a worthwhile way to spend some game-time.\n\nGet it if you like: Detective games, Violent murder, Interaction, Creepiness, A good movie, Collecting stuff.\n\nDon't get it if you like: Action, Challenge, Long games.\n\n7/10","December 31, 2015","true","23.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Couldn't think of anything but wonder what the next clues will add to the story. To sum it up:\nStory: 9/10\nAlthough it's a typical murder investigation, playing as a ghost trying to uncover clues makes the mystery more interesting. The side stories obtained by finding all the hidden objects on each map are very spooky and a good bed time story to wet the bed.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nAlthough it's nice to find clues and unfold the mystery, it's veeery repetitive and lacks diversity. Not much you can do but run through walls, teleport short distances and kill a few demons. other than that, you get bored fast from gameplay and you just want to finish the story faster.\n\nGraphics: 8/10\nI can't say it's bad, i can't say it's good. For a 2014 game, objects are edgy, characters lack emotions, but still, it looks ok. It's the bad textures from clues that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nOverall, i enjoyed the game very much, considering i got it on sale. I recommend it just to unwind from stressful multiplayer games and submerge in a story filled with mysteries.\n\nPS: could play a cat.","April 9","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/recommended/233290/","uncageable","Gwidhw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/uncageable/","679 products in account","When I first heard the announcement of Murdered: Soul Suspect, I thought this looked like an amazing idea for a video game. Then, I when it was released and officially reviewed by personalities on the internet, it was met with mixed opinion, the lesser of which delayed me from giving it a chance. During the Steam sale, I picked it up for a considerable discount, and decided for the price I paid that it would be worth it. I am happy to say, that, it's good enough to play through. Though, I doubt the replay value is remotely existant, for a couple of reasons:\n\nCONS:\n\n1) Awkward voice acting: At times when the character is supposed to have a cigarette in his mouth, the animation doesn't, so he ends up sounding like he's chewing on his tongue. This is awkward. But somewhat hilarious.\n\n2) Awkward animation: For the same reason as #1, as well as as that when dialogue is being conveyed through other characters (e.g.: other souls), they flail their arms in a strange manner as they talk, obviously on a loop of animation that doesn't always fit with the dialogue. As for Ronan, he himself likes to move way too much in conversation. He moves his hips, he shuffles his feet, and he keeps shaking his head. He's either disappointed and frustrated with everybody, or he just can't get past the fact that he has no perception of touch when being dead.\n\n3) Cliche: Personally, I've seen the "gruff guy working together with spunky young girl" scenario too many times. It works for the characters, I suppose, but, Joy, the girl, mostly just comes across as very unreasonable. As for Ronan, in this "partnership", for a guy that used to be into some pretty dangerous ♥♥♥♥, he comes across as a bit of a pushover. He helps her out and she up and leaves. She makes an ungrateful remark, and he smirks, shakes his head, and shuffles his feet. Yep. Then he goes after her, and they end up working together again. Repeat (it seems thus far, but I haven't completed the game yet, so who knows? There could be a curve ball in there somewhere, like... *gasp!* She comes to actually like him?! :O )\n\n4) Confusing: When I say confusing, I mean only one thing; seeing buildings, and watching live people walk through them, but you can't. Why can't you? Because you're a ghost, and this is a "ghost building" that you can't pass through. What?\n\n5) Easiness: Whenever you go to assist another spirit in their issues, sometimes, the clues are literally right in front of them. If the other spirit just took two steps to the left, they would find out what they needed to know. "I wonder where my body is? I lived with the old couple and now I'm dead and don't remember what happened, how I died, or anything except that they had something to do with it... Hmm... Ah well. The trail has gone cold."\n\n6) Clues:  Finding all the clues for the main case can be a bit tedious, especially when you just want to go through the window after the girl and follow the trail! I know where she went, I want to go after her, dammit! xD As well, you're roped into a small confined space to find the clues within, and many things jump out, while others are more intangible. It's not very interesting, most of the time, and makes me just want to move on, a la "go through the window after the girl".\n\n\nPROS:\n\n1) Good animation: Very fluid, and I haven't hit any strange framerate issues or animation glitches... yet.\n\n2) Game Mechanics: The overall controls and movement is great, as well as the interaction and detective work that you have to utilise to advance the story. It's solid. Though detective work becomes a bit tedious.\n\n3) Character design: It's very interesting. Ronan is probably the best looking dead guy I've seen lately.\n\n4) Ronan reminds me of John Marston from Red Dead Redemption. Yeah.\n\n5) You get to possess and play as a CAT. Meow.\n\n\nI'd say, if you're in the mood to play a very simple, interesting detective game, with little replay value (IMO), and see it on sale, go for it.\n\nIf you're expecting something like LA Noire, and really enjoyed that game, you might not enjoy this as much.\n\nIf you're just curious and want to try it out, chances are you'll end up shelfing it.\n\nNow, let's see how the ending plays out....\n\nAFTER-END EDITS:\n\nAlright, so I just finished playing the game. I got a good majority of the achievements, and can honestly say that I have no intentions of going back to gather the remaining ones I missed. But for a good reason!\n\nRepetition.\n\nHonestly, this game wasn't half bad, and after getting through from beginning to end, I'd say it's something I actually quite enjoyed. That said, however, I will be uninstalling it now. Why? Allow me to repeat myself:\n\nRepetition.\n\nIt's an interesting game with detailed locations, great source material, and a somewhat intriguing story. But, I just can't get past the fact that there is so much, well... repetition. Let me break it down:\n\n1) Go to a location\n2) Start investigation (of said area) and look for clues (some obvious, some not so obvious)\n3) Come to a conclusion\n3a) Help another spirit in the area come to terms with something more or less obvious\n4) Avoid demons.\n5) Move on.\n\nIt got to the point where i felt like I just wanted to ignore finding all of the details, hidden items, and extra historical case file "things" laying around, because I did it so many times, I felt like I was playing a scavenger hunt game, rather than a detective-style game. Which is more or less what this is: a scavenger hunt, with a pretty package, and some interesting mechanics thrown in, based on the Salem Witch Trials, which, on a normal day, I find fascinating.\n\nAnd the demons... oh, the demons... Don't expect action, here. And the "crows" that are around that you can stir up to attract the demons so as to take them out? Well, I never used them. You just have to wait for the demon to turn around, run up behind, and take them out (which is 1 of 2 things he figured out on his own out of thin air, just like "teleporting"), or just run past them. It's that simple.\n\nHaving played games like "Still Life" and "Still Life 2", I'd say, if you're looking for a great mystery game, go play those! Those are gritty, dark, interesting, and genuinely investable for your emotions, at times. Murdered: Soul Suspect? Well, it's good. But I certainly won't be playing it again. Not to say it's not worth playing through at least once, because, honestly, if it's within your price range, or on sale, go ahead and pick it up. It'll keep you busy for a while and give you something to look back on and go "Huh. That was definitely something else". And then move on from.\n\nUninstalled.","December 27, 2014","true","5.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved the game don't get me wrong...was a great game...just not worth the full price. Its a game you will want to pick up on sale. If you love collecting everything, there is plenty of that in here. Many small items to be found all over the city, and in each of the main spots you have to travel too to progress the game itself. The story is great, even though you may see most of it coming a mile away.  My one downfall I felt on it was the demons. They weren't used often enough, with that being said it made it feel they were more to just in your way, as well were the only enemy you had in the game. When trying to kill them it puts up different button presses, so be quick, or you will need to start running then play a game of musical chairs hiding till they go away. I do wish as well that your ghostly powers were more so needed to be used, but it was a bit of a let down as well.  Other then that I do hope that there will be another game, just hopfully they will add more too it. It was a great concept, but more could have been done. Once again its one I would say buy, just wait till its on sale.","June 4","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zelrokyz/recommended/233290/","zelrokyz","Zelrokyz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zelrokyz/","430 products in account","MURDED: SOUL SUSPECT (apparently the CAPSLOCK key of the developers is broken!) is a really good game. Really good. Repeating for emphasis!\n\nOf course, I'm going to complain about something, so lets get the irrelavent bit out the way first.\n\nI'm playing this on a PC. So tell me Airtight, where is the Start button? I really hate the consolification of PC games. I don't need a silly screen where I have to "Press Start" to continue. When I want to quit the game, I don't want to be returned to "Press Start" so I can then choose "Exit Game" from the menu. I thought I made my intensions clear when I initially said "Exit Game" from the in-game menu. Meh, who am I kidding. Might as well wish that developers didn't include stupid not skippable logo's and videos each time the game starts.\n\nAnd... CHECKPOINTS? This was almost a deal breaker. MSS is an adventure game. Since when did adventure games need checkpoints? This leads to my major crisitism of the game, but as I'll defer that until the end where it belongs.\n\nSo, what's good about the game? Well, pretty much everything. Atmosphere is brilliant, I really enjoyed the juxtaposition of the ghost world ontop of the real world, past mixed with the present. It worked amazingly well. Graphics and environment design top notch.\n\nAudio is generally good, but there's a few places where you had "what is making this sound" puzzles and two of these the proported sounds didn't really match the clues, but no biggy. I also confess to jumping out of my skin on more than one occasion when the demons annouced their arrival.\n\nThe investigations were nicely done and nothing too complex (which is both a plus a minus, sometimes it felt a little easy, at other times I was greatful I wasn't trying to work out some insane and illogical inventory puzzle), and the story was engrossing. Each major area in the game also has a themed set of collectibles, which once all obtained give a nice little backstory to the area.\n\nThe checkpoint system generally works, but take heed - when you get to the final act, the game mentions if you continue you can't go back. By this point I was treating MSS as a open world type game, running around picking up things I'd missed and so on. I assumed, like all open world games, that once I'd finished the main mission, I'd be free to find the last missing side quest in the town center. Nope, I was wrong. When it said you can't go back, you really can't. And there's only a single damn save for the entirely playthrough.\n\nFortunately I have a backup from a couple of days ago so I can at least replay the latter half of the game to find my missing items rather than the whole game, but I did think this a pretty dumb design decision.\n\nOne other astoundingly bad design decision is the very final act of the game. Remember that MSS is an adventure game - you play it at your own pace, looking around for clues, collectibles, backstory etc. There's a few semi-quick time events involving demons that spawn. These aren't too bad, just annoying as each event uses a randomized key combination. There are similar QTE for demons that come through the floor but for most of the game you'll avoid these.\n\nThe final scene however involves two very brief timed events where you have something like 20s to do one thing then 10s to do another. This made me pretty angry actually, I've spent hours playing this lovely creation, then you force the last 30 seconds with no time to do anything but try and do the right actions.\n\nCombine that with the fact that I couldn't return to the open world, meant my last memories of the game are negative, which is a shame because the climax of the story was excellant, and the little twists amazing. This is a game with an excellant story! What a shame a couple of silly design decisions have offset that.\n\nI've just read on a wiki that Airtight closed a month after releasing MSS, which seems a travesty along the lines of TTLG closing after Thief 2. Disappointing news, as I was greatly looking forward to the possibility of further games in the series.\n\nIn short, excellant game, buy it, play it, enjoy it! And commiserate over the fact that they might not be any follow ups. (And probably spare a curse for the publishers that probably cause the shuttering)","March 17, 2015","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This will prevent left-handed people from playing and makes the only difficult spot more difficult by choosing ridiculous key controls\n- That said, the game is not difficult at all (it's almost an interactive movie), though in certain spots the difficulty spikes due to the controls\n- There's plenty of reading if you want to know the whole stories that make the side quests, but there's a bug in the game: if you want to read the stories of the items on the menu, press Enter, not the mouse\n- There's plenty of stuff to do and to collect in the city and you have almost complete freedom to move around.

The story hooked me in right from the start and never let go until the 'yell at your tv' ending. I find the gameplay mechanics refreshing and fun. You are a ghost so you can't directly interact with most things, but you can look and piece together clues leading you through the games story amazingly well. I don't think i ever got frustratingly stuck or bored of the gameplay. The story and gameplay flow together nicely. And the characters! I found them all to be believable, with no cliche cardboard cutouts among the main characters.\nThe collection of all the items in the game adds more reason to search through the levels and adds a nice layer onto the story with collectables about the main character, the enemy, and even the town itself. The world feels very historic. Some might argue that it is too linear, but I personally liked that places were blocked off or I would have spent hours rifling through large buildings, getting lost XD\nMaybe my only complaint about the game is that there is no map, and since you can go through walls, it can get disorienting. I get that a ghost cant really carry around a map haha, its just a little nitpick, overall I loved the game and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great story and a fun time :)","June 6, 2014","true","15.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

His wife dies and he becomes reckless, and winds up geting killed. Now hes a ghost, searching for his killer. Theres alot to do in this game, through fairly easy. you have your main story, about 7 additional ghost stories to uncover, history on salem, and many other artifacts, something like 200 Items to search for. As a ghost you get abilities as the game progresses. The game really does not punish for wrong choices except you lose your gold badge status if you mess up. Steam has achievements to earn. There are demons and demon traps so you need to be carefull where you step, or if your running from demons not to step into traps. You can kill demons by getting behind them. or you can try to avoid them. I perfer just to kill them and get them out of the way. The game is not set up so you fail, it relies on the story telling and requires you to scour areas with a fine tooth comb to unlock all the stuff thats needs to be found. Just running through the main story makes for a short game, But trying to collect everything makes a very long game. So the choice is yours. The graphics are very good, I have not found any glitches or bugs in my two play throughs, the controls are responsive. I'd recommend this game for anyone who just wants a casual interesting story to sit back and relax and play. With that in mind the critics scores on this game is unjust.

I've been playing it throughout the weekend and i've just finished it. I thought it was great. I found the story to be very interesting and everytime I was left with a cliffhanger I wanted to know what happened next. The fact you play as a ghost makes the game all the more interesting to play. You cannot pick up objects and normal people cannot see or hear you. It's a very interesting way to play a game but I really like it and I think it adds a hint of uniqueness to the game.  If you've ever played L.A noire you'll probably be fairly familiar with the concept of this game (finding clues and solving cases) but gameplay wise they are completely differnet, you cannot pick up and examine clues you find for example.\n\nDon't let the negative reviews for this game turn you off from buying it.

I found however a particular repeating element and pattern that struck me the wrong way in most of them. The major complaints often revolve around repetition and easy difficulty structure. The learning curve is rather flat while taking the time to solve mysteries and crimes is often called child's play at that. I hate to use this term but it just feels so rather Meta in the face of the pace the game seems to give off. Salem just looks so ghostly inviting and everywhere has the potential for you to take the time and admire the lives of the still living. At the same time it just doesn't feel like a burden to get to the next part of the story and become all the more curious of the world around you.\n\nEven the collectables have merit in the stories they tell. It just seems that a great number of people expected a rather explosive and mind bending experience. Murdered: Soul Suspect is like a brisk walk through the undead and spiritual park. It's a pleasant walk. It has a great way of not stifling the flow it has set up and the characters you come to find along the way give a curious nuance to the atmosphere. Would I say the game is flawless or addictive? No, I do not believe it is an extreme grabber that you can't let go of. It's more like that book you've been wanting to read for awhile and you just finally got down to reading it. Take your time, appreciate the attention to details, and you'll feel all the more rewarded for the investment. If you're more set on something more fast paced and hectic then perhaps another title may be up your alley.\n","June 4, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Is the game a detective game? Is it like L.A Noir? These two questions are the most common asked ones, and it's a little bit like L.A Noir, but that is only because you can take choices on what to ask other dead persons. Since you're gonna meet others like you, each one of them, have their own story. You can travel into living persons mind and read them, or you can "posses" them. Not making them do things for you, but you can make them think thoughts that you kinda implant in their head, You can't make them do things for you, as like you "posses" a police officer, and then control him, nope not gonna happend.\n\nThe game not only got the whole detective genre going on, but also a good old thriller.\n\nIf you like mystery, thriller, action, then this is game for you.

An honest to god adventure game, where you play the character to pass a few simple puzzles to unlock the next part of the story. And Murdered: Soul Suspect developed by Airtight Games scratches that itch. Albeit it does have its flaws.\n\nLets get the basics out of the way, you play a cop by the name of Ronan and in the first seconds of the game you get to see your character die. But unlike a lot of games this isn’t the end, because you become a ghost. Who in order to move on has to find out who murdered him. That’s the basic plot of the game, and the main story line. And so you will spend roughly 8-12 hours going through all of Salem’s locations hunting down the clues to discover your murder. Along the way you’ll befriend some people and learn some very unsettling secrets about the town.\n\nWhile the story isn’t the most complicated or even the best it still is written and presented well enough to be enjoyable. Along with the side quest and collectibles that fill in the background details about the town and the various characters it kept me enthralled for the nine hours that I played it, but then some peoples mileage may vary.\n\nThe one complaint I will have is that the developers didn’t put more background in, or even more interesting stuff. As in very early in the game you help a young girl discover what happened to her and why she was dead, you barely ever come close to that type of detail again. And that is sad because of this the background environment in terms of engagement is inconsistent, because at one end you find a piece of the map full of history and maybe a doctor who was performing experiments on his patients then at the other end you have a boring area that you have to navigate constantly to get to other locations in the game.  Seriously it gets tedious having to run the same gauntlet over and over again, with nothing changed just the same old Salem with the same old random NPC’s.\n\nAs for the gameplay mechanics, you will have learned almost everything within the first hour of how to play this game, except for a couple of “powers” you learn later on. You’re a ghost, you can pass through physical real world barriers, except for ghost barriers and all the houses in Salem are blessed or something so you can’t get into them without there being an opening of some kind. You can manipulate real world things like tv’s, phones, and printers, but except for missions these abilities don’t rouse a response out of the people in Salem. You can possess people to hear there thoughts, which there are not many of them. You can influence them to advance the case and you can view the world through there eyes to once again advance the case. Pretty nifty thing, but only actually used in the missions and have very littler bearing on the game.\n\nAnd that is pretty much the sum total of the game in mechanics other than the bad guys. Which are demons and floor demons as I will call them.\n\nJust like most adventure games of the past the bad guys pose little to no challenge and are merely there to present a hurdle to bypass. For being called demons if its 1V1 I’m going to win all the time. You hide in shades wait for them to turn there backs and then rip them apart. Also you can use ravens to distract them, but ravens ain’t used a lot. As for floor demons just side step them.\n\nGraphics wise, the game is pretty good, not the prettiest in terms of background environment and the character models look a bit dated, they remind me of XCOM the Bureau, or even LA Norie, but that’s not a bad thing as those games had good graphics as well. And as with anything graphics are not everything as the recent trend in PC gaming can attest to.\n\nSo you may be asking why I seemed to be praising this game in the beginning but point out a lot of flaws in it. Well because in truth there are very few actual adventure games made by triple A developers anymore so anything coming out in this genre that isn’t a bug ridden mess, it will be enjoyed by those of us who like adventure games. Where you play a guy or women trying to unfold a story, either by solving puzzles or piecing the story together . Where you don’t have to gun down an armies worth of bad guys to move from one area to the next. Where the bad guys have to be planned around as you really have no actual defense against them. Where you know you can’t lose but hate the fact that you screw up sometimes.\n\nSo for an adventure game, Murdered Soul Suspect is a fine addition, its has a fairly strong main storyline and some pretty interesting side storylines and background storylines, but as I said before could use a few more to liven the area up even more. (Maybe some DLC?)\n\nFor a game it is pretty average to mediocre though, with most gameplay mechanics discovered and mastered in the first hour it leaves little advancement in that area. The NPC’s are uninteresting, the graphics compared to top of the line are dated, gameplay is pretty linear, and replayability, well to be honest there is none. I’ve played ten hours and the game will probably sit there unless I have an itch to find those 5 pieces of background info/collectibles.\n\nSo final verdict? If you are a fan of adventure games and smooth easy gameplay, then Soul Suspect is the perfect game for you. But if you are new to adventure games, or expecting something different then I wouldn’t suggest this game. And even if you are a fan of the genre this will slot into, wait till it drops to under $20 for it to be worth the money.","June 6, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The main story starts off kind of rocky, but as it pans out, and you learn to ignore the hand-holding that occurs during the investigations and some of the sillier plot points (where the game screams THIS IS IMPORTANT), it actually becomes quite intriguing. I found myself actually ruling people out as the Bell Killer, with my mind firmly set on one person from very early on in the game. To my pleasant surprise, I only partially anticipated the ending, and it wasn't something from way out in left field as you would find in an M Night Shyamalan movie. It worked (eventually).\n\nWhat didn't work in this game, are many of the aforementioned investigations that hold your hand throughout, often making it obscenely clear exactly what happened without ever even looking at any of the evidence at the scene. In most cases, you needed to guide Ronan to each piece of evidence (generally around 10 items), at which point he would make a remark that is often idiotic (and very often the complete opposite of what the item clearly gave me the impression of) about how it may pertain to the case, and after you have collected sufficient evidence, you would choose the items Ronan deemed important in closing the case. Since chances are you already know what happened, you would then need to find the two or three items that Ronan needed before you could move on to the more enjoyable parts of the game. This burden is frequently increased by Ronan's tendency to ignore VERY important evidence, that could immediately close the case, to focus on items that don't really help his investigation..at all. In general, what could have perhaps been the main draw for many people in this game, ended up feeling trivial and even, at times, tacked on as an after-thought. This became especially apparent when comparing the investigative stories to what was probably my favorite part of the game.\n\nPerhaps the most redeeming quality of the game in terms of story, is sadly the part of the game that most people are likely to overlook. Each area of the game has a set of collectibles that you can gather to get a better understanding the lore surrounding that part of Salem, as portrayed through a spooky ghost story. Between these and the investigations, it definitely appears that the ghost stories took a backseat in terms of time spent working on them in the production process, as they consist of a single voice actor describing a very short ghost story, while you look at a spooky picture related to the story. It sounds lame, sure, a cinematic would have made more sense, but at the same time I think it allows you to focus more on the story itself. The ability to successfully portray a spooky story with what seems to be as little effort as possible makes me wonder why this wasn't more of a horror-based adventure game, than a detective-y investigation-y game.\n\nPerhaps the most depressing part of the story is the fact that it is so short, clocking in at only 7hrs from start to finish, getting 100% of the achievements at the same time. I would have liked to see more side missions (I'd say investigations, but there wasn't really any of  that going on), and a generally longer story than the game had to offer.\n\nCHARACTERS 7.5/10 - Ronan is basically a walking cliché for a bad guy gone good guy cop who does more than just toe the line between cop and criminal when he works cases. You can pretty much ignore his character entirely for a good portion of the game as his comments tend to only point out the other flaws in the game. Joy, the teenage medium, even comes off as a rather cliché young pain in the ♥♥♥, but her character does evolve rather well. When it comes to characters, the game really shines with the secondary characters, such as Baxter, and some of the Bell Killer's victims that you meet along your journey, who have all interacted with the killer in one way or another, and you get to see how that experience has changed them - for better or worse.\n\nThe same split between really good and really boring characters can be seen in the all-to-few number of side investigations that you can find scattered across Salem, where someone may have a problem that you offer to investigate, and inevitably fix. In the cases where the characters are lame, it is often because of the same thing the investigation part of the game suffers from, the answer being too blatantly obvious to not think that character is an idiot for not seeing it. In other cases, it is clear that the character is in a literal limbo, and they need your help getting out of it.\n\nGAMEPLAY 8/10 - First off, the game as a whole  works beautifully, both as a game being played on launch week, and a game in general, as I found no bugs of any kind while playing through the game.\n\nChances are, part of the reason the game runs so great is because it is just so simplistic. The combat in the game is about as basic as you can get, and would most likely have become very redundant had there been more combat sequences in the game. I had only just started to get sick of dealing with demons by the time I reach the last half hour or so of gameplay. It is very clear that the focus is on story and investigating the crimes of the Bell Killer (see the story section for why that is a letdown).\n\nThe world around Ronan becomes increasingly impressive, and creepy, as the frequency of ghosts increases, but in general I got a very Twilight-zone-empty-town feel from Salem, and the ghosts flat out reminded me of the Haunted Mansion ride at Disney World. Ultimately, the living people that populated Salem ended up feeling even more empty than their ghostly counterparts, which I think actually gave me an even creepier vibe from the game, although I don't think that was totally intentional.\n\nWhile making the world feel a bit more lively is kind of optional, since a gloomier look does make sense to me as you are playing a ghost, I think Salem definitely should have been larger than it was. By the time you reach the credits, you will have only explored just over a half dozen different parts of Salem, and the streets of (a rather small) Salem itself. Sure, the areas are diverse, consisting of everything from a Church, to a Police Station, and a Mental Hospital, but none of the areas are very large, further adding to the small-world feel of the game. On the other hand, with how tedious the combat had become by the end of the game, and how pointless the investigations were (they weren't quite tedious, but certainly would have been soon enough), I think focusing more on other aspects of the game first would have been more important than expanding the world around Ronan.","June 7, 2014","true","7.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The market for AAA games demand experiences much different than this one.  This is a niche game, and throwing so many resources at it is a terrible, terrible business decision.\n\nThe game has almost no combat, and is driven by dialogue, information gathering, and narrative.\n\nThat said, I am writing this after just completing it, with a huge grin on my face.  The story in this game is STELLAR.  It evokes the slower pacing and murder mystery elements of games like the Blackwell franchise and LA Noire.  It's also compounded with supernatural elements and a heavy influence from the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nAt it's heart, it's a murder mystery (your own, in fact.)  But once it starts unfolding, there is an incredible narrative to be experienced, one I highly recommend, if you don't mind slow pacing in video games.\n\nI can't recommend this to everyone, but if you love a good mystery, and prefer dialogue to gunplay, then I cannot recommend this game enough.

Not a fast-paced game and with very few action elements, but it was never supposed to be an action game to begin with. Soul Suspect plays more like an adventure game with puzzles with an occassional fighting scene (which itself is presented like an action puzzle with a small amount of strategy involved).\n\nThe atmosphere is great. Sound (voice and music) and visuals are superb and convincing and set the mood for the game right away. The story is classical detective story, obviously with supernatural elements, is well written and even though not mind blowing in its "message", it kept me completely immersed en interested through the whole game. The game world is not very big,but detailed and varying, and there are very many things to observe and find. Lots of collectibles, but these are done right: when found, they provide smaller details to the story, or tell separate smaller stories of their own.\n\nGameplay puzzles aren't very difficult, and failing them doesn't give any penalty. The detective puzzles will remind a lot of LA Noire, but are somewhat easier.\n\nTo sum up: not a game for people looking for action. It is rather a game for people who don't mind standing still occasionally in a game for a while to observe the surroundings and solve a puzzle or mystery. If you are one of those, you are in for a treat: the game is very convincing as a supernatural spooky detective.\n\nPS: almost no bugs found, except cinematics graphics sometimes appeared in much worse quality than actual gameplay (which are pretty good). Also keep in mind that collectibles you might have missed can't be collected once you finish the game (the game notifies about this in the last scene).","July 21, 2014","true","14.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And this game gets negative reviews because people are expecting a game, not a movie. But if it was soemthing like "Wolf Among Us" ("The Walking Dead" is a bit off, sicne it's not a detective story), noone would have complained, I think. And if there were more choices, that influence the game, if collectibles did not only tell you some background, but also influenced the ending somehow, if saving ghosts influenced the story... There are a lot of ifs, that could have been covered if this was an episodic game and if it did not feel like pieces were cut off of it. And if it actually had a map IN the game, not on a web-page.\n\nBut if you forget about all these, it's not a bad story. Yes, if the background told by the collectibles were more integrated in the main story, characters could become more... Real. Less flat. But overall, I actually enjoyed it. It has good dynamic: not too fast (since it's not an action game), but not too slow (as some detective quests can be), it has motivation, it has mistery.\n\nI think I'll give it 7/10. Maybe 7.5/10, since it kinda reminded me of Dreamfall (although Dreamfall had more gameplay). I wonder if Airtight Games can make something in similar fasion, while covering some negative points. Or they can simply try an approach closer to Telltale Games, I guess.","June 8, 2014","true","10.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

No, not by a long shot, but then again, are there any perfect games which aspire to the complexity of narrative and gameplay as Murdered: Soul Suspect? As a narrative exercise, Murdered is very enjoyable. The stories of the various ghosts you encounter are always interesting and sometimes quite haunting. Ronan, the dead detective whom you play, may seem one dimensional at the beginning, but he is 'fleshed out', so to speak as you play, to at least TWO dimensions. But to mitigate this issue are some really interesting characters and stories, i.e. the aforementioned ghosts you meet. Some are quite affecting.\n\nThe game is, for the most part, solidly built and I experienced no bugs or glitches while playing the game. Glimpses of Airtight Game's puzzle pedigry show through in several sections, though there is never an explicit focus on that kind of gameplay. Yet nor is there a focus on action. This a much more quiet and reflective gameplay experience, which I wonder is not an explanation of the game's poor reviews thus far. Certainly, it is not a blockbuster, but it feels more like an independent, more closely focused affair which I think many will enjoy if they are open to it.\n\nIn many ways, I kept thinking about similar games I played in the 90s. Perhaps it was the interface itself or the mood or the package as a whole. The game is a throwback, so yes it does have obvious shortcomings. The living world which it hints at is very quickly revealed to be smoke and mirrors, but as already explained, I was fine with that. I liked the characters and the ideas and the game played smoothly. I do not regret slapping down the cash for this one.","June 7, 2014","true","12.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Any cop you throw out a window will hunt you down and kick your ♥♥♥."\n\nI really enjoyed this game, a dark supernatural murder mystery. I'm not sure exactly what the critics got upset about though looking at the Metascore, but it's not as bad as they have made it out to be.\nAs others have mentioned it is very LA Noire-ish but it's more forgiving if you make a mistake during your investigation. The story is interesting, voice acting is good, and the atmosphere/music is very similar to an early Silent Hill.\nThe game has you spend most of your time investigating your death and tracking down your killer. Along the way you can also collect items that tell you ghost stories, interact with living and dead, and help others that have also passed move on. This isn't a hard boiled action game like Max Payne, however you will run across demons during your travels that can be exercised. It is short yes, but for what it is I think it was probably the right length.\nI didn't experience any major bugs or issues, and it is possible to 100% it on the one play through.\nA heads up though, the interactive map has some major mistakes in item locations, other users however have kindly corrected these with their own markers. So if you choose to use the map check out the Global Flags.\nSo to wrap it up, if you are after ghost stories, dark settings and something a little different, check this one out.","June 7, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The 'detective' puzzles can be a little...wonky sometimes, abd a lot of them come down to trial and error. But even then it only takes a few minutes to really sort out which clue you need. The "combat" is kind of a sore spot, it's basically a stealth/reaction puzzle thing where you have to sneak up behind a demon, hold R, then press the WASD+mouse1/2 combination it shows you. Luckily the demons are pretty sparse.

Murdered: Soul Suspect is a great 3rd person game that involves excellent crime solving elements. The game jumps straight into the action, revealling one of, if not the biggest plot twists in the entire game.

This totally does, it's a cool film noir thing that's written like a paranormal TV show, in a good way. The 'detective' puzzles can be a little...wonky sometimes, abd a lot of them come down to trial and error. But even then it only takes a few minutes to really sort out which clue you need. The "combat" is kind of a sore spot, it's basically a stealth/reaction puzzle thing where you have to sneak up behind a demon, hold R, then press the WASD+mouse1/2 combination it shows you. Luckily the demons are pretty sparse. The focus is really on the atmosphere and the writing, which is actually super good.","October 2, 2014","true","10.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

Luckily there are people out there who have fixed this.. and the link at the bottom is a youtube video that also links in its description to the files needed to sort it all out. :)\n\nOnto the review...\n\nThis game was very enjoyable from start to finish. The story is great and the whole idea of playing a dead character solving his own murder is one I haven't seen done before and it was excuted perfectly in this game so welldone to the developers for that as in the wrong hands an idea like this just wouldn't have worked as well I feel.\n\nThe games graphics and look were great. I ran it maxed out at 1080p on my Radeon 6870 with a quad core Athlon II cpu and 8gb of memory. I didn't experience any framerate issues that others have mentioned in the forums.. tho there was one part of the story that seemed to repeat itself at one point and I'm pretty sure that wasn't meant to happen as it made no sense, but the story continued fine after that little hiccup, not a major issue.\n\nControls on the 360 controller were great, very easy to get into and layed out well. I never tried the keyboard/mouse for this game as I felt no need to, so can't comment on some comments form others about it not suiting keyboard/mouse.. considering the price of even a 3rd party wired 360 controller these days its not a problem worth moaning about and as i said, the 360 controller is fully supported and ideal for this game.\n\nThe game is quite short compared to most large companies titles these days and can be completed in between probably 7 and 10 hours depending on whether to stick to the main story or want to collect everything and complete the side stories. I clocked a bit more than that as I was playing the game on a day I was ill to pass the time lol, so game was paused for periods of time while i was .. well... attending to being ill lol.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes games with a good story to unfold.. also its a bit different to the norm thats released these days. I hope Square-Enix and Airtight Games work together again on a similar title as I'd definitely buy it.. and hopefully they will learn from their game launching mistakes with this one.\n\nAs stated the game launch problems are easily fixed using the files the guy links to on youtube for anyone that needs them.. (link below, view on youtube to see description and files link)\n\nI'll give the game 8/10 despite the shorter than usual gameplay and the fact I had to fix its launching problem. The score reflects the game itself and it was great.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsBgPCmfbYg","February 13, 2015","true","13.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I have trouble really classifying it because I've never played anything quite like it, and it really managed to form it's own gameplay identity instead of being a clone of something else or fitting neatly into a pre-defined gameplay genre.\n\n-The graphics are also really pretty relative to how easy on the hardware it it. I was able to max it out (with AA turned off) at 1080p on a 750ti and it was rare that it dropped under FPS.\n\n-The story is brilliant and actually managed to have a couple twists that I really didn't see coming because of the way it played with my expectations near constantly and intentionally set itself up for common tropes only to subvert or play with them.\n\n-The art design is great and does this thing where it creates interesting eviroments by blending the real-world with ghostly left-overs of the past.\n\n-It was interesting how it turned no-clip into a game mechanic.\n\n-The bonus stuff like the side-missions and ghost stories were cool.\n\nI guess there is some cons, though:\n\n-The stealth sections can get tedious because the Demons tend to be a little to smart and aggressive, I often found myself trapped because they got stuck in the alert state and wouldn't go back to the posts no matter how well I stayed hidden.\n\n-Some poor optimization, I know I said it runs well but it does tend to suffer from really inconsistant framerates, it can be at 55FPS one minute and 100FPS the next and the Vsync is useless because it looks it to 30FPS instead of to your screens refresh rate.\n\n-Some of the items are to well hidden, I missed out on two of the Ghost Stories because I just could not find the last items for either, and one location even locked me out of room that the levels last item was presumably in.\n\n-No kind of map, even though the "hub" area is pretty huge and maze-like.\n\n-Short, I spent just over 10 hours on it and that was a playthrough with a lot of messing about and finding A LOT of the bonus items. I imagine it would be under 5 hours if you ignored the side-missions.\n\n-Price, I think $30 is pushing it. I paid $4 during a sale and I'd say it's not worth more than $15, so wait for it to go on sale.","May 30, 2015","true","10.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Murdered takes place in Salem, Mass and stars the newly deceased Ronan O'Connor, who sets out to learn the identity of his killer.\nIt's an adventure game, basically, right down to the often frustrating hunt for clues. This makes up a good chunk of the gameplay and tasks you with finding a certain number of bits of info by exploring a tightly defined location, examining everything. Moving the story forwards requires you to find and identify the most relevant clues. It's not the most graceful representation of the detective's art, but it is a more compelling take on the genre than the rummage sale of irrelevant detritus that typified LA Noire.\n\nSo the game is absolutely amazing The visuals, the gameplay, are all spectacular and it's refreshing. they have completely redefined storytelling in gaming with this masterpiece.","June 6, 2014","true","2.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Right from it's release, I somehow knew this game would really capture my interest. I picked it up at the Humble Store when they were doing a Square Enix Sale for $15. I do not regret paying that much, as this game really caught my attention.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, L.A. Noire players will find that it's a lot alike in terms of clues you must find and mysters that have to be solved. Of course, if you fail to connect the clues to the pending question of "who dun it", the game is more forgiving in that regard, as you get as many tries as it takes. Get it on your first try, however, and you get a better rank for that mission.\n\nThere is "combat" in this game, but this is the one and only thing about this game that really was shallow. The "demons" that all of the ghosts within the plot are afraid of are nothing more than easy prey for the protagonist. What was supposed to be a game of cat and mouse where the demons were the cats, actually felt very flopsided, as every demon encounter I had within Murdered: Soul Suspect felt like mice, and I more than likely felt like the cat in multiple situations. I really felt like the purpose of having demons within the game was really undermined, thus, it fell very flat on it's face.\n\nThe overall plot to this game is where it really shines. Within each level, it's a consistent game of "who dun it" as I mentioned earlier. Each solved case supposedly brings you one step closer to unmasking a pertty good villain: The Bell Killer, keyword "supposedly". I found that whom I thought it was all this time turned out to be completely and utterly wrong, and the game laughed in my face for having me think it'd be whom the clues all pointed to.\n\nAs an added bonus, within each level you can find these artifacts that, when you collect them all, tell a ghost story about the specific surrounding that you find yourself in. Because of this, I will happily be replaying Murdered: Soul Suspect so I can listen and bask in the ghostly horror of these stories.\n\nOverall, this game was great, although a bit short. At it's current price tag of $50, one might be a tad disappointed. Wait for a sale, however, and you'll truly enjoy the ghostly world that is Murdered: Soul Suspect.","August 2, 2014","true","14.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Short, but good. The story is absolutely fantastic - well written, well presented. There are a couple of problems I encountered - keyboard controls felt awkward, so I had to switch to xbox controller, the whole "investigation" thing is pretty linear. But what saved this game for me was the sheer amount of LORE and background for everything happening and what happened. Hell, even the town and some of it's past events are real. But also not only you can "read" newspaper articles or you dead wife's diaries - you can also poke around the city to find some ghostly remains of city's past, reveal some well-narrated backstories and so on.\nIt is pretty linear in it's investigations, but outside them you have your town which is kind of open-worldish, but not really. Nice little touch is the ability to read people's minds - and even though they sometimes repeat - the amount of "thoughts" is pretty big and also reveals some lore.\nThe "ghost" mechanic is great and executed well - the only bad thing I can name is that in tight spaces (there are not a lot of them, but still) you can easily lose your sense of space because of your "ghost noclip" ability. Oh, and demons are kind of annoying, but not too much, and they are pretty rare.\nThe real bad thing is that this game is pretty short. If you ignore all nice details you can possibly complete it in 6 or 5 hours. With all the poking around it will take around 9-10, but not more. Though the story is good, really good.

A good, interesting concept with bags of potential that has a half arsed delivery. It also feels like a dumbed down L.A Noire, that maybe a bit harsh actualy but anyway it still holds your hand through the investigations that are implemented a lot like L.A Noire. The twist is ok and frankly I was quite a head of the investigation before that point anyway and the rest of the game was basicaly confirming my theories. The controls are also very odd. Exorcising demons, which I swear is never explained how the main character and only him can do it however I may have just missed that or didn't pay attention, involves holding the R then pressing either W,A,S,D and the left mouse button. Now I'm sorry but this is just too much, a 3 button QTE is just too much, it's a QTE not a think for a bit to make sure I have the right button because if you don't your going to have to run fast. These demons are quick and kill quick too, they also freak me out a lot but that might be just me. The mouse is also super sensitive and it took me a while to get used to it even on the lowest setting. The cat controls are ridiculous too and seems to be slightly less broken than Radscorpions, which is saying a lot as they are the most glitchy animals in a game, ever. Oh and the game is too short, and the escort parts are silly as the people your escorting won't move till a distraction happens to lead the person away....who is standing still at the time, not actively searching...so those being escorted are never in any real danger, so it's a tad pointless. On the whole, good concept, average delivery and worth £10 on sale, definatly not full price though.\n\nCheck out my youtbe channel for lets plays and commentary every Monday and Friday\nhttp://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2l1zwMcpJm_hJq4owO3nHg","August 4, 2014","false","6.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I purchased it from Humble Bundle when it was part of a $1 bundle and that's honestly about how much it is worth.\n\nThe gameplay is okay. While the storyline is interesting, general mechanics of moving your character around can be quite a pain. You only play in third person and the camera moves way too fast; apparently mouse sensitivity only seems to affect cursor movements on selecting clues. The demons, though 2spoopy5me at times, seem like an unnecessary add-in to the game. Also, your LMB/RMB and any keyboard function will randomly stop working. The game also only auto saves, so if you end up having any issues like that, go ahead and prepare yourself for any progress you may lose when you have to restart the game.","January 21","false","1.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The premise was unique (you're a detective and you need to find out who murdered you).  But this was just not enjoyable.\n\nThe game is short.  By itself, this isn't a big deal, you don't need to put 40+ hours into a game to get your money's worth.  My playtime was 9 hours.  But I'm guessing 4 of those were spent fighting with the game's poor systems:\n\n1) No Map.  Seriously?  What is this 2004?  In a 3rd person exploration game this is unheard of & seems like it was omitted to add unnecessary time & difficulty.  Wandering about town, there is a series of intermediate waypoints that lead you to the next target, but those get broken & send you through areas that aren't available, so unless you're a navigational expert, you're stuck randomly wandering until you luck into the next target.\n\n2) Combat.  It's basically added as an afterthought to add time in between the "investigations" (which are generally well done, once you figure out the game's systems).  There's is one monster type & it's pattern is easily identifiable.  But the controls are difficult & even if you do everything right you still might get caught & have to redo the area.  The game is using poor controls & frustration to again add extra difficulty & time, instead of giving the enemies useful AI.\n\nThe graphics are fine, but suffer from overusing a "dark & hazy" theme.  Considering the story takes place entirely at night, this is probably expected.\n\nI was engaged enough with the setting & story enough to want to finish it, but definitely won't be replaying to get a 100% finish.","February 22, 2015","false","9.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Right off\nthe bat, I was unimpressed by the whopping 30 frames per second that this\ngame runs at, followed shortly by the delayed lineup of subtitles to speech.\n\nThe story was cheesy and doesn't fit with the objective of the game;\nstarting out by stating that your ultimate goal is to reunite with a lost love,\nbut then not mentioning that relationship for the bulk of the game.  As for the game\nbeing a detective game, I would disagree with that and state that it is more\nlike a hidden object game that requires you search out 'clues' in a predetermined\nlocation.  There is no deduction needed; all the clues are in one place, and\nthe game holds your hand by leading you to the next clue and asking\nrediculously obvious questions.\n\nThe ghosts, while contributing to the atmosphere, did absolutely nothing\nto add to the game.  For the most part, they were all from the same time period,\nand were supposed to add a spooky element, but as you are also playing as a\nghost, and they disappear when you get close, they were more of a waste of time\nthan anything else.\n\nI enjoy watching movies, but I buy games in order to, oh I don't know,\nplay a game!  This game played like a cinematic movie, with about 20-25%\nof the game actual gameplay, and the rest being cinematic movies or dialogue.\nBeing made to move all across the mapp to get to the next action point does not\ncount as gameplay;  it is wasting time.\n\nIf you are interested in the story of this game, I would recommend going\nto YouTube and watching the cinematics strung together rather than buy this game.\nIt treats you, the player, as if you are an idiot that can't figure out anything\nfor yourself.  Graphically the game gets by, as well as the level design.  The\nstory is acceptable, but what little gameplay there is designed for those\nthat can't deduce anything for themselves.  As a game, I cannot recommend this,\nif it can even be called a game.\n\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of\nwhat I cover in my video.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","November 20, 2014","false","10.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

It is basically an interactive movie. It is a murder mystery. For me this game/movie was kind of boring... Not very fun for a video game. I feel sorry for those who paid full price. I guess I got my $12 worth out of this game since it's cheaper than going to the movies to kill 4 hours. This is a Crime, Drama, Murder, Mystery. I'd say I've been bored for 4 hours since I just wanted to finish the story. It wasn't worth it for myself. There was no challenge at all... Just go here investigate this and that help this person do this get here blah blah blah.... Just boring.\n\nKilling demons isn't even satisfying and it's also a very small part of the game to add a challenge... It's not challenging at all. Just get behind the demon hold R then you will have to hit W, A, S, or D with left or right click, it's completely random which is cool but i'd rather actually battle the demon with something more interactive. But yeah do that and the demon is dead YAYYYY!!! Or you can just skip killing demons and go to your next location... doesn't matter.\n\nThis game is only worth $12 or less.

In fact, I enjoyed it a lot more than I ever thought I would! The game relies largely on its characters and the murder mystery that's central to said characters' lives. If you're looking for a fast-paced, highly action-driven game, it doesn't deliver on that front - but that's what made it such a great ride for me as a player.\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect of the game from the premise alone, but it does atmospheric horror really well, along with the splashes of detective fiction and noir, too. Investigating, gathering clues, questioning witnesses, and making deducions are all important to the game. It even has an historical angle that I first thought would be somewhat canned, but actually surprised me a bit by the end.\n\nCollecting is an important part of the game and, although it's "optional," a lot of the story content depends on how well you can scour a map for all of the items - some hidden and some not. Even with ~10 hours play time into my first "completed" game, I still didn't track everything down! So if you're a completionist who enjoys searching and interacting with maps, M:SS definitely appeals on that front.\n\nThe other main challenge of the game is demon encounters, and they can be tricky to master at first, since some of the combinations are a little awkward. Still, by the last few maps it seems easier (as the difficulty doesn't really go up much during the course of the game) ... but it's definitely anxiety-inducing sometimes! All in all, the demon encounters kept the game from feeling extremely linear (i.e., like a visual novel).\n\nSo if you're into mysteries and crime fiction, love spooky stuff, and enjoy a game that burns a little slowly, definitely give it a try.","June 30, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But the more I read into the reviews, the more I realized that this game was just never given a fair chance from the start. A lot of people came off as jaded as to what they wanted and expected with "Murdered: Soul Suspect". In truth, I feel as though they were wrong.\n\n"Murdered: Soul Suspect" is what you expect out of a good ghost story, or even a Noir movie. You have many different characters that fit the roles they were supposed to play. The story keeps you guessing until the very end, and manages to keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. While it is not like a sandbox game like many had hoped and desired, you still have plenty of places to explore and little nooks and crannies to find within the game's structure.\n\nThis game is not for a player who wants a sandbox world, who wants to shoot up bad guys, or that has to really put some effort to unlock, discover, and solve the many puzzles within the game. This is the kind of game that is for those who enjoy the journey it takes you on. For those who loved games like "Gabriel Knight" or "7th Guest". Good horror stories that make you want to discover everything that happened and why.\n\nWhile the replay value may not be as good as some other games, it is the sort of game you will play, try to find all the artifacts in the first run through, and then put away when you are finished. You will then pick it back up after awhile, and play it once more for the amazing story it tells.","July 1, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, some players has been following this game from E3 2013 and has been building up alot of anticipations and pre-release hype. Based on the original concepts, authentic setttings and unique mechanics, this game definitely delivers.\n\nIn this epic detective meets criminal adventure heavily inspired by the likes of L.A. Noire and Alan Wake players takes the role of detective Ronan O'Connor who happens to find himself being killed by the mysterious 'bell killer'. He then not only find himself dead in the real world but simultaneous alive in another dimension like the movie 'ghost'. Determined to find out who the killer was, Ronan embarked on a endless investigation to solve the mysteries behind his death and discover the dark secret behind Salem's ancient history of witchcraft.\n\nBy playing as a ghost, you gain awesome abilities such as no clipping through walls, possessing people, poltergeist electronic devices to attract attentions, and if these aren't enough you can possess a cat and go 'meow'.\n\nBy poeessing common folks around the town, you are given the options mind read their thoughts. However, most of the things they say provide little to no useful information at all which makes it pointless at any point of the game. Some NPCs such as police officers will allow player to obtain useful clues regarding the cases often by means of eavesdropping, peeking through their eyes and influence their decision making.\n\nBy possessing the cat, you gain access to platforming sections of the game which often will help you to get to a upper level.\n\nThe detective elements of the game was not as good as L.A Noire, investigation can help you gather clues and the amount of clues needed for each case was given to players. Interrogation can only be done on other ghosts and it involves picking from limited options and are way too easy most of the time it is just common sense. With enough clues gathered, players can conclude the current investigation by chossing pieces of important information. Players are given 3 chances and even if you selcted the incorrect choices, the game will give you infinite tries leading to eventually picking out the correct information by trials and error.This idiotically defeats the purpose of giving 3 tries and has way too much hand holding throughout the story. Whereas, in L.A noire inability to solve crimes often can have consequences and investigation cannot be done again once it is concluded.\n\nThe combat is however interesting as player gain ability to see demons through walls to allow advanced planning of strategies and make decisions to whether encounter or avoid. Most of the battle requires player to teleport between human remain souls to get behind the demons to perform execution called 'exorcism'. However, the game has only one enemy type and every encounter feels the same and after a while it gets repetitive.\n\nThe environment is also quite boring with little open world elements, no interactive NPCs, and bland design choices that players often just walking around for collectibles, side cases or towards the next objective. Speaking of side quests and collectibles. It can be a real chore as the game has little replay value so you gasically back tracking for the sake of it. There are no incentives or rewards for doing it apart from some achievements for completing a side case or a set of collections.\n\nCharacters have little personality development throughout the game, most of the time I find it hard to relate to most of them. If the story wasn't decent enough to make me continue playing I just cannot think of much selling point in this game.\n\nTechniquelly, there has been occassional frame rate drop issues and stuttering problems which is annoying but still playable. When booting up the game for the first time, the screen also flickers a few times but I won't rate a game based on these minor issues as it can be simply fixed with a update or two.\n\nIs this a good game?\nI think overall, yes it is a good game if you like story driven adventure that doesn't involve all out shooting and straightout combat. Its appeal really comes from a real life location and interesting depiction of Salem's ancient history and traditions with a unique play style, it can be really appreciative. If you can ignore the problems present and look at the good side of things plus the price they are asking for, I would say it is worth a try.\n\nFinal verdict\nMurdered: soul suspect is far from perfect or a masterpiece if you compare it to similar games such as L.A noire and Alan Wake. But it borrows what is good from both titles and add its own twists which some think it is good and some simply may not like it.\n\nFinally, I think it is one of those game that should be played but just don't expect 100% perfection and a fully immersive world and rather expect a rough around the edges unque title to try in 2014.\n\n7/10","June 9, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sometimes it's really pleasant to drop off your swords, guns, explosives, tanks, etc. and just listen to a good (mystic in this case) story, or since we're talking about the game - become a part of the story.\nThe plot doesn't bring something new (or maybe it's me getting older), but it's interesting and keeps you involved till the end of the game, with a small twist. Thankfully, game is pretty short and does not get you bored - 16 hours in my case, BUT, this is becasue of the greatest minus of the game - it's terrible, random, sadistic check points. I had to exit the game after several hours of playing, and when came back to it about 30 minutes were gone. I had to rush into several side quests again aaand....caught a bug with Ronan falling through textures, reloaded, and repeated those 30 minutes.\nAs far as I understand this is first succesfull project from Airtight Games. If they had more budget, city would be bigger, there would be more side quests, more reasonablo thoughts in the citizens' minds and more interactive objects. So I wish developers all that for their next project so it can become a real AAA game.\nFor now, it's 7,5/10 (not enough for 8, better than just 7)","June 13, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you like good detective story, or Japanese style of narration, or both then you are for a treat. It's must have for all fans of games like Deadly Premonition or Heavy Rain. Gameplay focuses on quite easy, but fun, puzzles and on sneaking-based combat, but those mechanics are just tools to tell the story, if you want intense, gameplay focused game then it's not for you (but you should try it, you might like it anyway because it's really good game ;).","June 15, 2014","true","12.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay mainly consists of walking around and examining objects in the environment to help solve cases. If that bores you, don't get this game because there is not even much of a combat system aside from sneak attacking demons once in a while. It is kind of open world in the sense that you are free to walk around town and collect objects to solve side cases, but the lack of any sort of map or minimap makes exploration a hassle. With all that being said, I enjoyed the story and atmosphere of the game, which is surprisingly a bit lighthearted for a game about ghosts. It took me about 7 hours to complete the game and I also took my time to grab most of the collectibles as well.\n\nVerdict: Definitely get this on a sale, it is short but sweet. 6/10","December 23, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The crime solving mechanincs were good but a little glichy, wallking a round as ghots was fun and felt new to me.\n\nMy problesm with the game is that they played it safe, short and simple. They could have doulble the game if they had added time travel to it. You all ready see stuff from the past but only small stuff but with time travel you could have ,witneses, much better under standing of the wicht trails from exploring the past town and the people from that time. the murderers, (spoilers) You could all so see the past bell murders and victims. The side quest would alse be better with it adding the murder , plan or thougths and reasons for it as well as seen the even unfold.\n\nPossessioning people was very boring and not that  usefull, you had alot of copy and past npcs. Would be better if you could contol them which would make it possible to enter more building increassing the game.\n\nThe town was very small and cluster together with random hinding spots all over town.\n\nIts a good game and stands out from many other games.

The score are deducted as follow.\n\n-2 for game lengths. having to wait for a year, I would have expected the game to last for more then 6 hours of game play. And for the amount that I am paying it is not worth getting. heck there isn't even a start new + where we can do more side quest or something. Major disappointment.\n\n-1 not challenging enough. I have play many other detective rpg games but this one seems to be really dumb down. the clues were very easy to get and conclusion was very obvious.

I waited for it, and although it did not meet all my expectations, it left me satisfied.\nFirst of all it a game of a rare genre nowadays - Adventure. Get rid of the demons and demon hands - and this is a pure non-combat quest. The closest example which appeared in my mind is Indigo Prohecy. Sometimes it's really pleasant to drop off your swords, guns, explosives, tanks, etc. and just listen to a good (mystic in this case) story, or since we're talking about the game - become a part of the story.\nThe plot doesn't bring something new (or maybe it's me getting older), but it's interesting and keeps you involved till the end of the game, with a small twist. Thankfully, game is pretty short and does not get you bored - 16 hours in my case, BUT, this is becasue of the greatest minus of the game - it's terrible, random, sadistic check points. I had to exit the game after several hours of playing, and when came back to it about 30 minutes were gone. I had to rush into several side quests again aaand....caught a bug with Ronan falling through textures, reloaded, and repeated those 30 minutes.\nAs far as I understand this is first succesfull project from Airtight Games. If they had more budget, city would be bigger, there would be more side quests, more reasonablo thoughts in the citizens' minds and more interactive objects. So I wish developers all that for their next project so it can become a real AAA game.\nFor now, it's 7,5/10 (not enough for 8, better than just 7)","June 13, 2014","true","17.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What do I mean by slow controls? I mean that walking is more like shuffling and the run option is nothing more than a fast paced walk. Granted you get a power later on that helps with that problem, but only to a point.\nThe story is well presented but it still feels rushed and boring at times. The only thing that would make the gameplay any longer is by aquiring all the collectibles which I feel has had more time spent on than some more important parts of the game, both finding them and reading/watching them. This game is portrayed as a thriller and it hasn't failed on that part. However it also implies some horror elements that aren't really present, even with the "spooky" spectres.\nAs my activity time shows, I've not spent long on this game. I'd say that the campaign is only around 3-4 hours long and all other time is spent simply getting the collectibles or completing the tiny amount of sidecrimes/cases that you can solve.\nAll in all, this is getting a thumbs down. While the story is good, I can't help but feel that this game was rushed out to help with the new gen consoles rather than be a good game. I also don't think that with the small amount of time spent on thisgame it is worth the £24.99 price tag.","June 7, 2014","false","6.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

WELL...\nwhere to start?\nfirst: was waiting for this game 2 months... big expectations.... preordered and waited\nsecond: limited edition - there was a small journal (i have a phys. game DVD limited ed.) - nice small book, interesting reading.... no spoilers... just some "background" info... nice\nthird: the game.... well... the story is great i think, the end surprised me. Nice twist. I guessed another ending :) The story, i mean the IDEA of this game is great/unique. The afterlife and etc. Many ghost NPC - some interesting, some useless. The living NPCs on the streets.. .well... the city was a bit dead .... empty. (many repeatitive toughts and lines, etc...) not enought side quests.\nThe gameplay.... not bad, but not superb...  I think the action passages were..... the fighting part was for 3rd time boring. But the demons were great (mean the design, not their skills or AI)\nI think 2-3 months more for betatesting to correct flaws and changes in gameplay, this game could have been PERFECT  (9 from 10) but maybe next time!\nBut now... one playthrout and I think I never play it again. There are flaws for me I cant never forget....\nDont buy it for full price or you become angry. Trust me.  (10-15 euros, or sale)\nIn past, Ive played fahrenheit (indigo prophecy) and both Alan Wakes (game and expansion)... I think this game is first for me, then Alan Wake, and then fahrenheit. Didnt liked the Alan Wake supernatural part, and fahrenheits either. But this was more believable.

(honestly, i have not gotten killed a single time during the game, except for once when i wondered what would actually happen if i got killed on purpose)\n\nhonestly, just reading these few paragraps written with my terrible english will probably be a time spent better than trying to enjoy the gameplay of this excuse of a modern "press x to win" game.\n\nbut as i said earlier, the story is cool and the little ghost tales told for collecting items during the abrasive pixel hunting are interesting as well. i would much rather watch a 1 hour long B-movie made from this story than die in agony wandering through the streets of the boredom town to get to the story.\n\nthis was a terrible experience, and screw the money but i want the time back. the time. give me back my time.\n\n\nPS. before you dismiss the review because i have 0.1 hours of the game played on the record, i played it with steam in the offline mode and it just didn't register my playtime","February 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you do not like either the cinematography stylings of pulp noir (in which case, you won't like the cut-scenes and may dislike the characters on occassion) or think ghost stories are dull, then this is not the game for you.\n\nFor those of you still with me and looking at potentially buying this game a bit of background is in order.  The studio that released M:SS closed down despite really ploughing everything into this game.  Part of it is odd in places, which I'll get to, but mostly they'd been struggling for a while due to releasing a couple of games which were bombs a while back.  Any future updates to the game will have to be community driven but that at least is one piece of good news - after multiple playthroughs I only came across one minor glitch, once, and it was a graphical one that I couldn't replicate.  The game runs really well so future patching should not be necessary.\n\nSo, where to start?  How about the story.  It's pretty standard fair, almost straight out of a "Randall & Hopkirk: Deceased" episode.  You're a detective in Salem when a call is put in about a strange hooded man breaking into an apartment building.  As you are an emotional loose cannon after your wifes' death (it's actually nice to play a character who's irrational behaviour gets some explanation for once) you chase after him alone only to find that he's too strong for you, the eventual fight resulting in your death.  Your purpose is to stop the killer from beyond the grave so that your spirit can move on and be reunited with your wife.\n\nThis opening is actually really impressive as it's almost entirely done using the in-game engine and graphically looks superb, the sweeping camera shots and the slow-motion work really well giving a strong movie quality feel but rather than just have you as a passenger watching the opening the developer makes you take part in it, trying to first catch the killer and even trying to survive the attack.  The sound is excellent too and is nicely understated, something that carries throughout the whole game.\n\nAfter this you're left, dead, in Salem trying to figure out how you can stop this killer.  There's a tutorial which covers the controls and then you're given objectives to complete but you are left to wander through reasonably large parts of Salem without being stopped.  As you're dead you come across other spirits and left over memories of Salem in it's past, which just helps to make the world more interesting and full and the contrast in design is really well realised, especially when it ties in with the sidequests and main stories.  The more you progress the more of Salem opens up to you, allowing you to find out more about Salems past and revisit areas you have already explored.  The team have been as historically accurate as possible, considering that the game is a work of fiction, and you'll get to pick up on a real flavour of Salems darker past as you wander town.\n\nCharacter design suits the mood of the town too and there are characters in period dress in certain areas, although they are very few and far between, I'd have liked to have seen more of them.  They are reasonably realistic to look at - not ultra-real - which would feel out of place in a ghost story, but real anyway with very good motion capture and facial expressions especially on the main ones.  One that stood out to me is a point where a character manages to pretty much lie with just their face for a split second near the end, you'll know it when you see it, but the technology is well utilised without being overdone, it does not take you out of the story or gameplay very much if ever.\n\nAs a ghost you get to travel through walls but presumably due to hardware limitations this pretty much is only really used within enclosed spaces, though this is explained within the game-worlds mythos itself well enough and it can be quite good fun.  These sections really can make you feel like a running, screaming spirit.  I felt less like a spirit and more like I was going to have a seizure due to swoosh noise everytime you select a conversation topic.  It's fine in short conversations but they can be long and a little grating if you want to find out everything.\n\nThere's some disturbing bits in this game too.  Some pretty nasty deaths of young women, some ghosts have some surprisingly harrowing and well-acted lines, almost mini-stories, of their own if you come across them and there are collectables that unlock urban legends, a couple of which are genuinely quite creepy.  There are places with a lot of extra details added in which build up a wonderful sense of dread and oppression too, a lot of which can easily be missed and overlooked as it is just there for scene-setting.\n\nControls are pretty tight, the camera is good but can be a bit awkward when you are possessing something or trying to get through a wall slowly.  But there are two elephants in the room and these are what most reviewers scored the game so harshly on.\n\n1) Pointless Sort-of Forced Combat/Stealth Sections.\n\nYou do combat, you either have to go for it whole-heartedly or just don't do it.  In for a penny, in for a pound!  M:SS feels like it's dipping it's fingers into the collection bowl and wondering if it can get away with giving a two Christmas old chocolate coin.  You get an enforced stealth section, taking you out of the more interesting portion of the game which feels jarring, so you can try to sneak past these demon-monsters which look like the Nozghul if they'd been drinking sheep-dip.  It hardly ever works so you have to try to stealth kill them, which is only a temporary fix.\n\n2) Escort Mission\n\nThe escort is at least useful but these are really badly designed - it barely matters if you get spotted because the spotter sub-routine is so badly programmed.\n\nBoth of these things feel tacked on and out of place.  I have a sneaking suspicion that they received orders from their publisher that if they wanted a Triple A advertising budget then it had to have those things in it because they feel completely at odds with the rest of the game.  And yes, I will be doing a video rant I am that annoyed about it.\n\nMercifully, there's only a handful of those sections and apart from that and one point with a truly stupid portrayal of mental illness (completely different to an earlier scene with a ghost in a bath), the rest of the game is pretty much excellent.  If you can stick out those few parts you will find a good to look at, engaging murder mystery, with an excellent twist and interesting backdrop and characters.\n\nI recommend it, but have to dock it marks for 1) & 2)\n\nTotal Score:  7.5/10\n\nWell above average and definitely worth a play if you want a murder mystery that's a little different or a slowly paced adventure game.","September 28, 2014","true","18.0"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

The investigation aspect is forced on to you on each level and spoon feeds you on what you need to do, meaning that the harder-to-find clues aren't even necessary and have no impact in the game, making it a linear story. Side quests are almost non-existent despite it showing some potential with some of the ghosts you talk to - most of which, there is nothing to persuade them to move on from the living world.\n\nIt has much potential but it dies down and you realize that everything you thought was cool, becomes repetitive and or unnecessary. Gameplay/Story aside, there are annoying technical issues with this game - only one save file is allowed and the autosave is terribly planned. If you're unlucky, like me, you'd have spent some time and lose all your progress with side quests (did two side quests and quit the game, only to find out that the game didn't save). The game's vsync is garbage, your video driver's vsync produces better results.\n\nTo sum things up, the game aspects of this game are great but not used well to keep you entertained for long. The only things that could keep you entertained would be the story and that depends per user's preference. The autosave feature sucks, it only saves during main quest and when you enter/exit places. It doesn't save on the town map at all.\n\n[Possible spoiler regarding gameplay]\n\nThe teleport and remove abilities are barely used in this game, making you wonder "whats the point of having this?". In the end, you only use the teleport ability for travel conveniences rather than to get past obstacles like how it was originally introduced to you. Remove ability is pretty much dead in the game, there's no point of having it.\n\nI'm quite ok with the monsters but other people may have issues with them. The demons need more variety. There are only 2 types of monsters that get in your way and it's those same 2 from beginning to end. Their availability in the game are very rare and illogical - you don't see them in the open map and only during story related quests.\n\nThe investigation/clues - some answers are stupid and doesn't fit well in what you are observing, others are so obvious. As mentioned before, the important clues are in your face and you're forced to use them as your evidence. You won't be able to proceed unless you use those set pieces.\n\nThe AI ... at first, you think it's cool but as you play on and interact with the non-quest related AI, it all becomes repetitive. They all say the same things and they don't react when you use poltergeist... they're there for decoration and nothing more.","June 9, 2014","false","8.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, some players has been following this game from E3 2013 and has been building up alot of anticipations and pre-release hype. Based on the original concepts, authentic setttings and unique mechanics, this game definitely delivers.\n\nIn this epic detective meets criminal adventure heavily inspired by the likes of L.A. Noire and Alan Wake players takes the role of detective Ronan O'Connor who happens to find himself being killed by the mysterious 'bell killer'. He then not only find himself dead in the real world but simultaneous alive in another dimension like the movie 'ghost'. Determined to find out who the killer was, Ronan embarked on a endless investigation to solve the mysteries behind his death and discover the dark secret behind Salem's ancient history of witchcraft.\n\nBy playing as a ghost, you gain awesome abilities such as no clipping through walls, possessing people, poltergeist electronic devices to attract attentions, and if these aren't enough you can possess a cat and go 'meow'.\n\nBy poeessing common folks around the town, you are given the options mind read their thoughts. However, most of the things they say provide little to no useful information at all which makes it pointless at any point of the game. Some NPCs such as police officers will allow player to obtain useful clues regarding the cases often by means of eavesdropping, peeking through their eyes and influence their decision making.\n\nBy possessing the cat, you gain access to platforming sections of the game which often will help you to get to a upper level.\n\nThe detective elements of the game was not as good as L.A Noire, investigation can help you gather clues and the amount of clues needed for each case was given to players. Interrogation can only be done on other ghosts and it involves picking from limited options and are way too easy most of the time it is just common sense. With enough clues gathered, players can conclude the current investigation by chossing pieces of important information. Players are given 3 chances and even if you selcted the incorrect choices, the game will give you infinite tries leading to eventually picking out the correct information by trials and error.This idiotically defeats the purpose of giving 3 tries and has way too much hand holding throughout the story. Whereas, in L.A noire inability to solve crimes often can have consequences and investigation cannot be done again once it is concluded.\n\nThe combat is however interesting as player gain ability to see demons through walls to allow advanced planning of strategies and make decisions to whether encounter or avoid. Most of the battle requires player to teleport between human remain souls to get behind the demons to perform execution called 'exorcism'. However, the game has only one enemy type and every encounter feels the same and after a while it gets repetitive.\n\nThe environment is also quite boring with little open world elements, no interactive NPCs, and bland design choices that players often just walking around for collectibles, side cases or towards the next objective. Speaking of side quests and collectibles. It can be a real chore as the game has little replay value so you gasically back tracking for the sake of it. There are no incentives or rewards for doing it apart from some achievements for completing a side case or a set of collections.\n\nCharacters have little personality development throughout the game, most of the time I find it hard to relate to most of them. If the story wasn't decent enough to make me continue playing I just cannot think of much selling point in this game.\n\nTechniquelly, there has been occassional frame rate drop issues and stuttering problems which is annoying but still playable. When booting up the game for the first time, the screen also flickers a few times but I won't rate a game based on these minor issues as it can be simply fixed with a update or two.\n\nIs this a good game?\nI think overall, yes it is a good game if you like story driven adventure that doesn't involve all out shooting and straightout combat. Its appeal really comes from a real life location and interesting depiction of Salem's ancient history and traditions with a unique play style, it can be really appreciative. If you can ignore the problems present and look at the good side of things plus the price they are asking for, I would say it is worth a try.\n\nFinal verdict\nMurdered: soul suspect is far from perfect or a masterpiece if you compare it to similar games such as L.A noire and Alan Wake. But it borrows what is good from both titles and add its own twists which some think it is good and some simply may not like it.\n\nFinally, I think it is one of those game that should be played but just don't expect 100% perfection and a fully immersive world and rather expect a rough around the edges unque title to try in 2014.\n\n7/10","June 9, 2014","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can typically think up answers with one clue, but have to find a dozen arbitrary things - mostly irrelevant - before you can progress.\n\nSlow, no replay value, and definitely not worth the money.","June 24, 2014","false","5.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Gathering clues and evidence is neat.  The game's mechanic for putting those clues and evidence together for a solution is terrible.  When it's not the most obvious puzzle ever, it's a complete guess and luck.  The action sequences are not terrible.  They simply aren't fun.

Easy answer: This game isn't a total desaster, but it is not worth its full price.\n\nThe gaming magazines criticize its length, its combat system (btw there is no combat system ... you more or less only hide from the few enemies) and absolutly no replay value. These three things I can confirm.\n\nIt is also annoying, that while the main characters are very detailed, everyone else looks way worse and there is nearly nothing to do beside the 'main' quest.\n\nBut that main quest is the thing, that keeps you nonstop playing till the end.

Not the case at all. While the puzzling is not brain taxing in the slightest, the story is interesting and the setting can be almost beautiful in places. There is no horror to be found, unless you found Peter Jackson's Frighteners scary.

I was so bored... soooo bored. I did not expect another LA NOIRE but c'mon.. the best part was the intro video. It does have a very good story with interesting characters but it is so dull when you play it.\n\nIt is sort of like this. You get into a location where you run around and picking up some totally useless things for revealing some sidestories which are interesting (some of them) but after picking up 5(/10/25) whatever they want (saw/papers/photographs) you go "OMG just give me the achievment and let me go". And the game starts telling you the whole sidestory while looking at some picture or something similiarily cheap.\n\nSome weird ♥♥♥♥ in the location where you run around belongs to the main story. But the point is same. You runnin around like an idiot and then go "HA! it wants me to push E" then you push E and then continue to run around. Then it asks you some totally dumb question and you got to connect some clues which would be interesting if the game would punish you for a wrong choice... You picked the wrong clue? Nevermind.. Pick another! So you can just click around cause it doesnt matter and answering questions like "Why did she go to church?" with an answer "I think she did go to the church" summs up the dullness of the "detective mechanics".\n\nOverall Murdered Soul Suspect looks like a game by someone who knows what makes a good game but doesnt know how to put it into his game. I can imagine somebody can get into this game and actually like it but I was so bored after 2 hours playing it.","April 4, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/recommended/233290/","RPINerd","RPINerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/","470 products in account","Murdered: Soul Suspect was easily the biggest surprise of 2015 for me, and I think the last game that really blew away my expectations to the same extent was the psychologically assaulting trek through the sands of Spec Ops: The Line. Now of course that comparison gives Soul Suspect a lot more credit than it deserves, it’s a far from perfect game and certainly won’t be looked back on as a game design milestone. But while I expected a more or less point and click hidden object game with fancy 3D graphics and bizarrely contrived QTE’s, what I got was a decent story entwined in a fascinating and well fleshed out word with fantastic mechanics to handle action sequences.\n\nHonestly, yes. If I had to boil this game down into a single genre I would have to go with a point and click adventure. The main backbone of the game is walking from crime scene to crime scene and pressing X when you spot a clue. There is certainly nothing revolutionary about the mechanic but the content of the clues- and to a much larger extent the collectibles- brings to light a remarkably well imagined world. Now I’m not well versed in the history of Salem and the details of the witch trials, but I think the writers put in a good amount of creative effort bringing an engaging fictional story into a very real place and time. Typically the little factoids littered around the game world only appeal to completionist minded individuals like myself, however I found myself on a multitude of occasions scouring the town for that last entry to figure out the end of a story.\n\nThe visuals of the game are adequate, nothing that I didn’t expect after looking at 2 or 3 screenshots. I was able to run the game mostly maxed out on my 680 and the framerate was stable and consistent.\n\nHere is the thing that made the game for me: the “final boss”. Don’t worry I will not spoil a thing, and it was actually the absence of something which made it utterly refreshing and a huge relief. Aside from a handful of action-y stealth segments with demons, the game is slow and narrative driven. As I felt the story come closer and closer to a close I got this feeling of dread. You see I know how AAA games go nowadays, every fiber of my being was expecting this dreadful quick time event unfair boss fight that has no continuity with the entire rest of the game. I was even tempted to not finish the game myself and watch the ending online because I didn’t want to walk away from such a great experience with a terrible taste in my mouth. Yet the developers NAILED it. No it’s not a spectacle and no it’s not brutally difficult, but it was satisfying and conclusive to the narrative. The amount of relief I felt at the ending was overwhelming.\n\nI’ve harped a lot on a very little point of the game, but it was a big reason this game left me with such a positive view of it. Murdered: Soul Suspect is not perfect but it’s a breath of fresh air for narrative centric games and it kept me engaged and entertained the whole way through.","April 26, 2015","true","12.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Better story, better mechanics, better gameplay, better graphics.  The story is probably the best part. It wasn't too obvious and had a lot twists and turns to it. That being said it does have some glaring flaws.  Some of the gameplay is fun for a while but the problem I found is that you begin with almost all the powers you will have at the end. This leaves no room for a feeling of character progression and development. It has some buggy mechanics such as having to stand at the exact right spot to interact with certain things. The graphics seem very last gen. I also HATE the stupid demon killing thing. It's very repetitive and an all round pain in the ♥♥♥ to have to take them out. Negatives aside, I wouldn't say the game was terrible. If you enjoy story based games, in particular, ghost/horror/noir based games. You may enjoy those aspects enough to warrant you buying it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThiefZero/recommended/233290/","ThiefZero","ThiefZero`","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThiefZero/","95 products in account","Having seen footage of the very first part of the game, I was curious about the story. The characters and detective esque gameplay seemed interesting. So, I purchased the game and have only just finished it. The game is about a detective who has to find the mystery behind his own murder. This game was played with a 360 controller.\n\nLots of text following, so:\ntldr; amazing cat simulator, 10/10\nserious tldr; Only buy if you are interested in the story only and not in it as a game. And only then when it is on sale.\n\nnumbers tldr;\nGameplay      [3/10] - not much of it\nWorld            [2/10] - felt empty\nStory             [6.7/10] - not as exciting or interesting as I hoped, but still good. Narrated short side stories were very entertaining, and eerie.\nGraphics        [6/10] - adequate\nSound            [5/10] - nothing noteworthy or memorable, but adequate\nVoice Acting   [6.7/10] - mixed feelings, bland NPCs are bland, main characters are quite okay.\n\nYou can move freely as a ghost, passing through real world objects such as walls. The design here is quite well done, clipping through objects felt quite natural in this game and definitely was an interesting experience. You grow quite quickly accustomed by it, and by the time you do the novelty of it does wear off as fast (atleast it did for me). Even though you can pass through some objects, ghostly objects and certain walls still limit you. More and more as you progress through the game, making it feel like any other regular game.\n\nGameplay wise, throughout the story you encounter different "crime" scenes and are left to examine it. This involves some looking around, and depending on how many of the clues you want to find and how adept you are at it, it could take 5 to 10 minutes. It does not involve more than walking around the crime scene and pressing X to interact with an object. Sometimes,  the game wants you to be slightly more involved by asking you to, for example, select which of 3 objects matches the sound being played. More often than not, the sound and belonging object combination were quite far fetched in my opinion.  Another type of clue is when you "reveal" a memory of the scene. You get to see a person and need to select out of a bunch of choices what the person was doing or experiencing, again a selection of 3 to be made.\nWhen you have collected enough clues, you can "solve" the scene by combining the most relevant clues to mystery at that time (such as: "What was person X doing here?"). For each of these elements, the player has 3 tries to get it right. When the player fails within those 3 tries, I believe it doesn't quite matter and the counter stays at 1. I'm not sure of this, since I've at most only had it happen to me once in the beginning of the game.\n\nThe player moves from scene to scene through the town of Salem, which is filled with bland NPCs. You have the option to possess them and read their thoughts, which more often than not are only 2 of. Once you listen to a thought, you can't quit it either, and have to wait for the voice to finish talking. Other options the player rarely has when possessing an NPC is to "Influence" their thoughts (pick the most likely clue out of a bunch to try help the person remember something useful) or to "Peek" meaning watch through their perspective to see what they see. These are only ever useful with NPCs at a scene, not random NPCs spread throughout town (whom, by the way, all look similair and mostly have the exact same thoughts). You can sometimes hear them converse with eachother, which is a nice element to the game to give it a bit more depth and make it seem more alive, but it is not far enough to stop the NPCs and the town of Salem feel bland and empty.\n\nOther actions the player can use as a ghost is "Reveal" (hold R to reveal a ghostly object), "Remove" (hold R to remove a ghostly object) and "Teleport" (hold LB and release to teleport at an aimed location).\n\nIn a nutshell, the actions the player has available to him are very limited and do not add much to a gameplay perspective value.\n\nTo try and make the game more exciting (dare I say challenging?) they have added two enemies to the game: demons and a pool of demon grasping hands. When you walk over the second one it grabs you and you need to press a random direction combined with a button to get out. Once you figure this out it succesfully into like any other wall you can't pass through. Demons patrol certain areas, once they see you they try to suck your soul which means game over. You need to avoid being seen by them, meaning hiding in certain "Ghost residue" or simply behind walls. You can sneak up on them from behind and execute them by, again, pressing a given direction and button. Bland. Annoying. Nothing more than a nuisance.\n\nI believe we've arrived at the final gameplay element, which is the cat. Yes, you can take over the cat and move around for some basic platforming action thing. If one could even call it that, as you're basically still just walk around, except sometimes with a jumping or climbing animation.\n\nThe most interesting thing for me were the short narrated ghost stories, which could be unlocked by collecting a bunch of objects. The problem with this though, was that you had to actively search around to try and find the objects, sometimes 14 of them. And you needed all of them. Got 13 and can't find the last one? Too bad, you get nothing. I would have really liked it if the developers had changed it so that you only needed to find half of them, because a game such as this that only has the story going on for it would do well to cater the only players still playing by giving them these greatly narrated short stories.\n\nThe characters in the game were alright, there's a bit of character progression going on and you learn the relationships between them. The main character is enjoyable to get to know, and thinks and behaves like a real person. It was good enough to keep me interested.\n\nThe game can be finished within a day's playtime if you want. I've got about 12 hours on it including afk time and searching for most of the side clues.\n\nIf you enjoy the story, I recommend just watching a playthrough on YouTube or something and skipping through boring parts. I can only recommend the purchase of this game if you are truly interested in the concept of it and would like to see more (better!) of it by supporting the developers, and even then only on a heavy sale. €40,- for a game as this is severely overpriced, unfortunately.","June 23, 2014","false","12.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't even mind if the graphics are bad, as long as the gameplay works and the plotline keeps me interested.\n\nWhen the game started I thought it seemed alright. The whole ghost detective trying to solve his own murder wasn't a bad idea and had quite some potential.\n\nWoe is me now, having paid 40 euros for something that lasted for 17 hours, and only so long because I kept on exploring the extremely limited environments that seem to be a trademark of Squaresoft's games these days. The player is guided by both arms like a blind and handicapped elderly through the mediocre and predictable story. God forbid anyone who pays good money for the game should have to think for themselves.\n\nAnd it's not just that. The whole game was more like getting from one lengthy cutscene to another. The only times you can screw up or die is when "battling" demons, and by battling I, of course, mean pressing two keys that show up on the screen in the correct order when close to a demon.\n\nHow exciting.\n\nThere was really only one thing I enjoyed in this game, and that was the first time I got to possess a cat. The cat's animations were done nicely and it was a fun idea. But really - not worth 40 euros. Another thing that was "ok" was the lead male's voice acting. It was not great, but it didn't get on my nerves either.\n\nAt some point you gain an ability that made me think I might be able to roam the map more freely, but again I was to be disappointed.

The gameplay typically involves wandering a room/area and picking up 16/16 random glowing points, for each you'll get a mostly uninteresting sentence to read "A police report.  Witness says the killer was wearing a hat.".  Then he'll come to a conclusion to move you to the next scene.  The dialogue is also typically very uninteresting.  You can read NPCs thoughts which should be cool, but each NPC has 2 useless dialogues, and they share the same dialogue with the other NPCs.  "It's so cold outside" "I don't feel safe with a killer on the loose" etc.  And everyone else who has unique dialogue is some kind of secret psychotic serial killer.  The demons are getting annoying.  My favorite part was a bit where you can "posess" and become a cat to access an area you otherwise couldn't.  The main character's backstory was interesting, but just poor implementation so far.  I'll probably push through and finish it, but I'm disappointed.","May 5, 2015","false","13.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

But every bit of this review is constructive criticism.\n\nFirst three areas explored in:\n\nI am already offended by this game for its lack of social construction. This game's dialogue seems to have bits and pieces of an idea together but are poorly sewn together. If you are a private investigator or an FBI profiler you will be saddened by this game. For the dialogue choices seem to route you to the same answer, but are shallow in complete thought. I get the idea behind this game being the main story line but my problem with this game so far is not your maneuverability, or lack of direction. But more or so to the approach this game takes when it comes to solving the cases. It seems like the person who created this plot forgot that detectives constantly talk to themselves while piecing together a story. Though to be fair it says in the text right there what it wants you to do. But it should be stated by the detective to help people figure out what is going on. The text floating around as you try to piece things together will throw you off guard as soon as a change of course happens within the solving of each small puzzle.\n\nWhile trying to figure out one thing it suddenly switches... but our friend the detective doesn't say much and it quickly moves on to the next thing. So you miss what the text changed to, telling you what you are supposed to look for now, at that very split second given moment and you guess wrong. Worst of all is the clunky UI. You mess something up it freezes you... pauses.... backs out.... brings up several different separate tab screens for each object which suddenly takes away the purpose for searching it, (which is why I say again it would help if the detective was constantly talking to himself in thought to keep the main point in focus.) And quite frankly leaves me bewildered at what happens when you "try again."\n\nMaybe the approach to this method should have used better sorting options.... Throwing things around all the time makes me think this detective never carried around so much as a book. Possibly carried around a recording device seeing how disorderly everything being displayed becomes.\n\nJust imagine that every time you came up with the idea behind a string of events you got angered, and suddenly threw up all the information you just looked at in frustration... only to come right back to it, to string everything together again, as all the papers fall to the ground and you have this game. I think the creator... if he is or was a detective... must have had little to no patience himself in each case. Possibly due to extra ordinary means like time or money allotted to his investigations. Maybe a sergeant or person's interest was a timely manner. I am still willing to give this a second try but it is so demanding on your eyes, more or so than your brain, that it causes you to lose concentration quite easily.\n\nAnd the demons? My goodness. Talk about an annoying trap puzzle that springs up like a jack in the box that malfunctions a lot. I get the idea behind exorcising ghosts... but uh.... how does our detective friend just suddenly know how to exorcise a ghost exactly? Was our friend the detective a priest? There is no mention of him being one in his own background... But just barely minutes into the game, you have the ability to exorcise a ghost without having to read any books about it. I think this game would have been a lot more interesting with the setup it seemed to hold. In which I think the Detective originally did not know how to exorcise ghosts until later in the game. But I guess the devs thought it would be too annoying to make players fear them so early. Yet it would have been a lot more fun and made more sense if the ability wasn't there until you figured it out.\n\nThis game seems to be targeted at kids more or so than adults seeing how there are some "way too soft" spots that spring up like a bad smell. You will literally yell at our detective to "JUST GRAB HER F***ING ARM!" When it comes to solving one of the cases. I want to slap the detective for being so.... retentively sympathetic, yet wise cracking at certain times.\n\nAlso the girl? Best idea ever when it comes to surprising your audience when you finally meet her for the first time. But there was one inconsistency that happened at the cemetery... She complained about not being able to see him... even though she was holding a flashlight... Then a few minutes later she has no trouble seeing them. Could have been the lamp post nearby but uh.... She did shine a flashlight on him.\n\n\nLast three bits:\n\nAm I ever more disappointed in a game? This game answered that question. Incredibly short game. I am sad. I am so sad after completing this game.\n\nThe best puzzle is the ending.\n\nI think the issue is that the development team behind this had an astonishingly awesome idea.... but I think budget cuts really let this game down. This game had some real potential but it is so short lived. The ending seems to be pasted together. But at least it did create one hell of a mind ♥♥♥♥. It is just too bad the whole time you believe one thing because of your own abilities... and then there is another. What the hell.\n\nToo short. Way too short. My final complaint? Some of the "side missions" are broken.\n\nThis game should be twitch viewed only.","May 22, 2015","false","7.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

It's not bad as some of the review sites out there might want you to believe. It's and adventure game, think LA Noire without the action and driving. It's a slower paced game where you'll have to look around for clues to solve puzzles to move to the next area, so if you're looking for an action FPS or something like that, it probably won't be for you. It's a good looking game with better graphics than watchdogs that I picked up last week, and has alot of graphics settings to play with, runs smooth on ultra/high on my HD 7870, although the frames per second seem to be locked to 30. I'd give it a 7 out of ten, it is kind of pricey though for what it is, but would definitely reccomend it at say $25.","June 3, 2014","true","10.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The investigations are sensible 50% of the time - the other half just felt I was wrong becuase the scriptwriter went for a really surreal story. Finally, the ending... well, I don't wish to spoil things, but what a cop out.\n\nOn the gameplay side of things... someone decided that to build tension they need to throw in demons into the mix (either in the form of demonic "pools" on the ground or "sentries" that patrol the area). Suffice it to say it doesn't build tension, but it does slow the pace even more, and is purely annoying. Oh, and speaking of the pace - I really wish the character could make a like a ghost and move faster. Getting anywhere is a pain.\n\nPS. The game is also buggy.

Well the problem is that the game is ultimately short and, frankly, boring - there is nothing to do outside of the main quest aside from FOUR side-quests and a bunch of collectables no one really cares about; the use of ghost walls, while a good concept, are only present to hide how small the environment is; and the biggest problem? This game is far too easy. It has a points system depending on how well you solve the crimes, but this doesn't actually have any impact whatsoever, and there is no penalty for making a wrong judgement, sure you lose a point but even after you lose them all you can keep on guessing. Oh and this game can be painfully short, if you're good at it you can complete in under 4 hours (or if you want to speedrun and miss the cutscenes - the story is the best part of the game, mind you - you can complete it in about 2). So yes, Murdered is an OK game, but it's one that will be played once and probably be forgotten about soon after playing it.

The bright blue thumbs up or red thumbs down is the first thing people see and it is criminal that I'm forced to open my opinion with either a blatant recommendation or condemnation, as it is often never that simple. Murdered: Soul Suspect is one of those games that I feel very ambivalent towards. It gets a thumbs down though for reasons I'll gladly expound upon here but I'll start by saying that If you do want to buy this game, go ahead, but do it at a discount as there isn't enough of it to warrant its full price by a long shot.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect is a supernatural intrigue game where you play as Ronan O'Connor, gangland warrior turned detective and wandering samurai warrior, who is tracking a mysterious serial killer. Ronan is about apprehend the killer in the opening cutscene when the killer decides he's had enough of the law and reenacts the opening scene from Watchmen all over Ronan's face before shooting him seven times in the chest. So Ronan is dead, but you knew that already. Ronan now has to endeavor to do in one night what the entire police force couldn't do in years worth of time and solve the case of the Bell Killer. M:SS reminds me of two very specific games I actually liked, the first of which is Alan Wake. Like Alan Wake, this game is about supernatural dealings with a distinctly traditional American feel. Also like AW, the rules for the supernatural stuff in this game are very well defined.\n\nThe supernatural lore being dealt with this time is ghosts, exploring all the traditional facets of what you might think ghosts are like, but before you go hog wild there is an exception to each of your abilities. You can pass through walls but not consecrated or ethereal walls, which mark the level boundaries. You can jumble electronics, but not to any meaningful degree. You can possess people but not control their actions. You can teleport, but not over demon holes so you still have to circumvent those on foot. Also like in Alan Wake, there isn't a whole lot to do in between plot points except hunt for collectibles. This leads me into the real issue I had with this game: its design.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect is a game of extra steps. I kept a running list of things the game took more than one step to complete without needing to: Often the game will end a cutscene just to have you press the interact button to continue the same cutscene. When questioning a suspect, you have to press a button for each option you want to explore but the interrogation doesn't end until all options are explored, so it might as well be one long cutscene. You can read the minds of people you possess but each person has exactly two things to say and you have to press the button twice to hear both things when they could just say them both at once. When piecing together the clues of an investigation, if you pick a wrong option you get booted from the screen, having to reenter the screen to continue. When grabbing collectibles, you have to reveal the object first before picking it up. The collectibles are half hidden but the game tells you where they are so there's no need for hiding them. Speaking of collectibles, there are a plethora of them, all of which have very little to no bearing on the actual game. Each area has a unique object that, once all are gathered, will unlock  a spooky campfire story unrelated to what you are doing. There are a series of over arching collectibles including diary pages from Ronan's dead wife (really the only means of character development), handy info blurbs copy-pasted from the Salem tourism comity website, and newspaper clippings reminding you how creepy and invincible the serial killer is.\n\nWhile Alan Wake also felt the need to boldly announce the appearance of an enemy so that there is no way for you to be caught off guard, at least it had engaging combat. Every once in a while the game breaks up the monotony by presenting you with enemies to sneak up behind and quick-time-event to death. Once or twice a level, there will be demons that half-heatedly wander around in an enclosed area. You have to hide in the hiding spot and wait for the monster to turn around so you can slowly walk up behind it and kill it. This ends up being tedious and non-threatening, unit you mess up. If you manage to not properly dispatch your spectral foe, the backlash is absurd. Demons will kill you within a 3-5 second window unless you can scurry back to a hiding spot. However, once detected, the demons can see you in hiding spots; forcing you to shift between them as fast and erratically as possible until they give up. This turns what little combat there is into a game of Red Light, Green Light. These sections make no sense to the lore of the game either as there is no reason given as to why Ronan seems to be the only ghost that can dispatch the demons. No introduction is given to the power nor is it explained that Ronan is the only one capable of it, leading me to wonder why the other ghosts all flee in terror when the demons show up.\n\nThe second game I'm reminded of is L.A. Noire, because the investigation sections are reminiscent of the ones in that game. You have to walk around the crime scene and collect the clues, using them to piece together the motive of the criminal. There are six to fourteen clues per scene but only three of them at most are ever necessary to continue. It's no secret that detective work is not as flashy or intriguing as it is portrayed in popular culture, but no where is this more obvious than video games. L.A. Noire had a good mix of action and detective work, due (I think) to it's structure. All the clues were relevant because solving the case was the goal of the mission and everything unfolded naturally. Murdered, by contrast, has you investigating glaringly obvious crime scenes which, more often than not, inform you of something you already knew. For example, one crime scene later on in the game has you investigating a room full of people the Bell Killer murdered all at once. At the point of investigation, however, you have already been made aware of what the killer did afterword, so the reason for killing the room full of people is obvious. Then, once you investigate the room, Ronan stands there and tells the the reason the killer did it, even though you already knew. Really the investigating is just being a master of the obvious. It's also impossible to fail to find all of the clues, because the game tells you how many are present in the scene.\n\nMurdered, like many games these days, would have probably made a better book or movie. The game play really just consists of different kinds of walking around and looking at things. Despite being a game made by an established developer and publisher, this is something any indie dev could have made, if not made look quite as good. In the end, games are meant to be interactive; that is what the medium excels at. Yet more and more it seems like games are being made with interactivity at the bottom of their priority list. Once during the middle of a cutscene I caught my self replying to text messages. It was then I realized how bored I was with the game; how absolutely unengaged I felt. The story was really not all that bad but being set in Salem, you can bet with reliability that it will have to do with what Salem is famous for. I would rather them have just made a movie out of it and cut out the game play entirely. At least then it would have taken me only 120 minutes to get through.","December 29, 2014","false","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

It's more of an interactive story/movie with movement, It has a very interesting premise, but in my opinion it failed to deliver on that punch which it desperately needed and strived for.\n\nFor the "gameplay" mechanics, you basically find crime scenes, try to find and examine every object, then have infinite tries to choosing the correct ones that apply to move the story along. Sometimes this involves influencing people by possessing them, but that's only during scripted moments and does nothing useful when you possess the NPCs walking around the world. It's the same when you "poltergeist" an object (turn it on/mess it up for a few seconds). Lifeless NPCs will not react unless it's a scripted moment for the story.\n\nThere are enemies in the game, demons, and you can walk behind them and try your hand at a randomized QTE where you'll have to press one button from WASD and use the left or right click to destroy the demon. If you fail, which you will due to the poor controls of this, then you'll have to jump into ghost fragments around the level to avoid getting your soul sucked until the demon gives up. This is all of the "action" in the story and it's more of a waste of time than anything. There is no boss fight or no real reason for destroying demons. Their AI is on a predetermined route and they're just an inconvenience for scouring a level for the collectible items.\n\nEach area has a different amount of collectibles. These unlock urban legend/ghost stories that are just a picture and a person monologuing. That's really it for the entire game's mechanics outside of possessing a cat and following a predetermined route with no real obstacles/puzzles. There's literally nothing interesting to do in this game beyond solving the main storyline with its pre-determined deductivity.\n\nAll in all, I can't recommend this as a game. If you're looking for the great supernatural mystery thriller of our time this is far from that. But if you're looking to chance it for a story that you may (or may not) enjoy and you're willing to overlook about 8 hours of lacking gameplay, this one on the cheap might fit that bill. Treat it more like an average-grade movie than a game.","January 2, 2015","false","8.7"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","4"

Playing as Ronan O'Connor  you piece together clues and evidence to find his killer . With just the right amount of skill for anyone to keep the story moving along.Great voice overs and dialogue that had me smiling and laughing at times.If you like to find hidden objects there are 247 total artifacts to find if that's something you'd be interested in .Having missed 3 artifacts I proceeded to the final chapter and couldn't go back. So unfortunately I will have to do a second play through to get the game to 100% .

In Murdered Soul Suspect you play as Ronan o connor. Salem is haunted by a serial killer named the Bell killer. One day Ronan Finds the trail of the bell killer but gets killed in the process. Ronan returns as a ghost but hes unable to move on until he finds out who killed him. In the proccess he meets Jane who the killer is trying to hunt down. So its youre job to protect her from the killer while trying to find out who killed you. So how is Murdered ? Its actually a great game. The best way i could put it would be a supernatural LA Noire. The game is essiantly you interogating ghosts and people who can see you know as mediums. The game lets you posses people and cats. Mess with electronics and stuff like that. Theres also fighting segments where you have to fight ghost while trying to aproach them from the back. But if they see you you will have to hide because you cant fight them head on. So now for the pros and cons. The game has a great story and a great twist ending. The game is fun and simple. Great puzzles to solve and tons of collectibles to collect. The cons: the game is kinda glitchy and its also really short. Overall Murdered Soul Suspect is a great game and i suggest you buy it because simply put it its a great game and Airtight Games will be missed. I give Murdered Soul Suspect a 8/10","August 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Pressing 1/3 and Q/E to change tabs is a no-no and shows that it's a port.\n\nFirst off, you don't really do any detective work, I often got the answers to detective questions wrong because I was over thinking and in the end, I sometimes tried multiple times until I got it right.\n\nThe town is simply dull, some NPCs keep walking in the same path, really killing the atmosphere, they also have only two lines of dialogue, which are boring. Since there's no map/minimap, there was one time that I got lost and had to keep running all over the place trying to find my way. The barriers they added to limit the scope of the game are horrible, making the game feel more linear than it should have.\n\nAlso, the combat is simply terrible, you can see they added this part only to make the game lengthier because it's not fun at all.

For a puzzle game, the puzzles are never very engaging, but then again, not a lot of puzzles can be done if the main character can't touch things. Every brain teaser is either 'pick the obvious clue' or 'pick the obvious series of clues'. Sometimes you have to do them in the right order, wow.\n\nThe combat/stealth is practically non-existant. Occasionally demons will jump out accompanied with the sound a piano might make if it were thrown through a window. It shocked me the first time it happened, then never again. You disable them by running up behind them and doing a simple qte. This is made incredibly easy since they cannot see through walls. You, on the other hand, can both see and walk through walls. Dissapointing.\n\nOh, and the many hiding spots in the overworld kept me constantly wondering if I might get jumped at one point. Never happened. Why even have them there?\n\nThe story itself is okay, but it suffers from the protagonist having never even heard of withces before, and he's lived all his damn life in Salem, of all places. Sometimes there are no excuses. And the ending, oh god, the ending was a major dissapointment. It lasted all of 5 minutes and most of that was cutscenes.\n\nThat said, I really enjoyed all the interactions between characters. All the ghosts are kind of one note characters, but the humans were kind of special to me. The way they reacted to your death and subsecuent actions made them seem more real and alive then most other characters I can recall offhand. They all mourn and act in their own way and even though this is not a big game, I can't say that there are any living characters that I disliked.\n\nEnding... uh. Rent it, I guess? At least wait untill it goes down in price. A 10 hour game does not deserve a 40$ price tag. Definitely get it if you really, really like collecting stuff.","June 8, 2014","false","9.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/recommended/233290/","dunetiger","Dune Tiger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/","2220 products in account","MSS is pretty much a PNC adventure game masquerading as a modern cinematic AAA game (which I don't find any better, by the way).  While the game has merit for any adventure game fan, know that the story falls apart and I doubt anyone will be satisfied with it.  So with such a major hook of pnc games not really delivering, what are you left with?\n\nAt its heart, MSS is your typical textbook modern game design, except the main character doesn't carry a gun and you don't run around shooting at pop-up targets.  Instead, you are tasked with investigating your own death, complete with spritely sidekick and canned TWEEST.  This in itself isn't bad as mysteries often need to have at least some sort of turning point and well, being dead kind of demands you have a real-world sidekick to help you out.\n\nHowever, being of modern game design, MSS falls into the trap of checklist design; that is to say, it takes no risks and does pretty much everything by the book.  Exploration?  Check.  Voice actors?  Check.  Cinematics?  Check.  Hidden objects?  Check.  Progessive ability unlocking?  Check, check, check.  None of this bad, really; just saying it brings nothing new to the table.  The worst offender is the checkbox for action - because why would anyone play a game without action in it, right?  Pfft.  From time to time you will be forced to deal with a completely useless and forced section where you sneak around bad guys and try to get rid of 'em (or circumvent them entirely once you're tired of this ♥♥♥♥) because someone in development land has decided that under no circumstance should a game of this type be without an action sequence; problem is, it's stupid and provides nothing to the game other than padding and, of course, a checkbox.  Similarly, you'll be tasked several times to arbitrarily click on multiple clues to proceed through the game and it gets old fast - at least it's thematically sound what with the main character being a detective.  Whatever.\n\nAnyways, as far as fans of PNC games goes, this one isn't that bad.  The game has a runtime of approximately 8 hours, maybe 6.5 if you don't bother looking for all the hidden stuff (which is also pointless, but allows you to do some checklisting yourself).  I wouldn't recommend getting this at full price in any shape or form, but if you get a decent deal on it, say... $10 just to cover some of the production value, then why not give it a run-through?  It's kind of like watching the latest sci-fi space opera film just because you don't often see them being made and not because it's actually really good.  MSS is just a decent effort.\n\ntl;dr: Adventure game fans may enjoy this game on theme alone, but anyone looking for a meaty game experience will find that this offering is leaner than that girl you used to know whose bones could be counted individually when she had her shirt off.  So this remains a (meh) thumbs-up for adventure game fans, but a thumbs-down for anyone else.","August 23, 2014","true","10.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Though after seeing "Square-Enix", I had some clue. (Those guys are the kings of cutscenes, after all.)\n\nThat aside, it's hard to classify this game as much of an action game. It's defeinitely more of a casual one than anything else, and not that long of a game, either. I guess one could also think of it as a kind of roaming adventure game with a few side missions, plenty of collectibles, and plenty of 'Press X to Not Die' moments.\n\nThe investigations in the game involve searching for clues, some of them obtained from thinking a little bit out of the box. Though personally, I'm surprised that weren't any 'match-3' or 'hidden object' puzzles in here. Maybe I'm a bit jaded in that respect. Really not all that hard to deal with.\n\nAs far as action scenes, there aren't that many, and they're generally limited to Quick Time Events with maybe a little bit of strategy involved. Outside of that, there really isn't much that can kill you. Again.\n\nAll in all, it was worth the discount price, though. Square-Enix can weave a decent tale, and the storytelling here was pretty decent, and not quite that predictable. Biggest faults, though, were that the game was too short, and the action rather limited in scope.\n\n","February 15, 2015","false","14.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

What I assume I was supposed to do was use my poltergeist ability on the vacuum to get the priest to walk over the vortex thingy on the floor so I could possess him and safely cross to the other side of the hallway.\n\nAs it turns out, the priest decided to be a bishop, in the sense that he only moved diagonally. He crossed over and clipped into the wall opposite the vacuum cleaner, and when I possessed him he moved diagonally across the vortex, clipped into another wall, and walked in a courtyard where I could not unpossess him.\n\nI tried restarting the checkpoint. I tried letting the priest make a single trip and then using poltergeist on the vacuum a second time before possessing him. I tried starting the game over from the beginning. I tried reinstalling the game. I even tried starting the game from the beginning AFTER reinstalling, but nothing worked.\n\nSo I checked Google for answers, but couldn't find any solutions. That's when I gave up. Even if there is a solution, I refuse to sit through the same unskippable cutscenes for a fourth time in the hopes that maybe I'll be able to get past the second chapter.\n\nIf you're thinking of buying this game, don't. There's an old flash game on Newgrounds called "The Dead Case", which is similar yet vastly superior despite being from 2004.

I don't play games for their 3rd rate stories, I play for the gameplay.\n\nNot to mention that this is just a plain terrible port. 30 FPS cap randomly applies at times, mouse senstitivity has three options. Low, Medium, High. Wow, thanks guys, amazing job. The whole options menu is plain lacking, and the game eats up more performance than it should.\nI also don't appreciate lazy game design. Some guy was haunting a kid after he died, and got  eaten by a demon  and disappeared. When I came back and reloaded the save, I found him in the exact same spot, except that I couldn't talk to him. The little girl's scripted "MOMMY" sequence replayed again. Why does reloading a save cause everything to reset improperly? This game is not worth your time or money.","April 11","false","1.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's not that it's necessarily a bad product, but it's a bad GAME.  Virtually all of the gameplay elements serve to do nothing but force interactivity; they don't really add anything substantial to the product.  There are little forced "stealth" segments, some elements of old school pixel-hunting games, a very Vampire Bloodlines-feeling "open world" hub section, etc.\n\nBut, ultimately, I don't think they add anything to the product, and in most cases actually detract from it.  The plot isn't going to win any awards, but it's competent.  The voice actors are all at worst competent, the art direction is fine, and the setting is kind of fun if you like the supernatural stuff.\n\nThe problem is that this could've been a movie for all the significance of the actual interactive parts have.  That's why I keep referring to it as a product, and not a game.  Because I don't feel like Murdered: Soul Suspect is a game for the same reasons I don't think Gone Home is a game.  Or, rather, because I feel like Murdered is cramming in a bunch of random gameplay elements to make us BELIEVE it's a game... when it's really not.\n\nI would never, ever recommend paying anywhere near full price for this product, but if you can get it for a few bucks on a Steam sale or in a Humble Bundle like I did, it's a decent enough way of using five or six hours of your time.","May 1","false","7.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Unfortunately, the gameplay completely fell flat. The piecing together of clues to solve the crime was laughably simplistic. For example, you'd often need to posses someone to prompt them to think about something. When posed with the question along the lines of "What clue can you use to make them think about the murder?", one of the answers is literally "the murder".\n\nAnd the whole adding in of the demons thing to give it some aspect of stealth combat was irksome; I know they felt they needed to add something in to make it more challenging (since the mystery portion certainly wasn't doing it), but that aspect could have been done away with completely and nothing would have been lost. Less ghost splinter cell and more ghost Sherlock Holmes would have been great.\n\nIt wasn't all bad; the plot was interesting, the graphics were good.

The gameplay itself is not very original and repetitive, but the game stands out due to the excellent presentation and good storytelling.\n\nIn "Murdered: Soul Suspect" the player steps into the role of Ronan O'Connor, a police detective who gets killed right during the intro. In this first cutscene, Ronan sees his dead body and realizes that he has become some kind of spirit (which reminded me of the similar scene in the 1990 movie "Ghost", starring Patrick Swayze). As a new inhabitant of the spirit world he sets out to find his murderer, seemingly some kind of serial killer on the loose targeting women who at first don't seem to have anything in common. Ronan saves Joy, a young medium, from the killers grasp. She is in search for her (also medially gifted) mother. The two start to work together to unravel the mysteries behind the killings.\n\nThe game is set in the small town of Salem, USA. The entire story occurs during one (very long) night. The streets of salem provide the starting point and are also the main "level hub" during the game gaining access to different locations which are unlocked by advancing in the main story line. Allthough story and level design are quite linear, this allows the players to travel back to previous visited places to look for clues or collectables they may have overlooked, giving the game a small whiff of "open world".\nWhile following the main storyline, the player is free to pursue side quest for other ghosts, in other words doing detective work on their "cases" to help them find peace and thus the way into the afterlife.\n\nMost of the time you search for different clues, either physical or mental - Since you are able to slip into the bodies of every human NPC you encounter, you can read their minds to find valuable clues or just spy on their thoughts, which is quite fun most of the time and adds to the atmosphere. When you have enough clues, you can "solve" a crime scene by combining the clues that matter, which I found sometimes confusing and not very logical. Since you can try the combination out as often as you want, try-and-error is always the way to go, making these puzzles somewhat obsolete.\n\nOne of the most fun elements in the game are the few cats throughout, you can possess their bodies to jump and climb into otherwise unreachable areas to open passages or unlock secrets. A feature I could definitely have had more of.\n\nScattered during the different levels are several sets of collectables which, upon completion, each unlock a small, fully voice-narrated ghostly short story.\n\nThere are no time-limited missions, which I found very comforting.\n(Unfortunately, the developers decided to change this in the final battle, see below). The player is always allowed to take hers/his time to inspect the surroundings (with the exception of the recurring hide-and-seek from the demons), giving the opportunity to enjoy the remarkable atmosphere the developers created here.\n\nThe only physical confrontations in the game happen in some scattered events where "demons" show up. These entities are described as former ghosts of humans that were unable to solve their "soul quests", and as a result descended into madness and turned into vile creatures, preying on other spirits. If they spot the player, they rush towards him and attack, resulting in a game over after a few hits. The only way to defeat them is to perform a sneak-attack. To avoid being seen, the player can use one of the variuos "ectoplasmic residues" (some astral, human-shaped clouds that are found all over the game world) to hide inside.\n\nThese sequences work like a stealth game where you approach your enemies from behind and finish them of by a quick keypad-key & mousekey combination that is displayed. I despise quicktime events in general (in my opinion they are the distinctive mark of the lazy game designer), and I found these short "battles" against the demons just annoying. If you hit the wrong button, the attack fails and you have to flee and hide again, while the monster search the hiding spots. Most of the time you hop from one hideout to another, till the demons stop looking for you. This can be quite frustrating if you are in a limited space (like the asylum) and three demons are hunting you simultanously. These sequences often feel random and half-baked, resulting in hectic hopping-around until the enemies let go. In some levels there are spectres of crows placed in certain spots which the player can activate to distract the demons. These are quite helpful, but there are few of them and they are seldomly encountered inside buildings.\n\nWhen I started playing, I was drawn into the eerie atmosphere and loved it. Unfortunately, the feeling vanished the more I approached towards the "final battle" sequence. Without spoiling the story, it is basicly just a longer quicktime event. You have x seconds to find out that you have to push key y, then you have x seconds to do z. Otherwise you lost. I tried to beat the sequence about four times, then I uninstalled the game (yes, I am a wimp!).\n\nThe strength of "Murdered" lies in its strong storytelling and stunning depiction of the spirit world, and if it were not for the uninspired gameplay mechanics, it could be one of my all time favourites. Since steam does'nt have a "thumbs sideways" button, I give it a thumbs down, although it would deserve better.\n\nI recommend it for people who are into "haunted house" stories (It reminded me of movies like "Ghost", Peter Jackson's "The Frighteners" with a pinch of "Se7en" in the mix.), and who are not easily frustrated by quicktime events like me.\n\nPros:\n- great graphics & sound design\n- superb eerie setting\n- interesting main characters\n- some interesting side characters\n- reading minds of NPCs\n- fun with possessing cats\n- some good sidequest-stories\n- small, fully voiced short stories as rewards for  collectable-sidequests\n\n\nCons:\n- game mechanics very simple & repetitive\n- clue investigation just simple searching and puzzle solving by try & error\n- demons annoying\n- final "fight" scene annyoing\n- NPCs barely react to "poltergeisting" at all","November 14, 2014","false","11.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Consistently without failure, they are not hard to defeat they just become annoying and feel like they're just getting in the way. However apart from these few set backs, the story thus far (I'm yet to have finished the game) is very interesting, the murders are gruesome, so serial killer fans will enjoy this game.

It combines crime scene investigations with ghostly manipulation, set tpo the backdrop of a modern day Salem.\n\nFirst and foremost, Ronan (the main character) has easily become one of my favorite protagonists in recent history; here you have a kid raised by the streets who knew nothing but a life of crime until one day he grows up and is offered the chance to turn it all around and make something of himself - thus he ends up joining the force and becoming a detective, though his past still haunts him and his newfound reputation. He's got a tattoo from every major event in his life - the good and the bad - and he totes a massive glock both gifted by and named after his mother. What's not to like?\n\nThe story is pretty straightforward - get killed by bad guy, hunt down and stop bad guy, pass on - but it's all brought together quite nicely. A strong voice cast and shiny graphics go a long way, too; Salem is looking just awesome!\n\nGameplay, as stated earlier, combines crime scene investigations with ghostly manipulation. That last bit probably needs some elaboration though. Basically, you're a ghost. Most buildings will be off limits, though they tie this into the story - being you're in Salem (home to ancient witch hunts), many of the houses have been consecrated long ago. However, open doors or windows are free game. You can also pass through interior walls and doors (so long as they don't lead to the outside world) and a variety of other solid objects. You can also possess people to read their minds or even influence them in certain ways, or manipulate certain objects to attract attention (TVs, radios, even vaccuum cleaners).\n\nAll in all, this title is living up to just about ervery expectation I had for it and then some.","June 18, 2014","true","61.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay in general is wonderful and something I have certainly not seen before in a game. But it's about as easy as putting the kettle on, and apart from a few pesky demons who are out to spill your beloved Earl Grey, there isn't much of a threat or feeling that you will lose, but this may have been a challenge to pull off since you are dead already! The detective side of it all is similar to the wonderful game L.A. Noire but in Murdered: Soul Suspect there isn't as much of a challenge, as you will eventually solve the cases whether you muck it up or not. Having said this I believe it's rather worth a go anyway, as it is jolly good fun! The main story is very well thought out and the whole idea of it is entirely new and I tip my hat off to it for that very reason. I would also say that if the opportunity arises a sequel would be well worth a shot as they could improve on these hiccups and make a spiffing game! All in all I give this 3 and a half cups of tea out of 5 for it's originality, story and the rather spiffing attempt at bringing us something a little different.

The game itself took me about 8 hours to play through and this was including the side quests and collectibles. I felt like the game started off good and had potential, but then the game developers just shrugged, said "good enough!", and threw it on the market.\nThere is almost no replay value and the crime solving aspect of the game, which is what I was really looking forward to, is way too easy.\nTheres only two enemies to you in the game, both of which are very easy to dupe. One you just avoid stepping on, and the other can be executed by a simple click of a designated key board key.\nWish I wouldn't have spent 30 dollars on this game.","June 26, 2014","false","15.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You'll find yourself back tracking alot, sometimes running from one end of the map to the other which gets frustrating as you don't move very fast. The demons are incredibly annoying, after a while each time it's 3 demons in each zone. Consistently without failure, they are not hard to defeat they just become annoying and feel like they're just getting in the way. However apart from these few set backs, the story thus far (I'm yet to have finished the game) is very interesting, the murders are gruesome, so serial killer fans will enjoy this game. Some nice side murder cases to free the other ghosts that linger.\n\nProbably give the game a 6/10 it's such a shame with the whole demon thing. They add virtually nothing interesting to the game.","August 8, 2014","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hairless_Ginger/recommended/233290/","Hairless_Ginger","The_Hairless_Ginger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hairless_Ginger/","265 products in account","firstly i want to highlight that this game has some truly great writting. i mean bioware levels of good writting. the core story of this game is that you play detective Ronan O'Connor who is murdered investigating a serial killler in the twon of Salem. the story follows the detectives journey to discovere the identity and reason for his murder assissting others along the way .\n\nfirst thing i want to say is that this game has a very heavy L.A Noire feel. if you didnt like L.A noire then you wont like this and vice versa if you like it then Murdered: Soul Suspect is the game for you. the core factors of this game are the story and the investigations. being a police officer the investigation skills were always going to play a big part in this game. the first investigation is very basic as to act as a tutorial to the player. the investigations are the primary form of gameplay with the player having to use their initiative to search the scene for clues and piece togethor what has happened. finding the clues themselves is not as simple as you'd think either with some of the investigations requiring a thourough search to find all the pieces of the pouzzle. for example in an investigation in the towns museum i found most of the clues fairly easily but the last clue proved to be a real pain in the ♥♥♥♥.. a painting hidden deep behind a shelf covered with boxes to obscure it, even worse the room was dark and the painting is black. i only managed to find the clue after about 30 minutes of searching and a lot of cursing haha. but even though the game can be a difficult at points it has a great sense of rewarding when you finish an investigation and unlock another piece of the puzzle.\n\nanother asoect that is important in this game is the mechanics, admittadly in a game where that focus's more on makingthe player think than the character being pushed to the limit the mechanics are as expected very solid, basics are obviously solid, running, looking, and interacting with objects are the core of the game but there is a few other core mechanics that are done quite well. as a ghost detective O'Connor has the abillity to interact with otherworldly objects in the town of Salem such as floors, walls, doors, staircases and ramps. this can be a diffficult mechanic to get right as the character is basically adding in game enviroment (i've developed a few games and tried to do this myself its not as easy as it sounds aha) but Square Enix have gotten it right here with a seamless addittion to the enviroment at the instruction of the player opening up new parts of the town. the other mechanic done well is the teleportation mechanic (not a spoiler as you see other ghosts doing this straight off the bat) the teleporting is only short range to avoid you jumping all the way over town in one go. it takes a few seconds to charge up but it comes in handy at points when looking for clues. the only mechanics i take issue with are the possession mechanics. now these work pretty well but its not as well rounded as the other mechanics, it can be a bit difficult to focus on the person you are trying to possess sometimes which made me slightly irritated to be honest.\n\nthe story writting for this game is as i said though VERY well done. what this game is, is essentially an interactive  detective thriller novel. the story plays out just as you'd expect but with some very well placed twists. i guarantee if you play this game you will guess wrong about the identity of the killer. the various games twists are very well placed but none more than the end .. no spoilers .. but it is very well placed and just about the last thing i expected playing this game.\n\nfinaly i shall examine the look of this game. the graphics for this game are very pretty but not overwhelmingly stunning. for the pc it isnt the best i quality i was expecting. it has a more console feel in terms of graphics which isnt really a bad thing. it doesn't do anything to damage the feel of the game as it still looks very good, the cinematics are nicely done keeping a similair graphical level to the game itself which i think works better for the way the game transitions from cut scene to actual gameplay. i would love to see this game with a more beautiful asthetic look to enhance aspects such as the moving through wiast high objects or to make Detective O'Connor himself maybe a bit easier on the eye.\n\nin short i very much reccomend this game if you are looking for a good story and to make yourself think a bit more than the usual game. the story will engross you while the investigations and the twists will keep you guessing until the game is ready to reward you with answers. there is also a hint of sarcy dry humour that i liked from Ronan which i think makes him more likeable but you can make your own mind up about that. i reccomend this game as a solid 8/10 .. its very good but not flawless and i doubt you will regret giving it a play","August 8,

It's more like a barely interactive movie. The gameplay is nearly non-existent, besides the 3000 quicktime and other single-button-press events. You get cool powers like "Reveal" and "Remove" but are never given the opportunity to use them for anything other than the aforementioned single press events. I was waiting for the puzzle where you have to combine your powers in some clever way. But unfortunately, that never happens. There is not a single puzzle in the entire game where you actually have to use your brain.\n\nThe only positive is that the story is actually pretty good. I was engaged enough that I really did want to find out who the killer was. And the history parts of it were pretty entertaining yet educational.\n\nIt's unfortunate that the rest of the "game" is so poor and lacking any sort of polish whatsoever. For example, when you walk near an NPC, they have one voice. Then you possess them and read their mind, they have a totally different voice. Very jarring. Not to mention the incredible amount of voiceover repetition amongst all NPCs. Another issue is trying to target objects and enemies is often a frustrating mess. Walking up to an enemy, seeing the prompt to "attack", and then having it suddenly disappear causing you to die is maddening beyond belief. It's made worse only by the fact that it happens so often. The targetting is really, really off in this game. These are small issues, but I bring them up as 100% undeniable proof the game is filled with small details like this that really show a lack of polish, and probably indicate the greater motivation (or lack thereof) to make this game truly shine. As with many things, the devil is in in the details, pun intended.\n\nDo yourself a favor and watch a YouTube video of this game being played in action so you see how the gameplay really is. And for Pete's sake, absolutely do not buy this at full price. Wait for a Steam Sale. I got it for $5.50 via GMG coupon, so the disappointment isn't too harsh for the price I paid. It's unfortunate because the story was actually enjoyable. The story deserves to be told by a greater game.\n\nYou want a much better mystery game? Try The Vanishing of Ethan Carter. The UI, voice acting, ambience, and even graphics, are light years ahead of this game.

The game is heavily based off of finding clues, reading minds, and peacing together unsolved puzzles. What makes the game not what it should be is the combat system, it shouldnt be there. The only enemy you face the whole game is Demons. How to kill a demon is incredibley simple and very tedious, you walk up behind it and hold RT (if using an xbox controller) and then a quick time event pops up where you have to move the directional stick in a combination with a button. The demons only appear at certain points during the game and i always dreaded fighting them. They arent very scary but rely heavily on jump scares so you will accasionally get caught off gaurd and get spooked. The combat in this game feels like a very "last minute thing" that the Devs were forced to implement. They are essentially cheap game lengtheners that take you away from the story, forcing you to spend 10 minutes on some idiotic sneak/quicktime minigame. The game would have been SO much better without the tedious demon encounters. Other than that, the game is very enjoyable and the story is above average and makes you feel sympathy toward certain characters. Playing this game kinda felt like watching an episode of scooby doo because once you think youve found out what is going on, it turns out to be completely different.","February 22, 2015","false","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","1"

Fox’s The Frighteners than anything scary. no jump scares, but you’re on edge at times due to the awesome soundtrack the game has.\n\ncaveat emptor (buyer beware): there’s a HUGE problem with this game, it won’t launch :(\n\n1.\nturn off, exit out of any recording software. i use DXtory. for me i normally use this to find out what my frame rate is more than any actual recording. i’ve found that with this game, while DXtory is running will crash on start up.\nit’s a minor thing to over look, so if you’re having trouble and running any software which records, and/or shows your frame rate then try playing with out it to see if it is a conflict. even if it isn’t, you’ve eliminated one possibility of what might be wrong.\n\n2.\ncreate a shortcut for Murdered Soul Suspect .exe\nhowever, don’t right-chick and ask Steam to make you one. for some odd reason my computer see’s the shortcut as a web url and won’t let me do what i will mention next.\nso file location is Murdered Soul Suspect / Binaries/Win64/Murdered.exe\nright-click > create shortcut > drag/drop shortcut on desktop > right-click it > properties > shortcut tab > find target:, and the end of the “text” press space, add, and type -dx9\nthis should get the game up and running. it runs perfectly fine, only you don’t get to use Steam overlay or get any notifications or achievements pop up. you still get them, along with the Steam trading cards for the game but you won’t see anything pop up on screen.\n\n3..\nlets fix this game shall we?\nat the time of writing, this game seems to have a problem running with a certain DirectX file.\ni went to the following locations on my computer, Windows/System32 & Windows/SysWOW64. my latest d3dx9_xx file (again, at the time of writing) is, or was d3dx9_43. i deleted this file from both the locations listed and downloaded, and updated/installed the latest dx from the web installer.\nSteam was closed while doing this so i would suggest doing that, then a restart of your computer.\n\nthis has done it for me. now everyone has different setups so one solution won’t solve them all. don’t be fooled into downloading some third party programs like some are suggesting. the first solution i found i totally overlooked. perhaps you have too, or perhaps you haven’t.\nsome people don’t regularly update their graphics drivers, some people don’t even have the recommend hardware. i do, and yet i still ran into problems.\n\n*also find the FateSystemSettings.ini find the following lines and change it to..\n"ChromaticUVNudge=0.000000"\n"ChromaticBlendExp=0.000000"\n","August 2, 2014","true","10.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is a bit stiff it's true, when you play as a cat the gameplay is even worse but solving cases as a ghost, finding colectibles to watch a interesting cutscenes and catch the main villain a serial killer was great and I enjoyed it. The story it's the strongest. You can only be killed by demons which i really liked them, you are defenseless against them and you have to use some strategy to pass through them or kill them from behind instead. The game lack difficulty too and forgives if you fail to choose any wrong clue but in the end it was a fresh game to me.\n\nScore: 6/10.","July 19, 2015","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The investigation bits aren't developed compared to other games like sherlock holmes, it simply adds to the story. It is not a very long game, even if you are into collecting all the pieces to unlock other non-playable short stories, which is kinda boring IMHO.\n\nMy biggest problem with this title is the unnecessary addition of quicktime events during gameplay. Quicktime is alright if they are few and far between, but in this game it is added in several mechanics, from fighting demons to escaping from demon pits. They should've done away with all of that if they didn't bother adding a different mechanism of fighting and evading danger.\n\nThe graphics are alright and the dialogue is okay - if your graphics card isn't at least a medium-end one I'd say skip it mostly because you might run into a few issues with fps, which will probably take away from the game as you have to walk all around places and kill demons to get to the objectives.\n\nI can recommend this game only if you enjoy story focused games and even in this case, if its on a sale. I wouldn't recommend people paying over $15 on this one.","April 21, 2015","true","10.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I expected a relaxing adventure game with nice graphics, a nice story, some easy puzzles and some exploration. Unfortunately only the graphics held up to my expectations. The story wasn't very original up to the point where I quit, but at least it was interesting enough to follow it. So it could have been a decent game - if it weren't for the abysmal gameplay.\n\nThe whole game is basically one of those crappy hidden object games. You walk around with your ghost character and search for clues (objects or people you can interact with) so you can walk up to them and press a button. Doh. Once you've found enough clues you can combine the most important ones  (which again means mindlessly pressing buttons, don't get your hopes up) to 'solve' the scene and move on with the story.\n\nOh, and apart from that sometimes you have to fight demons. Sounds exciting? It is not. You just have to walk up to them from behind and press a button combination. Just another very dull gameplay mechanic.\n\nMurdered: Soul Suspect would have been a better game if it was one of those Walking Simulators like 'Dear Esther'. And that says something. The gameplay is simply too boring and annoying to enjoy the (not even outstanding) story of the game. Not recommended.","February 25, 2015","false","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is one of my favourite games and I'm only 2 or 3 missions in. It takes a great perspective on "what is death" and it neatly places the game around that. It has everything you want - hard-to-find clues, side quests, enemies which take skill to maneouvre around and then random key+mouse combo to take down, and great graphics. They used the ghostly essence given off to show off some luxurious particle effects.\n\nSteam gives this  a metascore of 62, but as I say metascores are inaccurate - this game is worthy of a 80-to-85 range score.\n\nDefinitely a must-have!\n~Gio","June 22, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However, it isn't a spectacular one either. I enjoyed playing it, and think it's worth the purchase, but only within the $5 - $10 range.\n\nThe game isn't particularly long--7 - 10 hours not including collectables--and due to the murder mystery-esque storyline, has little replay value.\n\nCombat is non-existant, and instead the few enemies met in the game are dispatched using "sneak up behind them and perform a button combination" tactics. The encounters are never difficult, and with the exception of perhaps one or two near the end, pretty straight forward.\n\nThe meat of the game involves crime-scene investigation, or at least a simplified version of it. Once you get the hang of what the game expects from you, they become fairly simple, but several times throughout I found the prompts given to help you select relevant clues had little to do with the actual clues the game expected you to select... not that the game really penalizes you for choosing the wrong ones.\n\nIn short; decent game, buy it cheap, play it once, enjoy it, and move on.","February 28, 2015","true","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
