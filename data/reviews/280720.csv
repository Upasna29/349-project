"http://steamcommunity.com/id/johndsaucier/recommended/280720/","johndsaucier","jsauce","http://steamcommunity.com/id/johndsaucier/","856 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI purchased this game some time ago and have waited a long time to review it, due in part to some issues I had with it, but also because I wanted to be fair, considering that it is an early access game. So with that being said, my review:\n\nSo I was flipping through the steam games and I came across this game called "Imagine Earth" in the simulation section, I saw that it had a demo and decided to try it. At the time the demo only had a missions available, a simple interface and not a lot in the way of content... but I was hooked.\n\nIt reminded me why I like simulation games in the first place, giving me all the things I enjoy with the bonus of playing God to a newly created world to work with. I could feel the nostalgia of Sim Earth I played as a kid. So I jumped right in after playing the demo and purchased early access to the game.\n\nPlaying the early access version it was immediately apparent the game was slightly different than the demo that been made available, which is okay considering that demos are just that, demonstrations of what the game will look like. But one thing was clear, this was no simulation game.\n\nWhat I got instead was a game that seemed more like a puzzle where your decisions didn't really matter more than getting the right pieces in the right order before you run out of time. I had many issues with the game, all of which I made clear by submitting emails to the developers who were very receptive and seemed opened to the community ideas.\n\nLorian the third world in the game gave me excruciating torment, where it seemed the developers were more interested in creating a game of torture than a game of fun, and it became discouraging to play over and over, failure after failure. So I took a break, quit playing altogether in the hopes some of the issues I had with it would be solved eventually.\n\n\nSo after months I decided to try the game again, and I am so glad that I did. All of the issues that I had originally had have disappeared. What was once an overly complicated puzzle of torture, had become a relaxing simulation/strategy game that was less scripted with super hard puzzle nonsense and although still difficult seems less locked into "their" pre-defined way to win strategy I sometimes felt when playing. Even when I failed a couple of times, I saw different ways to get to where I wanted and ultimately finished the things that were once overly difficult to beat.\n\nThe developers have clearly taken the community recommendations and made the game a lot more playable and fun, and that's why I felt like it was time to review this game for them.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game now, for its addictive playstyle that will keep you happy for hours on end. While the game is still unfinished, it’s very much where it needs to be now, and playing it no longer feels like an exercise in futility but rather an actual game that is fun to play. I'm excited to see more and cannot wait to see how this one ends.\n\nFor the people that like extra-long drawn out games, this one might not be for you, as the game only has a few missions, but it almost doesn't matter because the addictive nature of it will keep you coming back for more. I hope to see expansions or additions to the game after it is released because what they have here opens so many other possibilities. Certainly you will be left wanting for more, and there doesn't seem to be any reason why the devs couldn't keep adding on to the game.\n\nFor the people that love simulation, strategy, space games, this game is FOR YOU! For everyone else that loves fun quirky games, you'll want to play this game too. Beautiful, charming, and challenging. Highly recommended!\n","May 5, 2015","true","34.0"," 84 of 88 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","84","88","2","0"

Or need a side-task often to do with population in order to get new research points? It may sound like nitpicking but the oddity of the game's reasoning is sticking out like a thorn.\nPrice: I still find it a bit pricey for what the game offers.\n\nThe Verdict: ★★★☆☆\n\nA good little game, with a little more promised for the future.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pferdbaumcowboyfressen/recommended/280720/","pferdbaumcowboyfressen","GrandMaster-D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pferdbaumcowboyfressen/","279 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nImagine Earth or: The game "Reus" wants to be\nImagine Earth is best described as a mixture of puzzle, strategy and management simulation. Even though with a educational mandate, as it's main feature is the fragility of planets. As the title implies this game throws a shadow on the future of our earth. But first things first.\n\nWhat is: In this game you are the jr. vice president of Imagine Earth, Ltd., a coorporation that colonizes distant planets for big profits. The game comes with a nice campaign, introducing you to likeable characters that guide you through your first steps. Expect to fail in the second mission anyways. Even though the tutorial is very well designed and gives a good guidance, the game itself remains a challenge.\nYou start of every new colony by placing your first town centre on the planet. Soon enough new colonists will move in and develop a demand for food, energy and goods.\nBy the games triangular grid, every building has - yes, that's right - three sides. And as you place buildings next to each other they possibly gain benefits or detriments from each other. So in this way Imagine Earth actually resembles "Reus". For example, you can increase the energy output of biomass plants by placing them next to forests or farms. But your inhabitants will become unhappy if you build coal plants next to their houses. Since building space is limited, conflicts are inevitable and part of the challenge arises from the task to place your buildings in the most productive and proficient way.\nWhat's else: On the other hand there are different types or tiles of terrain. So you want to place your farms on fertile land or your gas plants on top of gas resources to maximize outcomes. This task gets significant harder by the fact that all your buildings create pollution, eventually triggering a greenhouse effect on your planet. Fertile land turns into desert, tornados and volcanoes arise and ultimatly your facing meltdown of the polar caps, rising global water level. To cut a long story short, if you don't take care of your planet, it will want to get rid of you.\n[/b]]The graphics[/b] are a bit toony, which I personally enjoy very much. The planets themself looking like beautiful blue marbles that I - personally - feel a bit sad for, if my false management destroys them.\nThe Music itself is not extraordinarily remarkable but fits the pace of the game very good. (The speed of the music actually changes with the set game speed - mindblown!)\nThe story is also not quite thrilling but gives enough motivation to play through the campaign which I perceived mostly as a tutorial introducing my to new elements. Once your done with the rather short campaign, there is sandbox mode, challenge mode and a free play mode. You can play on planets, that are procedural created according to player set parameters - for instance like in Tropico where you can choose size of the map, the amount of resources, etc... - what makes the game a good value.\n(It seems that there is the idea of exchanging planets with your friends, competing for highscorse, but I can not confirm this.)\nThe controls are very simple and easy to pick up right away. One click opens the menu, one click lets you choose, one click places the building.\n\nFlaws: As much as I enjoy Imagine Earth, there are two downsides. Even though the planets look beautiful, they feel a bit sterile, as streets stay empty, for example. Where are your 1.5 billion inhabitants? Building big cities is fun and the realy look cool as large skyscrapers emerge, but there is now life in the game. There are neither people or cars (like in Anno, where you get the impression of a busy citylife), nor animals roaming on the map.\nThe other minor flaw is, that you cant buy 5 buildings in a row, as you have to open the menu, select the building and place it for every building. Which I find a little unpractical and thus ironic in a game, that focus on maximizing efficiency.\n\nSum of us: This game is what I expected when I first got my hands on "Reus". If you were, like me, disappointed by Reus - even though solely based on your own false expectations - then this game is for you. If you like building simulations and management games, this game also is for you. If you are still sceptical, the free demo is for you.\n\nImagine Earth is charming, challenging, a good value and a game of plain fun.\n","October 26, 2015","true","11.5"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","45","52","3","0"

It is easy to pick up the basics, but definitely takes skill to get good at it.\n\nThe gameplay is great, despite the graphics not being the best on the market. Considering this is an indy title, it really needs to get more attention as a great addition to a difficult-to-please genre of players.\n\nLook at the negative comments for the game - none of them complain about gameplay. Its all taste-based comments or something that's not an issue like expecting world-class graphics from an indy team. The negative comments don't complain about the gameplay, because the game is fun and challenging.\n\nWould love to see how this game ends up at release.

It's been consistently a lot of fun throughout development and the devs have been really active in updating and expanding the game. An example being I found a bug in Alpha 11, maybe they had already located it too, either way, it was fixed in 5 hours! So, this is not one of those early releases.\n\nOn the actual gameplay, it's an entertaining simulation, where you're having to develop a colony, with pre-set victory conditions in each level. You can't use all the buildings and techs every time, so you end up needing to be selective on what you develop and coupled with that is the risk of runaway global warming, which results in failure. Added to that is time trials, challenges, free play and planet creators, so it's got a decent amount of replay value to it too.\n\nIt's a pretty chilled game, which however can put the pressure on at times. For the price it is, I would definitely say it's entertaining and enjoyable enough to be totally worth it.","May 14, 2015","true","12.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

However, in this case I made an exception and I'm glad I did.  I believe it will be well worth it once the game is finished and am glad I could help out the developers.\n\nSo far it's a pretty good game (first three missions are available) and I was able to play through without too many bugs.  Reminds a bit of Light of Altair in terms of the city building elements.\n\nThe one bug I did have was that research system was screwed up -- when you earned research stars you had to go back to the main menu before they would appear and you'd be able to invest them.  I'm sure that will be fixed by the time they launch 1.0.","June 16, 2014","true","50.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

The concept is good but the end game leaves alot to be desired.\n\nI played 1v1 free play against a normal difficulty AI, I was having a blast building a 10 mil population city and right at about 8.5 mil I realized that the other civ was about to doom me. Now I thought maybe they were just late to pic up the green techs so I simulated a few asteriod strikes to see what would happen the reloaded to play thru the rest of my "peaceful" playthru.Essentially by time I made it to 10 mil the other civ had doubled my polution output with only about a third of the population that I had. The AI civ doomed the planet and the game only gives the player an option to throw asteriods at their foe causing the roid to stick in the ground leaving a blocked space thats unbuildable and as far as I could tell it couldnt be removed either (I'll have to throw one into my own territory next time to see if I can remove it). Without a way to combat the AI the other civ simply just landed more city center where any space was available, seeing as the impact would cause a fire which would burn the trees that would then open up a space for the AI to land a city center, the fight was futile or arguous at best.\n\nApart from the lack of military stratagy there was absolutely no way to combat the rising tides or to attempt to stabalize the atmosphere using technology. Sea walls and carbon capture systems seem like common ideas that would make it into a game like this, given it is only an alpha so maybe more eviromental protection techs will be added but I felt very dissapointed to see my 10mil city go to ruins in the exact same way my 1 mil city did with absolute no way to progress after the collapse even tho I had plenty of capital to invest in recovering the flodded areas.\n\n\nI give this game a 3 out of 5 at it's current version, untill an update adds to the end game content I would not sudgest this game to the average civ gamer as they will feel as I do after playing a marathon; dissapointed in what seemed like the same game weather playing ten minutes or ten hours.\n\n#Seawalls\n\nEdit 3/26/16; I have changed my thumbs down to a thumbs up. I still dont fully support the game but the developer is putting out new content and it seems to be moving in the right direction. I look forward to playing the game with the new updates when I get around to it.

So when I saw Imagine Earth, I thought it might be another take on the concept. Sadly, it fell just a few yards short of a touchdown.\n\nImagine's gameplay just feels clunky, from setting up cities to the requirements for upgrades to actually expanding your colony. The upgrades system especially feels odd, considering you're working for a corporation having there be population marks to meet rather that using your money as an alternative feels tricky. Also, there feels to be too much of a limit on what you're capable of doing, though since this is still in early access I know things will change. Maybe making the planets a bit bigger and offering alternative methods to gain technologies and licenses?\n\nRight now, I can't recommend Imagine, but maybe it'll surprise me in the future.","May 30","false","1.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","2"
