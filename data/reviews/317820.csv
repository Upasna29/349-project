I watched a friend play it for a few hours before deciding it looked interesting and unique enough to buy. If I was reviewing this game in the first few hours, which I see a lot of people have, it would be 100% positive, it takes delving a little deeper to discover some of the flaws.\n\nYou choose your class (6 choices progressively unlocked through a gold-based tree) and this gives you your deck of cards (attacks and defense). Each turn you are randomly assigned cards that can include monsters, rooms and treasures. You place these to create a dungeon, and your adventurer (who you don't control), will be motivated to get the shinies. You can build your "deck" of attacks by choosing equipment (much of which is unlocked through the gold-tree).\n\nThe quirky monsters, attacks, dialogue bubbles and item descriptions are awesome. For example, if you play the bruiser, you're the chavviest chav ever. If you're the cat burglar, you will literally, throw cats. I won't spoil the rest, a lot of the fun in this game is the personality that shines through as you play.\n\nYou complete quests which unlocks more rooms in your guild (through gold), you get more dungeons, you complete more quests, and it repeats. Some of the quests are catered towards different classes, so you have to unlock the right classes and figure out what the strengths and weaknesses are and take in the right adventurer, whilst your graveyard piles up with the bodies of the minions who failed. Whilst simple, it can be pretty challenging and you do have to really think about what you're doing.\n\nIf I could leave it there, this would be 100% positive - but after the first six hours or so I did feel the game was very monotonous. That's a side effect of the fact that every single dungeon you start again at level 1. After a while you realize you're just playing the same monsters, the same room types, the same abilities from a small card set vs the same mechanics that you start with, over and over in a very repetitive grind. Progression takes a lot of gold, grinding and time, and for me, felt quite slow and stale. The game needs a much larger monster, class and equipment pool if it wants to pull that off without it getting boring by the end and a more interesting set of options and permanent carry-overs to reduce the time you spend grinding as you progress.\n\nThe roadmap mentions an "endless mode" with a high score table, which may add some competitive play and certainly a lot of replayability, so I look forward to seeing how long I can survive in that.\n\nMy recommendation is still positive because I do think it's a unique idea with a great style, especially the writing, and I did enjoy playing this game a lot - it's just too simplified and reptitive to be taking full advantage of it's potential and that makes me sad. When this comes up on sale or perhaps when patches are added in the future, I think this will be better value.\n\nTL:DR Great basics, tons of potential, very unique and interesting game, can be a bit grindy/reptitive, needs more content. Would still recommend.","July 18, 2015","true","9.9"," 120 of 131 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","120","131","4","1"

I was excited to play, everything was funny and great to discover - and then it clicked: I already saw everything the game had to offer.\n\nThe game mechanics are the same from start to finish.\nDo quests, use money to upgrade guild hall, get new equipment, do quests, use money to upgrade guild hall, get new equipment... Sure, this is every RPG-style game, is it not?  There's always some *reason* why you're doing this, though.  Some end goal.  Something to motivate you to continue.  Some change in game mechanics.  Here?  Nothing.  It's really a one-trick pony.  Do quest, get new equipment, do quest, get new equipment, rinse and repeat.\n\nI found myself bored within hours.  There was nothing that captivated me, here.  The narrator starts to grate on you singing the same tune at every significant event.  You feel no love for your heroes, they die, and are instantly replaced.  There's no benefit to keeping them alive longer.\n\nBottom line, Guild of Dungeoneering is extremely lacklustre.\n\nGuild of Dungeoneering feels like it should have been a mobile game, where you would play a dungeon and come back in a few hours time when your heroes are ready to go again.  There's so little meat and potatoes to the game, I'm disappointed.","July 16, 2015","false","1.6"," 379 of 496 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","379","496","9","13"

Interesting game with innovative system. Still, I had to consider really long whether to say I'd recommend this game or not. In the end, the positives won out.\n\nSomething very important you should know before buying the game: despite the misleading name and description, gameplay-wise this game is not a dungeon crawler, neither is it a RPG. It is more like a twist on deck-building card game. If you understand that before playing the game would be a lot easier to play.\n\nPros Innovative system.\nAlmost every mechanic in the game is card-based, and require you to plan each step of the fight. The ability to build your dungeon and choose your enemies based on your character deck is both challenging and fun.\n\nMany character classes with unique playstyle.\nThis part of the game is extremely well done. Each class is vastly different from the others, and all of them are very fun to play. The feeling when you finally get to buy that building and test out the new class is trully thrilling. Though I would love to have classes' info available to see outside of dungeons. Right now you have to actually get into a dungeon to see your new class' ability.\n\nNeat dark humor and an evil bard mocking your dungeoneers every time you fail. Or win. Or do pretty much anything. His sole meaning of existence is sacarsm.\n\nAnd of course interesting art style. But I guess you can already judge it yourself.\nCons There's no tutorial.\nOk, actually there's one hint for what you should do at the first turn of the game, and that's it. You have to figure out how the game works yourself. Took me 4 hours before I got a rough grasp of the game. And the last hour before realization was very, very discouraging. You have to be patient and figure out things with trial and error.\n\nNo possibility to improve weak classes.\nAlthough each character is unique, the lower-tiered classes are a lot more powerful than their earlier counterparts Mainly because they have more starting health, which is quite important in this game. And there's no way to upgrade character in this game, meaning you will practically have only 5 choices for the endgame, which is a watse. I really love the Bruiser class but it's at the 1st tier so it get shadowed pretty soon.\n\nA lot of a lot of a lot of small, irritating UI bugs especially with pop out windows and click handlers, and occasional game freeze.\nAnd I don't mean this as toilerable. This is the main reason why I considered giving this game a "Not recommended".\n\nThe game feels like a beta test version\nSeveral screens seem to be just there to be a place holder. For example you have a guild building where you can choose where to build each room/hall, and... that's all. You have an entire screen that doesn't really serve any purpose other than listening to its music.\n\nNo end game content.\nAfter you clear the game you don't even have enough money to buy all buildings for the guild, and yet you can't go back to cleared dungeon. Meaning once you clear the game it's the solid end. Expect a 15 hours game for 15 bucks.\nIn the end I would recommend this game if you:\nEnjoy deck building card games and had experience playing them in real life. Many effects and buffs/debuffs in this game are not tracked, which is not something players of digital card games are used to, and will lead to miscalculation and frustration.\n\nWant to enjoy an indie game that focus more on gameplay quality than quantity.\nDon't play this game if you:\nPrefer a simple, easy to jump in game. Prepare to spend at least 4 hours to understand what the game's about. You can see that most of the bad reviews are at around 3 hours of gameplay. I myself struggled at the 3rd hours mark too. Heck, that conveyed such strong messages that if I were the developers I'd do something about it immediately, but what am I to say, I can't even design a decent card game.\n\nHave low toilerance for semi-finished game. The game is lacking in content AND contains a ridiculous amount of bugs. They aren't game breaking bugs but they are irritating nonetheless.","July 17, 2015","true","21.3"," 99 of 108 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","99","108","0","0"

Really, wow. Wowies. Wowzers. I did not expect this. This is a game that will force my review to be as blunt as it gets. I expected a simple Pen-and-Paper game that would allow me to kick back and reminisce of the old days when adventures on paper were actually fun. I got surprised big time. I watched some youtube videos of this game but none of them prepared me for what it represents.\n\nA TL;DR Intro to Guild of Dungeoneering:\n\nSo, this is the Guild of Dungeoneering, who tries to rival the best guild ever who has the best stuff, the best people and the best intel. In short, you form a guild with the intent to show them who's better. Sadly, the people who join you will be rougher than the average... And that's put mildly... unless you, Sir/Madam, are good enough to show them the way.\n\nWhat way? Well, it may be a way to glory, losing few people and actually showing the Ivory League guild who's the BOSS. Or you may send them to senseless deaths times and times over till the end of days. Everything goes. In the end, you will prevail.\n\nSo, let's take a look at what the game does well and what poorly.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\n1. The music and soundtracks: this is the most unique soundtrack I have heard to date, turning the bland background sounds into a bard-like storytelling. Whoever thought of that must be showered with gold. For reals.\n2. The artwork: the game completely and thoroughly kicks back to the olden times when you could create adventures on pen and paper and make them fun through roleplaying, storytelling and jokes and jabs.\n3. Good character class variation and your own guild to improve, build and create as you feel like.\n4. No adventure is ever the same, because:\n4.1. You choose your hero from a number of classes.\n4.2. You choose your dungeon layout.\n4.3. You choose the enemies you fight.\n4.4. You actively participate in the action.\n4.5. You do your best to fight your battles as best as possible.\n5. This is not a game to keep you glued to your PC. You can play for a bit, take a break, and come back to it. The game will not lose anything from its charm.\n6. The game creates stories from the gameplay. If you have been following my reviews, you would know that I love this about a game. Be it for a win or a loss, you get a mission or a playthrough that makes you go to the forums and share. That in itself is a huge plus in my eyes.\n7. Good enemy variety, all of them with separate skills and setups.\n8. Talking about skills: skills = cards. So you play cards to win encounters and use them to the best of your ability. The enemy plays a card and then you counter and try to win. SImple, yet engaging.\n9. Ironman: there is a very select type of games that are worthy of an ironman experience and this one is certainly one of them. You do not get to save and load and fool the RNG.\n10. Humor: plenty of jokes, jabs, easter eggs and pokes to various cultures, franchises and... let's generalize, popular stuff is to be found in this game.\n11. A game that doesn't take itself seriously: this is one if the things that sells me out in a game. I love games that are jokingly frivolous and put a smile on my face. This one did it - many a time, even as I was losing horribly.\n12. Tons of loot: another thing that I love about games. Loot. It is improving with difficulty, and it is worth taking.\n13. Strategic decision win missions: while I said that I love frivolous games, I also love seeing my decisions amount to something. THis game does it for me.\n14. Commanding a rag-tag army of dungeoneers and sending them to their demise has never been more fun for me.\n15. Just like in real life, you can do everything right and still lose or get an unfavorable outcome.\n16. The game has more depth than it looks.\n17. And they even added animations, something that I, personally, did not expect.\n18. A single play-through takes over 7 hours even if you know exactly what you're doing (barring luck falures, wins, etc.), meaning the game is good value for the money.\n\nThe BAD. Hold on to your knickers, people, cause the BAD is a lot. However, I would be so bold as to urge you to look at the BAD subjectively. Please decide for youself what's actually good or bad for you.\n\n1. Steep learning curve. The game is easy to pick up but expects you to play it for a good amount of time in order to learn its quirks.\n2. The game is frustratingly punishing. Winning a mission is not always a factor of character build and player skill.\n3. If you are the type to get easily aggravated, frustrated, or flat out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off at what happens on the screen, this game is not for you.\n4. Your adventurers forget everything they did in the previous dungeon and start at level 1 every single time... But that's not all: they also completely lose the gear hey got from the last run. Now I, personally, think that they just get so happy for being alive in such a punishing game, that they get so horribly drunk in the city tavern and pass out and someone steals their gear and returns them to first grade. I blame it on the Ivory League. Them freaking cheaters.\n5. RNG can screw you big time. It can even lose you a mission. This may happen so often, that it will force you to ragequit or dub the game as an downright infair, so much so that you might shelf it.\n6. You will ragequit many a time, especially if you have a short fuse.\n7. The game doesn't present much in terms of graphical and aesthetical fidelity for our modern age.\n8. There are no RPG elements of any sort that many people would expect from this type of game.\n9. There is no multiplayer. No co-op or LAN or anything.\n10.  Difficulty ramps up very quickly. If you don't know the quirks of the game, you might find yourself over your head in no time, which results in lost missions.\n11. Some classes are need revamping and balancing, as they are better than the others.\n12. So easy to lose a fight and the mission as a result.\n\nAnd now, the conclusion. I will make it very plain and simple.\n\nYou should buy the game if:\n- you're a casual gamer\n- you like in-game humor that puts a smile on your face\n- you can accept the game for what it is - a parody to dungeoneering\n- you like games that you can play for a bit every now and then when you feel like, but still return to them and have just as much fun as before\n- you like jokes, jabs and pokes to various cultures and franchises\n- you like card games\n- you like skill based games\n- you like challenges\n- you like ironman games\n- you like experimenting\n- you don't care about losing, but enjoy learning from experience and adapting as a result\n\nYou shouldn't buy the game if:\n- you are a very serious gamer that expects a huge value from a purchase\n- you have a short fuse and get frustrated easily\n- you dislike the random number generator\n- you ragequit a lot\n- you expect a game that will get you glued to the pc for days on end\n- you dislike games with a huge learning curve\n- you don't like seeing your minions die for the greater purpose\n\nSo why would I recommend the game?\nI would recommend it because it is the right game for me. I love games that have lots of humor, don't take themselves seriously and put a smile on my face. This one did it - even as I was losing horribly. It never made me feel bad for it and always had this jovial feeling of letting me fool around with it - be it with additional classes, options, and avenues of advancement. I was enjoying myself regardless of what was happening, and I believe this to be one of the most important factors in a game.","August 8, 2015","true","17.5"," 67 of 75 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","67","75","5","1"

Quite enjoyable still but feeling of evolution and variety do not last.\n-In my very opinion : evolution is slow and although not that poor in the end still limited, just as variety of missions.\n\nI'll had a special thought for a mechanic I really like : each looted gear do not directly give new cards but rather levels of skills that stack on the character, each level unlocking a new card.\n\n\n\nFirst : it's NOT a BAD game. But...\n\nTL;DR :\n-Great game design ideas.\n-Globally poor content although sympathic.\n-Way too repetitive and boring due to the lack of evolution.\n\nLovely idea on the paper, building a dungeon with cards around a character that move itself through the rooms you're creating, populating, filling with loot. Then playing cards based combats, making your character evolve, collecting better gears giving better cards. Upgrading your guild with earned golds to unlock new gears and classes.\n\nBut...\n\nVery few different gears in my opinion, very limited deck building possibilities (one class and one weapon/offhand/helm/body gear), no lvl or gear conservation through mission makes you start anew everytime, not much novelties to unlock in the guild, at least nothing that feel like...\n\nVery sympathic but get tediously repetitive before the first half-hour.\n\nI have to recognize a great realisation for all the graphic and music parts, very funny narrator and beautiful tracks, very nice paper style design.\n\nBut even for 15€ I feel ripped. The game is fun to play but so insanely repetitive. Played four hours, started to struggle to really enjoy myself before end of the first. I can only hope the promised  gifted extension for pre-purchase will really enrich the game but I have few hope.\n\nGreat ideas but very unrewarding for the player due to the lack of evolution and real objectives beside. Missions are basically always the same, and even though there are some real tactical aspects they are, well, like all the rest, very poor in the end. Big deception because it's just a funny little time killer where it could have been quite a nice game.","July 14, 2015","false","7.2"," 243 of 366 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","243","366","7","20"

When your start  a dungeon quest, your chosen hero begins as level 1, and gains experience and gear as they progress through the level. Luck and randomization determine how your fare\nin the dungeon, and the mechanics get a bit repetitive, as you start each new dungeon\nagain as a level 1 with no gear that carries over.\n\nIf your hero dies, you and your guild are not punished in any way, and another hero\nof the same class appears in your guild to take the place of the fallen. This endless\nsupply of heroes that don't interact of coordinate with any of your other heroes gives\nthe game a disjointed feeling, and takes away a sense of progression as you level up your guild.\n\nBecause your heroes do not level up as your progress, and you are unable to bring any sort of gear into a dungeon with you, or have any choice in what cards you bring with you, the game relies heavily on luck and repetition. When it comes to beginnning a new dungeon, you are essentially thrown into battle with no ability to prepare for different types of enemies. The leads to having to repeat levels hoping for the right random cards, and a grinding feel.\n\nThe concept of this game, and the way this game was presented was very appealing, but at the end of the day, upon playing the game, the extreme repetitiveness and grinding nature of the game make it frustrating and time consuming to play. You have no emotional ties to any of the heroes, and have to start out each new dungeon at square one. There is virtually no deck building, and no depth to the game. This was a great concept, but it fell short of it's potential.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","September 13, 2015","false","5.6"," 146 of 222 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","146","222","2","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vinterro/recommended/317820/","Vinterro","Vinterro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vinterro/","327 products in account","The game is cute, simple, and fun. It takes a nice concept and puts it expertly into it's game. So why is this a negative review? Because the game relies on what I like to call impossiBS. This is when the difficulty of the game isn't based on skill, knowledge of the rules, or reasonable RNG. It is when a game's difficulty can be literally impossible if you made the wrong upgrade choices. And you will make those choices at least once. It's when the game laughs at what you've learned, and kicks it to the curb. And it's not in a fun way either.\n\nLet me show you what I mean. Needless to say, this review is spoiler free, so don't worry about it. You will come across a quest that requires you to defeat an Eye of the Beholder within a limited amount of turns. Not a problem, you say. You've done timed missions before, why should this be different? Because the placement of the set tiles requires a VERY precise path through the area. You need to kill a couple mobs to reach a NEEDED chest, in which you might not get the needed loot. Then you need to go a certain way to get to the boss on time. I've made it to that boss with just hitting zero turns, and it counts as a loss. When I did beat that mission, it was because I got lucky on the tiles/mobs, and was able to grind up quickly enough to kill it.\n\n"But Vinterro," you say. "Isn't this game based on RNG? Shouldn't you expect to have a few bad draws, given the nature of card games in general?" Yes. I did expect to get many bad draws. However, I did not expect to have to do the same level 37 times. I had to turn off the audio, as there is a bard who sings about your death every time it happens. Needless to say, it was getting very repetitive. The whole thing was annoying, and unneeded. But alas, when the boss's death came at hand, I was relieved that I could move on. And I got a hearty 1000 gold for defeating him, of which I immediately spent.\n\nNeedless to say, I regretted that decision. The next area of the map is a jungle theme, and the missions in there got a massive difficulty boost. This is where the main part of the impossiBS difficulty came in. The levels beforehand were a perfect difficulty to what was available to you, and I had fun. These levels were in no way possible with what I had on hand. Every enemy got an upgrade, which added bigger damage, unblockable hits, and just endless frustration. I was a brawler main, which concentrated on a 'best offence is a good defense' kind of thing. However, the enemies had, for the most part, unblockable hits. Now, I griped for a bit, but realised I may need to change strategy in order to defeat these enemies.\n\nSo I invested in other classes, trying to figure out the way of winning. Which first off is a big no-no. Under no circumstances should a game present an option to a player, then beat him over the head until he realises that option is entirely wrong. So I tried another class. And another. And sometimes I would be able to defeat the first couple of enemies in a mission, and by then I was set to finish it. However, the difficulty to get to that point is too damn high. I got to a point when I was literally stuck, and could not progress. And trust me, I tired. Unfortunately, there is no way to grind out the class you need. You can not revisit any quests that you finished already.\n\nSo I looked to the Steam community forums. And I found some guides. Those guides basically told me that I'd need to choose one setup in order to win the game. Only one viable option, out of all the classes, blessings, and other "choices" I can make. And reading on, it seems the third area has an even bigger difficulty spike. I can not fathom how I'd be able to do this. I am basically required to start all over and follow a guide, word for word. Which should not be needed in any fashion, for any activity. Games are to have fun, but this has become a chore for me. Follow this step, buy this thing, choose this class. There is no freedom that is apparently there. As good as a game this looks, and as good as a game this was, it basically broke itself less than halfway through. And that is why I am writing this review. So hopefully you do not make the same mistakes I did.","October 20, 2015","false","6.5"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","86","37","43","5","1"

The different characters and variety in dungeons reward smart and methodical gameplay yet don't over complicate the issue with too many mechanics that are not well explained. Even with random card draws and all, what the game does fantastic is making you feel like you are in control of what happens to you, as bad decisions will come front and center, while smart decisions will make you feel like you're cunning as a fox. The game has a style that works wonders, and in particular the bard that sings your successes and failures was really appreciated as it just works for the back room RPG like atmosphere that the game gives off. The game does have little things that could be added in the big picture to help and is missing some options that I would expect from the game (sound sliders?) but overall, it's an experience you'll lose hours to while being charmed throughout it. Very well put together and polished.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: http://youtu.be/np6M7ux7j8E\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nRewards strategic gameplay. Understanding what a dungeon's strengths and weakness are in combination with your characters strengths and weaknesses are is key to making progress, and rewards smart gameplay.\nGood balance all around here as not every character can do every mission given their skill set, and I like that about the game.\nEven though the decks are small at first and can be added to with the loot system, in never honestly feels repeatitive despite doing the same thing over and over, which is fantastic. While about 3-4 hours of my gameplay was idle (oopsie me), the number of hours I spent should indicate how ingrossing the gameplay is.\nLove the aesthetic of the game. The singing bard that comments on your recent failures or obtained characters is fantastic to listen to, and the graph paper setting gives a back room RPG feel to it that I think works.\nLittle touches like the ability to build your hall despite it not really making a difference in the end is appreciated, as it goes for that extra touch of charm.\nGame Design all around is done well even with some of the complaints that I have in the negative section, they don't overpower the game in terms of it's fun factor.\n-:\nIt will take you a long while to figure out the movement system, and even then your character will do silly things at times.\nI feel that despite the game being mostly balanced, the Ranger is overpowered at this point in time with his ability.\nDo wish that I could look at a deck on a character in the guild hall. That could make picking the right character easier in the long run.","July 14, 2015","true","22.3"," 91 of 132 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","91","132","6","1"

Unfortunately those trailers failed to mention the complete lack of any persistent progress. After I realized this, the game lost 90% of its appeal for me.\n\nYeah the graphics are cool and charming and the dungeon building is a fun concept. But why bother? If I make the dungeon too hard and lose a charcter, so what? I just get a new one, and he's the same level and has the same gear because you cant actually progress between dungeons. If they beat the dungeon, again, so what? They cant bring back any loot or gain any experience, health, skills, etc... basically, it's the same as if they had died, except now I get to do the next pointless quest.\n\nHaving a persistant character from each class (or multiple characters from the same class) would allow the devs to make the dungeons get tougher, but that's ok because your guys get better too. Then when your Chump finds a sword in the second dungeon, he has a better chance of taking on the next one... assuming you dont kill him. And he gets to bring back the twig he was using too, and put it in the guild vault for some up-and-coming Cat Burglar to start with. Or as Guildmaster, you can sell the twig - or his sword, poor guy - for some cash.\n\nObviously one problem with that is that currently you can't repeat quests, so your second or third guildmembers can't do a quest that your first guy cleared out. A solution would be a random quest generator, which could spoawn a random level, random goal dungeon. "Kill ___ number of ____" or whatever. It would add some variety to the game, and there would always be fodder to level your newbs up with. A cap could be put on experience gained from specific enemies, to prevent over leveling/grinding; so after level 2 you get half experience from Nasty Rats, after level 3 you get none. Time to go pick on someone your own size, Chump.\n\nEven the Guild expansion mechanic is flawed. If I build a blacksmith or a leatherworker, for example, it only affects the cards that my random loot is drawn from... so, I guess the rats and skeletons are coming and purchasing their gear at my guildhall? What I'd like to see here would be buildings that actually give my guys an advantage, like the blacksmith allows me to arm them with some iron swords or something, and expansions to it allow me to give them better stuff.\n\nIf the devs want extra credit, and I know this would be a lot harder to impliment, a party system would be cool, where certian high level dungeons let you take two or three guys in together... And you don't stand a chance sending one guy in alone!\n\nSo, while the graphics and soundtrack are great, and the dungeon building is fun, it really leaves a lot to be desired. I'll probably slog through it eventually, just so I can update this review for fairness. But as many have said, and I dread, I'm afraid that what you see in the first dungeon is what you get in the last.","July 23, 2015","false","5.2"," 64 of 91 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","64","91","2","0"

The presentation is simple but very functional. Extra praise has to be heaped on the atmospheric music and snarky lyrics that pervade play. The game is simple enough to certainly not need external reference or strategy guides, but hard enough to require forethought. Each run is short enough that dying 10 times isn't detrimental or particularly aggravating, which is fortunate because the game does not hold your hand and sometimes successive random chance dictates a no win scenario.\n\nEach dungeon run consists of turns with the player placing up to 3 cards of 5 in their hand. These consist of map tiles, gold, and monsters. Once placed, the dungeoneer then moves through the dungeon (prioritizing treasure, monsters and exploration of new tiles). Assuming the dungeoneer does not encounter a monster, this cycle completes until the specific mission objective is completed (kill a boss, kill X monsters, escape before X turns etc...they are rather varied).\n\nBattle consists of playing against an AI deck with each playing a single card per turn. Cards vary widely and include mechanics for two damage types, first strike, blocking, unblockable, card drawing and discarding, healing etc. The players deck is based off their class start deck and is augmented by "loot" captured from previous battles and chests. All loot give bonuses to one or more "skills" (such as Holy, Fire, Quick, Slashing etc). Extra cards are added to your deck based on the totals of these various skills (eg if you have a Fire II and  Fire I items, you get the cards for Fire I, II and III).\n\nYou have a central guild that you upgrade with the winnings from individual runs. Available upgrades include classes (base battle decks of a dozen or so cards and one special ability), packs of bosters that expand the potential pool of loot items, and a charm that adds a special ability.","August 31, 2015","true","18.2"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","2"

Taking inspiration from games like Dungeon Keeper, players must build the dungeon around the hero, luring them to the objectives and ensuring that they have faced enough monsters and gathered enough equipment to survive. You bribe, entice, and guide your heroes through dungeons without actually being able to control them directly.\n\nControl wise the game is all clicking and some dragging and dropping. There’s not much to it control wise and by looking at the UI design it has without a doubt been designed for an easy mobile port in the future. I actually think that it would be a perfect game for a mobile port and would do well on iOS and mobile devices. It’s glaringly obvious that the game was created with a mobile version in mind which usually means the PC version can suffer. In terms of usability it doesn’t however the UI can occasionally be unresponsive when clicking a button. However the developers don’t seem to have sacrificed anything from the game to make it touch screen friendly.\n\nIt’s a game that’s packed with humor, including a narrator that sings in poetic verse as you get your minions killed, horde for loot, and kill infamous creatures. The game comments on the RPG genre with humor in every aspect, from art design to the hero classes themselves. For example, the Barbarian class in RPG’s is as overused and old as RPG’s themselves, and thus the barbarian in the game is an old man or woman who frequently complains or stops for a cup of tea.\n\nI enjoyed the games cute minimalist art style, the background white graph paper with the pencil shaded graphics not only look good but give reinforce the humor feel to the game. Much of the game is just white and gray but the use of occasional color with vivid reds and blues does work well. The sound of the game is great with the voice acting and the medieval style music working hand in hand. The humour of the game really shines through in the sound design and the only criticism I would have of it is that I want more narration.\n\nGuild of Dungeoneering overall is a fun, well put together card battler. Its dungeon building elements work well and the games humor shines through in everything. It’s certainly worth picking up and is easily enjoyable for what it is. There’s very little to dislike in the game and with the pirates cove dlc on the horizon, there will no doubt be more content to come.\n\n","July 14, 2015","true","10.7"," 54 of 80 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","54","80","2","0"

While the presentation is nice, the gameplay is polished and the general concept well realised, the core of the game design is fundamentally flawed by overreliance on randomness and a lack of player control.\n\nThe very shape of the dungeon you explore, and many of the enemies you fight, are determined by placing cards you are randomly dealt each turn. If you're lucky, then the cards you get will lead you to your goal, if not, they won't, which on timed missions can mean you simply fail the mission and need to restart. Similarly, if you can place enemies your hero can defeat, then you can win the battle, level up, and progress. If not then you either skip leveling up and stay too weak to fight the preplaced enemies in the level, or you risk a battle against a too strong enemy, which will likely lead to you dying and needing to restart.\n\nThese 2 aspects of the game are made worse by the fact that you cannot control where your hero will actually move. Often the hero will move onto the monsters and treasure you yourself place, while sometimes (usually when it matters the most) the hero will ignore what you've placed  and insist on charging into a powerful enemy and dying. Once again, this is particulalry annoying on timed missions where every move you make is important. The rules for how the hero chooses his path are never explained, so it's possible this can be avoided with clever play, but I never figured out how.\n\nDeck building for combat is also very random, each hero you choose has a gimmick (such as extra effect from healing spells) and a few preset ability cards, but most of your abilities come from equipment that randomly drops in the level after fighting. This means you often end up in battle having to fight with abilities that were randomly chosen from your deck, which itself is filled with abilities that were semi randomly added to it. Once again this leads to frequent situations where you lose battles simply because the RNG didn't give you cards that allowed you to win. Since losing a battle means a restart, the frustration can quickly mount.\n\nIf you enjoy the gambling aspect of games, where your fate is 70% determined by the roll of a dice and 30% by the choices you make, and you have a lot of patience, this can be a fun game. The combat is simple, but understandbale and fun, the graphics are nice and the music is good (though the "Lol your hero has died again!" songs eventually caused me to switch off the music entirely). Otherwise, you'll likely find that the frustration of constantly restarting levels due to factors beyond your control will quickly outweigh the fun that the game offers.","July 16, 2015","false","5.4"," 55 of 83 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","55","83","2","0"

Well worth the money!\n\nLikes: Very charming art, voice over, and flavor text.  Easy to play but still rewarding.  After I bought a couple 500 gold expansions for my guild, I was feeling like a BOSS.  A bit OP, but hey, I struggled to earn it!  Most importantly it's a unique game design combining cards and D&D-style RPG--and that is what our studio is into as well at the moment, so this has been very fun research!\n\nDislikes: At the point after you have purchased all the 50 gold guild expansions but before you can buy the 500 gold expansions, the game feels like a bit of a grind because no new game mechanics are being introduced and you probably have mastered the rock/paper/scissors style combat up to that point, and you just aren't getting gold fast enough. Thankfully I pushed past the 1-2 hours of "wandering in the desert" and continued to have fun.\n\nTip: You can keep going in circles on the dungeon quests that don't have a boss that rushes you in X number of turns, and keep collecting as much loot as you want (hopefully this gets fixed), provided you are stronger than the monsters.  You will want to add monsters, so you can get the gold from them.\n\nSuggestion to Versus Evil: Add in a mechanic or two that makes it detrimental to just walk in circles in the dungeon collecting loot. Increase risk and lower reward. Starvation?  Disease?  No loot drops? Ghosts of past slain mosters that come back with increasing levels?  Fewer and fewer cards show up to build dungeon with?  I'm sure you can think up a whole bunch of funny things.","July 29, 2015","true","13.9"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","1"

The more classes you unlock; the more you'll realize how much variety there is in the game.  For an early taste of variety, I'd suggest picking up the Mime and the Bruiser as your second and third classes.  The mime is a spell heavy class that can make your opponent discard cards or duplicate a card from your enemies hand.  The Bruiser, my personal favorite so far, is a block-centric class that rewards you for saving and using your block/ block - attack cards for that perfect play.  Sure there's RnG but you have the choices and ability to swing things in your favor. Playing a class that deals well with phys attacks better than magic? Sprinkle your path through the dungeon with enemies that deal in phys damage and discard all those nasty magic based enemies you don't want to deal with.  The more I played the more I realized how much you can do you help yourself win - and figuring that out feels extra rewarding.\n\nI have encountered a few bugs (characters deaths glitching, occassional game slow down, and one straight up crash) and a few tooltips are lacking as well. I don't know what "Quick" means on a card yet. Hopefully a patch will fix these issues soon.\n","July 14, 2015","true","4.2"," 35 of 51 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","35","51","0","2"

Lots and lots of charm. Mechanically, the dungeon building aspect works well. Combat does not work very well. Combat is pretty simple and so highly predictive. Barring extreme good or bad luck you can be pretty certain of victory or death on turn 1 of combat.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with the game is the lack of any persistence between dungeons. You always start as a level 1 hero with no gear. I know the developers have said that the is an intentional part of the gameplay to prevent farming a dungeon to get a super hero, and their reasoning is sound for the game that it is. However, in my view, it is still a design flaw and they should have made other adjustments during design to account for this. It is a major negative to the game. The developers have said that the point of the game is to level up your guild, but this is not a very satisfying experience and feels lacking of consequence.\n\nI've marked the game as a "no"; however, I will say this.

Each of the different character classes (13 in total, I believe) has their own starting decks. These decks are expanded in battle by collecting equipment dropped after each battle. As with most RPGs, the common drops are low quality, only granting you a single card or buff, while the rare and epic loot drops can grant you 5 powerful cards and multiple buffs. You can also equip your Dungeoneer with a special item or blessing before exploring a dungeon, and these can offer advantages like extra hit points, larger starting hand sizes, or increased damage.\n\nYour role in the game is not that of the Dungeoneer! You are actually the guildmaster sending these freshly recruited dungeon crawlers in to fetch you treasure, to defeat boss monsters to give you bragging rights over a more successful rival guild, and more often than not, to die.\n\nThis is where a lot of people are complaining about the game. Instead of this being a traditional RPG when you play as the same protagonist throughout, leveling up and accumlating new powers, your Dungeoneers die quite frequently and are replaced just as easily. There is no individual character progression in the game... Only the Guild benefits from the adventurers labors. You may find yourself getting attached to a particular Guildie after they survive a few expeditions, but trust me...\n\nTHEY ARE ALL EXPENDABLE.\n\nOnce you have that in mind, you will find a fun and stylish game! The maps are partially laid out for you, and you get to fill in the blanks with the random dungeon tiles you are given each turn. Same thing with treasure and enemy placement. Some things are already on the map for that particular mission, and you get to place the rest to your own liking. You don't directly control the Dungeoneer once they are on a mission, but you can influence their path by tempting them with gold or putting a monster in their path. GoD actually reminds me of the tabletop tile game Boss Monster, and that is a favorable comparison!\n\nThe biggest downside of the game is that it is very short. I beat the game with nearly 100% unlocked in a little over 15 hours. There is no end game content, and you cannot re-run old missions in the same game. There is no New Game +. The selection of classes and items is limited. There is little replay value. As such, the game does kind of let you down because there is the potential for so much more!\n\nApparently an expansion entitled Pirates Cove is in the works, so that is a plus. The ability to mod the game would bea welcome addition. I, for one, would love to create some of my own classes or even do different genres, like a Warhammer 40K-style sci-fi version or super hero style set up.\n\nIf you don't mind the relatively small amount of content, then yes, I recommend this game. Just be aware that you're going to be paying about a dollar per hour of content. Fun content, yes!\n\nJust not a lot of it...","August 14, 2015","true","71.4"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

There's so much to like, but it falls short of being a good game.\n\nThe progression is awful.  You struggle to earn any money to buy the unlocks until the game just decides that a boss is suddenly worth ten times the amount of money you've ever owned.  Newer classes are just straight up better than older ones, so you won't, can't keep playing a class you like.  Gear is debatable, some 'better' items have their own drawbacks such that some old items continue to be useful, like the trusty +1hp items.\n\nThe combat can be frustratingly unfair at times.  This is partly due to the nature of the card game mechanics, and anyone who has played a card game knows that sometimes you get a bad draw, but it sucks when you're ten minutes into a dungeon and have ground your way through a bunch of monsters to suddenly die at the last hurdle through no fault of your own.\n\nExperience is weird.  Dungeoneers level up through a hard to tell system (I think you have to kill an equal or higher monster, grinding lower levels seemingly does nothing) but it doesn't transfer to the next dungeon.  While I can see why this might be overpowered, it makes keeping Dungeoneers alive meaningless.  Since they're given names, it would be nice to have some kind of system to withdraw from a Dungeon to keep them alive.  Nope, quitting a dungeon kills a fully healthy dungeoneer.\n\nThe music is... odd.  The Lyrical segments are definitely nice, but only plays upon victories, deaths and unlocks.   Otherwise, the game is oddly quiet.  Sound effects are lacking, and the bgm doesn't really fit, IMO.\n\nThe first levels are so promising, which is why all the lets plays have been fun to watch, but it just doesn't pan out.  In particular, the very ending is pathetic.  The game just sort of... stops.\n\nAs I say, it's not the worst game, and I could see a sequel that expands upon the idea being fantastic, but I don't recommend this game.","August 4, 2015","false","9.7"," 27 of 42 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","27","42","0","0"

So the building of the dungeon is done in a randomized card fashion pullying cards from a deck specified for the level by the designer (so far into the game you cannot alter this deck); these include room card such as a corridors, turns and rooms with multiple exits. The other type of room save the specific paths you can create are rooms with "fountains" these come in the entire variety of room designs but also come with a fountain in the middle of the room, the fountains give buff or debuff to the character, but is only picked up after killing any monsters in the room, these have a wide range of effects such as "burn", "stupidity", "blindness", "fury" or such as +1 hand size or +1 loot, i will explain what this means later in the combat.\n\nNext is monsters cards depending on the level of your character, they are given to the player and allow you to place them as you like: though note that killing these monsters are needed for gold and loot so you want to be fighting as much as you can.\n\nThe final set of cards is one of the more interesting mechanics "gold" in this game you don't directly control your characters they go where they please depending on where the paths you make go, or where the gold is. With the placement of gold or other treasures you can lure your adventurous little scamps down the path to victory, but with a lack of incentive your hero will often run of on their own attacking monsters at will sometimes this is fine allowing them to kill everything in sight can be good for loot but some monster are more of a challenge than others or for you character to go to or avoid "fountains".\n\nThe combat is one of the other interesting ideas in this game its done in a card based method, most characters have a starting hand size of 3 cards when the fight begins (if not under effect of buff which increases it), these cards come in many different varieties, but the main idea is each player plays a card and it is resolved and removed. Most will deal damage to the opposite side these come in two varieties magic (blue) and physical (red) these two styles of damage are important when it comes to blocking and the resolution of certain effects, but as an overarching comment blue can only block blue just as red can only block red. So I will basically explain the combat; the player gets to chose a card from their hand (note in most cases you are reacting to the opponent's card unless your under the blindness debuff where their card is hidden), one such card is the bruisers "get out of here" which is one red damage and one red block, which can be used to deal one damage and block one physical damage. Along with the various damage and blocking card there are cards which allow the drawing of extra cards along with other cards which can give damage when you next use a specific attack or healing abilities.\n\nAs to buff and debuffs there is quite a variety, "burn" causes one damage per round on both enemy and character, "blindness" prevents you seeing and reacting to them, others include frenzy which activates when the character or enemy is below half health and it causes physical attacks to have +1 damage. Or for the debuff "mundane" causes magic atracks to do down +1 damage to the enemy or "stupidity" which give an extra card a "stupid" or "umm" which are a blank card which obviously aren't good for combat, or at least takes up a spot in your hand.\n\n\nThe RPG/rouge lite effects of the game are quite interesting, at the start of each dungeon run or mission the character starts again at level 1 without any equipment, death has no real problem it just means you loose most of the loot and gold you gathered. As you fight through the level you will kill monsters and level up which cause an increase in health and for each kill you gain an option for selection of equipment which give the options for 3 different cards to the combat but this can be altered with certain abilities to give more cards. Overall you can equip 4 peices of equipment a helm/hat, main hand, offhand and a body: the equipment gives many options as i mentioned before which include extra health or extra cards for combat.\n\nApart from the dungeoneering you also have a small peice of base building in the form of the guild, this is where you spend your hard earned gold, you build buildings which either give other variations of heros or gives options for better gear to be found in the dungeons these are in three teirs initally which goes at the costs of 50/500/2000 gold.\n\nOverall its a good little game and now they have actually recently released a DLC for additional dungeons to explore along with additional character you can play, i certainly think its a good little game, worth a look at if you have the time Its well worth it.","November 2, 2015","true","7.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

So far so good, but once you finish the game, that's it, you can not play anymore since you've beaten all the missions.\n\nYou should really consider adding something like an endless dungeon mode with different difficulties and maybe boss card options, or make a heroic version of all the missions.\n\nThere's a lot of different combinations with blessings, heroes and loot that you can experiment and have fun with, so one of the above is definitely needed, even better if you can implement both.\n\nOverall the game is decent!","July 17, 2015","true","28.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","1"

This game is more of a brain teaser than anything and a difficult one at that.  On the surface the game looks simplistic and easy, and i could not disagree more.  Figuring out how the cards and traits will resolve into damage is the most important aspect of the game.\n\nThe game can be frustrating as you can get half way or all the way to the dungeon goal and lose your consentration, play one wrong card or neglect to account for a trait and you have to start over.  Be prepared to lose a lot of heroes... but don't worry because there is no hero progression other than unlocking new heroes and equipment outside of each individual dungeon, which makes sense for this game.\n\nI really liked it and if you do buy the game, READ THE TEXT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN DURING A BATTLE. If something happens like you lost more health than you thought, the answer will be there.","July 19, 2015","true","17.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The basic idea of crafting the dungeon as you move forward adds a very fun and interesting tactical layer to the game. Letting you progress in a way that you choose, from placing monsters, rooms, and amazing treasure. The game also sports a unique adorable art style and wonderful minstrel musical score. The over all game works very well and is designed well with no bugs that I found, despite a lack of an options menu. There are a few hiccups along the road though in the form of RNG(Random Number Generators). The game is focused on fast replayability and while this works for the most part, it also lends itself to getting screwed over occasionally with crappy loot. Having to repeat a dungeon over again until things work out in your favor. There is also a bit of confusion about movement but this is easy to overcome. Guild of Dungeoneering is sure to make you smile and entertain you but it lacks a certain long lasting feeling to it all. The game is somewhat of a gear treadmill with a fun battle system. This makes it great for picking up and playing and coming back to later. If you enjoy a unique combat system, crafting a strategy/dungeon/guild, and  tongue and cheek humor. You should check out Guild of Dungeoneering.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/qIB4XdHa6Ug\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","July 23, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Otherwise, the class system is clever, though later classes completely overshadow earlier ones.  Combat is strong.  You are almost always punished for doing something dumb.  The fountain cards were not clever.  They were bonuses when you didn't need one and penalties where you felt like you just wasted time.   The RNG is painful, when trying to get that piece of dungeon or that right level monster to move forward in the time limit.  That really could be fixed a bit.  It's not like not getting the right pieces is a fun thing.  That's not replayability, that's just painful.  So overall, I'd say it's a strong game, if you get your wish from the RNGenie.

It's usually something that cant always be avoided unless you get the right draw of cards. Windowed Mode is sometthing I'm looking forward to, hopefully it makes it run a little smoother aswell.\n\nI'd sometimes wish the cards played little animations/Sound effects when you play cards as in, if you play that "eyes closed" punch then your dungeoneer should animate that. Otherwise it can get pretty stale to watch over long periods of time.\n\nLastly is it possible to view your dungeoneers traits/abbilites before you buy them? Becuase I can only view that information when I'm in a dungeon with them and not prior. I love Cat Burglar and just got Ranger so trying to prioratise and not being able to see that information is a bit of a nuiscence. So perhaps an improved and more detailedl UI would also help aswell!\n\nOverall it's a cute/fun game with basic strategy elements to it but don't get attached to your first Chump unless you're feeling lucky. ;)\n\nP.S The bard/narator could do with improving his rhyme game.

Guild of Dungeoneering is a lighthearted, joyous take on old school dungeon crawlers with a few twists. The player takes on the role of a rather vindictive person who wants revenge after being thrown out of the prestigious Ivory League guild. The solution is to found your own guild and destroy the Ivory League in the process. Considering that your reputation is of a bit of a dunce, respectable adventurers won’t exactly line up to join your guild. So you spread the word around and take pretty much any chump who shows up. And that’s literally the first class available to you – Chump.\n\nOne of the first harsh realities that will become apparent very soon is that chumps are disposable. Seeing as how Guild of Dungeoneering features permadeath, the first thing your guild will need is a graveyard to house all the poor souls that gave up their life for your petty cause. And the graveyard will get crowded pretty fast. But there’s no need to fret as there is always another chump around to continue your quest. In fact, that is true for every class. As you acquire gold by successfully completing missions, you’ll be able to build your guild further and receive new classes and better items.\n\nAs you start adventuring, the first thing you’ll notice is the lovely sketchbook aesthetic which truly gives off a wonderful hand-drawn vibe reminiscent of pen and paper role-playing games. Guild of Dungeoneering utilizes a turn-based system with cards. The twist is that you don’t actually control your hero while exploring, you control their surroundings. Each turn, you can use up to three cards. With one type of card, you build the maze-like dungeon around the hero. The second type of card allows you to place monsters. The third and final card type provides you with loot such as coins and diamonds which you can drop to steer your hero in a certain direction because all heroes like shiny things. It’s a pretty cool system that provides just enough of a mix between tactics and randomness.\n\nIn battles, you take on a more direct approach. The card-based combat is rather basic and reminiscent of other single-player card-based games such as Card City Nights. There’s not a huge variety of minions and spells to use here such as in competitive multiplayer games like Hearthstone. It pretty much revolves around blocking and dealing direct damage. Cards utilize various combinations of physical and/or magic damage/blocking, card draw, health and a few other tricks. It’s not particularly deep, but it is entertaining and addictive. Each hero class and each type of monster has their own slightly different set of cards. Certain classes and monsters have unique traits. For example, Most Holy Grail Knight has the Retribution trait which allows him to deal 1 damage if he receives 3+ damage on any turn. Also, as you go through each dungeon, monsters will drop weapons, armor and other items based on their level. Equipping these will provide various bonuses and cards. It should also be noted that each dungeon run is its own separate affair, you don’t carry over levels or items, you start from scratch each time and as soon as you lose a single battle, you’ll have to do it over again. However, each run is relatively short, so it’s not a particularly big deal.\n\nThe biggest problem I had was that your success or failure too often comes down to pure luck. Sometimes a monster will spam you with unblockable attacks and there’s really not much you can do about that. Also, as I upgraded my guild, I made a few poor choices when transitioning from the first to the second tier of upgrades. Each tier offers new classes and items. Items are described in detail as to what they provide, but classes are not described in any way. Seeing as how I couldn’t plainly see any advantages of unlocking a new class, I decided to unlock beneficial items. That proved to be a mistake and I had a hard time during the second tier quests. So here’s some advice – unlock new classes first.\n\nI’ve already mentioned the art style, but another element that elevates the game’s presentation is the fantastic soundtrack. Each time you unlock a new class or you win or fail a mission, you’ll hear a short acoustic tune that describes the event in humorous fashion. It’s a small yet such a nice touch that really makes you feel like you’re sitting in some fantasy tavern listening to a bard sing of tales he picked up on the road.

Very addictive gameplay with lots of versatility.  The versatility comes with a large castle/base to build on and upgrade which opens up a ton of equipment options.  There's also different classes with their own traits.  The cards you play during combat are modified by the class and also the combination of equipment you have that you gain by exploring.\n\nI'd say it's priced fairly.  10 would be a bargain and 20 too much.  The graphics are crisp and clean.  The artstyle suits the whimsical style of the game and voice overs.\n\nNo bugs or issues so far.  I had one initially where the game did not load into fullscreen but I think that was because I launched it directly from the steam install window.  After restarting the game, it's never come up again.\n\nThere are no video options but I don't think you need them?  It's cards moving rather than animations so there's really nothing to affect by playing with video options.  Game is capped at 30 fps, which again, it's cards moving, not animations so there's no actual benefit to 60.  I'd rather have it capped at 30 than see frame variance if I'm playing windowed, which I do because of the casual nature of the game, since it's much more jarring.  Plus, I'd rather have it at 30 and see this come out sooner on mobile platforms.  Just a heads up if you're one of those people that needs big options and customzation menus because it's a game on a PC despite it being a small casual game.  The only thing missing is a hard option button for fullscreen/windowed that could even be a toggle on the main menu. I just use keyboard shortcuts because they're quicker and easier.\n\nI don't think you can go wrong with $15 for this if you like the casual or roguelike genres.","July 14, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I hate card games. To be more precise, I hate CCGs. The fact that someone can pretty much steamroll you only because he's got better cards is not fun. With that out of the way, this game is awesome! The art style, the music, the dungeon building and the combat. Yay for the card-based combat! The monsters have decks based on their levels and, well, type, you have your deck based on your class and dungeon progress and there ya go.\nNow don't get me wrong, the game can ♥♥♥♥ you. I've once lost to a level 3 monster. As a level 4. I've beaten this monster before as a level 2. The monster just drew cards I didn't have anything to counter with.

It is exactly what a game should be... Easy to Learn, but has just the right amount of challenge that it will take some time and practice to master it.  On top of that, it has a soothing, catchy soundtrack and lots of dry humor.\n\nThis is a card game, so I'm assuming you're looking at this game, because you enjoy card games.  It reminds me a little of carcasson, where you get to place your cards to create the playing board... in the same manner, you get five randomly drawn cards each dungeon round, and you choose three to place to create your dungeon.  Because you get to build it from randomly drawn cards, every dungeon is different and totally customizable by you the player.  It is rewarding on multiple levels.\n\nEven if you are defeated in the dungeon, you still get the rewards you collected along the way, and the dungeoneer gets a headstone in your graveyard.  I like this, because the only penalty for defeat is having to play the dungeon again until you complete the objective.\n\nThe battles with monsters are also card based. You have three random cards to choose from for your turn-based battle. Once you play your card, a new one is randomly drawn to replace it.  The loot you pick up provides equipment that has special battle cards to add to your dungeoneer's battle card deck... so there's still a reason to find bigger and better loot, just like in a dungeon crawler.\n\nJust like traditional card games are simple rules that take time to master (such as Poker, Spades, Hearts, or the like), you will find this one easy to pick up and hard to put down as you try to better and better your ability to play the game like a master.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone who loves card games, turn-based dungeon crawlers, or humorous casual games.","January 1","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is a good deal of luck and you can end up dying due to bad card draws, but that keeps in line with the theme of the game. Your Dungeoneers are mostly rubbish, particularly at first level. As you complete quests and clear dungeons you are able to unlock better classes and new loot options. Every time you go exploring your character starts over with no gear and just the base stats for the class. This means regardless of what you collected in your last run you have none of it. Part of the strategy of the game is gaining decent gear before you have to take on the end condition, which are often boss fights of a sort. I agree with TotalBiscuit that the game takes substantially longer to play than it needs to because of the animations but I don't really mind it that much. I spent the better part of yesterday playing the game and definitely see myself continuing. I love card drafting/deck building anyway and I like the challenge of starting out fresh each exploration. For some the price might be a bit steep for what could feel like a very repetative game.","July 19, 2015","true","12.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As you build his surroundings using the dungeon cards, he must simultaneously make hasty decisions in order to accomplish his quest.\n\nWill your hero rob the dungeons dry of their gold and loot? Or go on a blood thirsty rampage and kill everything in sight? The choice is, well, not entirely up to you.\n\nTHE GOOD\n\nI NEED A HERO\n-Your selection of heroes is about as classic as it gets. From the cat burglar to the methodical apprentice. As you level up and progress, you unlock tiers of the basic hero classes each with their own fighting style ready for you to exploit. The way you play your quest heavily relies on your play style so study each class carefully.\n\nDORK SOULS\n-Don't be fooled by it's cute and fun aesthetic, this game is as brutal and challenging as it is adorable. Each dungeon requires strategic planning and swift execution to accomplish each feat. From defeating bosses to looting large chests. You don't know what lies ahead in every corner. Fountains that drain you of your abilities, Zombies shambling to eat your brains, dead ends and timed attacks, every corner is littered with death and you only have yourself to blame. How could you put your hero through all this?\n\nFIGHT STICK NOT REQUIRED\n-Should you choose to fight your opponents, that alone is no easy task. Each enemy has their own set of abilities that enable(or disable) their potential power. They have strengths and weaknesses that you can exploit with a set of attack cards. You gain level and items that earn you new cards to add to your variety of arsenal. How you plan to use them is all up to you. This is turn-based card fighting at its finest. Oh, the game also fronts perma-death so don't get too attached to your heroes because you will die. A lot.\n\nSTRANGER THAN FICTION\n-The narrating bard will sing your every move. Kill your hero and he will taunt you and make you feel guilty. Succeed and he'll cynically praise your efforts but keep an open-mind of your impending doom. It definitely keeps me entertained and I find myself arguing with a software made to ridicule me. Sometimes his foreshadowing is creepy and bodes well with the atmosphere of unknowing. Needless to say, the soundtrack and commentary plays a big part in the game.\n\n_______________________________________________________________\n\n\nTHE BAD\n\nPLEASE SIR, MAY I HAVE SOME MORE?\n-I love this game and so far, I'm not tired of it. I'm scared of the day that I might though. Don't get me wrong, the game is not lacking or anything but I'd like a bit more variety and surprises because so far, it's literally the same missions over and over again. Now I'm not saying there is something wrong with that, there's nothing wrong with it, it's fun as hell! But there's gotta be something more to this right? We'll see.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\n\nTHE VERDICT\n-Guild of Dungeoneering is a unique experience. Emphasis on experience because it's more than a game. Any game that manages to keep me intrigued for 10 hours straight with minimal colors and modes has already achieved legendary status and I have ADD. It's fun, addicting and well worth the asking price. For any of you looking to challenge yourselves in the most non-threatening of ways(I didn't know it was possible to achieve this! Take that Dark Souls!) get this game and start crawling!\n\n\n\n\n9 out of 10 Rubber Duckies","March 7","true","17.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The artstyle is unique and interesting.  The music is fun and witty.  The story has a very light hearted touch and doesn't want to be taken seriously.\n\nYou dive into your first dungeon and they let you know just how expendable your first character you receive by naming the class "The Chump".   The battle system is very straight forward and the cards do a good job letting you know what it is and what it does.  Essentially this game is a deckbuilder game in which you always begin each dungeon at level 1 with the same basic deck in which you must upgrade via winning weapons and items from battle in which you can carry 4 different pieces of. Each class has a different basic deck and so if you get somewhat bored or find that a class is better suited to fight in the dungeon than you can change to that class and see new possibilities open up for you.\n\nThis game is GREAT...... until.... you get your character killed. Normally this is something you can kind of avoid but there are times in which you can't since there is some luck involved.  No problem though you get a free character of that class and off you go.  Oh? Your character killed again?? Well no problem there's more where that came from.  You quickly realize that losing a person is like losing a piece of hair.  There's no progression of characters at all.  The only thing you need to do is build up your guild until it gets really powerful and then win the game.\n\nThis game is basically a no stress game that may appeal to the audience looking to wind down and just have some plain fun.  However if you're like me who is a hardcore gamer that needs to feel challenged to have fun than this game is not for you and will eventually become boring.\n\nI am going to give this a thumbs up and recommend purchasing this game but hardcore players beware.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/J8RhSPPXFHo","May 8","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Which will generally take quite some time given that there is no hard cap on your time limit and you can just indefinately sit in most dungeons walking back and forth between two tiles.\n\nA lot of the game is very counter intuitive.\n\nExamples of this are that it is often wrong to unlock certain item pools, which will do nothing but increase the time you need to spend grinding to reacquire your deck. It's also sometimes, a lot of the time, wrong to take and a equip of a piece of gear with a relatively poor skillset as the cards it will do nothing but dillute your deck.\n\n-The graveyard being shuffled back in as your deck, lack of a resource system and lack of a maximum hand size seeminly make the best strategy to get Aracane IV with the smallest deck size possible so that you can cast Celebrate until you draw your entire deck then heal for 3* (4 as Alchemist) every single turn since the monsters average far less than 3 damage a turn over the course of a game. (If they did it would actually just be impossible given you can't remove chaff like do 1 unblockable damage from your deck).\n\n-There isn't a real feeling permanence with any of your soldiers as they get their stats/equipment reset after every mission.\n\n\n\nThat said for what the game seems to aim to do it is a good diversion. If I get another couple hours out of it I will be happy with the price point and the concept is really fun. My biggest complaint is that there isn't more depth/levels/items/monsters/cards so clearly the game has struck on something that is very enjoyable. ++","July 15, 2015","true","13.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The moment I played the tutorial version on the website, I knew I had to pre-order the game. I played the free trail several times and was pretty sad when it was taken down. XD;\n\nOn launch my husband actually played the game before I did, commandeering it from our Steam shared account and played it well after I returned home from work. I had to tell him to give me a turn, if that says anything about how fun and compelling this game is.\n\nThe game can be hard, my graveyard is filled with dead little adventures despite only playing a few hours. It can feel grindy if you're trying to reach the next tear of unlockables (pricing jumps 450 gil between the first tiers, for example). It is repetitive, but the presentation of the game and mechanics makes the repetition bearable (if not fun) for me. The gameplay is straight forward with a simple enough interface.\n\nThere is lack of game options-- but this is another plus, the devs are responsive and actively improving the experience of the game. This is something I appreciated back when I first pre-ordered the game, Gambrinous emailed me a standard thank you with a questionnaire, but then personally emailed me back to chat about the game and release status. I know it can be hard to communicate with the player base with everything that needs to be done, so I appreciate and really support devs who actively communicate with players.\n\nThe game is turn based, RPG, rouge-like, with treasure hoarding, card based combat system, and bonuses are applied through upgrading the player's home guild. It is snarky and great voice work for this type of game, with cute and quality simplistic graphics. Lots of people are streaming the game on twitch, so check out a stream if you'd like to see more gameplay before purchasing!","July 15, 2015","true","8.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

SOme contain room tiles, some monsters, some loot such as silver or gold coins, or gems.  Fighting is turn based, drawing cards which have a variety of effects such as physical hit for 1, Physical block for 2, etc. When (if!) you win, you can choose from dropped loot that has attributes, or gold instead.  Gold is spent between dungeons upgrading your Guild. As the game progresses more dungeoneers, monsters and loot becomes available\n\nThe music and amusing songs are also well done\n\nI highly recommend buying the game.

The premise of building the dungeons your heroes scour was an instant draw for me; simple controls too, only a mouse is required. It has a good variety of randomly aquired equipment, monster and terrain cards all drawn in a childish manner that you will rapidly warm up to.\n\nWhile the game is good overall it does have some issues that plague it, the first and most obvious being unable to access the options from the main menu screen. When you start the game you're given a brief tutorial that teaches you the basics but does little to teach you about advanced battle tactics. Sometimes during a quest the game crashes causing you to lose all your progress on that level, which can be be very disappointing when you're doing well. Another thing that was disappointing was discovering that you could not go back to previous levels, I was hoping to go back to the old levels to measure my progress against quests and bosses already beaten.\n\nThe DLC added many more quests that enabled you to fight new monsters, collect new equipment and recruit new dungeoneers. Unfortunately the pirate quests are easier than most of the main game quests. The new enemies are very interesting to fight though and there were a few times I had to get tactical with my way of thinking. The new dungeoneers while interesting in their own right, seemed a little too gimmick like and had no substance to them; against the trials of the third act they were especially outclassed.\nOnly one song was added from the the DLC, but like the rest of the track it is high quality and creates much atmosphere. The narration from the bard was well voiced and at times seemed exceptionally annoying, which seems like it was its every intent; however the miniscule options menu does little to help players enjoy either the voice acting or the music in any particular way as there is only a master volume slider and music volume slider.\n\nOnce the game is completed you get a giant heap of money that allows you to purchase the rest of the facilities, though this is more a formality as you can't redo quests to test the new dungeoneers which highlights the glaring issue of little replayability. Since the gameplay is relatively simple, playing as different heroes sometimes feels similar with only the synergy between character traits and a characters base card set to freshen things up. All in all, I enjoyed this game and would recommend it as a good, if slightly annoying time waster.","November 9, 2015","true","91.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's exactly what it is. First of all, don't get me wrong; it's fun, but there's not much depth to it beyond realizing that it's a deck building game and choosing your aquisitions accordingly.\n\nIf you like the gameplay you've seen of this game, you'll like playing it. That said, there are many pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1: Turn based gameplay - play on your time!\n2: Effect stacking and interaction is fun and rewarding.\n3: Class diversity is nice - different heroes have unique decks and effects to reward playing through multiple times and in different ways.\n4: Gameplay is unique and engaging.\n5: It's pretty replayable if you don't mind replaying mostly the same content.\n\nCons:\n1: The constant reliance on RNG for most of the game can be a blessing and a curse, having to restart over and over because you keep pulling bad cards is no fun but that perfect find feels so good.\n2: You can't save progress in the middle of a dungeon.\n3: Early in the game you have to save up for the next tier purchases for a long time and some people end up getting stuck because they end up getting countered by certain enemies and dying over and over.\n4: Once you unlock the next tier hero, the one you were using ends up never getting used due to difficulty scaling, which sucks if you like a tier 1 or 2 hero.\n5: In my experience, some of the heroes are just weaker than other heroes of the same tier (especially at certain parts of the game.)\n\nAfter playing through multiple times, I still feel like this game is incomplete. Everything is so temporary it feels like a beta or a game made under a time limit for a competition. There's no individual hero character stats or experience or consequence for their death. The story is pretty sparse, as well. Also, once you beat the game you can't even fight anything anymore. Dungeons close off when you beat them.\n\nEven after all that, I still think it's worth it. This game has entertained me longer than I thought it would, and I can see myself returning to it in the future to play through again. At $15 this game is a little costly for what it delivers (nowadays) in my opinion, but it's a fun, novel experience. I'd give Guild of Dungeoneering a D- for amount of content, C for content diversity, and B+ for overall gameplay and personal enjoyment.","August 17, 2015","true","47.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is a neat concept and worthy of praise within that on its own, however it falls short after that.\n\nThe game is terribly plagued by 'RNG' to levels of which you can have a losing streak of 100+ and there is absolutely nothing you can do. You can make the best possible choices in the game and yet the enemies will consistently draw every card they need while you fail to draw every single one you would need just to help you survive. Ontop of this you need to physically build your dungeon tiles with RNG drawn cards which can further screw you over and make it phyiscally impossible to complete the dungeons, Something the devs have commented they don't care about ever trying to fix.\n\nThe game is frustrating & a hindrance. I may have a short patience for such things but I feel as if the level of 'Skill and learning' ends so soon that you hit a point that your hoping and praying to win when in the end you simply get dealt the short end of the stick 9/10 times in which to some extent from what I've seen of the map is the only way to lenghten a very short game.\n\n\nOn the positive note however, Losing has no real impact. All levels & gear is reset on a mission per mission basis, Should a character die, they are just instantly replaced by another one who does the exact same thing, you can even rename them if it is what you so desire. You accumulate a tiny bit of gold even when losing as well.\n\n\nSo there is no real risk involved other than extreme frustration.\n\n\nGuild of Dungeoneering may be neat as something to play on a tablet per say between classes in college or on a lunch break on the job, but as a solid sit down and play game, This is far from it. I do not reccomend this to anyone and I would advise it be avoided, If you don't mind RNG to ludicrous extents however then by all means go for it, just be prepared for a long frustrating game.","September 29, 2015","false","6.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","1"

You can fail a mission but are not really penalized for it.\n\nCons:\n- You dont really have a lot of control over what is going on. Specifically:\n--- You dont control what path your hero takes. They just take the quickest route.\n--- There is no deck building, other than equipment cards you get on each mission (which are reset after missions)\n- The game lacks a lot of depth. For example:\n--- You place rooms down in the dungeon to decide your path. However, rooms themelves have no other function. Unlike games like Munchkin, there is no reason to place one room versus another other than getting to a specific place. It would have been far better to have 1) A "Special" room deck that got mixed in with other normal rooms with rooms that had perks or penalty trade-offs and 2) Have rooms/halls that maybe hurt you on the first turn on the next fight or gave you extra hitpoints, etc. Just any reason to make them special.\n--- The actual guild screen is customizable based on classes you unlock but serves no actual purpose in the game.\n- No persistance with characters at all. They level up in missions but then reset after the mission is over. The persistence is all in the guild, which isnt nearly as exciting as most of it is just unlocked classes.  I would much rather have character persistance and increasingly hard dungeons.\n-  While you can control what class you have (Class cards) and extra cards (Equipment cards), it would be nice to have SOME sort of deck building to feel like you are controlling the result a bit more. It just feels too random.  It also get harder as the game goes along (Enemies have like 3+ hits on you almost imnmediatley) and all you can do is choose a class.\n- Success feels like hitting a wall enough times (failing) until you finally win.\n\nOverall, a fun game that could have been a lot better. Not bad or great, but i can see someone really not liking it.","December 8, 2015","false","16.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

For those of you that like games like Munchkin or even Dungeons and Dragons, you COULD enjoy this game alot. But if you like those games for the team-based gameplay, then you won't get that here. Imagine you're playing DnD IRL with a group of friends. You've each picked your class and whatnot. Now the DM tells each of you you have your own missions; go into seperate rooms and play by yourself against this deck of enemies. Thats pretty much how this game is.\n\nPLAYER/DUNGEONEER GAMEPLAY\n\nYou play as the DM, but you're only providing a game for one character at a time. You get plenty of characters with different classes/abilities to match - but only one of them matters. And most ppl will find the one they like and just use that one for everything. Which is fine; except some dungeons have enemies that favor magic or physical - which may counter your favorite character...\n\nGood thing all your characters start EVERY game at the same level. This is an interesting idea - assuming you dont care about team growth and like the randomness of refarming in each dungeon to gear up your little dungeoneer for each quest/boss. This is sadly what makes the game EXTREMELY repetative very early on - because you don't get that magic of watching a character/class/team member grow and evolve as you delve deeper. You just buy MORE and more classes - adding to your roster - but thats not really a big deal because A) You can only use one of them at a time  - and B) If they die, you immediantly get a replacement. Which means almost nothing since theyre gonna come in at the base level that ALL of your guys are at all the time anyway...\n\nDUNGEON GAMEPLAY\n\nThe deck/card aspect is pretty good. You're characters ATK options are determined by a deck composed from their class and gear earned in that dungeon (specifically; it resets when quest is done) - and the dungeon around you is also built by some predetermined deck for that dungeon in particular. The Dungeoneer tends to do their own thing based on the goal of the mission - but its pretty easy to  bend them to your will by using the dungeon builder cards - so its not really an issue once ou get the hang of it.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe game is super simple - has a decent randomness affector - and cute little dialogues from the narrator and such. But it doesn't provide much challenge and it makes you play DnD by yourself and FEEL like you're playing DnD by yourself.\nNot alot of people want to play a board game by themself - which is what this is EXACTLY. As a BOARD GAME it would be fine cuz you play it once in a while, build a dungeon real quick - challenge yourself and whatnot- then you win and thats it. For a video game it has the capability to do so many more interesting things; but it just doesn't. You'll have to spend hours farming lowbie dungeons and such to get the those long/interesting dungeons; but if this was a board game you could just learn to play then go straight to a good hour long adventure or so without playing what feels like 50 tutorial games to finally feel accomplished when you beat the real game.\nStory is super generic and minimal - team play is non-existant outside of you buying the next upgrade for your guild - but a least its cute 8 year old drawings will make you smile. :)\n(8yr old in its simplicity; not that its bad art - it fits the theme rather well)","July 14, 2015","false","1.6"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

You don't even get to control the guys moves inside the dungeon (well not directly, most of the time it felt as if I was dangling a carrot in front of a donkey to get the guy moving to the direction I wanted it to).\n- You don't get to keep any levels or items (?) so everytime you enter the dungeon it's like starting the game over..? I simply don't get it, could be that I'm missing something. Even if you finish a dungeon as a lvl 4 with multiple items, next time you go into a dungeon you start with lvl 1 with zero items and armour.\n- Not that much character customization (since you don't get to keep anything other than the gold) and the home base improving isn't that great either.\n- My characters have died a few times and when I return to base, the dead guy gets replaced with a new guy of the same class. What's the point since the characters don't differ from each other since they don't get to keep any levels or items. There's no losing condition in this game (?) since it doesn't seem to ever end, you could keep on grinding till the end of your days.\n- No help menu to be found, also very bare bones tutorial.\n- Too much clicking too, when purchasing home base improvements you have to click each time on the buildings/upgrades to see what you are getting.\n- I accidentally found out how you can see the cards that each class has. At no point was it pointed to me that you can actually do that.\n\nUnfortunately not gonna keep this one when I have "Darkest Dungeon" in my library. This doesn't feel to be worth of 15e, sorry. It has nice style but when you get right down into it, there are so many flaws and missing stuff in the game it almost feels as if it's being released too early, unfinished.

It's fun to weigh your options w/equipment (even if it's easy and occasionally a no-brainer.)\n- Cheeky dialogue, cute/clever art style.\n- The developers are committed to supporting the game with improvements, fixes, and new content. They recently laid out a HUGE road map of exciting things to look forward to.\n\nCons:\n- The balance between the classes seems a bit out of whack. They're all different but some are "strictly better."\n- While I can appreciate a game that doesn't want to hold your hand, it's pretty easy to misspend your Glory points early on and find yourself hitting a wall where suddenly it's too difficult to progress. I ended up starting over with a new save file to avoid needing to grind Glory. Pro tip: Unlocking a class in the next tier is always the most important thing to be saving Glory for (until you have a Tier 3 class of course.)\n- The bard, while charming at first, gets a little old. Would be nice to have an option to turn off the singing but keep the dungeon BGM on.\n\nOverall I had a lot of fun, especially given the $15 price.

In my best run, I was able to complete all of the quests (including those of the Pirates Cove expansion) with but three hero deaths. This is quite an improvement over the thirty heroes taking dirt naps in my first game.\n\nThere is a depth of strategy to this game on many levels. Yes, two or three quests leave you at the mercy of the card-gods. (If the path cards you need in those quests do not turn up within the first three turns, you are screwed and your hero is as good as dead.) Be that as it may, the vast majority of quests can be completed with the right hero, the right equipment, the right skill selection, and a goodly measure of cunning play. When these are in place, it makes for a *very* satisfying game.\n\nNow for a few hints on game play. Stop reading here if you prefer to discover things on your own.\n\nUse your first couple of games to explore the guild-expansion trees where in are found new heroes, new equipment, and new skills. Discover which hero on the third tier you like the best and which equipment is best suited for his or her style of play. Is he a brawler, a healer or a magic user? (My favorite is a magic-user, the Cartomancer.) Then, on your next game, play with the understanding that you do not need to (nor should you try to) buy everything in the game. Doing so will only clutter your hand and make it more difficult to find the equipment your hero needs to defeat the tougher monsters and complete the quests. Spend your treasure wisely and obtain your chosen tier-III hero as quickly as you can. Select those skills, lesser heroes and gear which best compliments this goal. Once you have your favorite hero and gear-set in hand, resist the temptation water down your deck with useless clutter. Buy heroes, if you wish, (the songs of introduction are fabulous) but let them watch from the comfort of your guild as your champion does the heavy lifting.\n\nUpdate: The newly added 'battle scars' feature changes this dynamic and make the game even more challenging. Your favorite hero will accumulate scars as they quest, making their continued use very hazardous to your body count. While not all scars are negative and while some scars can be ignored by one hero class or another, enough scars are harmful so that you will need to retire frail old heroes and bring fresh blood on line if you hope to keep your body count down. It is a challenge to judge which hero is healthy enough to risk on a given quest. You will need to manage your treasure even more carefully than before, as well as master several classes in the game. Trying to avoid equipment clutter becomes increasingly difficult because different classes of heroes thrive best with differing equipment sets; and there is no way to select which equipment sets are active once you buy them. Your body counts will climb. But don't despair. You are the Guild Master after all, and fresh adventurers are easy to find when your favorite grizzled old heros meet their inevitable end.\n\nIn some quests you will be chased by a boss-monster which you must fight when he catches you. Before this happens, you must level up and find the gear you need to withstand his attack. Learn how to control where your hero moves, how he is lured by chests and gems and gold, by monsters, shrines, and by unexplored passages. Keep him moving away from the boss and fighting creatures his own size. Throw monsters directly in the boss's path to slow his pursuit and gain you extra time for gearing up. Be very careful how you place dungeon tiles on these chase quests, lest you confuse your hero and cause him or her to run to their doom.\n\nA few quests require you to reach a particular square before time runs out. Learn how best to place the tiles dealt you so to allow for placement of the widest range of future tile cards. Try to avoid getting in to the position of needing one particular card, such as a right-hand elbow, where in you truly are at the mercy of the card-gods. If you can avoid painting yourself into a corner, most of the time the random selection of cards which turn up will work out just fine in the time allowed.\n\nSome quests give you a set number of rounds before the boss attacks. Don't worry overly much about these quests. Gear up and you should be fine. However, sometimes a boss of this type will be weaker if you can reach him before he attacks. This can gain you a handy advantage.\n\nMy final hint is this: If you find that the Guild of Dungeoneering is your type of game, consider buying the Pirates Cove expansion. It adds additional quests, creatures, heroes and cards to the base game. While the game itself does not change, the additional quests can earn you more gold and more leeway in leveling up your skill-trees before facing the final challenges in the game. Besides, having more qusts is just fun. Enjoy!\n\n-Sci_1","November 13, 2015","true","145.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Forget about playing it for longer than an hour in one go, it should be rather played 30 minutes per day maximum.\n\nIt is quite similar to Desktop Dungeons:\ngo for short adventure\nearn gold\nexpand your base which allows you to start in better position:\nunlock better blessing\nunlock new character classes\nunlock new items to be found during adventures\nThere are elements of CCG (collectible card game):\nthere are multiple skills spanning over levels 1-4, each level gives you unique card during battle\nskills can be increased by items which you find during adventures (head, off-hand, body, weapon)\nsome character classes have single skill at level 1\nevery character class has ~6 basic cards, different depending on the class\nThe graphics is cartoon-ish but it is really pleasant to the eye. Also, the soundtrack is very good.\n\nDisadvantages: There is a lot of grinding in the game. Income from exploring dungeon, collecting treasures and killing monsters (which sometimes adds up to 50-100 gold) is far too small comparing to finishing quests (usually 50, but sometimes 1-4k). And tier 3 buildings cost 2k each. As a result, the only reasonable way of gaining gold is to just rush through the quests.\nYou cannot replay quests. Once you complete them all, you have to start over from scratch.\nSome bugs in the descriptions and mechanics. Skills do not trigger when they should, sometimes they trigger when they shouldn't\nHow the hero chooses path is very unclear, is it random? And fighting monsters instead of going to quest objective when the timer is ticking I would call a bug. There is also no path-finding implemented - if you make a corridor 10 squares long, with the hero on one end and unexplored part on the other end, the hero will be wandering randomly instead of going straight to unexplored part.\nThere is no AI in game, all opponents' actions are random. Player has a hand of cards, however opponent's are just drawing a single card and playing it immediately, they don't have a hand to choose from.\nOverall the game is too simplistic and although I enjoyed playing it, it is not worth £15. However, if you can get it on sale for £5 - go for it.","November 6, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am not one of those who pretend like only a 10/10 is a good score).\n\nPresentation, visuals, sound - especially how everything is narrated in rhyme - artwork and animations are awesome.\nThe combat (Card game style) is well done and easy to understand, yet with enough complexity to keep you going.\nThe Hub world progression system is also quite neat.\n\nSo where is the flaw in the thing?\n\nIt's the RNG. Games like Binding of Isaac or FTL always have a lot of RNG, BUT this game is pure RNG. After your first few battles you will have enough knowledge about the game to always pick the optimal move... and yet even if you do everything perfect you will sometimes still lose. The most times I had to redo a dungeon was 16 times. And that was a dungeon that was timed and I often couldn't reach the objective because the game wouldn't spwan pieces that would fit the maze.\n\nAlso it's quite unfortunate that you can't replay already done dungeons. I'd love to beat them with the late game champions that are way stronger than the early ones. But all you can do is start a new game and start from scratch. No New game+.\n\nBut It is still worth playing in my opinion. The fact that I lived through the rng shows that much.","October 16, 2015","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For me I'd primarily call it a turn based rogue-lite (with a card style battle system). The RPG elements are fairly minimal as well.

Essentially you are a good for nothing guild master who wants to raid dungeons without going yourself, thus you expand your guild and hire dungeoneers to do it for you. Once you enter a dungeon, you build it with randomly drawn cards (5 per turn, 3 of which you must play). You can place loot, monsters, and rooms to build the dungeon. You have little to no control of where the dungeoneer goes. Once in combat, you play cards from your hand to deal combat/magic damage, shield, heal, or draw more cards. There are special abilities and skills as well. Once you defeat a monster you will be given 4 options to choose 1 from. Either way, plan on having a graveyard as once you leave a dungeon, your dungeoneer looses all his/her previously gained loot and gear. Overall, the game is interesting and is something that kids could play pretty easily.","August 1, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is way too random number generator dependant; Both in and out of combat.\n\nCombined with long time to restart levels, this makes it very frustrating and unfun. It gets worse later in the game when you can't even strategize properly as most enemy attacks are unblockable, either because they do mixed damage or have unblockable property. You just have to be extremely lucky to out damage your enemy before they kill you. Also, enemies always attack before you unless you have a unique class, which makes  you auto fail on the last round if the kill you before you kill them.\n\nIf you are stuck need to grind money for upgrades, it takes forever as you gain pitful amounts of money  for failing. Now, I know failing is part of the narrative and theme of the game, but getting 15 money for failing and needing 2000 for the next upgrade is frustrating.\n\nThere are elements of a great game here, but balance feels very off and I can't recommend it in its current state.

Got exactly what I expected, which was what the promo videos advertised. This is a low-frills indie with a lot of personality. I wish it was longer, but it more than delivered on the price point. Might go back if they produce more DLC and sell it at a point I don't mind grabbing a bunch to breathe new life into it... as it stands you get 3 regions of content with a 4th offered as DLC.\n\nPlays like a board/card game -- in a fun and interesting way. Monsters and characters have a starting "deck" of abilities and the gear you find gives and takes away different cards and bonuses... it's easy to pick up but has a lot of depth. People who like CCGs (or appreicate their mechanics) will find combat in this game as enjoyable as I did. Basically you have health, attack and defense moves. Cards you play do physical or magical damage, physical or magical defense, and grant or subtract health and cards from you or your foe. There is also unblockable attacks and attacks that "first strike" out of sequence. coupled with some interesting class abilities combat has a lot going on in it -- harder or easier starts, greater or weaker apexes for different classes, and advantages and drawbacks that make things like enemy selection thoughtful and meaningful.\n\nIt's a good game. If there is a heaven for Indie developers that do not use the title to ♥♥♥♥ on the consumer, these guys are going there.\n\nRecommended.","January 14","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Being able to pick your course to a goal?\n- Non-linear development. I realise I can choose which types of items I get first, but they are all so bland it makes little difference.

It is way too random number generator dependant; Both in and out of combat.\n\nCombined with long time to restart levels, this makes it very frustrating and unfun. It gets worse later in the game when you can't even strategize properly as most enemy attacks are unblockable, either because they do mixed damage or have unblockable property. You just have to be extremely lucky to out damage your enemy before they kill you. Also, enemies always attack before you unless you have a unique class, which makes  you auto fail on the last round if the kill you before you kill them.\n\nIf you are stuck need to grind money for upgrades, it takes forever as you gain pitful amounts of money  for failing. Now, I know failing is part of the narrative and theme of the game, but getting 15 money for failing and needing 2000 for the next upgrade is frustrating.\n\nThere are elements of a great game here, but balance feels very off and I can't recommend it in its current state.

Got exactly what I expected, which was what the promo videos advertised. This is a low-frills indie with a lot of personality. I wish it was longer, but it more than delivered on the price point. Might go back if they produce more DLC and sell it at a point I don't mind grabbing a bunch to breathe new life into it... as it stands you get 3 regions of content with a 4th offered as DLC.\n\nPlays like a board/card game -- in a fun and interesting way. Monsters and characters have a starting "deck" of abilities and the gear you find gives and takes away different cards and bonuses... it's easy to pick up but has a lot of depth. People who like CCGs (or appreicate their mechanics) will find combat in this game as enjoyable as I did. Basically you have health, attack and defense moves. Cards you play do physical or magical damage, physical or magical defense, and grant or subtract health and cards from you or your foe. There is also unblockable attacks and attacks that "first strike" out of sequence. coupled with some interesting class abilities combat has a lot going on in it -- harder or easier starts, greater or weaker apexes for different classes, and advantages and drawbacks that make things like enemy selection thoughtful and meaningful.\n\nIt's a good game. If there is a heaven for Indie developers that do not use the title to ♥♥♥♥ on the consumer, these guys are going there.\n\nRecommended.","January 14","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is expected that your first chumps will be lost to rats and ghosts as you progress, pathing the way of future heroes in the blood of said chumps.\n\nThe play is built around a basic card game as you progress through a dungeon which is mostly based on chance, if you're feeling lucky this might be a good way to burn a few hours. The writting in fantastic and funny with little tunes which describe your success or failure throughout your misadventures, at one point I had a chump with a stick and a paper crown who defeated the vile rat king.

For me I'd primarily call it a turn based rogue-lite (with a card style battle system). The RPG elements are fairly minimal as well. You can put on new equipment during a dungeon run, but that only gives you some extra cards, health, or a unique ability.\n\nI really like the unlockable characters and their unique strategies. The game difficulty seemed to be just right for me as well. It took about 17 hours to finish the single player campaign, and I'm actually still wanting to play more so I bought the DLC right away.\n\nThe strategy can be fairly deep as well. Late in the game you can have quite a few active abilites. In my last game I had the following:\n\n-Negate all damage if I'm only receiving 1.\n-Deal 1 magic damage to the enemy if I receive 3 or more\n-Deal 1 damage if I can block all damage in 1 turn\n\nThe enemy also has quite a few unique abilites, so it's quite a bit to keep in mind as you make your moves.\n\nAll in all, this game has a lot of great elements. I'd mainly recommend it to people who like Rogue Legacy or FTL.","April 3","true","19.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/recommended/317820/","raixel","raixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raixel/","495 products in account","TL;DR: The art and writing is awesome and really unique. The game kind of reminds me of Munchkin. If youve ever played that game and liked it, you'll like this.\n\nLong story short. Build your guild by getting gold. Adventure to get gold by building the dungeon using cards. Attack enemies with different attacks using cards. Get inventory to give you different cards in your attack deck. But that explanation really really doesnt do this game justice.\n____________________________________________________________\n\nI saw this game and when I saw "card game", I ignored it for a while. But then I got bored and the pickings on Steam had been slim lately. I decided to pick it up.\n\nIts a "card game" in the same way Hand of Fate is a "card game". Meaning yes, its a game, and yes there are cards. But just saying its a "card game" doesnt do it justice.\n\nFor starters, let me just say the game is really unique and stands out among your typical indie fare. Seems like a lot of indie coming out nowdays are kind of spins on the same thing. Granted, even the 15th voxel built (or 2d pixel)  open world crafting game or the 53rd RPGMaker SNES JRPG  even comes *close* to the "same $59.99 game, different skin" run of the mill churn of the AAAs, but still.\n\nLike dont get me wrong, I love certain indie genres, pixel art, etc. I'm not knocking indie games, thank whatever deity you want they exist at all.\n\nBut its refreshing to see a game that looks and feels like nothing else. Its got great tongue-in-cheek sarcastic writing and narrator and the art has this great "someones telling a story by doing pencil drawings on pieces of paper" feel.\n\nGameplay basics:\nSo you start. You have a card, put it down and youve got a barracks. A little adventurer shows up. Now, you can expand your guild (which takes gold) or go adventuring. Since you have no gold, you adventure. You get a hand of cards. Some are treasure cards, enemy cards, or room cards. Your little adventurer is standing there, maybe theres some half built rooms nearby. YOu need to get him/her some gold and loot. You can play 3 cards a turn. Put down a room and that square gets drawn in with the room featurs. Drop an enemy and some treasure. Now send your adventurer in there.\n\nYou get a hand of cards with various attacks and defenses (physical/magic). Some cards have specials, such as heal HP, force opponentr to discard etc. So does your enemy. You play them against each other until one of you is dead. Death is permanent for that adventurer, so be careful. If theres treasure, you may get inventory cards (aka loot). Grab what you want, loot the room, and the next turn happens. Play your cards (or dont if you dont want to), move, fight, loot. Keep doing this until you beat the quest goal, whatever that may be. Take the gold you earned back and pick new stuff for your guild, weather its for fighteres, thieves or mages. Put down rooms and items to attract stonger adventurers and boost their stats and abilities.\n\nSo far, its fun. Simple enough to pick up and play, but strangely addictive. The combat is the one weak point, its just a matter of back and forth, hoping you get the last hit in first. I'm hoping as I get better guyys it wuill become more interesting, because right nowm its "I do 1 HP (you have around 5 total), he does 1 HP, I do 1, he does 1, and so forth.\n\nAnd did I mention ithe arts pretty cool and unique?","November 4, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The sound design is nothing short of amazing and the gameplay, while at first outwardly simple, can surprise you with its hidden complexity. It has an incredibly cute aesthetic but this should not deter more hard-core gamers as this inherent 'cuteness' is almost a parody of itself, as the game use much in the way of dark humour to threaten and bet against your 'cute-little-dungeoneers'.\n\nSeriously, I recommend this game.

The gameplay is fairly straightforward for anyone who has played Card Hunter or Hand of Fate. Premise of laying out a dungeon and having the AI wander onto your creatues to gather gold and items. The combat is fairly simplistic and easy once you get the hang of it and differs only slightly. My biggest issue is the price. Well the gameplay and music/art are fun and well thought out there just isnt much depth to the game to justify $15. If the game where offered at a more reasonable price $5-$10 range I could have been pursaded to stick with it. But after only a few rounds of play I felt like I had figured out the game and knew where it was going in regards to leveling characters and your guild. A noble effort but falls short in longevity and depth.","July 14, 2015","false","0.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The jist of it is simple, the style is somewhat cute and the way the game plays makes you feel like you are in control at all times, which is nice. Problems arrive once you realize the game doesn't go that far with it's ideas.\n\nSure you have upgrades and unlockables but it never really feels like new stuff is being brought to the table - just more of the same. Powers have no animations, sounds are extremely simple (I'm not kidding, there must be one or two sounds for your attack powers) and although some parts have voiced songs, it get's annoying after the third time or so. Maps and monsters change, but again, there's little added than just another image and another objective.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice game, don't get me wrong. You will get your share of fun, but for the price it asks I don't feel I should recommend it.

There is no real punishment for losing a Dungeoneer in a mission, and they never (permanently) get any stronger.  All experience and items are reset to zero every new mission which feels kind of pointless.  The only real progression in the game is building more rooms in your guild hall which is much less rewarding than it sounds, and unlocking new missions.  The missions also get stupidly difficult later in probably because there is no real penalty for failing.  This has the effect of making winning feel more like blind luck of the RNG of what items you happen to find and what moves you get and your enemy decides to use rather than any sort of skill or strategy on the part of the player.\n\nLike I said, it's kind of fun but I wouldn't buy again.

With simple graphics and amazing music it does create a very immersive experience. Even people that didn't recommend the game stated that they found themselves playing for hours before they didn't like it.\n\nThe bulk of the gameplay is quite repetitive and is VERY difficult sometimes especially with randomly generated loot and deck mechanics, but at it's price point it is a very good game that feel complete with very few bugs that I was able to find. You will die a lot, but that game isn't too punishing on death so you can laugh about the terrible ways you just got slaughtered. There is also a light problem solving mechanic as you try to build a dungeon with a deck of random rooms where you end up excited for figuring out a way through in te least favorable circumstances. I rate it a firm 8/10.\n\nYouTube Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EUz_14FRTo\n\n","July 21, 2015","true","7.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I love the cards. Making dungeons is fun, and the tutorial dungeon is fun.\n\nIt's after the very first dungeon it all falls apart. There is no actual progression for your characters. They lose everything after each dungeon, so you have to rely on upgrading yhour base to get anywhere. The first tier characters are entirely without any worth and will only take up space further along the game, I can only imagine the same thing happens to second tier characters too. First tier characters easily get steamrolled in dungeons as you don't have any direct control over them, their AI is absolutely horrendous. There is a path to go around a decay fountain, they will still go straight through that debuff and QUESTION ME for doing so. I place some gold to divert them from the end goal because they're not strong enough to fight yet, they don't give a ♥♥♥♥; they rush to their death and my loss.\n\nThe idea is good on paper, but the execution is pretty bad.

The first problem I have with this game is the way it rewards you. The truth is that the game doesn't really reward players for going through the dungeons. Each dungeon you enter starts your character completely fresh.After you've defeated a creature in the dungeon you gain equiptment. After the dungeon is completed all that loot you've gained from that dungeon is taken away. Eventually you're back at your guild with nothing really to show for it. Sure you're able to upgrade your guild, but really all upgrading does is add more characters for you to play as. The difference between characters is fairly small. They all have cute different card titles. but a lot of the abilities on the card are the same as other classes. The classes in this game, don't really feel like they're getting stronger as you get further in the game. Improving your guild is pretty pointless and all the other characters don't seem to improve the game much. This game suffers from an overly simplistic card game mechanic and that's really where the game threw me off from truly enjoying my experience. Building your own dungeon was something that I thought was the most unique part of this game. The only issue with making your own dungeon, is that the movement in this game happens to be very on rails. You're not allowed to choose the part of the duneon you want go through. It tells you ahead of time where you'll be walking, but it's by force the way it puts you through a dunegon. I wish I had more control in where I moved in the dungeons and that my room placements weren't just to waste my turn. The game still has promise, but it needs more rewarding factors as well as more different card variety. It's still worth a look at, but at a much lower price.","July 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","2"

It's not fair to compare this to time-sinks like Binding of Isaac, DayZ or (god forbid) even CS, but the real tragedy here is that this _could_ be so much better (and hopefully will be in a few months).\n\nThe biggest problem with the game is repetition, no replayability and lack of difficulty once you have the proper unlocks.\nThe game even taunts you with the lack of new-game+, by giving you 10.000 gold at the very end (alot), but no levels to play with; you can't even replay any dungeon you have completed.\n\nRight now, there is proper framework, which will give you a few hours of enjoyment.

The only way around this buying equipment, but you need gold to do that, and my dungeoneers keep dying because they're being put against level/rank 3 enemies in the new parts of the dungeon sections I unlock, while being shoved back to level/rank one, making gold difficult to come by unless. I don't think I can go back and redo the other parts of the dungeon to farm gold, I didn't see the option to do it.\n\nSo basically you don't get stronger while the enemies keep doing. You don't keep your equipment so you start off with bad attacks/blocks.\n\nThis is a really, really bad mechanic. I'm basically replacing the character after every dungeon because they start off at the beginning rank every single time.\n\nIt's not a bad idea, it's even fun at the beginning, but it very much needs improvement in order to gain recommendation. It is not worth the $15 price tag it's asking for. Wait until its $5, or at least until they improve the game.","July 16, 2015","false","1.0"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

You don't control your hero directly, but you do have to fight his/her battles in simple and frequent card duels.\n\nThe big problem with the game is that it feels very, very grindy. You don't build any kind of a connection with your heroes since they're entirely disposable and their stats and loot are wiped clean between every 5-15 minute run. The only lasting commodity is gold, which you use to buy some rather expensive card upgrades and new character classes.\n\nThe classes offer some variation to the gameplay, but not nearly enough. The combat mechanics are way too simplistic to offer any kind of challenge or reward after doing them for the 100th time. If and when you fail, the game is also quick to taunt you with various tunes that quickly turn annoying and make you question the point of kicking the player while he's down.\n\nI liked the aesthetics of the game initially, but even the graphical side the game ends up offering very little variation. It's all just doing the same thing over and over again.

If I compare the two, I remember being much, much more excited playing Darkest Dungeon. Why? The dark atmosphere, more depth in combat and somehow I felt more attached to my characters. I guess the dungeoneers lack vividness, they just sit there with their goofy looks like pawns in a boardgame. I can't even see their stats/perks outside of a dungeon (except for the fact that they all have a name and 5 HP, how nice)! At this point I don't even know if it matters if a dungeoneer dies...\n\nPROS:\n- Cute art style.\n- Funny narrator.\n- Different characters and enemies/challenges might prove interesting, but..\n\nCONS:\n- So far the amount of content seems a little small for the price.\n- Not enough depth in combat.\n- Repetitive gameplay after the first hour.\n- Game settings are non existent at the moment (might be patched soon though).\n- The game does not feel skill based at all, just use your common sense to prevent/deal the most damage.\n- Died to RNG too often, not topdecking the right defense/healing cards isn't fun.\n- Expanding your dungeon does not add anything to the game, except for expanding your deck. There is no sense of discovery while unlocking things as in the game Bastion. It just feels like a long grind to get 15k gold to unlock everything.\n- Can't see character stats in game except while in a dungeon. I want to know these things before I start a dungeon!\n- Can't see how much gold I gathered during a dungeon.\n\nThis game has much to learn from Darkest Dungeon.\nThere are more interesting alternatives to play, especially for this price.\nI might revise this review when the developers patch in new content.","July 16, 2015","false","11.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I've bought over 2,000 games in that time. Guild of Dungeoneering is one of the least fun games I've ever played. It's not the worse game, not the worse in terms of how it looks or sounds, but in terms of fun; it's just plain not fun.\n\nI love RPG's, and generally the basic formula of what makes a RPG fun is exploring, killing monsters in entertaining and graphic ways, finding loot, collecting items, and leveling and improving your characters skills and abilities.\n\nThe reason GoD isn't fun is because it fails at so many of these "must haves" to make a good RPG.\n\nExploring: Exploring is kinda fun in this game, but there really isn't much of it. You leave your guild and go directly to a dungeon, which you then build; no real exploring. The building is ... meh ... not so great.\n\nKilling: Killing monsters is pretty much unrewarding as well. The combat system is faily simple; an expanded version of rock / paper / scissors. It's about the best aspect of the game other than the music and the style of the game's artwork. It would be fine if the game was fun or interesting; it's not.\n\nNow for what is really, really bad about this game; ie. everything else.\n\nLoot:  Finding loot ... it's irrelevant, non-existant, a total fail. You have four, COUNT THEM, four item slots for equipping things. No back pack, no storage, no collecting anything. You can equip something you find and use it for the dungeon you are currently in with your current character, but that's it. You leave the dungeon all your equipment is gone! No selling things, no improving them or modifying them, etc. Gone; Poof! So lame. You can use the gold your find to improve your guild hall so you can have the priveledge of finding it randomly in dungeons; YAWN.\n\nCollecting loot: There isn't any to collect. Um what? Yes that's right, no real loot. The basis of every legendary RPG is finding epic gear. GoD thinks it's not a component of a great RPG. Wrong !\n\nLeveling your character and improving skills and abilities: Without this what is a RPG? The answer: Not worth playing. There are no skills, no abilities, and no leveling. You can "temporarily" level up the current chararcter in the current dungeon, but if you survive and go back to town you loose EVERYTHING! You keep nothing. You STAY a level 1 character with no gear, no skills, no abilities; forever. You can improve your guild hall to get a different character class and that gets you a new level 1 character with a different deck of cards to use while fighting. BUT, and that's a big but, that character stays a level 1 too, with no gear, no skills, and no abilities. EPIC FAIL !!!!!\n\nGee what fun; NOT ! That's the whole point, it's not fun. The game teases you into thinking this looks cool, has a catchy opening musical theme, but that's it, it's a total illusion. It could have been a terrific game if it had any substance to it at all, but it doesn't.  It's not like a castle defense game, or a RTS game, where building up your guild hall is fun and exciting, it's just pointless grinding to get gold to buy more "things" that aren't any more fun than what you had to begin with. I even watched some videos of the game and read as many reviews I could find and I still made the horrible choice of spending money for it. Shame on me, but hopefully you won't be fooled.\n\nBottom line: If you don't mind spending $15 for 2-4 hours of frustration and disappointment I guess you may want to try it, but it wouldn't be a good choice. I've spend less than $1 on steam sale games that are more fun than GoD, and with 100 times less frustration. It would require a total rework of almost every aspect of this game to make it fun and I seriously doubt that is going to happen. :(","July 16, 2015","false","8.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Pretty much you watch as some vengeful ♥♥♥♥, who was kicked out of his previous guild, tries to get revenge and be better than his last. That involves building his own guild and then hiring nimrods who are (According to the game) dense, stupid, greedy, and all-around feeble. Not a great cast huh? Well, it doesn't matter because all the characters you unlock are expendable and when they die, it just pops out another for you to use. No penalty. None. I'm nut even sure that 'leveling' a character (or whatever it tracks outside the dungeons) actually matters other than what gets written on their tombstone.\n\nNow, the game isn't stupidly difficult. No, instead it relies on a fantastic random number generator that, even with a high level character (They level in dungeons), a great hand, a good strategy, and all the patience in the world IT COULD ALL GO UP IN FLAMES. All progress on that quest lost and POOF. Start over. Mook dead. Aww well.\n\nThe problem is that this "quest, level, die, repeat" thing has me wonder if I'm not missing SOMETHING. I feel like my mooks could be stronger or something. I beat the first dungeon and a handful of quests, but the rest just curb stomp me with crap luck.\n\nThe art style is neat, it looks handdrawn, but oddly enough ALL the characters look female. Even the first mook it give you, despite it may be a man, has visible boobs. What's up with that? Otherwise, the characters fall under the typical "Jack, Warrior, Mage, Thief, Bard (Or mime)" formula where Jacks are the crap starter, warriors are all physical, thiefs have potent extra effects, mages use magic, and bards (or mimes) use a mix of magic and physical. It's nothing new or revolutionary.\n\nI wish I could give this game like a middling score. I would say 6/10, the graphics are neat, the premise (simple but effective) works, but the faux difficult keeps me from trying and failing repeatedly. So, yeah, 6/10.\n\nWould I recommend it?

I found it addictive to play. Completed it in 10-11 hours.\nI do wish there was more content. I expected there to be more dungeons to clear, since the map would clear up when you unlock new dungeons.\nI would also like the ability to go back to cleared dungeons or have some sort of practice dungeons, so that I can test out the characters I unlock. I ended up just using the same character through the second half of the game, because I did not want to risk buying another character.\nThere is some luck involved, as it is a card-based game. However, you can always just start the dungeon again, since the characters you unlock will remain (just as a different dungeoneer). My graveyard ended up having about 30 dungeoneers. You also learn what to expect from the monsters as you keep playing.\nThere were a couple bugs here and there, but none were game breaking.\nOverall, I would recommend this game.

Simple and challenging, very easily approachable, but I have already noticed some dungeneers are better at certain areas than others. That combined with the perk bonus and the randomness of the maps and the semi-perma-death aspect makes the game VERY deep, and I could see countless hours being enjoyed in game very easily.

I've bought over 2,000 games in that time. Guild of Dungeoneering is one of the least fun games I've ever played. It's not the worse game, not the worse in terms of how it looks or sounds, but in terms of fun; it's just plain not fun.\n\nI love RPG's, and generally the basic formula of what makes a RPG fun is exploring, killing monsters in entertaining and graphic ways, finding loot, collecting items, and leveling and improving your characters skills and abilities.\n\nThe reason GoD isn't fun is because it fails at so many of these "must haves" to make a good RPG.\n\nExploring: Exploring is kinda fun in this game, but there really isn't much of it. You leave your guild and go directly to a dungeon, which you then build; no real exploring. The building is ... meh ... not so great.\n\nKilling: Killing monsters is pretty much unrewarding as well. The combat system is faily simple; an expanded version of rock / paper / scissors. It's about the best aspect of the game other than the music and the style of the game's artwork. It would be fine if the game was fun or interesting; it's not.\n\nNow for what is really, really bad about this game; ie. everything else.\n\nLoot:  Finding loot ... it's irrelevant, non-existant, a total fail. You have four, COUNT THEM, four item slots for equipping things. No back pack, no storage, no collecting anything. You can equip something you find and use it for the dungeon you are currently in with your current character, but that's it. You leave the dungeon all your equipment is gone! No selling things, no improving them or modifying them, etc. Gone; Poof! So lame. You can use the gold your find to improve your guild hall so you can have the priveledge of finding it randomly in dungeons; YAWN.\n\nCollecting loot: There isn't any to collect. Um what? Yes that's right, no real loot. The basis of every legendary RPG is finding epic gear. GoD thinks it's not a component of a great RPG. Wrong !\n\nLeveling your character and improving skills and abilities: Without this what is a RPG? The answer: Not worth playing. There are no skills, no abilities, and no leveling. You can "temporarily" level up the current chararcter in the current dungeon, but if you survive and go back to town you loose EVERYTHING! You keep nothing. You STAY a level 1 character with no gear, no skills, no abilities; forever. You can improve your guild hall to get a different character class and that gets you a new level 1 character with a different deck of cards to use while fighting. BUT, and that's a big but, that character stays a level 1 too, with no gear, no skills, and no abilities. EPIC FAIL !!!!!\n\nGee what fun; NOT ! That's the whole point, it's not fun. The game teases you into thinking this looks cool, has a catchy opening musical theme, but that's it, it's a total illusion. It could have been a terrific game if it had any substance to it at all, but it doesn't.  It's not like a castle defense game, or a RTS game, where building up your guild hall is fun and exciting, it's just pointless grinding to get gold to buy more "things" that aren't any more fun than what you had to begin with. I even watched some videos of the game and read as many reviews I could find and I still made the horrible choice of spending money for it. Shame on me, but hopefully you won't be fooled.\n\nBottom line: If you don't mind spending $15 for 2-4 hours of frustration and disappointment I guess you may want to try it, but it wouldn't be a good choice. I've spend less than $1 on steam sale games that are more fun than GoD, and with 100 times less frustration. It would require a total rework of almost every aspect of this game to make it fun and I seriously doubt that is going to happen. :(","July 16, 2015","false","8.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Pretty much you watch as some vengeful ♥♥♥♥, who was kicked out of his previous guild, tries to get revenge and be better than his last. That involves building his own guild and then hiring nimrods who are (According to the game) dense, stupid, greedy, and all-around feeble. Not a great cast huh? Well, it doesn't matter because all the characters you unlock are expendable and when they die, it just pops out another for you to use. No penalty. None. I'm nut even sure that 'leveling' a character (or whatever it tracks outside the dungeons) actually matters other than what gets written on their tombstone.\n\nNow, the game isn't stupidly difficult. No, instead it relies on a fantastic random number generator that, even with a high level character (They level in dungeons), a great hand, a good strategy, and all the patience in the world IT COULD ALL GO UP IN FLAMES. All progress on that quest lost and POOF. Start over. Mook dead. Aww well.\n\nThe problem is that this "quest, level, die, repeat" thing has me wonder if I'm not missing SOMETHING. I feel like my mooks could be stronger or something. I beat the first dungeon and a handful of quests, but the rest just curb stomp me with crap luck.\n\nThe art style is neat, it looks handdrawn, but oddly enough ALL the characters look female. Even the first mook it give you, despite it may be a man, has visible boobs. What's up with that? Otherwise, the characters fall under the typical "Jack, Warrior, Mage, Thief, Bard (Or mime)" formula where Jacks are the crap starter, warriors are all physical, thiefs have potent extra effects, mages use magic, and bards (or mimes) use a mix of magic and physical. It's nothing new or revolutionary.\n\nI wish I could give this game like a middling score. I would say 6/10, the graphics are neat, the premise (simple but effective) works, but the faux difficult keeps me from trying and failing repeatedly. So, yeah, 6/10.\n\nWould I recommend it? Probably not.","July 17, 2015","false","2.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

At the start of the quest your deal about 5 cards that can be either rooms, gold, or monsters and you must place atleast 3 cards down every turn and try to lure your adventurer to the room/place you want him to go. If you encounter a monster you enguage in a turn-based card battle with various attacks and skills which can be changed depending on buffs, cards, location, etc. Once you have completed you quest you return to your guild with spoils which you can use to purchase upgrades and new room for new adventurers.\n\nI had to stop play after an hour or so. My friends that have the game tell me to give it a few more hours to "get into it", which I don't understand. If I can't get into it after an hour, why keep playing a game that I don't enjoy?\nSome people like to put this game in the rouge-like section with the fact that once an adventurer dies, well, there dead. Sadly, the only thing that seems to make one adventurer diffrent from another is class and name, Besides that, there all the same with the same standard deck build.\nAnother reason I will not say this game is a rouge-like is because when you die in a rouge-like, it's normally your fault. You didn't plan accordingly, you didn't do something in the order that it should have been done, YOU ♥♥♥♥ed up!\nWhile in GoD, you have no control over the cards in your base deck. Buying upgrades to your guild adds new weapon in armor cards in the dungeon and can't be added to anyone beforehand. The game then throws monsters with cards that seem more than unfair at most times, if not just bottom line cheating.\n\nOutside of the unfair Rouge-like elements, the game fails to offer anything new, with the only good thing to come out of it is the soundtrack, which seems to fit with the theme of failure.\n\nAll-in-all, save your money for something else, there are tons of other games on Steam that are better then this.","September 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Fun was had. I love this game's quirky attitude to dungeoneering. You own the guild and build the dungeons, but you don't get to tell your dungeoneer where to go.  You can bribe and cajole him though, with the promise of wealth, glory or death. As long as you take the time to understand his psyche. Dungeoneers are a crazy lot. So you need to be crazier. You need to learn to be better at the game through the delicious process of repeatedly dying when you make bad decisions with your cards. Think before you act. You'll be surprised how well that works! What else about the game I love?  The irreverent writing. The cheeky puns. The endearing artwork. The spirited music.

Although you can't dictate where your adventurer explores, you can tempt them to move in a certain direction by placing treasure or monsters that they can kill.

As it is, I refunded after playing for abour an hour, and would say, briefly:\n\nFor ME it was not what I had hoped to get, but if YOU are just looking for a nice, simple dungeon crawler and can live with some of its limitations, you might enjoy GoD much more than I did.\n\n---\n\nThe game's concept, while not unique, is really pretty cool. You have an AI-controlled hero exploring a dungeon, which YOU build around him. You place down corridors, monsters, special events, and your hero then acts accordingly. Sounds great, doesn't it? I expected there to be all sorts of tiny differences between hero classes- maybe a Thief would always go for gold, maybe even putting himself into danger? Or a Ranger would probably move themsleves into good sniping positions? I saw myself considering how to place cards so that my hero would survive and level up and that sounded amazing.\n\nNothing of that. The main idea is: Room with monster is a no-go. Room with same monster and any amount of treasure however: Let's go there. It's almost irrelevant how you place down stuff. Your hero will always act more or less the same.\n\nEven worse: Not only are all heroes the same, even the classes make relatively little difference, at least early on you just don't get that much of a difference between a Bruiser and a Mime, yet on paper they are "Fighter" and "Spellcaster". I admit, I did not play very long, and there probably is more to the class system, but after spending my hour throwing Hero after Hero into a dungeon where my building made little difference, I lost hope a bit.\n\nThere's also no permanence to anything. You keep no equipment, your Hero resets to level 1, you just return with some gold. That made it even harder to actually get invested into my tiny AI lemmings.\n\nStill, I admit that the game just disappointed ME, probably because I expected such a lot of it. The core rules are simple and easy to get into. The combat, while simple, works just okay. And the art IS charming as hell.","July 17, 2015","false","1.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's perfect if you want a slow-paced day.  The advancement, though, is incremental.  Each battle will set you ahead, but not in epic proportions.  It's a nice, linear rise in power.\n\nThe art style is cute, sort of like Don't Starve.  The music is very much styled after what you might hear at a RenFair.  There's little bits of vocal commentary with each new addition and after each battle, win or lose, and it's pretty good.\n\nThe playstyle is Rogue-like.  Your characters don't seem to carry and advancement from one instance of a dungeon to another; all equipment and abilities are gained inside each dungeon.  That can offer some excitement as your favorite weapons or gear pops up, and keeps things from becoming a min-max grind.  What does advance through the game is what sort of loot you can find; as you unlock that, your little Dungeoneer finds nicer and nicer things.\n\nOverall, it's a really fun game if you like something that's a turn-based game with a cutesy art style and good voice acting that will take you several dozen hours to get through.  They're also adding an "endless" version instead of just standard dungeons, so that ought to help replay value.","July 19, 2015","true","10.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

(if you can appreciate the style)\nCustom music that is absolutely hilarious!\nGameplay is truly fun and addicting.\nPlays a lot like the card game Munchkin if you have ever tried that.(if you love that game. You will love this game)\n\nSummary of what I think about Guild of Dungeoneering\nThis game already holds a special place in my heart. I can see myself playing this game for a long time.\n\nThe game starts you off as a Guild leader who is sick and tired of being considered "grossly Incompentent by the Ivory League of Explorer's". After you decide to start your own guild of explorer's (so you can sit back and collect the gold just like your father taught you.) Now you are off on your own, bought a small piece of land in the "bad part of town". and you are ready to find your first chump to do your dirty work\nThis is not your ordinary indie game and it really shines through compared to any game of its kind. It puts laughs in all the right places and gives you the perfect amount of playability crossed with tactics. All put together in a beautifully hand-drawn world. What more could you ask for? 16.99? pfft.. I'd buy this game for $30.\n\nThere is a great skill system that works like you are adding new rooms to your guild hall. All of these add-ons which show up like cards in your hand can be added anywhere they can connect. Some of them grant you new Dungeouneers or special boons that help you when you are running through a dungeon. Each hero has different unique abilities that will help you in different dungeons. As you complete the game you start unlocking different trophies and cards you can use to your advantage.\n\nIf you happen to die in a dungeon (trust me you will) that hero is dead forever but you get a different hero of the exact same class (just looks different with a different name) shows up at your guild. Then the other one who died shows up in the graveyard with a funny flavor text underneath their name. It also shows how many monsters they killed and how much gold they earned. It really is an awesome addition to the game and makes it far more enjoyable.\n\n10/10Would sit back and collect gold from chumps again.","July 14, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

For me it's a mixture of many different games due to its mechanics. You start off with a person who wants adventure and finds a base where he can settle as a base of operations. Here after every adventure you can expand this base with new facility rooms that can produce chances for new loot during adventures, new classes of people you can use, and new pendants which give you bonuses every adventure. During these adventures you have a goal within a dungeon. It is a dungeon crawler but it's unique because you must build the dungeon around you and its obstacles and rewards, all through the use of cards. You have a hand of 5 cards of three types (rooms, monsters, and loot). Movement through the dungeon is turn-based by room and after every turn you have a new hand of different cards. When you fight monsters, the combat is simultaneus turn-based, where the enemy shows what action card there going to take and you must choose your reaction from your own hand. There is magic, physical, defense, speed, and draw more cards. It has a very satisfyingly simple strategic combat system. Each class have specialties with their combat decks, such as a mage having a mostly magic combat deck, etc. After every battle your health returns to full and you choose a piece of equipment that gives you a bonus such as specific combat cards or more health. There is permadeath in the game however there is no character progression in this game like XCOM or Darkest Dungeon, so when you lose a person it doesn't really matter because after a person dies, you immediately get another person of that class in your base to replace them. This is my only real negative toward this game, there's no real consequence to losing a person. The art style of the game is very enjoyable and reminds me of early Tim Burton or Don't Starve. The music is clever in being a bard that sings lymerics of your adventures and events. It's not my personal taste but I know many people enjoy it so I consider it a positive. No bugs for me thus far. Overall a very enjoyable game. 9/10","July 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A bit sad there isn't any post-game content to keep me going (like an endless dungeon or an infinitely repeatable quest?) Especially since there's an entire quadrant of the map where stuff could be but isn't.\n\nI did notice quite a few balancing issues, namely the dwarven explosives having more skills than some level 3 enemies in the same area. Also it is very easy to break the game with the arcane skill tree, since nothing in the game normally hits higher than 3 (and only a few bosses can hit for 4 once per cycle) you can effectively get infinite HP and unlimited damage, especially so with the Alchemist and Mathemagician who both have their own damage buffs and are generally easy to use on their own.

A bit sad there isn't any post-game content to keep me going (like an endless dungeon or an infinitely repeatable quest?) Especially since there's an entire quadrant of the map where stuff could be but isn't.\n\nI did notice quite a few balancing issues, namely the dwarven explosives having more skills than some level 3 enemies in the same area. Also it is very easy to break the game with the arcane skill tree, since nothing in the game normally hits higher than 3 (and only a few bosses can hit for 4 once per cycle) you can effectively get infinite HP and unlimited damage, especially so with the Alchemist and Mathemagician who both have their own damage buffs and are generally easy to use on their own. This game breaking becomes especially apparent with the cartomancer who, when combined with arcane 4 and the "wise" effect, becomes an unkillable and unstoppable death machine who can hit enemies for 13 damage without damage buffs and can effectively attain infinite damage with enough patience due to the "Focus" card in the Arcane set.\n\nThat said, I also found a few classes were notably underpowered and simply unable to do some missions without getting a perfect and lucky run, namely the Ranger, Artificer, Berserker and the Most Holy Grail Knight.","July 17, 2015","true","42.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is a little frustrating that every time I start, I get a newbie who has almost no perks and the characters only differ slightly. However, I bought this game for casual, every-so-often playing, so it's not as annoying to me as it would be for some other guys. Furthermore, I think the thing that frustrates me is that every time I try to play, the buttons at the bottom go where my task bar is. This kind of gets annoying that every time that I try to push a button, the task bar comes up and there's no way to change the screen size.\n\nHowever, gamewise, it's almost like a board game. Every time you go back in, you start afresh. It's pretty straight forward and it's kind of fun for really casual players. If you play this a lot, you'll get pretty bored fast, but if you're just wanting to play for a little bit just for kicks, this is a good game to kill time. Although, the characters could be a little smarter. Sometimes, they go in weird directions....","July 14, 2015","true","70.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've beaten the game and there is a lot of good going for this game.\n\n*The card game and rogue-like dungeon crawl gameplay elements are implemented pretty smoothly with each other.\n*The hand drawn map on graph paper art style is very attractive and fitting.\n*The bard songs are well done and humorous (the first time you hear them).\n*The same goes for the story of our fledgling dungeoneering guild vs. The Ivory League, very humorous and well done.\n\nHowever, in the end I cannot recommend this game in its current state.  Mostly because there is not enough content here.  The game got tedious and repetitive very early on.  It felt like a chore to finish it and I resorted to muting the game and going through the motions while watching TV.\n\n*There is just not enough variety in the items, characters, monsters, map tiles, quests, and cards.  About 2 or 3 quests in out of a few dozen you've seen everything.  Things just get a little bit stronger but are otherwise basically the same combination of 2 types of damage, blocks, card draw and healing with only a handful of additional abilities.\n*Aside from random fountains there is almost no variety in map tiles other than where they connect and this can cause frustration in timed missions when you can't draw the correct tile and have no way to mitigate bad luck.\n*The guild building is superfluous and pointless.  There is no effect or purpose to where you put different buildings and there are very few buildings to build besides the barracks for the different characters.\n*It is also incredibly frustrating that there is no way to preview the decks or abilities of new characters and you have to blindly pick them based on just character names when upgrading.\n*Finally, like I said, the bard songs are humorous the first time you hear them but you will hear the same ones many, many times before game end.\n\nIncredible idea here and some nice stuff in terms of art and tone.  It just needs so much more stuff.","July 28, 2015","false","15.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've lost more heroes trying the first level of the second world than I lost in the entirity of the first, and all of them were because I didn't get the cards that I needed, not by any playstyle fault of mine.\n\nUnless this is changed in a patch, perhaps by making your heroes' starting stats increase as the levels go by, then I don't think I'll be playing much more of this game.

There are too many characters I don't use, the gameplay gets VERY repetitive VERY early in the game. The cost increase between levels is too steep for smooth progression. You have to play a lot of things over and over again. I REALLY don't like that it's an ANTI RPG in many ways. Your characters get gradually worse until they die. That's not fun at all. I hate starting from zero every time I go into a new map. It's an ok game, but no where near worth what they ask for it. Oh yeah, and the music is probably the single best aspect of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/confanity/recommended/317820/","confanity","Confanity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/confanity/","69 products in account","This is a quirky game with a decent amount of heart and a surprisingly deep set of mechanics that I'm just starting to get the hang of, like how certain pieces of equipment synergize with each other and with class abilities. That said, there are several points that are ulmiately turn-offs when considering this game.\n\nFirst, there's a lot of swing that comes from the random mechanics. I've failed dungeons simply because they were on timers and I didn't get the right map squares in time. I understand that semi-random trial and error and death is a staple of roguelikes, but in this case it was just a series of increasingly frustrating moments that felt arbitrary and unfair.\n\nSecond, there's a lot of repetition. Even with varied classes and equipment, there are no real little surprises of the type that a roguelike-like really needs in order to have staying power. What's more, the reward structure (and some of the achievements) are set up to encourage spending a long time noodling around in non-timed dungeons, despite the fact that there's an upper limit in a given dungeon to PC and enemy power and the number of enemy types available. These issue unfortunately combine with the first point above to ensure that after a while, the thought of yet another dungeon becomes work rather than play, and I have to quit for a while because the game has become drudgery.\n\nThird, there's a lot of repetition. You're probably going to spend a lot of time repeating dungeons that you're not really ready to face, just because you need more money to unlock better stuff in your guild hall, and each failed mission means a mere pittance of cash trickles in. Unless you get lucky at all the right moments, you're forced to gind a dungeon over and over until you have the cash to buy the upgrade you wanted. And if you *do* get lucky, then congratuations! You're faced with the exact same problem when it comes to th next, incrementally harder, dungeon on the list.\n\nFourth, there's a lot of repetition. Part of the quirkiness is little details like things the characters say when they're hanging out in the dungeon, or the way the artwork is animated. These elements lose their charm at some point in the process, and that's when you discover that they're unskippable. (One specific animation in battles can be turned off in the options, but that seems to be the only gesture the programmers made toward solving this problem.) I fear that my current admiration for the game's "heart" will turn to loathing over time as I'm forced to watch every twitch of its increasingly forced-feeling systole and diastole.\n\nFinally (and worst of all, perhaps) every once in a while the game just gives up and stops working. I'm writing this review in part because it just crashed on me (not for the first time, either). Hasn't it been out for months now? Shouldn't they have cleared up all the bugs? I'm on a brand-new gaming laptop, so I doubt it's my computer's fault either. And of course, this problem exacerbates the others. There only thing worse, in the context of a game like this, than a long slog through a frustrating dungeon with your every step being opposed by the random number generator... is to have the game crash on you when you're close to done, destroying your progress and leaving you with the prospect of repeating the exact same slog.\n\nI really want to like this game, and I really want to be able to recommend it, and I'll keep on playing it every once in a while; the dungeon setup can be conducive to lunch-break play, after all. But any discussion of the game must come with the caveats above, and while it is relatively amusing and novel, there are probably better-designed experiences available, even in the casual roguelike-like genre, for the same amount of money.","November 16, 2015","false","44.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

You'll easily fail 30 quests before completing 10. Many times, you will lose for no fault of your own, especially since the paths you make around dungeons rely on cards drawn each turn. Quests that give a time limit to reach an area are often made impossible by your room card drops. Quests that require you to run away from the quest boss while leveling are made impossible when you draw no room cards on the first two turns. It normally wouldn't bother me to lose on random chance, but it happens way too frequently in this game.\n\nIn order to fully enjoy this title, you must go into it with the attitude that "Failing a quest isn't really failing" because part of the game is to die over and over and over until you get enough gold to die slightly less often, and maybe win a map or two.\n","November 6, 2015","false","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're probably going to spend a lot of time repeating dungeons that you're not really ready to face, just because you need more money to unlock better stuff in your guild hall, and each failed mission means a mere pittance of cash trickles in. Unless you get lucky at all the right moments, you're forced to gind a dungeon over and over until you have the cash to buy the upgrade you wanted. And if you *do* get lucky, then congratuations! You're faced with the exact same problem when it comes to th next, incrementally harder, dungeon on the list.\n\nFourth, there's a lot of repetition. Part of the quirkiness is little details like things the characters say when they're hanging out in the dungeon, or the way the artwork is animated. These elements lose their charm at some point in the process, and that's when you discover that they're unskippable. (One specific animation in battles can be turned off in the options, but that seems to be the only gesture the programmers made toward solving this problem.) I fear that my current admiration for the game's "heart" will turn to loathing over time as I'm forced to watch every twitch of its increasingly forced-feeling systole and diastole.\n\nFinally (and worst of all, perhaps) every once in a while the game just gives up and stops working. I'm writing this review in part because it just crashed on me (not for the first time, either). Hasn't it been out for months now? Shouldn't they have cleared up all the bugs? I'm on a brand-new gaming laptop, so I doubt it's my computer's fault either. And of course, this problem exacerbates the others. There only thing worse, in the context of a game like this, than a long slog through a frustrating dungeon with your every step being opposed by the random number generator... is to have the game crash on you when you're close to done, destroying your progress and leaving you with the prospect of repeating the exact same slog.\n\nI really want to like this game, and I really want to be able to recommend it, and I'll keep on playing it every once in a while; the dungeon setup can be conducive to lunch-break play, after all. But any discussion of the game must come with the caveats above, and while it is relatively amusing and novel, there are probably better-designed experiences available, even in the casual roguelike-like genre, for the same amount of money.","November 16, 2015","false","44.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

While I enjoy the concept, I'd have to agree with the folks who find it disappointing that your hard-won progress with a particular hero goes out the window after each trip through a dungeon.  While I was looking for something that didn't require the time and mental commitment of, say, Skyrim, I was hoping for at least a bit more than this.  Also, the apparent inability (I say apparent, because I haven't found a way to do it) to save in the middle of a session is a big negative for me.  Real life doesn't always allow the time to complete an in-game task before you have to leave.  I left my computer on with the game running over night, but by the next morning it had consumed around 1.6GB of RAM and most of the features had stopped responding, so I lost my progress anyway.  This "forced march" feeling seems to be completely at odds with the idea of a frivolous dungeon-crawler with disposable heroes.  Also, the voice-overs...?  No.  Just... no.  The music isn't bad, but the "narrator" makes me cringe.  It sounds like something from a children's movie.\n\nUpdate 9/24/15: Okay - I have to admit it's kind of fun and a bit addictive now that I've picked up the spirit of the game.  There are still things that are painful, like not being able to save in the middle of a dungeon sometimes, however I have also recognized that the extensive dungeons I was building were not necessary to accomplish the objectives, so perhaps I was going about it wrong.  I'm giving it a somewhat flaccid "thumbs up" now.","September 19, 2015","true","34.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

XD\n\n- Pros\nThe game itself is based on simple rules.\nIts very intuitive.\nUses a lot of strategy.\nThere arent many death penalties.\nIts REALLY fun.\nIts challenging.\n\n\n- Cons\nThis game, (the way I saw it anyway) depends a LOT on luck.\nEven though the graphics are fun ans really suit the game, They should improve it a bit.\n\n\n8/10\n\n\n---DETAILS---\n\nThis is a card-strategy game with elements of RPG, delver and dungeon building.\nThe story is prety fun so far and the characters are funny, they actually made me giggle a few times.\n\n\nLets split it a bit.\n\nSoundtrack: Simply awesome. Everytime a hero dies, wins a dungeon or when you start the game, the music just blows my mind. It really fits the atmosphere of the game! Congratulations to the developers! 10/10\n\nGraphics: Pretty cool, but not awesome. Its kinda of repetitive, even though whenever you equip a new equipment to a hero it changes the display, everything else stays the same. 8/10\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay consists on 3 parts:\n\n1. Building your guild.\nThe gold you get from dungeons you use to upgrade your guild, allowing you to get more heroes, blessings, different loot in dungeons. You can also check your graveyard and trophy room. Nice features, good mechanics to upgrade, but the visual effects and the higher tier upgrades cost are kinda of lame. 9/10\n\n2. Building the dungeon.\nAt the beggining of the "round" you receive 5 cards. There are creatures cards, dungeos area cards and treasure cards.\nYou can put 3 of them into play. The idea is to use these 3 cards to build the dungeon, place enemies and treasures for you hero to find. The cards you get are mostly based on luck. Wich SUCKS. Sometimes you only get stupid cards, like 3 areas that only connect to 1 area and 2 creatures that can kick your ♥♥♥ as encounters. I got to say that dependiong entirely on luck kinda bummed me out. 7/10.\n\n3. Movement of the hero and battles.\nYou dont control the hero movement, he ALWAYS take the shortest route to complete the dungeon objective. Easy to understand. The harder the dungeon, the longer the dungeon you must create for him to get there, but the cards you receive to create the dungeon are random, remember? This can SUCK sometimes.\nOk, now for the battle system. Its a card battle system. Each of your heroes start with a deck of cards that is the standard for that "class". You CANNOT change the deck before the dungeon. It's ALWAYS the same. When you win a battle, you will get some sort of equipment. The equipments will then add cards/give more health to your character. All the equipment is lost once you complete/fail a dungeon. So you always start with the same deck.\nThe battle themselves are fun, but sometimes EXTREMELY frustrating.\nYou start the battle with 3 cards and you can see the card that you enemy is going to play, with that you can choose the best card for the ocasion.\nThe battles are in "real time" by that I mean that its not turn based. When you chose your card, yours and the enemies card are used at the same time, unless you use a quick card, wich makes you use it first.\nOnce again, everything is based on luck, but that is to be expected, since its a card based battle, but it kinda takes a bit of the charm of the game. Since it is luck based you can be defeated by some stupid monsters, that you placed and was sure that was going to defeat it.  8/10\n\nGamplay overall: 24/30\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","4.2"," 21 of 44 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","21","44","0","1"

You build little dungeons and populate them with enemies and treasure for your adventurers to explore. You can guide them by placing treasure or by selecting some corridors over others.\nThe art is great and looks really cool.\nBut this game is REALLY lackluster. Not even a demo is this empty. And the price tag of $15 is way too high for what it offers.\nThe BAD:\n- The Game is slow, really slow.\n- There are no options at all. Not graphics, difficulty, not even windowed/fullscreen mode. Games made in Unity have this for Cthulu's sake!\n- The controls are bad. More than once the game do not register my clicks, making an already slow game, slower.\n- The fighting... is really boring. There are no animations, no colors, no anything. There is no difference between attacking with a  spoon or using a fireball beside a small text description at the bottom.\n- There isn't a tutorial, encyclopedia or help file to know what everything means (what is a blessing, how to improve statistics, how to level up, etc) nothing is explained.\n\nConclusion: This game has a lot of potential. Really. But for $15 you expect a more developed game and not something that rival Godus as an Early Access. Shouldn't have been released in this state. The developer should've waited a couple of months more and polish this gem that sadly right now is covered in waste.

The art style, the music, the general idea. Sounds great right? Yeah, but it fails at the most important part: gameplay. It is just dull, you move through a dungeon by laying down cards, monsters and loot, the monsters you fight give you loot which gives you better cards for your combat so you can complete an objective in the end. And the combat is just boring, you see the card the monster plays and just play the card that counters it if you happen to have it, no real stategy or planning involved. If you fail a dungeon, and your dungeoneer dies, it has no impact at all, a new one will appear and since you loose your dungeoneers progress after every dungeon it is literally the same guy that you just lost, its not like in darkest dungeon where your high levels dudes dying is devastating, in this game you don´t level at all, so meaningless permadeath. It´s a shame I was actually really excited to play this.\n\nTL;DR This game is ok as a mobile game to kill time on a plane I guess, but as a PC game it is just straight up BORING","July 15, 2015","false","7.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

A game that is a blend of Rogue Legacy, Hand of Fate and even some Carcassonne thrown in there simply cannot be bad, right? RIGHT!\n\nIn GoD, you play to simply get better items & gear. You build a keep that gives you bonuses, you send youe dungeoneers out to traverse dungeons, they bring you gold. Will they survive? Sometimes. Will you get gold? Definitely.\n\nThe game has incredible music and art. I love it. Playing the game is so much fun, even when I die, I never get frustrated. It doesn't feel dull or repetitive, even though I know there is some repetition in it (like all games). I think the fact that the map is always random, in terms of how YOU piece it together, really makes every playthrough different. It's awesome.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the game is that you cannot choose WHERE you go on the map. Your character seems to find the closest treasure and hones in on that. Maybe I'm mistaken, but I don't know if you can choose which tile you want to go to next. I hope there is and I'm just dumb for not finding it, or it's being patched in.

At the end of every dungeon you lose all that you have collected and at the next dungeon are forced to start at level one.

Sure, you can utilize different classes and traits and the randomness of each quest makes things feel different, but overall, you're doing the same exact thing every quest and even using a lot of the same cards quest after quest.\n\nThe progression leaves much to be desired.

In a respectable roguelike, continual RNG abuse can provide an extreme challenge and defeat most players, whereas there is simply very little skill actually involved in this game. As a player you can slightly alter your deck, but again the deck can just screw you. It's frustrating and random and all based on the luck of some simulated draw, and this is coming from somebody who enjoys Roguelikes like FTL and Gods Will Be Watching.\nIt just feels like the entire game is contrtolled by the deck, and early game there should be a fair amount of actual skill involved.

It has a nice art style, the combat system is fun and engaging, and the idea is pretty creative. However, there is one MAJOR problem.\nThe A.I. is completely idiotic.\nYou see, you don't directly control your "dungoneer" in this game. Rather, you try to set a path for him to go down and watch in anger as they go off that path to fight a monster they have zero chance in defeating. You see, the dungeoneer is attracted by two things: money and monsters, with money sometimes overruling monsters (I say sometimes because I've had times where I put money down to keep the dungoneer from trying to fight the boss, but they went ahead anyway). This means that, if they can see either of those in their line of sight, they will go towards them. However, often this will result in the AI going to fight a rat instead of going towards the objective which is right in front of them and that causes them to die and makes me lose the mission. It's annoying. And it ruins an otherwise good game.","March 25","false","4.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

As someone who loves games like Hearthstone and the iOS sleeper hit Dream Quest, this game is pretty much a dream come true.  A few of the highlights for me:\n\n+ Lots of meta-game/stuff to unlock.  Loved this in other rogue-likes such as Rogue Legacy.  From a purist standpoint, it's less rogue-y in that sense, but I absolutely love all the stuff there is to upgrade and unlock.\n\n+ I love the novel card battle!  The way it works is you equip weapons/armor/items, and depending on the item, it adds certain cards to your deck.  For instance, a club might add a 'Bash' whereas a staff might add a 'Fireball'.  Your class will also have certain traits, so choosing the right equipment becomes critical.\n\n+ Great selection of classes.  I've unlocked 4 so far.  The card battle system isn't SUPER deep, but there is a good amount of variation -- enough to make things interesting.  I always prioritize defense with the Bruiser, since he gets a bonus when defending against attacks.\n\nIf I could make one suggestion (and it might get better once I unlock more stuff), is I'd love to see even more variation and depth in the combat.  One of my favorite games, Dream Quest, is a card based battler.  What makes it interesting is there is just so much depth/different builds for each class that add a lot of replayability.\n\nOverall, this is a really solid (and really friggin challenging!) title that I can't wait to finish.

I believed it to be a dungeon romp where you EXPLORE EVERY dungeon and are not FORCED to play a certain way or timeframe.\n\nThere's a ton of TIME missions that you have to play to proceed in the quests. They are SILLY STUPID figure out the puzzle and make the TEMPLATE that MUST be played to defeat the game.\n\nYou have to sit there and count how many NPC's it will take an at what levels to get to the goal of the GOTDAM TIMED missions.\n\nBut, to be fair the actual DUNGEONING of the game when you get to play like you're in a DUNGEON is fun an addicting. Unfortunatly that ends not far into the game. All the timed stuff starts and hardly stops.\n\nSo, if you hate being RUSHED like I do you won't buy this game. I suggest SHADOWRUNNER DRAGONFALL as I'm playing it also and it's awesome. But, like just about every game it has it's quirks and faults. Too GOTDAM much reading and going back n forth. But, the combat is awesome and fun to play.\n\nI asked the DEV about the GOTDAM TIMED Missions and if he could take some out or leave some out in the next expansion and HE says to me (the customer) "SORRY "I" Like the dynamics of the mixed way to play in dungeoneering. Thinking of himself above the customer...can you believe that. They go and ask for feedback and then turn up their noses to it.\n\nREMEMBER DO NOT BUY IF YOU DON"T LIKE BEING RUSHED. ;))\n\nEDIT Nov 20th: Well just ad insult to injury now they have gone and really screwed up the game. They added in cr.ap like battle scars that only crap on your parade after every mission to the point your character is no longer any good or use. Everything is a negative to your stats just for completing a dam dungeon. Now how do you like that for stupidity. At least have some gd good traits one can get also for getting all scarred up.

Guild of Dungeoneering didn't feel like a mechanically deep enough game for me. There isn't much mechanically going on, you start each run with a select few dungeoneer who are basically preconstructed decks, and the strategy on what cards to play is pretty straightforward. The strategy of each dungeoneer varies a little, though it doesn't affect what is the best card to play all too much. The result is that, after knowing the strategy, it feels like you're just rolling dice and following a flow chart.\n\nYou do get loot during each run to build to your deck, but you don't keep the loot after the run finishes. The only sense of building your character is the gaining of an attribute, but most runs end with death by RNG, so that attribute doesn't last long.\n\nWhat did keep me playing was the witty songs that play after you get new characters, beat dungeons, or die. It's easily the best part of the game. But it's not enough to make up for the barebones card mechanics.","May 13","false","2.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

I normally love dungeon crawl games. This one has a very interesting card mechanic. I liked the whole battle with cards thing and the like paper and pencile art style is nice. I have to say though how your character moves is the WORST!!! In some stages you have to run from a boss while placing down new rooms, placing an enemy in the new room you created, while also placing an enemy infront of the boss so you can actually have the time to level up or the boss will just unmercifully stomp you. Guess what? You can only lay down three cards in dungeon mode. Oh did I mention your character also has a massive chance of saying screw that enemy behind me that I so desperately need to kill to level just stand a chance, and go straight for the boss fit three rooms away instead of the enemy in the room behind him... The first couple of dungens are fun. Other then that I wouldn't buy this game again or even suggest it to a friend with what I feel is a broken mechanic. I know part of the fun of the game is not really controlling the character, but when you can barely make it out of a dungeon or you have to restart it every two minutes because your character decides to take a stroll into the worst possible direction it gets old real fast.","May 9","false","2.5"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","2","10","0","0"

Overall, it was a really fun experience. It has a lot of charm to it which can be found in the music, humor, and art design. Gameplay is very simple to understand, but requires a little patience whenever you hit a difficult quest. You'll often find yourself thinking up strategies and mixing up class/item combinations to adapt to different obstacles.\n\nThis game is not without flaws. A few glitches here and there need to be patched out, but nothing gamebreaking as far as I have encountered. There is some amount of RNG factor involved, like any other card game, so if you're the sort of person who dislikes somewhat luck-based games, I wouldn't recommend this game for you. The game is somewhat shallow and repetitive; you will fight many enemies over and over again using the same attacks and abilities over and over again.

Every fight that I get in is stressful because you never know what is going to happen.  By that I mean, there have been several times that I have taken extra damage and lost a battle for no reason what-so-ever.  The game just randomly decides that I am going to take extra damage this turn.\nAlso, what everyone else is saying, this game is very repetitive and gets boring quick.  There is no consequence for losing, because you don't keep any level ups or items after you successfully complete a dungeon, and you DO keep any gold collected if you die, AND if you die you just instantly get a new dungeoneer to replace the previous one.....so what is the point.\nLastly, you really have no control over your character's movement.  I will place a massive gem and low ranking enemy in a room with a positive fountain, and my dungeoneer will instead go running straight into the room with the OP opponent and get into a fight they can't win.

The structure of the guild hall itself - the layout - doesn't matter, for example.  Dungeons are non-persistant, characters do not develop and are nothing to lose when they die, and characters don't seem to team together for dungeons.  Combat is a clever, elegant card game but it ultimately is too simple in terms of dyanamics and does not retain interest.  Some strategy is needed to select treasures, monsters, and classes in any given dungeon - but that's about it, and the 'technology tree' isn't deep.\n\nNow, the tech tree and so on could all be expanded and improved; but balance is difficult as systems expand.   It would be much more challenging to make many features ultimately 'matter' to the game, and the player.  If they do this and give the 2.0 and 3.0 to the current game owners, I would need to revisit the review.\n\n","July 21, 2015","false","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firstly lack of overall explanation of game rules and attributes hinders general understanding and strategy throughout the game. This often coalesces in relying upon unlocking the next tier of hero simply to complete a mission which would otherwise be impossible. Furthermore, there were many instances where I would seemingly barely beat an opponent, feeling proud of myself, only to quickly realize I had instead been defeated due to some unforeseen reason which is never explained. The game also comes to a sudden and anticlimactic end after completing a mere couple dozen of (rather generic) quest hubs. Due to the easy customization of maps and objectives, I was really shocked that there were so few quests to complete and then be booted to the menu with no option to continue exploring or expanding my “headquarters” which does nothing in reality other than add a few more clicks to my routine in selecting a quest. Finally, the character creation and recreation seems extremely mundane and unrewarding. If it were possible to stick with the same hero for longer or feel some sort of attachment to them, I would have enjoyed the game much more instead of just feeling like it was a throwaway NPC.\nHopefully some of these issues get fixed in the future but for now, it is not worth the ~$0.50/hour of gameplay I got out of my runthrough.","July 21, 2015","false","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is in the endless deaths of your lower level characters, the lack of advancement to allow you to gain a liking for characters as they fight their way through the system, and a loot system that only permits you to keep a few purchased abilities that you start to realize that this gem is lacking.  Sure - the idea that you fill the grave yard with hundreds of noobs as you try and get out of the beginning spaces is humorous, until you discover that you like them and you are frustrated by all of the work that gets no where.\n\nEventualy you advance, and your noobs who do not gain experience fall behind.  Then you leave them and pack up your rangers and barbarians, filling another grave yard.\n\nI would avoid the game in its current state.

If you hate the RNG then you may want to avoid this game. If you don't mind trying to bend RNG over to make it do what you want, it's all good. Just know often times you'll lose because RNGesus has forsaken you.\n\nSomething important to note, equipment gives you bonuses such as Arcane 1. It stacks with other Arcane bonuses to give you new cards. Example: head piece and weapon both give you Arcane 1, you'll have Arcane 1 and 2 spells.\n\nNext, get blessings!!!! You'll notice in the expand guild menu 3 boxes with 4 options. Box on the right is for equipment. Box 1 and 2 both have 2 classes and 2 blessings. My advise is to get the class you like then the blessing to add more hp for the first 2 fights. It'll make your start more bearable.\n\nLast, you can play up to 3 cards per turn. Doesn't mean you have to play any. Also you can hover over the enemy names to know what kind of enemy you're placing. Don't want to place an enemy with Leader (for every monster near it the monster gains +1 hp) in the middle of a bunch of monsters.\n\nGameplay:\nTurn based combat system using cards.

And I LOVE IT!\n\nArt:\nThere's pictures, It's honestly a simple thing of you like or you don't. I like it.\n\nMy main problem is the end. After you finish all the dungeons it becomes a file save of an award room basically. Outside of that I enjoy it. And the developers seem to want to add more content for the end. So personally I'd take it with a grain of salt because it's not out yet. Just a matter of how much you trust the developers.","July 22, 2015","true","20.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level of "Dungeoneering" is a clean slate; you begin at level 1 with no equipment or resources. Dungeon paths, enemies, and chests are placed by the player in order to best navigate to the boss or objective. Battles themselves are also turn based, and your deck of battle cards is determined by your class (a unique 6 card deck) and gear. Gear abilities stack: 2 pieces of gear with "fire" level 1 will add a fire 1 and fire 2 card to your deck.\n\nAfter completing a few dungeons, you can spend your gold upgrading your guild. There are typically 3 choices to upgrade: new classes, new items in the drop pool, or a blessing to start off your dungeons with. If you find your income to be a little lacking, don't despair. The final level of an area gives a bigger gold reward, and the plot dungeons give huge rewards relative to the dungeons leading up to them.\n\nOn the aesthetics side, the paper artstyle of the game is simple and charming. Every character has a set of unique dialog for engaging in battle or uncovering treasure. The voicework in the game is also well done. Every character has an intro song after unlocking, and there are 2-3 songs that mock your defeat if you are to die in battle.\n\nThe one improvement I would make to the game would be to teach how pathing works in the tutorial. Although you control the layout of the dungeon, your character will always move to the space s/he finds most "attractive". This is determined by the levels of nearby enemies, loot, whether the space has been explored yet, and proximity to the boss. I was able to figure it out after a few runs, but I feel it would be a big help to newer players to show them how to change course.\n\nAll in all, Guild of Dungeoneering is a great game and definitely worth a try. The game has about 15-20 hours of gameplay at the moment, more if you choose to replay to use a different class or item progression.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/recommended/317820/","PyroTyger","PyroTyger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/","458 products in account","TLDR: This game is sushi - lots of perfectly-crafted, clean little morsels made from fresh, simple ingredients.\n\nEach dungeon is a unique and light experience, everything laid out before you like a simple puzzle, and you absolutely will not be able to stop at just one. You will stuff yourself with "just one more" and REGRET NOTHING. And you will want to do it again the next day.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Send your little dungeoneers out on dangerous quests, then purchase Guild expansions with the loot (if they survive!) adding new dungeoneer classes and new equipment options, so you can tackle harder dungeons later.\n\nThat's just the overworld management, though. The real meat is in the dungeons. You don't control your dungeoneer, but you steer them each turn by dynamically laying out rooms, enemies and loot, from a random hand of five cards.\nWhen you meet an enemy, you fight to the death in a card-duel, playing from a unique deck composed of your class' abilities and any equipment abilities you've collected along the way. The cards each show a combination of attacking, blocking (melee or magic), healing & drawing cards, and a few special abilities, so each battle is a puzzle built from the pieces you've collected.\n\nOnce in a while the game will deal you a bum hand, and you just have to try again and make your own luck. However there's no penalty for dying, so you're invited to try different classes & strategies and see what works. Sometimes you crack it on the first try, through luck & skill, but I never found myself stumped for more than a handful of attempts. It's a really well balanced system.\n\nAESTHETICS: Papercraft and sketchy pencil art. It's clean and simple to be instantly accessible, but with enough character and to make it inviting.\nThe writing is full of little smirks & winks throughout. This is a game that really understands its pedigree, and how to poke fun while still getting you invested.\nAnd the soundtrack is fantastic for such a little game. There are little acoustic, bardic ditties after each event (win or lose, complete a chapter) that very strongly reminded me of the narrator from the Deponia series - a bit dark, a bit daft, with terrible rhymes and excessive gravitas.\n\nI was also really happy about the in-game representation. New dungeoneers are randomly assigned gender and race. There's almost no difference aesthetically as they're just little chibi charicatures, but you can tell, and these little touches matter.\n\nThere were a few bugs, but nothing game-breaking or upsetting, and I gather it's being developed further. More content, easier access to in-game information, and more replayability, all of which were on my wish-list when I'd finished the game. I'll usually delete a game from my Steam Library as soon as I've completed it, but I'll be glad to dip into this one again after the next update.","July 23, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the usage of different classes in the gameplay because if you know what kind of enemies you will be facing you can get the edge on your opponent using the class system, this system lets you use trial and improvement to find class combinations that work for every situation, I also like the dungeon pickups, I think that picking up weapons and armor as you complete dungeons is a very good idea, but I also like the fact that you have to build Blacksmith's and other buildings to make sure that you always find good weapons inside the dungeons.\n\nHowever, I think that both paid and free dlc packages should be released for this game giving you more guild members to choose from and definately more dungeons, but overall, I think this game has a very good substance to it and has allot  of potential, I urge whoever is reading this to buy Guild of Dungeoneering if you have not already!\n\nHappy Hunting","July 24, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/recommended/317820/","serializer","Mumra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/","236 products in account","I got very bored of this game very quickly. Which is a shame, because it has a lot of style. The art style is simplistic but well executed, and the way everything animates and transitions around the screen is very smooth and solidly done. I think it's a very nice touch how the dungeon tiles draw themselves on the screen.\n\nAt first I really liked the music too, it was nice to hear some guitar and vocals in a game soundtrack. Sadly that gets old very rapidly. It's the same song over and over. Then the singer has this habit of getting to the last word of every song and then just .................... pausing. Before finally saying the last word (like really really smugly). And then he chuckles. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It gets super annoying after about the 20th version of this you hear. He seems to pause slightly longer with each rendition. Sometimes he pauses so long that I've forgotten the rest of the line by now and the last word makes no sense. And can somebody please tell him that it's generally considered really bad form to laugh at your own jokes. Especially when they're not very funny, nor even jokes for that matter.\n\nSo presentation aside, what about the gameplay. I mean, what gameplay. Good gameplay is about giving the player meaningful decisions to make. This game doesn't have any decisions. A battle consists of either being lucky enough to draw a card that will let me win, or not doing. If I don't draw a good card then it might be literally impossible to win this battle and I'll have to start this quest again. It just feels like I have no control over winning a lot of the time and with certain classes, and when I do win it was just because I got lucky. This doesn't make for a satisfying game experience. Sometimes your hand size gets reduced and then you don't even have three cards to choose from, you might be down to only 1 card. Draw a card, play it. You don't even get to choose. And why on Earth can't the characters keep their gear or levels after a quest? This one thing would make the game so much better, at least then I would stand a chance in some of the harder dungeons. Although equipping gear doesn't even always make much difference, a lot of gear just gives you a chance of drawing certain cards that are slightly better than your character's base cards, doesn't help one bit if you just have bad luck and draw bad cards.\n\nOverally I could only recommend this game if it was in a sale and if you like unlocking things very very slowly. But you should probably just go and play a proper dungeon crawler instead. As for me, I'll be getting a .................... refund.

Combat is a clever, elegant card game but it ultimately is too simple in terms of dyanamics and does not retain interest.  Some strategy is needed to select treasures, monsters, and classes in any given dungeon - but that's about it, and the 'technology tree' isn't deep.\n\nNow, the tech tree and so on could all be expanded and improved; but balance is difficult as systems expand.

Firstly lack of overall explanation of game rules and attributes hinders general understanding and strategy throughout the game. This often coalesces in relying upon unlocking the next tier of hero simply to complete a mission which would otherwise be impossible. Furthermore, there were many instances where I would seemingly barely beat an opponent, feeling proud of myself, only to quickly realize I had instead been defeated due to some unforeseen reason which is never explained. The game also comes to a sudden and anticlimactic end after completing a mere couple dozen of (rather generic) quest hubs. Due to the easy customization of maps and objectives, I was really shocked that there were so few quests to complete and then be booted to the menu with no option to continue exploring or expanding my “headquarters” which does nothing in reality other than add a few more clicks to my routine in selecting a quest. Finally, the character creation and recreation seems extremely mundane and unrewarding. If it were possible to stick with the same hero for longer or feel some sort of attachment to them, I would have enjoyed the game much more instead of just feeling like it was a throwaway NPC.\nHopefully some of these issues get fixed in the future but for now, it is not worth the ~$0.50/hour of gameplay I got out of my runthrough.","July 21, 2015","false","26.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is in the endless deaths of your lower level characters, the lack of advancement to allow you to gain a liking for characters as they fight their way through the system, and a loot system that only permits you to keep a few purchased abilities that you start to realize that this gem is lacking.  Sure - the idea that you fill the grave yard with hundreds of noobs as you try and get out of the beginning spaces is humorous, until you discover that you like them and you are frustrated by all of the work that gets no where.\n\nEventualy you advance, and your noobs who do not gain experience fall behind.  Then you leave them and pack up your rangers and barbarians, filling another grave yard.\n\nI would avoid the game in its current state.  It has so much that could make it the addictive title of the year - but likely someone will have to learn from this game and make a newer model next year.","July 21, 2015","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every level of "Dungeoneering" is a clean slate; you begin at level 1 with no equipment or resources. Dungeon paths, enemies, and chests are placed by the player in order to best navigate to the boss or objective. Battles themselves are also turn based, and your deck of battle cards is determined by your class (a unique 6 card deck) and gear. Gear abilities stack: 2 pieces of gear with "fire" level 1 will add a fire 1 and fire 2 card to your deck.\n\nAfter completing a few dungeons, you can spend your gold upgrading your guild. There are typically 3 choices to upgrade: new classes, new items in the drop pool, or a blessing to start off your dungeons with. If you find your income to be a little lacking, don't despair. The final level of an area gives a bigger gold reward, and the plot dungeons give huge rewards relative to the dungeons leading up to them.\n\nOn the aesthetics side, the paper artstyle of the game is simple and charming. Every character has a set of unique dialog for engaging in battle or uncovering treasure. The voicework in the game is also well done. Every character has an intro song after unlocking, and there are 2-3 songs that mock your defeat if you are to die in battle.\n\nThe one improvement I would make to the game would be to teach how pathing works in the tutorial. Although you control the layout of the dungeon, your character will always move to the space s/he finds most "attractive". This is determined by the levels of nearby enemies, loot, whether the space has been explored yet, and proximity to the boss. I was able to figure it out after a few runs, but I feel it would be a big help to newer players to show them how to change course.\n\nAll in all, Guild of Dungeoneering is a great game and definitely worth a try. The game has about 15-20 hours of gameplay at the moment, more if you choose to replay to use a different class or item progression. I hope they come out with more content, I will definitely be buying!","July 23, 2015","true","33.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/recommended/317820/","PyroTyger","PyroTyger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PyroTyger/","458 products in account","TLDR: This game is sushi - lots of perfectly-crafted, clean little morsels made from fresh, simple ingredients.\n\nEach dungeon is a unique and light experience, everything laid out before you like a simple puzzle, and you absolutely will not be able to stop at just one. You will stuff yourself with "just one more" and REGRET NOTHING. And you will want to do it again the next day.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Send your little dungeoneers out on dangerous quests, then purchase Guild expansions with the loot (if they survive!) adding new dungeoneer classes and new equipment options, so you can tackle harder dungeons later.\n\nThat's just the overworld management, though. The real meat is in the dungeons. You don't control your dungeoneer, but you steer them each turn by dynamically laying out rooms, enemies and loot, from a random hand of five cards.\nWhen you meet an enemy, you fight to the death in a card-duel, playing from a unique deck composed of your class' abilities and any equipment abilities you've collected along the way. The cards each show a combination of attacking, blocking (melee or magic), healing & drawing cards, and a few special abilities, so each battle is a puzzle built from the pieces you've collected.\n\nOnce in a while the game will deal you a bum hand, and you just have to try again and make your own luck. However there's no penalty for dying, so you're invited to try different classes & strategies and see what works. Sometimes you crack it on the first try, through luck & skill, but I never found myself stumped for more than a handful of attempts. It's a really well balanced system.\n\nAESTHETICS: Papercraft and sketchy pencil art. It's clean and simple to be instantly accessible, but with enough character and to make it inviting.\nThe writing is full of little smirks & winks throughout. This is a game that really understands its pedigree, and how to poke fun while still getting you invested.\nAnd the soundtrack is fantastic for such a little game. There are little acoustic, bardic ditties after each event (win or lose, complete a chapter) that very strongly reminded me of the narrator from the Deponia series - a bit dark, a bit daft, with terrible rhymes and excessive gravitas.\n\nI was also really happy about the in-game representation. New dungeoneers are randomly assigned gender and race. There's almost no difference aesthetically as they're just little chibi charicatures, but you can tell, and these little touches matter.\n\nThere were a few bugs, but nothing game-breaking or upsetting, and I gather it's being developed further. More content, easier access to in-game information, and more replayability, all of which were on my wish-list when I'd finished the game. I'll usually delete a game from my Steam Library as soon as I've completed it, but I'll be glad to dip into this one again after the next update.","July 23, 2015","true","15.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like the usage of different classes in the gameplay because if you know what kind of enemies you will be facing you can get the edge on your opponent using the class system, this system lets you use trial and improvement to find class combinations that work for every situation, I also like the dungeon pickups, I think that picking up weapons and armor as you complete dungeons is a very good idea, but I also like the fact that you have to build Blacksmith's and other buildings to make sure that you always find good weapons inside the dungeons.\n\nHowever, I think that both paid and free dlc packages should be released for this game giving you more guild members to choose from and definately more dungeons, but overall, I think this game has a very good substance to it and has allot  of potential, I urge whoever is reading this to buy Guild of Dungeoneering if you have not already!\n\nHappy Hunting","July 24, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can solve most dungeons with every character type, so there's no need to vary your playstyle, and actually using different characters is not that so different anyway.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/recommended/317820/","GameDragonZero","GameDragonZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GameDragonZero/","77 products in account","SUMMARY: Issues of polish and documentation aside, Guild of Dungeoneering is a witty guild manager/roguelike with a clever card based battle and adventure system, plus a lot of personality.  If you invest a little time in learning it, you'll find dungeon-crawler that has many refreshing changes to the usual formula and mechanics, and with developers willing to update it.\n\nI hate to start out a review with the bad, but as Guild of Dungeoneering has a lot going for it, let's get to the flaws:\n1) Documentation is non-existent, and as the game has some quirks and complexities, that makes the learning curve unnecessarily steep at the start.\n2) The guild construction element is cute, but not exactly needed.  It could be achieved with a different "look"\n3) Some mechanics (see below) are a bit strange.\n\nOK, so you got the flaws - some ramp-up, one annoying interface, and some strange mechanics  Now let's get to the good which is a lot of good.\n\nGuild of Dungeoneering is a guild manager/roguelike adventure game.  Without the standard noble background, you're a frustrated would-be hero whos decided to found their own organization to spite the great guild that clearly you're not suited to be a part of.  Ignoring Groucho Marx's dictum, you're going to raise your own guild.\n\nStarting with one recruit of the class "Chump" you send forth adventurers into various dungeons on the land.  As you accumulate gold you can expand the guild, unlocking new classes, artifacts, and improving loot drops.  As you unlock more, more choices become available to you, which is needed as you'll face new challenges as well . . .\n\nAdventuring is done with a deck of cards - but you build the dungeon.  Each turn sees you get a hand of locations, monsters, and treasures, and you distribute them to maximize your adventurer's rresults - and direction.  Your adventurers pick their own path, so you'd best think ahead - especially as later dungeons have time limits or specific goals your none-to-bright heroes may not handle well unless you manipulate them a bit.  A new treasure, a new monster, the right corridor may be needed to get your minion to go in the right directions.\n\nCombat, like many games of this genre, is a big part of the experience and this is accomplished by a simple, effective, and surprisingly deep card game.  Each class has a "deck" of cards representing abilities, and that deck expands as they find equipment.  Enemies play one card at a time at random, but your hero has several cards to choose from, and choices matter.  Some cards have offensive abilities, others defensive, some are a mix, some even set up new conditions.  Strategy can get very deep, especially when you have to take enemy strengths, weaknesses, and traits in mind - as well as that of a character.\n\nTo give an example, you may have a spell that does minor healing - but increases magic damage next magic attack - so can you endure an attack to bring a finishing blow?  You may have an ability or item that will allow you to resist a deathblow - which means you can avoid playing defensive and concentrate on assault.\n\nCombat (and the occasional treasure chest) provides equipmentt, which grants more abilities and benefits, requiring you to measure tradeoffs.  At the end of each adventure your minions apparently sell off everything they found so, sadly, each adventure has them starting over, so don't get too attached to any one weapon or shield.  Oh and just because one item has one set of abilities doesn't mean its exactly the same next time you find a similar item - you need to pay attention.\n\nStarting simply, the game reveals more and more complexity as you play.  Classes, artifacts, found items, dungeon quirks and quests, interact to keep you thinking and planning.  Though randomness can often bestow mistery, in most cases I found failures were my fault - which only kept me going.\n\nThis entire adventure is presented in an amusing hand-drawn style, with interesting and at times funny card names, and a sarcastic bard narrator who provides commentary on your actions and choices.  The entire game takes place in its own little scribbly world with skewed logic and jokes, giving it a sense of atmosphere.  There's even a plot as you quest to show up those snotty rivals, though it's mostly sarcastic window dressing.\n\nAs noted the game is not perfect.  The lack of documentation is a bit frustrating early on as you have to feel things out..  The weird ditch-equipment rule is understandable, but still odd.  The "pin-up" cards of the guild serve little mechanical purpose and are just gratuitious - though they do keep with the atmosphere.  Screen options and text size popup choices would have been welcome.  Classes don't seem quite balanced, but that may also be due to my own playstyle.\n\nHowever despite these flaws - some of which impact the game  early on - it's hard to dislike it and it is well worth playing.  The game is honestly and sincerely fun, really makes you think, explores some smart mechanics, and has a great sense of atmosphere and personality.  All of that makes it hard to put down - even when you want a bit more documentation or a bit better presentation.\n\nI would also note the devs seem dedicated to supporting this game with updates and improvements.  That's a level of commitment I can appreciate, and it has improved noteably since release.\n\nIf you like your adventure games and roguelikes, and want to try something different, this is well worth your time as it smartly explores ways to evolve the genre, doing so with its own sense of artistry and personality.","July 21, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If this was early access game then I would say it has a HUGE potential. Because it's not, then all I can say is the devs seem to be listening and I still look forward to more content and changes.  This has amazing potential but mostly becuase it is so unique.  Everything in gaming has been done before it seems these days.. it's how it is presented and how deep it goes content wise.  Love the art, love the humor, and love the challenge of the random cards.  most people whine about that but it's no different than playing yatzee or any other bord game when things aren't handed to you like a whining baby wanting a cookie right now.  it has a bit of old school feel about it and yet new and innovative.. I'm giving this a rave review in the hopes and faith in the devs that they will keep going.  I paid for it because I wanted to support it's future, not due to the product right here and now.  I just hope that faith isn't thrown away.","July 20, 2015","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/recommended/317820/","serializer","Mumra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serializer/","236 products in account","I got very bored of this game very quickly. Which is a shame, because it has a lot of style. The art style is simplistic but well executed, and the way everything animates and transitions around the screen is very smooth and solidly done. I think it's a very nice touch how the dungeon tiles draw themselves on the screen.\n\nAt first I really liked the music too, it was nice to hear some guitar and vocals in a game soundtrack. Sadly that gets old very rapidly. It's the same song over and over. Then the singer has this habit of getting to the last word of every song and then just .................... pausing. Before finally saying the last word (like really really smugly). And then he chuckles. EVERY SINGLE TIME. It gets super annoying after about the 20th version of this you hear. He seems to pause slightly longer with each rendition. Sometimes he pauses so long that I've forgotten the rest of the line by now and the last word makes no sense. And can somebody please tell him that it's generally considered really bad form to laugh at your own jokes. Especially when they're not very funny, nor even jokes for that matter.\n\nSo presentation aside, what about the gameplay. I mean, what gameplay. Good gameplay is about giving the player meaningful decisions to make. This game doesn't have any decisions. A battle consists of either being lucky enough to draw a card that will let me win, or not doing. If I don't draw a good card then it might be literally impossible to win this battle and I'll have to start this quest again. It just feels like I have no control over winning a lot of the time and with certain classes, and when I do win it was just because I got lucky. This doesn't make for a satisfying game experience. Sometimes your hand size gets reduced and then you don't even have three cards to choose from, you might be down to only 1 card. Draw a card, play it. You don't even get to choose. And why on Earth can't the characters keep their gear or levels after a quest? This one thing would make the game so much better, at least then I would stand a chance in some of the harder dungeons. Although equipping gear doesn't even always make much difference, a lot of gear just gives you a chance of drawing certain cards that are slightly better than your character's base cards, doesn't help one bit if you just have bad luck and draw bad cards.\n\nOverally I could only recommend this game if it was in a sale and if you like unlocking things very very slowly. But you should probably just go and play a proper dungeon crawler instead. As for me, I'll be getting a .................... refund. Hee hee ha ho.","July 20, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GoD blends elements from several card and cardboard classics to addictive new effect, complete with a super-charming art style and a complete accessibility that all but the best Eurogames should envy.

I struggled a little in the beginning but through trial and error and with a few tips from other players I'm now blasting and slashing my way through the dungeons. I still find myself being defeated by unlucky hands once in awhile but it just makes victory that much sweeter. With many classes to try, an upcoming DLC card pack and talk of possibly adding repeatable quests this game has lots of replayablility. I feel it's worth the price tag of $15 but if you're unsure wait for a sale.","July 21, 2015","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Easy to pick up and play through a dungeon or two, but not super time consuming.  Creative hand drawn cards, and each class has its own "deck" of moves that is starts with.  This provides a good balance with different classes.\n\nMy only disappointment with this game is that once you have beaten the game, you cannot go back and play old maps.  The only way to replay is to start a new save file, and start from scratch.\n\nA New Game Plus would be awesome, as it could be done with higher level monsters, or just higher hit points / better decks.\n\n","July 25, 2015","true","41.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a dungeon where you have to get to a certain point in a certain amount of turns.  My character, even though there was loot drawing him to go towards the finish, decided that a detour to a skeleton was a better route.  This caused me to run out of turns and fail.  I feel I did everything I needed to win, but the game said no.\n\nNot only that, some of your favorite dungeoneers will be killed because of some stupid ♥♥♥ "burn" status where you both lose 1HP per turn.  In a battle you could easily win, you will lose over and over because you kill him with 1HP and then the burn kills you.  Not only that, the burn hits you before the fight even starts!\n\nAfter dying a ton even with higher leverl characters, I'm done with this game.\n\nYou got my $15.
