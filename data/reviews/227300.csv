"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieceOfMind1/recommended/227300/","PieceOfMind1","PieceOfMind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PieceOfMind1/","2414 products in account","Top-notch truck driving simulator.  With support for TrackIR, wheels and pedals, this game has become a gem of the simulation genre.\n\nBefore having tried it, it's hard to see why this game will be so addicting.  I suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multi-country Logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many drivers.\n\nYou "level up" various skills which improve the rewards you get from certain types of deliveries or open up more jobs such as longer distances or different categories of dangerous cargo.\n\nDriving the trucks is a pleasure.  It's surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city, obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman.  That said, if you disable the speed-limiter in options (90kph) you can get a bit crazy, getting as high as 150kph+ on some routes, a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow!  Speed cameras will become your enemy though.\n\nUnfortunately the AI of the other traffic can at times frustrate.  In some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way, probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly.  Don't get me started on the kamikaze AI at roundabouts either.\n\nIn any case, this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game.  Having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommended, and if you have head-tracking equipment it's icing on the cake.","November 8, 2014","true","110.1"," 498 of 516 people (97%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","97","498","516","17","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellzilla/recommended/227300/","hellzilla","Hellzilla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hellzilla/","259 products in account","This is easily one of the best games I've got in 2013, and will probably remain in my Steam Favorites list for a long time. I never played a game like this before and now it has me hooked. It keeps getting better!\n\nAt first I was just enjoying the scenery, the gameplay of driving the trucks, taking different jobs, and leveling up my XP so I could make more money and buy my own truck (Volvo FH16 Globetrotter). Now I'm working to upgrade my truck and my business. The business part is pretty addictive too. You can take a loan, expand your first garage, start buying more trucks, and hire drivers to work for you. I'm anxious to get enough money to buy another garage somewhere else and start another fleet.\n\nYou can not only use your skill points from XP to strategically improve your abilities and rewards one step at a time to make more money, you can do the same with your drivers (or choose to have their skills auto-balanced).\n\nThe scenery is gorgeous and there are some nice little touches of different things to see on the road and in different cities.\n\nThe changing weather and day/night transformations are great. Rain storms are awesome.\n\nDriving in Europe is really not that different than driving in North America. Although, for some reason driving in the UK made me a little nervous--maybe it's the little extra traffic; maybe it's just driving on the other side of the road; or maybe I was expecting The Stig to cross my path.\n\nI play with a  Driving Force GT wheel, and even though as a fan of racing games I at first had doubts about this game, I gotta say if you have a wheel you really should try this game. Everything about the game is pure pleasure, but the driving is not just enjoyable but challenging as well. Things like parking your trailer; traveling swiftly but balancing your trailer's loads around all kinds of bends, inclines and declines; driving at night; dealing with other drivers (watch out for the evil empire of busses!) and trying to overtake slow pokes who follow the speed limit; traveling as fast as you can and watching for speeding cameras and changing speed limits make this one of the best driving games I've ever played. Oh yeah, don't blow those red lights--all the tickets you could get for various things can really ad up on one trip.\n\nIt actually is becoming a racing game as I'm travelling longer distances. Right now in order to not interrupt my delivery with rest stops and not be late (which costs money) or get fined for driving while tired (happened to me four times at the end of one trip), I'm trying to make my trips even faster. So I'm balancing my loads at top speeds, taking the ever changing curves of the road as gracefully as possible, putting the pedal to the metal but watching for speed cameras and changing speed limits (watch out for those road hazard areas and be careful in town), and trying to overtake just like in a racing game--but it's more challenging with opposing traffic on busy highways!\n\nIt's also a great music game. Hit the road and use your in-game radio to tune into different internet stations or play your favorite music on a media player in the background (I recommend AIMP3, which has a great interface and features but is very low resource).\n\nI highly recommend ETS2! I hope they make more expansions, and I am looking forward to American Truck Simulator.","December 23, 2013","true","60.7"," 315 of 330 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","315","330","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_daemon/recommended/227300/","mr_daemon","mr_daemon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_daemon/","456 products in account","It's very hard to hype this game up. You get into a truck with some cargo to deliver and hit the road accross a scaled down version of Europe. Over time you gain experience for things, like longer distances, more valuable cargo, etc. You can eventually buy your own truck(s), hire other drivers and expand your trucking empire and stuff.\n\nBut basically, it's about driving heavy, sluggish trucks. I am having difficulties putting into words why any of this is fun. Perhaps fun isn't the right word at all.\n\nIt's relaxing most of the time, satisfying, and sometimes tense.\n\nThere's something in there about small moments. The moment where you pull out of the loading dock with your frozen peas or whatnot and find the highway. The moment where the countryside changes and you cross borders. The moment where the signs change and the language is different. The moment where you know you're almost there and are about to arrive. The moment where somewhere in the middle, it rained for a while, or got really dark. Or both. The moment where you missed your exit somewhere in belgium. The moment where you discovered you could listen to actual internet radio from within your truck, from a station that matches the country you're gently passing through.\n\nThis is probably not something you'll want to sit at for multiple hours, but if you're anything like me, you'll keep coming back to it, running a delivery once in a while, because it's relaxing, and the moments are tantalizing.\n\nOh also, there's a multiplayer mod. It's all of this except once in a while you will pass another guy going in the opposite direction. You'll both cheerfully honk your horns in greeting, then continue on your respective ways. I guess that's also another moment.\n\nI am actually fairly excited about all things VR and the Occulus rift for a multitude of reasons and games I'd like to experience with it, but my deepest secret about it is that I am really looking forward to playing ETS2 when the consumer version lands. Seriously. That's how much I enjoy this game.","February 17, 2015","true","11.5"," 275 of 283 people (97%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","97","275","283","24","5"

But it's a lot of fun, and it definitely gives the feeling of a completely open world that's just ready for you to explore. Hop right in a truck and start hauling freight for others, and earn enough money to buy your own fleet of vehicles and keep more of the profits to yourself.\n\nIt's really two games in one, because in addition to the fairly robust truck driving simulation, there's a pretty great business management simulation as well where you can play some kind of Trucking Tycoon and grow a small business into a profitable little empire of trucks and drivers all across Europe.\n\nI have to admit, Euro Truck Simulator 2 really surprised me with just how fun it is to play. It's pretty challenging to get the hang of at first, but once you do, it's a pretty enjoyable (and even relaxing) experience.

You start out as any regular bloke being a hired driver and delivering various things with a given truck.\n\nAfter a few jobs you have the option to get a loan from the bank to buy your very own truck. This is where the game truly opens. With your own truck you can drive around anywhere in the map and explore it as you please. Jobs give a higher pay so you can profit something while also paying off your debt. After some jobs the bank will offer you another loan, so you can start your very own trucking company. You use that money to buy a few trucks and hire drivers to work for you.\n\nThere is no objective in the game, you're free to do anything, but you could say the objective is to have the biggest trucking empire.\n\nThe game does a very good job at keeping you driving, if you don't pay off your debts, it's game over, but that's not all. You need more experience levels to be able to customize your truck to the max and also acquire better trucks.\n\nThere many trucks in this game. Iveco, Scania, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, MAN and Renault; all with different models and configurations.\n\nThe world extends from Aberdeen to Budapest, but there are mods that expands the map even more, such as TSM, which will open up parts of Italy, France, Spain and Northern Africa.

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) is a 2012 vehicle simulation game developed and self-published by SCS Software. It features a massive game world spanning most of mainland Europe, the British Isles, and Scandinavia with each of the cities being connected by the beautifully recreated road systems such as the German autobahn roads.  The game also offers detailed simulation mechanics for hardcore sim players while also offering an alternative 'automatic' mode for the more casual players or beginners such as myself.\n\nAlthough the game's primary and obvious gameplay mechanic consist of driving across Europe, it does feature additional mechanics to give the game a little more spice such as; a progression (level up) system where each level unlocks new cargos, trucks, upgrades and delivery conditions; Truck Company Management system where you manage a trucking company by purchasing / upgrading garages, trucks and hiring drivers to use them.\n\nStart the game as a driver for hire and earn enough money to build your own trucking empire that will span the entirety of Europe.\n\nPROS:+ Beautiful graphics with detailed truck interiors, world environment, and road systems\n+ Good sound effects and assets\n+ Europe is vast and well detailed  giving individuality to each location you visit\n+ Good selection of trucks with a good upgrade and customization system\n+ Various cargo and delivery conditions\n+ Surprisingly contains a relevant progression (level-up) system\n+ Garage and Truck Company management system\n+ Offers different game modes to cater for both hardcore sim players, casuals, and beginners\n+ Easy modding capabilities\n+ Very fast load times (Even on a mechanical hard drive)\n+ Live European Radio Streaming or custom music playlist using the in-game radio feature\n+ Has a demo in the Store page for anyone who's not sure if this genre is to their liking\n\nCONS:- Some micro-stuttering despite the FPS being above 60\n- Low number of pedestrians makes some parts of the cities a bit empty\n- Poor reward for manually parking a trailer (they could have at least given 100xp for it)\n- Anti-aliasing is limited to only MLAA\n\nNEUTRAL:+/- The game's overall concept is for a narrow/niche audience.\n+/- The AI needs to attend a Road Courtesy and Discipline class. (Although this does add to the immersion since the player will have to exercise due diligence while driving)\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT SIMULATION GAME. Playing this game is surprisingly stress relieving and gives off a zen-like feeling while also offering a lot of other contents within the game world.\n\n\nWORTH IT?:I can RECOMMEND this game at full price if you're a hardcore simulation fan but if not, I suggest you purchase this game on a sale. Either way however, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing the Delux Bundle which includes all available DLCs and Expansion Packs as well as SCS' other games such as Bus Simulator, Trucks & Trailers, and Euro Truck Simulator (1).\n\nFINAL NOTES:To be completely honest, I didn't think much of this game when I first bought it because I did not see the appeal in driving trucks around in a game without a plot or a story. I was, however, pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the experience because what the game lacks in story (being a simulation game and all), it makes up for in solid gameplay, excellent presentation, and player-friendly game mechanics.\n\nThe game carries with it a relatively high system requirement so be sure to check that out before making a purchase.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

They’ve even already set the sat nav. for you!\n\n\nDrink and Drive\n\nThe core of Euro Truck Simulator 2 is spent driving along the highways and byways of Europe.\nThis is a driving simulator, not a racing game; you’ll want to take care of whatever Big-Rig you find yourself in.\nDamage it and the repair costs will come out of your fee.\nYou’ll also want to drive responsibly; running red lights will cost you, as will getting caught by speed cameras.\nWhy would you want to rush anyway when you’ve got some beautiful European scenery to drink in as you drive?\n\n\nIt’s about the Journey, Not the Destination\n\nThe scenery is where Euro Truck Simulator 2 shines, this is a game that understands it’s the journey that’s important, your destination is just another way point to pause at.\nAs you put your “pedal to the metal” and open your rig up on the motorways of Europe you’ll be treated to a lush and changing landscape racing passed your windscreen.\nDon’t get too distracted looking at the pretty fields of sunflowers though or you might miss your exit (or worse hit another vehicle and damage your truck!)\n\n\nA Continent of Possibilities\n\nThere are 69 European cities present in the vanilla game spread across a dozen countries.\n(You can add more via DLC too!)\nEach city has its own unique real world land marks or iconic buildings present, you can often see them looming over other city buildings as you wind your way through the suburbs.\nIt’s a really nice touch to be able to recognise which city you’re approaching from the skyline without having to check the sat nav. or map.\n\n\nDon’t go into this thinking it’s an exact recreation of Europe though or you’ll be disappointed.\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 adopts the same stance to mapping the European Continent as “The Crew” does to mapping North America.\nWhat you have here is a condensed version of Europe, which is probably just as well, I think driving from Southern Italy to Northern England in real time might take a little while longer than the normal hour or two I have spare in the evenings.\n\n\nPoints on your License\n\nIt’s not just about driving around making money either (well it is, but there are extra game mechanics to keep things interesting).\nThere’s an experience based progression system here too.\nAs you drive around, completing deliveries, you’ll earn points which you can spend to unlock new capabilities.\nYou can invest points several different areas,  for example, you could focus your experience points in haulage distant which will make longer distance contracts available to you or you could invest points in licences for various types of hazardous cargo if you like the idea of trucking some dangerous chemicals around Europe.\n\n\nThe Boss of You\n\nWhen you’ve amassed enough wealth from “working for the man” you can invest in your own truck (there are plenty of models and varieties to choose from) and start your own haulage company.\nThis not only gives you more freedom with regards to delivery contracts, but also gives you the chance to invest future earnings in upgrading your rig, whether that is an engine upgrade or go faster stripes, that’s up to you.\nThere are plenty of stylish paint jobs you can pick as DLC too, should you like a more personalised look to your truck of choice.\n\n\nDrive Safe\n\nBeing your own boss isn’t all parts and paint jobs either, it comes with an extra layer of responsibility too.\nIt’ll be up to you to pull in at the services and fill up the gas tank from time to time now; running out of gas whilst on a long haul is not a good idea.\nIt’s also not a good idea to keep driving without a rest too, everyone needs sleep and you’re no exception so remember to keep an eye on your fatigue levels and pull in for a nap when you need one!\nYou’re also going to have to pay for maintenance on your truck now, so it’s even more important ... <...snip...>\n\n\n( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit  review-well.com [www.review-well.com] )","May 23, 2015","true","52.5"," 379 of 459 people (83%) found this review helpful 159 people found this review funny","83","379","459","159","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misstaxi/recommended/227300/","misstaxi","❤MissTaxi❤Roserin❤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misstaxi/","303 products in account","I did a review before, Back then i had 17 Hours playtime. Now i gained a lot more hours on it :D\nBack then my Review was not very detailed and  since then Euro Truck Simulator 2 got updated constantly and has much more to offer by now, i decided to redo my review. So let's begin shall we? :3\n(For those who don't want to read a book and expect a review in form of an IGN Joke - 10/10 would relax again)\n\nThe General Idea of the Game/Whats it aboutThe easiest answer would obviously be "Driving Trucks" B-But wait! That's not all there is to know silly. This game is in all reality a "Relax and listen to a Podcast/Music while you drive Simulator". This game is about you, your truck and an open Europe to travel across. How you do it, what trucks you will drive, what cargo you will haul or the places you will see is all up to you.\n\nGameplay\nGame Start and Quick Jobs\nThe game starts you off as a hired driver. You have no money, no truck and only a rusty empty garage to work with. So what do you do? You work your butt off with "Quick Jobs" In these jobs you will get put inside a truck and just drive to the destination. In this starting phase of the game your goal should be to make as much Money as possible and of course to level up (More to the level system below).\n\nFreight Market and your own Truck\nAfter you are level 6 or 7, which is about 2 hours in the game, you finally have enough Money to buy your first truck!\n(You could also take a bank loan and do it faster. This is where the game starts to become fun and somewhat addicting. There you sit. In your own little truck, in your rusty garage. What now? Now you can start making the big money. Instead of getting hired for an apple and a hug, you will now be paid directly by the Companies. All that freight money goes into your pocket. So you select a freight from the "Freight Market" Unlike "Quick Jobs" you will not just spawn in place. You have to physically drive to the loading spot. So don't choose something on the other side of the Country because you will have to drive there. This will be your life from now on. You pick a job, you drive to the loading dock, pick it up, and deliver it to the destination. Then you will get paid, and based on how you did you will get rated with XP to level up.\n\nThe Level System:\nAs mentioned many many times above. The game has a level system. You earn XP to spend in the following categories to unlock freight and boost income.\n\nSkill        Description                ADR        Lets you haul more dangerous cargo like gasoline or toxic stuff                Long Distance        Lets you take on jobs with a longer distance which will be higher paid                High Value Cargo        Expensive equipment such as diggers and forklifts                Fragile Cargo        Glass, Cars, Electronics and so on                Just-in-time Delivery        Deliveries with a shorter but more rewarding deadline                Ecodriving        Makes your trucks consume lesser fuel\nIn addition to your own skillset, your hired drivers will also level up in these. Which makes a level 30 driver far more productive than a rookie. Hired drivers brings us to the next aspect: Management\n\nThe Management Aspect\nAfter you made some Money, leveled up, bought more trucks and upgraded + bought new garages. You should start hiring drivers on your own. They will deliver cargo for you, just like you do. You equip them with a truck and they will bring in money. At first very little, up to 1000€. But soon you will have lots of drivers, and the higher their level, the more money they will make you. In the late game you will have so much money that you don't know what to do with it. Which is one of my biggest concern about the game. Once you reach a certain point you will just never run out of money. You will have millions and millions. Which makes it so the late game is literally only about the driving aspect. Which is not a major problem for me, but it might be for you, so please keep that in mind.\n\nTuning\nAs your level grows you will unlock more trucks and more parts for you to customize your truck with. You can even install mods that add more tuning parts. (Like you can install mods for basically everything in this game) You can also upgrade the trucks of your hired drivers, though that doesn't really do much since you won't see them on the road. :D\n\nGraphics, Audio and Performance\nGraphics\nDon't expect Crysis. But the game looks beautiful enough in my opinion. The weather effects just got overhauled and I catch myself sitting there thinking "What an amazing View, lets take a Screenshot of that" far more often than in a lot of other Games. The Truck models look beautiful and they are all fully licensed. The Dashboards all are functional and you really feel the love SCS (the developer) has put into them. I had some odd Shadow bugs earlier on but it seems they have been fixed since then\n\nAudio\nThis is one of the strongest aspects of this game. To be fair, SCS improved quite a lot here as well, compared to when the game was first released. From the sound of rain dripping on your cabin, to the rumbling of a thunderstorm, the sounds are just beautiful. The trucks themselves sound amazing! And not just the engine sounds, also the little levers in the truck itself has sound, and it just helps to immerse you in this game so much. Only the beeping sound. when you reverse from inside the cabin is way too loud in my personal opinion. I have never used a sound Mod since playing this game. I know they exist, and of course I use them for modded trucks but i never used one that changes the original sounds, but i just never felt the need to do so.\n\nPerformance\nNow i have to say my PC is one of the weakest. I'm still using an old ATI HD4650 and a dual core processor, but I can get the game to a steady 30-35 FPS (20 in cities) on Medium Settings. If you use mods, especially big ones, such as the ProMods Map or the TSM Map, that number will obviously decrease, but I'm very happy with that aspect of the game.\n\nPros and Cons + Verdict\nPros\n+ Fun and Relaxing Driving\n+ Fully Licensed Trucks\n+ Customization\n+ Big and Active Modding Community incl. a MP Mod\n+ Decent AI\n+ Amazing Audio\n+ Great Performance\n+ Good Looking\n+ Full Steering Wheel and Controller Support\n\nCons\n- Late Game far too Easy\n- Managment Aspect not deep enough\n\nVerdict\nIts one of my favorite driving games and the fact that I can only find 2 flaws with it makes me give it a strong 95%. If you are into trucks, or just want a relaxing open world driving game, get it.","January 16","true","627.9"," 100 of 104 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","100","104","13","15"

I've now damaged my truck to 8% and cost myself a pretty penny for the accident..... But hey we all gotta learn sometime right?\n\nJournal Entry 3\n\nAfter driving around my small property parking lot and learning my gears I decide to venture to the populated streets! I backup (this time checking my mirrors) and carefully pull onto the street. I'm now happily driving among the traffic of Europe! The drivers a slow and waiting at lights is a pain in the rear...but... alas this is my life now ...\n\nJournal Entry 4\n\nI have picked a mission to haul a load of heavy machinery across the countryside. I drive to my location, which happens to be a nice little farm with very tight corners and fences. I see my load waiting between two other loaded trailers, this looks like a tight fit. I attempted backing up several times not getting it right, I'm sure the farmer and his wife were either giggling inside their house or regretting not hiring a better driver. I finally get latched on and give a sigh of relief, I pull out of the space and very gently make my turns while trying not to stall out. Although its tight maneuvering I am able to escape Vincent's Smoked Meats!\n\nJournal Entry 5\n\nNow on the road I get to enjoy the beautiful countryside and shake my fist at the slow and dangerous drivers around me.... it begins to get a bit darker and a light rain starts, I almost drive my truck off the road twice trying to turn on my headlights and windshield wipers but were all good. I'm now cruising down the road at a gentle 70 and things are good....uh oh.....I can see a line of cars piling up behind me so I better pick up the pace... This was a poor decision on my part...\n\nJournal Entry 6\n\nNow thinking back... in the best interest of other drivers I should have just stayed the speed I was going.... but I did not. I got far to generous with the gas pedal and shifting, ended up pumping my truck up to around 120. This speed was great, I was making good time, I didn't have a line of cars behind me.... but I didn't account for sharp corners in my equation. I came whipping up to a corner thinking... ok ill just tap the brakes and slow down a bit.... well its wet on the road.... its a sharp corner... I got it down to about 98 when i hit the corner and suddenly my world started to become slightly off center...\n\nJournal Entry 7\n\nNow that my truck is laying on its side I've learned a key element about gear reduction to control speed as well as "when to" and "when not to" apply the brakes. I had missed my corner by lots...I had not taken into account the grade % of the road and I rolled it and slid for a long distance... it was quite scary......After my truck is up righted from the long skid on its side im now looking at 72% damage, the truck sounds like a blender full of ball bearings and the lights flicker.... that's totally normal right? ...\n\nJournal Entry 8\n\nOk the truck sounds terrible but it still drives... Its got horrible turning now and 3 of my gears are non existent... I'm still about 2 (game hours) away from my destination. I am able to drive for about 45 mins before the truck really starts to have...issues... I was driving along at my new cautious speed of 50 and suddenly my truck turns off.... great no power steering so my wheel locks up and its like trying to steer a dead whale with a pool cue....not working well.... but I'm able to get it to the side of the road safely.\n\nJournal Entry 9\n\nI am able to start the truck again and drive another while before it turns off again. I'm now only 20 mins away from my destination and im not giving up... if its the last thing I do im getting this load to its destination. I've now cranked this thing over enough times that I could probably forge a blade on the starter.... but luck has it that the final stretch into town is all down hill....yay!..... throw it in neutral and coast into the city... I blast my horn and coast powerlessly through red lights, dodging traffic and jumping curves. I look like a boat without a crew heading directly for the shore.\n\nJournal Entry 10\n\nI can see the building! I'm almost there! .. I'm coasting much much slower now that the terrain has leveled out, The truck won't even start now its toast, im about 30 feet from the buildings entrance and moving at a speed of about 5-7... Old ladies with walkers are getting better torque ratios then my truck. I finally land right next to the door, Unable to start the truck im not going to be able to back it in manually so we will take a gimme on this load.... this may be bad for my business but I can personally suggest you don't hire anyone from "Marauder Trucking"","June 10, 2014","true","73.0"," 187 of 223 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","187","223","0","6"

The game itself unmodded provides great entertainment if you enjoy to just relax at your computer and just drive. If you're wanting a great simulation aspect, this game can deliver on many levels and provide simulation like the real thing!\n\nSpeaking of modding, this game provides a massive range of modding features to improve and drastically extend your gameplay, I personally play a modded game most of the time, as I've expereince most of the game and what it offers in the unmodded version, but to this day mods still make the game very fresh and new to play!\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys driving games, with a very open aspect to modding.

Find Job 2. Gather trailer 3. Deliver trailer - Get paid... "i guess that can be fun...?"\n\nMaybe it's the idea of creating and expanding a business. Maybe it's that wierd infatuation people have with locomotives . Maybe it's just a cool job that works perfect for an easy going simulator.\n\nIt's just good fun. Jump in and out, no hassle. Simple and relaxing.\n\nYour only objective is to create a successful business and ultimately: earn money. Money buys accesssories and upgrades for your trucks, along with recruiting drivers and buying garages. Naturally your truck is the whole game, so customizing and improving it is your primary motivation. Working towards unlocks is a major incentive to keep you engaged.\n\nThere is a also a huge community with tons of fantastic mods to try out. They're easy to use and the content is full of good work. There are enough mods to improve upon nearly every aspect of the game.\nThere are a lot of sites with a lot of re-uploads and out-of-date crap, so It took me a while to sift through to find the ones i wanted. But it was totally worth it, I have an awesome menagerie of mods.\n\nIts an otherwise pretty dull scenario for a game, there isnt a whole lot more underneath than what's delivered at face value.\nThere isnt anything truly unique or special about it. A European truck driving simulator, you shouldnt think much of it...\n\nBut even if you have a remote interest, it might be enough to get some real enjoyment out of this.","November 16, 2014","true","29.5"," 99 of 106 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","99","106","0","4"

Once you do this you will be buying garages and upgrading them, hiring drivers and also buying trucks and upgrading those as well if you wish.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelance_/recommended/227300/","freelance_","The Space Ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freelance_/","283 products in account","For some reason, my review got 'deleted' even though I could still read the comments, and it was marked 'not recommended' instead of 'recommended.' No idea what happened there, so this is my 'second' review.\n\nNaturally, I do highly recommend this game. It's the best 'driving' (you don't race in it) game I've ever played. Initially I was turned off by this game because of the whole 'truck' thing. I love the idea of travelling hundreds of miles on an open-ended map, but I don't care much for trucks. I'd rather drive a car. That said, I tried out the demo (hey, I've got nothing to lose) and got hooked immediately.\n\nWhile still not a totally realistic simulation of a truck driver, I learned that driving a truck is nothing at all like driving a car but I had gotten used to it quickly (gotta go wide when turning).\n\nThe best part of the game is when you're actually out on the road. With your own MP3s playing (or one of the many radio streams you can turn on), and miles of open road in front of you, ETS 2 is the ultimate game to unwind. If you're all stressed out (from work, etc), play this game. There's no aliens to kill, or kittens to run over. It's just you chilling out in  your truck (with your cargo if you have a delivery) while singing Animaniacs songs (no really, that's one of the music I listen to while on the road) off key.\n\nRain effects are really good, although there's no other types of weather. The maps aren't exact representations but they are perfectly balanced enough so that those long jobs (say from Warsaw to Aberdeen) don't feel that long.\n\nCities aren't that interesting, but you rarely spend much time in any anyway, as you're mostly on the road. Going East (the DLC) adds much improved cities though,\n\nSome of the roads are questionable, and there's no penalty for delivering cargo earlier than the scheduled time, which are some of the little flaws in an otherwise excellent package.\n\nForm your own truck company, buy trucks and hire drivers to drive those trucks. Expand by buying garages for your company. Take deliveries and earn experience and money, or simply drive around in free roam and let your drivers do all the work.\n\nIgnore all the people who scoff at this game. I haven't heard of anyone in forums, etc, who, after playing the demo, -didn't- buy it afterwards. It's engrossing and the relaxation factor is high. SCS Software has been making truck driving games for years, so they sure know what they're doing. ETS 2 is the best of them all.\n\nP.S. American Truck Simulator is in the works. If it's anything like ETS 2, it will be yet another excellent game.","November 25, 2013","true","252.6"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","45","46","0","3"

Even after fantastic sex with my scandinavian model wife, I would lie awake and feel empty, hopeless, and souless. That was when a friend gifted me eurotruck simulator 2. Everything Changed. No longer did I feel lost, but more alive than EVER! I quit my highly sucessful job, divorced my wife and disowned my kids. I didn't need them anymore because any thoughts of them were replaced with the greatest game in the world. On nights I normally would have spent at partys or hanging out with Obama, I now spent preparing for the long drives from Aberdeen to Bratislava. I now live with my cousin Jeff who also is a ETS2 Fantic! We spend our time not gaming talking about different trucks or routes to travel on. I got a new girlfriend who works at a gas station, she knows a lot about trucks and it makes me aroused. One time we ♥♥♥♥ed in the back of a Scania AB. It was so hot I ♥♥♥♥ed all over the clutch. You should have been there that filthy ♥♥♥♥ was poping my clutch all night. I'm getting so stimulated thinking about it I might have to go for a stroke, maybe pop one into Jeff. The game is great and goes good with a G27 and eyefinity.

Jobs are scattered across the whole of Europe with a variety of XP rewards on offer based on the cargo you will be towing...hook up the trailer, then just drive.\n\nAs with most simulator games this could be seen as only appealing to a niche section of gamers but Eurotruck 2 really is different, I had no interest in trucks before this game but I was still drawn to it and it has quickly become one of my favourite games. It is essentially a driving simulator but there is a bit of added depth with the ability to build garages and hire other drivers to work for you but for the most part you will be flying down a motorway, watching your speed, watching the traffic, checking that ever so slightly tight bend(cos u will roll if not careful)..\n\nHaving played many types of games the question of immersion often comes up...not long after first buying this game I was playing one night...Headphones on..Driving down the motorway..Listening to the in game radio(a metal channel) then it began to rain...wipers on ..slow down a bit i'm starting to weave around.. that short time driving down that motorway was the most immersed I've ever been in any game.\n\nSpecial mention should also be given to the Devs..they are constantly releasing updates..listening to player feedback..offering cheap dlc (paint jobs) and periodically releasing larger dlc that opens up new roads and countries and they continue to do this despite working on American Truck Simulator. They also offer the world of trucks website which you can upload your trucking profile to in game and earn achievements and rewards through there ...for christmas they had a challenge to deliver presents over a distance equal to the distance between their offices and the north pole..reward?.. free Dlc..\n\nSo in summary, Great game..don't be put off by the 'Sim' aspect and support the Devs because they really deserve it and already have one confirmed sale of American Truck Simulator.","December 31, 2014","true","261.6"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","41","44","2","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadafaqap/recommended/227300/","shadafaqap","DELTA Zii /~\ 三角洲籽亿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shadafaqap/","4 products in account","I have owned this game for quite a while now and I’ve really enjoyed driving for hundreds of hours. I myself am a vehicle fanatic so I love everything that moves on wheels 8). Here are the advantages and disadvantages of the game:\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1.  The game has a huge map which will take you at least 500 hours to explore fully (including both map expansions). The map (including both map expansions) stretches from Great Britain to mainland Europe, then to the very east of Poland and the Nordic region up north.\n\n2. There is a wide range of trucks to choose from. There are high end trucks made for hauling heavy stuff and smaller trucks that get the job done.\n\n3. The customization is pretty good too because you can customize almost every aspect of the truck such as tires, engines and cabin trim. You can also apply custom paints and skins to make your truck more unique.\n\n4. There is a huge selection of trailers to haul. Even if you don’t have the Scandinavia DLC, and the High Power Cargo Pack DLC, you still get a choice to haul pretty much anything that can be transported. It ranges from Tomatoes to Excavators and if you’ve got the Scandinavia DLC, you can haul a pair of Scania or Volvo trucks.\n\n5. It’s very realistic. The roads have the correct signs, speed limits are imposed in the correct areas and many things such as white lines, hard shoulders make the driving aspect realistic. The simulation aspect is well met with settings such as physical camera rotation to make it seem like the truck actually seem like it’s moving when you’re in the cabin and realistic fuel simulation. Also real life currencies have been implemented where the main currency is Euros and you’re able to use other currencies such as Pounds sterling or Norwegian Krona.\n\n6. It’s fully modifiable. Since it’s release the game has been host to millions of community developed mods such as free map expansions (ProMods & TruckSim Map are great examples), and it literally ranges from everything. There are mods that can change the economy of the game, mods that add trucks, mods that change cabin interiors, mods that add skins. You can really have a blast customizing the game and even making your own mods and publishing them on mod websites like ets2.lt.\n\n7. It runs alright on low spec PC's on the lowest settings of course. My PC is terrible and I get about 30 FPS in the cabin on medium settings\n\n8. The controls are very simple and it's easy to drive with a keyboard. Gamepads work well too and if you want the full on experience then you should get a racing wheel like a Logitech G27 because it simulates driving and it's more precise.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n1.  Updates take a while to come out because the company who develops this game are a very small group meaning that map expansions like Scandinavia DLC that came out 3 years after the base game was released, were demolished by the likes of ProMods, a large group of modders who mapped out a huge part of Scandinavia over a year before the official DLC was even released.\n\n2. The cities are extremely brief. Let’s take London for example. If the city of London in-game was about the same size as it is in real life, it would take almost every city in the game combined to equal it’s size. This is because each city only has around 4 to 5 roads, a service station, a garage, and a couple of depots.\n\n3. (Good and bad) - there’s no multiplayer. This was a problem up until late 2013 when some Polish guys got together and started piecing together a multiplayer mod that would be free to play and would give players an opportunity to transport  loads with each other, organize enormous convoys, and take screenshots. To this day it has around 700,000 registered users and as of now it’s growing by about 3000 users per day.\n\nOverall this game is probably the best driving simulator on the store and it’s a game I’m so addicted to even though I have no interest in trucks.

Not only are they listening at the complains of the users, they also added free content (multible cities and Trucks). They are now working on ATS (American Truck Simulator), but still support ETS2 fully with new patches and content. The modding community is extremly strong and well recieved, which makes the game even better.\n\nMy point still stands. That game right here is one of a kind. These reviews don't lie.

But one day I thought I would give it a try, I didn't own a wheel and I played with keyboard and mouse which was terribly boring. If you don't own a wheel - don't buy this game until you do.\n\nBut if you do own a wheel, or planning on buying one, you should definitely get this game. ETS2 is the best simulator game I've ever played, it's as relaxing as it should be, but if you are to relaxed you might end up with the truck up side down on the side road and a trailer full of damaged goods you need to pay for. This game has almost everything a real life of truck driver has, consequences such as big fines when you drive too fast or wreck any other veichle.\n\nWhen you have enough money doing freelance jobs you can buy your own truck and start your own business and hire other drivers. You have a garage which you can upgrade along with more employees hired.\n\nIf you find the game abit repetetive and restricted - there is alot of mods you can install by downloading them from various websites, just google it, and no - this game do not support workshop modding, atleast not at the moment. However the mods are really easy to install and they can be (de)activated in your profile settings in the game menu.\n\nI find this game really enjoyable and I think it's a must-buy if you own a wheel.","March 28, 2015","true","14.2"," 45 of 54 people (83%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","83","45","54","13","0"

I wanted to give the game a shot and it turned out to be a lot more fun than first anticipated. Maybe because one of my favourite series is Ice Road Truckers or because I like big machines.\n\nIf you want the game to be more realistic try play it with 3D turned on and you will never go back!\nIt makes a huge difference and the 3D works very well. The game is best played with Nvidia's 3D Vision technology.\n\nUnfortunately in three real time hours I managed to get four tickets for driving through a red light and no less than four speeding tickets for driving too fast with my truck.

I have gotten a lot more respect for the European trucks and I have a lot Scania trucks besides my Peterbilt truck.\n\nThere is one thing I hate about the game: The piece of crap music in the menu. It sounds really terrible and dull.

Wrong.\n\nETS2 has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me, being someone who loves driving. The game offers up a solid rendition of a scaled-down version of most of Europe to roam while mastering the skill of hauling tons upon tons of cargo. The game engine is powered by a fairly accurate physics engine and detailed graphics, and achieves an overall feeling of realism that is on par with some of the best. Think of it almost like a "Free Drive" racing game, except you have to follow the rules of the road, and trucks provide more of a challenge to drive.\n\nThere are several real-world trucks with seemingly endless customization options, and a diverse pool of trailers and cargo types to avoid repetition between deliveries. Completing deliveries rewards you with experience points and cash, which both add progression in the form of unlocking new trucks, cargo and customization options, and being able to grow your business by buying more trucks and garages, and by hiring drivers.\n\nAll in all, ETS2 is a pretty relaxing way to kill some time, and an extremely detailed simulation.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=289595643","October 14, 2014","true","56.0"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

It has to be one of the biggest out there. There are many sites out there where you can download extra content for this game. There's so much of it out there, you'll probably need to rent out Google's servers for a day just to hold them all.\n\nIf you get this, I highly recommend you get the Multiplayer mod for this. It's that great, it won Mod of the Year 2014. You can meet other people who share the same interests as you and take a drive together. If showing off is your thing, you can enter a truckfest or drive in a convoy of your choice using the dedicated convoy sites. You even have the chance to drive a highly detailed car, which you can use for either piloting a convoy or just as an ordinary civilian vehicle.\n\nOverall, this gets a 10/10 from me.

This is the best Truck Simulator I've seen.\n\nNow if the developers could add some bridges and other obstacles too low or narrow for the trucks to pass, narrower, twisty and bumpy roads with heavy climbs and slippery surfaces, snowchains, risk of flat tires, destinations which are extremely hard to locate, deliveries fitted with the wrong address, more paperwork, dirt and carwash, and the risk of delivering the wrong goods or wrong amount at the wrong place this would be an even better simulation of a trucker's everyday life.\n\nBut seriously, this is THE truck driving simulator. If you ever wanted to see what it feels like driving a truck around, this is probably as close as you can get without actually doing it. However, a major difference between this game and driving a truck around in real life is the level of comfort and relaxation. Driving a truck in real life will make you tense, whereas this game is weirdly relaxing.\n\nThe sim is good looking and well made.

But the advances in programming technology, SCS have done a fantastic job with ETS2! As a single player simulator, the game offers a challenge to build up your company, hire drivers and buy trucks, putting you in the management seat as well as th driving seat. With the addition of the multiplayer mod, the game was bought to life and has since exploded in popularity in my opinion. ETS2MP bought the world of virtual truckers together, enjoying the game together, driving in convoys, working for virtual trucking companies and generally having even more fun than single player!!\n\nOverall, the game on its own is fantastic, but with the addition of official DLC's it is becoming an incredibly immersive environment, and some of the mods you can download really make the experience unique to the player. Ive truly not seen a better truck simulator than Euro Truck Simulator 2.\n\nBut dont take my word for it, my hours are good, but i know a few people with 500+ hours on the game!! Creating an experience that good is most certainly something for SCS to be proud of.\n\nNow, no game review is complete without pointing out some of the bad points. ETS2 itself has been out for a while and technology has advanced greatly since its initial release, therefore the physics engine could be improved. eg. why not have the road become slightly slippy when its wet during/after rain? However, I know that SCS are working on improving various elements of the sim whilest creating new exciting DLS's at the same time.\n\nThe ETS2MP Mod (the most popular unofficial mod) shares similar downfalls as many other mass multiplayer games (Call of Duty, Battlefield, GTA Series) whereas the servers become filled with people just wanting to ruin your day by not playing the game properly. It was suggested by an ETS2MP admin that new players should be made to "take a driving test" before being able to play on hte main ETS2MP servers, however I dont think this will take off.\n\nI hope this review is helpful, I truly think SCS will one day create something better than their capabilities, but that hasnt, and wont happen with ETS2.

Limeryn","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107229467/","66 products in account","Back when I had first discovered ETS2, I played the demo for hours upon hours. Starting one profile after another. Once the Multiplayer Mod was released, a friend of mine decided it might be time to actually purchase the game and see all it really has to offer.\n\nNow, I've been playing ETS2 since roughly November 2013. But I hadn't actually had it on Steam up until March or April. I've been involved with the Multiplayer community from day one, and have put over 400 hours into multiplayer alone. But, that isn't really the topic of discussion.\n\nSo, I estimate I've put in about 200 single player hours (90% of which was off the record) and I've got to say, if you enjoy simple, relaxing, and generally stress-free gaming, ETS2 is certainly for you. I can't tell you how much fun I have going from one end of the map to the other, avoiding the sometimes clumsy Artificial Intellegence cars.\n\nI've played around with the Vanilla version, Mods, all the while rounding some of the trickiest turns and windiest roads between Erfurt and Milano. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games I've ever played. It can take roughly two hours to get from one end of the map to another with the speed limiter on. Not to mention it's still being updated. Not too many games that were made even six months ago continue to add on more content, or even just fix little problems or exploits.\n\nI have to give it to SCS on this one. This game is their baby, undoubtably the best game they've ever made. And they treat it as such.\n\nNot to mention the Community. The ETS2 Community is very fond of SCS. And that is for one simple reason: They listen.\n\nSCS listens to the suggestions given to them from within the Community, Unlike most big companies, (Not gonna name any names here... *Cough* EA *Cough*) which seem to only care about the game and it's Community for a short time. While SCS has continued to progress the developement of this game and it's Community. And believe me, guys and girls. We, the Community, notice and appreciate your efforts. So, on behalf of the entire ETS2 Community, I'd like to say Thank you.\n\nThe amount of DLC for this game is quite substantial. With the new Cargo Pack update, and a potential Rigid trucks update coming out (Nothing official, just being considered) this is shaping up to be one hell of an amazing game. SCS, you're going places, and I'll be right here when you get there.\n\nI've been playing trucking games since the days of Hard Truck one, so I know what it takes, and what people generally want. And I'd say you've hit the nail on the head. And I know ATS is going to be flatout incredible. Happy Trails, SCS.\n\nKeep in mind, comparing this game to current gen games is not what I intend to do. It's being rated based on it's release date, and it's updates since then.\n\nPhysics: 7/10.\n\nTruck model detail: 10/10.\n\nMap size: 10/10.\n\nTexture detail: 9/10 (For it's time and what it is)\n\nMenu layout: 10/10. It's super easy to use, and rather user friendly for new players.\n\nImmersive aspect: 10/10. I can't tell you how many times I've started playing, and forgot I was playing a game for a bit. It's really easy to lose yourself in this game with some good music and a Radio Play or two.\n\nOverall, I have to give this game a 9.8/10. It's fantastic, and certainly worth the money.","September 18, 2014","true","757.8"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dani_bhai/recommended/227300/","Dani_bhai","Pr1nc3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dani_bhai/","109 products in account","Euro Truck Simulator 2 is all about living the dream that is professional trucking. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is too serious. The game even tells you as you begin that this is your dream job. With more than enthusiasm, players begin their adventure humbly with a little garage in the home city of their choice, and a company with no trucks.\n\nThe player begins by taking jobs for other companies, earning money from one city to another, with an eye toward earning enough cash and purchasing a truck. An owned truck means more freedom, with higher paying jobs that require more responsibility. When working directly for the player company, cargo is waiting at a select shipping yard and must be hitched to the truck before it can be taken to its ultimate destination. The next step from there is to start upgrading the garage, hiring other drivers to bring in more income, and eventually building a trucking empire that spans all of Europe.\n\nThe more you go, the more there is to do. Want to expand quickly? You can take out loans that need to be repaid. Want specialized drivers? They each level up the same way you do, and you can dictate the way they do. Of course, you also have to be mindful of expenses, be they repayments to the bank or fuel consumption by employees looking for work. There are a lot of ducks to get in a row, but the interface is user-friendly and information is constantly provided so nothing ever feels hopeless.\n\nMore than a game about driving, Euro Truck Simulator 2 boasts some role playing elements to keep things interesting. Successful jobs earn experience, which gives skill points. Skill points can be spent upgrading one's proficiency in certain types of jobs, unlocking new types of cargo, or even investing in fuel efficiency. Improving personal abilities and building a business from one lone driver to an entire fleet.\n\nDriving trucks is as realistic as possible. Offering a huge map of Europe, there's plenty of time to be spent on the open road, and lots of distance to cover. Although you won't be undertaking journeys in real-time, a decent paying job is still quite the investment. I often found myself able to only play one job at a time.\n\nThere are a variety of controls and settings allowing for significant flexibility in terms of personal comfort. You can choose how complex your controls are, with automatic settings keyboard and set up a wheel. Whatever your available input, Euro Truck do a great job of covering you and ensuring you get into the game easily.\n\nA tutorial guides for newcomers, and the essential GPS is easy to understand, as is its clear and simple route map. My first job was a decided disaster, with me getting the trailer stuck a number of times, managing to tip the vehicle over, and even call for emergency rescue.\n\nTraffic lights, speed cameras, and the ever-present need to keep one's eyes on the road can always trip up an overconfident player, and as relaxing as long country drives may be, the pressure to avoid mistakes is present throughout. It's very easy to start getting speeding along a motorway without regard to other drivers and strict speed limits. Every mistake translates into a financial penalty, damaged cargo reduces the payday, and suffered by an owned truck will have to be paid for at service stations.\n\nWhen a mistake occurs, it's almost always our fault, but there are some moments where the computer controlled road users face an issue. But they're few and far between, and experienced drivers will be able to avoid many of the hazard that lead to such trouble. Despite the occasional pressure to perform jobs well, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is still a largely cleansing experience. There's a driving through a variety of countries, a sense of joy as you get closer to your destination, and a sense of accomplishment in performing such boring tasks as refueling at gas stations and finding parking stops at which to grab some sleep. As you build your business up from nothing and take on more of managerial duties, it's hard not to feel pride over rewards well earned.\n\nAlthough most visually advanced game, Euro Truck's believable presentation of Europe's roads and cities and atmosphere of the backdrops, there's a sense of individuality to each new territory you uncover, and the trucks themselves are lovingly recreated with an intricate level of detail. Owned trucks can be repainted and upgraded with all manner of parts, and as the player levels up, the potential for personalization expands.\n\nThe most fun aspect of Euro Truck Simulator 2, however, comes in the form of its music. With the simple tap of the "R" key, you can open up a menu packed with European Internet radio streams as well as your own Music and Radio streams. Providing a wide variety to listen. There's also the option to queue up music from one's own PC.\n\n\nConclusion:Very realistic and very fun to play good game\nGreat Graphics\nLarge map, (With Going East and upcoming Scandinavia DLCs.\nt's a very relaxing game\nIt’s very easy and to listen to music, podcasts or the radio.\nCustomization options for trucks\nLots of different skills to improve to make yourself a better driver or to unlock new types of cargo\nReal truck manufacturers with Different truck designs.\nPhoto mode with different options allowing you to take nice shots of your trucks.\nWorld of Trucks Achievements and Events from the developers to unlock new contents through world of trucks                             website.\nSeat, lights and mirror adjustment, lights are all customizable.\nDifferent cargo types, especially with the High Power pack and some of the skills you can unlock\nDifferent skills to unlock new cargos.\nCustomizable Controls\nPlenty of great mods and it's very easy to install mods\nGame customizable with mods and it's very easy to install mods.\nExtra paint job packs in high quality.\nHigh Quality scenery\nRating:10/10","January 8, 2015","true","637.7"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","21","24","2","2"

You've probably read all the other reviews here and in publications talk about the experience of just slipping into some kind of "groove". You will be cruising down the autobahn with a load of potatoes at 3:00 AM with the radio on to some Dutch station and just lose yourself in that moment, almost as if you can roll down the window and feel the wind blow in. Those moments create immersion in a way few games can and this game will creep up on you with them. When you do make it to Milan with those potatoes you will feel like you've accomplished something.\n\nThe experience is the best part about this game, and while it's great I find myself wishing that the whole "company management" aspect of this game was done just a bit better. It has the bare bones there, you buy trucks, hire guys, buy garages, make money, but I wish it had more depth and strategy than it does. There's enough there to make you care about hitting the road with that load of tractors or upgrading your engine, but it's not quite what it could be to make this a truly killer game.\n\nBut what is here, those "on the road moments", is worth it.","November 28, 2013","true","143.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

This will be a review from my own perspective. My opinion is not a subject to approval. In this review, I will use 10 different categories, each having 10 points. At the end of the review, I will sum these points up.\n\nGameplay\nIn Euro Truck Simulator 2, you control a truck driver, who slowly climbs up the career path and eventually runs a huge company, OR goes bankrupt in the process. You can customize your truck, give your driver a name, and so on. Anything you would want to customize in a truck simulator, is there. The game is very fun and playable in general. It's a great game if you want to relax after or before work/school. You can also level up in various fields!\n\nGameplay score - 10/10\n\n\nSound\nThe game features very realistic truck sounds, and I have no complaints about those. You can hear the rain, thunderstorm, etc. But the biggest flaw I noticed is that I don't hear the AI cars/trucks passing by. It might be a problem with either my sound card or settings, but if I am wrong, I will update my review when I figure out how it really is.\n\nSound score - 9/10\n\n\nGraphics\nAs a game developer myself, I do understand that if the point of the game is functionality, then of course graphics must be put to second, or latter place. Therefore, the graphics and animations for ETS2 are as good as they should be for a truck simulator. I'd really give 11 points here if it only was not against my rules!\n\nGraphics score - 10/10\n\n\nDifficulty\nMy first hours were of course quite difficult to understand the controls. But what helped the the most are the manual and the online ETS2 guide. Thanks to those, I learned the controls and how to play this game really quickly. The developers put their thought into this and for that, I salute them. I don't remember if there was a tutorial, I think there was... I'll check when I get back home.\n\nDifficulty score - 10/10\n\n\nVariety\nThere is a huge variety of landscape, trucks, A.I. cars/trucks, buildings, and everything I would expect this game to have. There are lots of upgrades to choose from. The developers did a great job on that part. The only bad thing which stands out to me the most is probably the people walking on the streets of the cities. Yeah. There are none. But hey, it's a driving game, and maybe the developers decided not to include pedestrians in order to either optimize the game, or invest more time on more important things like trucks/landscape.\n\nVariety score - 9.5/10\n\nOriginality\nI haven't really played any other truck simulators in the past, so I'll just put a full 10 here.\n\nOriginality score - 10/10\n\nEconomy\nThe economic/business management part of this game, however could be improved much more. There's really not much you can micromanage. You can't negotiate with your employees about salary, you can't promote them(only level  them up). You can't enter how much you really want to take from the bank. There are no competitors, even if you see the actual A.I. trucks driving on the road. However, the economic part of the game is still playable, I'm not saying it's not. It's just that tycoon-maniacs like me might find this as a huge flaw.\n\nEconomy score - 5/10\n\n\nA.I.\nThe AI in this game is really well developed. It, however,  still behaves strangely sometimes - the cars sometimes don't follow the road rules, sometimes they glitch out. But overall, the AI just about right.\n\nA.I. score - 8/10\n\n\nControls\nLike i stated before, the controls are well-accessible, and are easly to learn and customize. You can even use a wheel with pedals, pretty much what all driving games offer, right? Perfect controls.\n\nControls score - 10/10\n\n\nPrice vs. Quality\nThe game is 20 euros. It is too low. Should be 40, or 50! Buy it before it raises! You will not regret it!\n\nPrice vs. Quality score - 10/10\n\nOverall\n\nOverall score - 91.5/100","October 11, 2014","true","20.2"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Honestly I wasn't too keen on a game for driving trucks , then a friend gave me it and I'm glad i got to play it. For starters , i wasnt successful on my first save , which some may find too, but it gets so addicting when you get into the game past your first truck . Pros , offers a very realistic experience , including trucks and roads that fell as if you could get into any volvo truck in real life and drive accross europe on your knowlegde from the game , propably stall the truck but thats besides the point! Offers many choices in technique , personally i chose manual gear box (shift up and down gears ) and mouse steering for a realistic enough feel , i would recommend that settings. Graphics are jaw dropping on ultra and excellent on good . Cons. At the start it was so boring , and if you dont think you will ever have a love for driving or trucks or business simulation , be best stay away , but i would give it a chance. 2, Ultra realistic , if you crash too much it could cause you to go so much in debt that you might just reset your game save . 3,Unrealistic ai , sometimes the ai can be stupid , like would someone ram you in the side at a T junction , probably .\n\nTo sum it up short , great game , very realistic , can be boring , but rewarding , and be sure to stay within those speed limits ( only if you see the speed cam sign)","October 23, 2014","true","82.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PaniniT/recommended/227300/","PaniniT","Panini_Tom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PaniniT/","17 products in account","Ever since I purchased Euro Truck Simulator 2 it has been one of my all time favourite games, with myself playing over 75 hours, all of which helped be grow and expand my company. Although the game never ends, once you are earning more money than you could ever need, and you don't really know what to do next.\n\nThe Performance of this game is incredible! I could run smoothly on my old laptop on medium settings and on my desktop I play on elevated high settings smoothly. The graphics are very realistic in high settings but sometimes out of place. Most motorways in the UK in the game look the same but none the less the experience in terms of graphics is amazingly realistic. Definitely see the performance for youself and do youself a favour and download the demo!\n\nWhen I first purchased the game I owned a Thrustmaster 458 italia racing wheel, which as the market goes is near the bottom. The wheel worked with the games like Insane 2 very well, but for Euro Truck Simulator 2, since it only had a 90 degree turning radius in each direction the sensetivity was insanely high. I changed the controller imput from 'wheel' to 'gamepad' and the sensetivity issue was fixed, but nothing felt real, as when holding the wheel still in real life, the wheel kept turing in the game, it took getting used to and did work but I didn't really like it and it caused coutless MVAs.\n\nOnce I was hooked properly on the game I invested in a Logitech G920 racing wheel which has a 900 degrees turning radius. All my problems were fixed, the driving force shifter felt realistic and worked perfectly, the amount I turned the wheel in real life was mirrored in the game.\n\nThe scenery in the game is very good and HD but is out of places in a lot of the game, my fix for this is to either go with a scenery mod like ProMods, which is a bit of a hassle to get working or try the Scandinavia expansion. I bought the expansion and it looked really good, I've never been to Scandinavia but I got a feel for the place, it looked really good and was definitely woth buying.\n\nGoing East came with my version of the game, but didn't really click with me, the east side of the map felt just like the rest of it but the price reflects that I think.\n\nI would recommend both Going East and definitely the Scandinavia expansion if you love to drive, but if you just want to mess around and are casual, don't bother.\n\nAs I got more into Euro Truck Simulator 2 I starting looking for ways to improve my experience, origionally I looked towards VR and the oculus rift which the game is compatible with, but the price put me off so I instead bought Track IR 5 with the standard head clip. The clip worked and fits onto any hat, and meant I could look around the environment as if I was in it. Although expensive, really cool and awesome.\n\nOne of the things that I love about Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the endless posibilities with customization of trucks, you can change everything... literally everything, the wheels, tyres, exausts, sun visors, interior trim, and loads more! There are endless posibilites and having played lots of the Truckers multiplayer have never seen anyone with a truck like mine.\n\nOne thing missing from the game I think is some realistic damage to the environment and your truck, which never happens, everything is clean and un-dented. Hopefully SCS can think about that one.\n\nOverall Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a brilliant game, very much woth the money and heaps of fun to play if you are serious or want to mess around. I recomend this game to anyone with interested in driving games as it is in my oppinion the most realistic driving simulation on the market. There are plenty of mods to have fun with so is perfect for any player,\nThanks for reading and happy trucking,\n~Panini","April 12","true","86.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","1"

You don't get too many trucks BUT you get plenty of variety when it comes to customizing. The map is pretty big and you can easily expand it with modifications (I DO recomment ProMods, their map expansion is like, REALLY polished and REALLY huge). If you get to add your favourite playlist or an online radio station, you'll love this game for sure.\n\nOh, and, thanks to this game I started looking at mirrors when turning or changing lanes in the other games.

The only reason I bought this was because one of my friends was nagging me to buy it. When I first played it, my first hour was literally crashing everywhere trying to adapt to the controls. But the more I played it, the more I loved it. You can own your own buisness and travel around a huge chunk of Europe. Definitely a must buy! Give it a chance, it's worth it.\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nAbout\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is the 2nd game of the Euro Truck franchise. You drive around Europe, completing deliveries and earning money to manage your own company. You can hire drivers to work for you by also completing deliveries around Europe. You can buy your own truck and design it in anyway you choose. Make your dream come true...... but in a video game.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is pretty simple if you've played simulation games beforehand. There are different modes for controls so for newcomers it shouldn't be too hard to adapt. Once you're used to handling your truck, it can be pretty relaxing. The game has tons of real-life radio stations for you tune in to. Your truck pretty much has things a real life truck would have, such has headlights, indicators and a horn. It even has steering wheel controller compatibility. There are 8 different camera views, so you can drive your truck at different angles. An almost basic style gameplay (Unless you go for the more advanced modes).\n\nDesign/Graphics\nYou don't need a super powerful PC to run the graphics at a high level. The developers have done a great job at detailing environments as best as they can. Some locations are beautiful to drive through, where as others are a bit plain and simple. The graphics aren't the best I've seen, but they're good enough to show a beauty element to it. The graphics settings are easy to navigate, should you need to change them.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nWhen looking at some of the screenshots, I can see some people being a bit overwhelmed if they haven't played many simulation games before, but as I said before, you easily adapt. As long as you know the controls, you don't need to worry about all the things you see around your steering wheel. Managing your company can be confusing at first, but the more you play, the more you get used to it.\n\nPros - Very realistic\n- Huge world to explore\n- Beautiful environments\n- Different driving styles\n- Real-life radio stations to listen and relax to. :)\n\nCons  - Some parts of the road make no sense. E.G. Roundabouts.\n- Can be confusing for people new to simulator games.\n- Some environments can be plain and/or repetitive.\n\nFinal Recommendation\nAs many people have said, this game is more of an experience. You don't have to like simulators to like this. You don't have to live driving games to like this. If I ever want to play a relaxing game, this would be the game I'd choose most of the time. It provides many hours of enjoyment, with plenty of things to do.\nI would definitely give this game a go!\n\nFinal Verdict - 9/10.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlTuC18xVII\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/227300/\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Now that I am playing though I can't stop playing, it's pretty addictive to drive and build up your company!\n\nIs this game a simulation? Yes and no. Yes overall it is a (driving) simulation, but in the finer details it is not so much. Specially the whole road network and traffic is not quite real and a bit to generic. I wont go into all the details, but the road network is not like that in real life in Europe (and specially not the same for every country). How the highway ramps/exits are designed and how just one lane can be used to not take the exit I have never seen in Europe. Even though it's not that realistic, it is not something to get annoyed about, it is what it is and it works.\n\nAs for the environment, that too (so far as i've explored it) is kind of generic (though nice looking), I don't really notice much difference between countries. When I am driving in Germany it could just as well been Poland or Slovakia or something. Some countries do have some unique buildings and scenery. The Netherland has windmills next to the road so you recognise that easily. However The Netherlands apparently also has hills, something I have never seen, and I am a Dutchie. And Austria and Switzerland does not have the Alpes mountains anymore. Those countries in real life have some great (tricky for truck drivers) mountain passes, but they are not there in the game. Mountains only exist as distant scenery, all the driving is done on hills at most.\n\nOverall the game has a bit to much copy/paste scenery/buildings/roads making more or less every country you drive through feel the same due to the same roads and what you see next to the roads. It would of course have been time intensive and costly for the devs to create unique buidings and environments for every country, but now it feels a bit to lazy. Even the vegetation and trees is exactly the same everywhere, there are maybe 4 or 5 different tees types on the whole map, grass and flowers are the same in whole Europe.\n\nI have never driven a truck so I can't really tell how realistic it is, besides I am playing with a controller and not with a wheel. The handling and phisics does feel nice and it really gives the feeling you are driving with a 10 ton trailer behind you.\n\nControls (controller) has a pretty aweful default setup and the game does not 100% support an Xbox controller. Not every button on your controller can be used to bind functions to so you are stuck with limited controls, however the most important things can be used with the controller.\n\nCamera. It's great you can look around in your cockpit and look at both mirrors, but while driving I can't really use the camera, because I don't have a 3rd hand I can use. Playing with a controller you can setup one of the joysticks for the camera, but then you will have to setup the other joystick for both steering and braking/accellerate which results in unplayable driving. So in practice in the truck I always have the camera straight ahead and totally rely on the mirrors. Now I don't see much of the nice scenery though as I can't smoothly look left/right.\n\nGraphics in general is nice. I think they made a good compromise between quality and performance. The truck models look really great and high poly and the overall cars (traffic) look pretty good too. I especially love the sky and clouds in this game, it really looks nice when you drive into the morning sun and see those nice clouds. As for buildings and general terrain and scenery, it's nice, but not wow or anything.\n\nConclusion:\nThis is a really fun and addictive driving game/simulation that is suited for a very wide audience. I think almost anyone can have fun with this game/sim if you like driving. The game/sim can be set up to be played as an easy arcade suited for any age, but you can also ephatize the simulation aspect and make it more challenging. This game is a nice getaway from all the competitive games. It's very relaxing to just drive from A to B and meanwhile enjoy the scenery and the sun shining through the window while listening to some music. Dispite the few critical/negative notes I made I think this is a pretty solid game that I will at least sink a 100 hours into.\n\n\nVerdict: 80/100\n\n","January 6","true","58.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

There is a lot of long drives for sure, but as the modding community comes alive there are new and larger challenges around every corner. The graphics are excellent, the trucks feel right, and when you mess up and hit the wall you pay for it. These aren't race cars and driving them as such will only come out of your pocket.\n\nThe added ability to hire drivers and build a trucking empire, while it still sounds tedious, is not nearly as boring as it sounds. The more you grow your company the more you can goof off and risk that speeding fine, car crash, or other poor decision.\n\nAll in all Euro Truck Simulator 2 is worth a look by all gamers.

This is one of those games that isn't fun, yet it's still entertaining.  Maybe, it's because it's kind of relaxing, just driving a big truck along European highways at night, with nothing to worry about except getting to Point B except offcourse obeying the traffic rules and knowing what your side of the road you are on specially in the UK.\nI like also dig the concept of starting out your company from scratch and make it successful.  In addittion, you can pretend travelling through Europe and enjoying the amazing landscapes.\nThe single and probably the main reason this game is so appealing to me is the fact that I can listen to my own music playlist or watch a youtube clip  and still play it.  I like that in games.  Sometimes, I pause for a while and read news articles online then come back and play.\nThe graphics are decent, and the gameplay has enough variety to keep you going for a while, with many different European and UK cities.  And the developers are great, offering expansions and DLCs to an already great game.\nI would definitely recommend for people who enjoy simulators because this one is pretty good.  I haven't tried the multiplayer mod yet.

I've ridden in Rigs, many relatives of mine drive trucks, as well as a friend.  I stayed in my lane mostly (until I'd hit my touch pad on my laptop, haha). I moved my turn signals to A and D since I use my mouse to steer. Q became my brights.\n\nGotta watch out if you pass up the gas station just a hair, there always seems to be a rig behind you and backing up ends up giving you a violation for a wreck! (Object's distance when that far back on a 1920x1080 resolution is nearly impossible to be able to judge how close that rig behind you stopped)  LOL  I only ran over about 15 cones in the construction area. (yeah, ONLY) haha.\n\n(And a friend of mine was texting (in RL) while driving a rig in the game and she nearly blew through a tool booth! LMBO!!!)\n\nI found it fun.. Some may stress over it.. but to me, it's just a game and it's fun to explore what it is like to drive a rig in a virtual reality setting. Visuals are great! Just wish that camera sound would stop when taking images! Steam uses f12 for me and this game was using both f10 and f12. I deactivated the f10 option but f12 still makes that shutter sound. Steam settings have sounds turned off for ingame captures. No clue how to fix that issue.  I got a lot of speeding tickets too! haha\n\nWhen I very first started playing, I forgot it was not American and I went down the wrong side of the road .. Another violation! And people keep cutting me off!  But my rating for the fun/ease of use/ new experience - I'd give it a 8/10 myself.\n\nI haven't figured out yet if hazards or high beams affect but no headlights at night = ticket/fine/loss of money. Backing up is HARD for me. I jackknifed more than I care to admit..\n♥ Roll on 18 wheeler, Roll on! ♥\n\nI hope you guys can enjoy it as I did. One more note. I used keyboard and mouse.. Mouse to steer. I played 4.1 hours straight my first game.. Must say something about how cool I think it is.. ^.^ (And you don't have to hit E to start the engine. You can hit W as well, which is "drive"..)  AND you can add your own music!!!  ( ♥  ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♥ )\n\nKeep an eye on your side view mirrors as you turn... Easy to hit a vehicle or other object (Signs, rails, buildings, trailers) if your turn is too sharp and getting up some hills is nearly impossible but not impossible :D\n\nYou can also adjust your seats, position in the seat and other cool little tidbit settings ^.^\n\nAnother note: I've only purchased the base game as it was a good deal but hope to purchase the others later, as they drop in price! :D  Have fun truckin' if you do like these types of games!

Euro Truck Simulator 2 is not one of them, it is strangely cathartic, engaging and relaxing. Unlike other niche games, there is a smaller barrier to entry and features a simple control scheme for newcomers.  There are some reservations such as an infuriating penalty system and a lack of vehicles on major highways but these are outweighed by the positives.

This game is the complete opposite of those things.\n\nWhile there is a bit of a learning curve at first (especially if you aren't from a European country), you can easily find yourself sinking a lot of time into this game.  The map for the game is very expansive, and it will take hundreds of hours of gameplay to discover every motorway, dual carriageway, small country road, and city.\n\nEven with this game being out for over year and a half, the developers continue to provide new updates and DLC that continue to provide new and exciting things to try.  And if they don't provide something you want, the modding community is very large and there are many different sites each with a plethora of different mods you can try (modding is also as easy as dragging and dropping).  Want a fancy Peterbilt, or a map with over 200 cities covering almost all of Europe?  There are mods for those.\n\nIn short, you won't be disappointed in this game if you enjoy casual trucking simulators.","August 31, 2014","true","795.8"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Nothing beats the feeling driving the truck in 90 km/h while listening to those country music.

And god, those trucks are awesome as ♥♥♥♥, and you can upgrade your trucks from the tires, body, dashboard (incl. accessories), engine, suspensions, paintjobs, basically everything. Every delivery you complete will net you some exp, money and skill point. After you has some dough, you can hire new drivers, trucks and garages.\n\nThe map is big enough (without the dlcs), IMO.

You do see the light of cars in the mirrors well enough at night, but that's about it...\nThis has to be remedied in a patch soon!\nThis has been fixed in a recent patch.\nNow the AI cars are visible enough so you actually see them at night!\n\nThere is no visible damage on your truck or other vehicles.\nYou can throw your truck into a barrier at 170 km/h do several summersaults and end up in a ditch, but the only thing happening is that you hear "Beep" and a sign showing how much damage your truck has.\nI haven't seen that kind of "realism" since TOCA2 during the late 90:s...\nNeither does damage affect your trucks performance, you might hear an ill sound from your gearbox, but as far as you end up on your wheels you can drive off from just about anything...\n\nYou can't modify or set your own route on the Route Advisor(GPS/Satnav),\nInstead you must use the route set by default, which is the shortest route to your destination, but not the fastest. This route can be over ridden by driving another way and have the Route Advisor select a new route.\nFixed in a recent patch\n\nThe highways exits are not all believable with turnoffs being about the same length of your truck, often downhill with a sharp bend which is not only highly unlikely but would be suicidal if present in real life.\n\nThe "You can't drive here" barriers are blocking the view, especially at night. Why the developers didn't lift them up in the air is beyond me.\nThis has been fixed in a recent patch.\nThe graphics showing these aren't obstructing the view as much and foremost they don't blind you at night.\n\nThe road signs doesn't make much sense most of the time and wouldn't do much good in real life either.\nLike all of a sudden there's a road work with 30 km/h and a red light.\n\nAI cars follow the traffic rules most of the time when they mess up accidents do happen, which is realistic.\nHowever it does take a while to learn how to live with them, because they have a bad habit to do strange things because they only have four modes.\n1: Stop\n2: Panic brake\n3: Speed camera\n4: Full speed ahead.\nSo being behind them is difficult, especially when they overtake each other as the vehicle being overtaken is:\n"HELP SOMEONE OVERTOOK ME I MUST STEP ON THE BRAKE!!!"\nThis is slightly better now since a recent patch\n\nThe generic towns are too dark, again I think it's highly unlikely that you have a roundabout with no street lamps.\nWhich makes driving into them almost impossible at night, for the reason mentioned above.\n\nThe company which you manage and run is so simple I wish they left it out completely.\nWhy does your drivers or your self for that matter earn a salary?\nYou work 24/7.\nThere are no competition between the drivers, they have no wishes for advancements or anything.\nThis could have been done much better.\nAlso there are no competition to other companies which makes the whole thing pretty redundant.\n\nThe trucks you own or let your drivers have doesn't affect their mood or your own stamina.\nThe only thing you have to care about is that your driver has to sleep.\nOne could have imagined that having the most expensive cabin would affect the rate of which your driver gets exhausted, but it doesn't.\n\nIt rains only during thunderstorms, with different levels of fog.\nAlso in relation to weather there are no seasons, instead  you play the same day during the summer.\n\nThese things mentioned above* I do hope will be fixed in ETS3.\n\n* Except the head light thing  because that must be patched.","February 16, 2015","true","426.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/recommended/227300/","lesalanos","Trip Hazard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lesalanos/","382 products in account","Euro Truck Simulator. Three words which, in isolation, seem innocuous enough, but which when spoken in sequence can put even the most ardent gamer to sleep.\n\nIf you’re still reading this, then that means you’re still awake. You passed the first test.\n\nIf my tone seems cruel and mocking now, that’s because when I first heard about ETS, I did cruelly mock it. Trucks? Boring. Simulation games? Boring. That’s what my STUPID brain thought when I read the title, and it relayed the various commands so that I might signify my condescension. Fake yawn, patronising shake of the head, roll the eyes. Fart a little bit - my bottom pleading to be involved somehow.\n\nAnd so I ignored it, for about a year after its release, until I read an article (I forget where, or by whom) which said that even though it sounds like it’ll be boring, it actually isn’t.\n\nIt is. It is a bit boring, but in a good way.\n\nFirst, the meat. ETS is a game where you drive a truck and deliver goods around Europe. You start off doing freight jobs in loaned trucks, but will eventually earn enough to buy your own, which is when you’ll see real money coming in. You’ll continue earning money until you can rent premises, hire people and buy more trucks for them to deliver goods in, earning you even more money. That’s it, really. There’s not much to the business management side of things, so once you’ve got your own truck you could just ignore that aspect entirely. Control options are fairly customisable, which is nice. I play on a 360 pad (very “casual mode”) with all the assists turned on and automatic gearing and whatnot, and it’s lovely. Relaxing. But if you want you can have 50 different buttons on the keyboard devoted to different functions and really take control. The holy grail, of course, is playing with a wheel and decent pedals, but I doubt I’ll ever get the chance to try that out.\n\nAfter I played the demo until about 3am, I decided to buy ETS. I couldn’t say that I had had a lot of fun, precisely, or that I’d learned anything about what it is to drive a truck, or any other aspect of trucking. But as the rain fell upon my cab in Calais, and the wipers swished hypnotically back and forth, back and forth, I had felt tremendously involved. In that time I’d gone from Manchester to London, then all the way to Scotland on some slow, winding roads, and then belted back down south and across the channel. I’d signalled properly, watched my speed, and stopped at the lights like a good boy. Is this even a proper game? Where are the zombies?\n\nOften, when we talk about games we talk about atmosphere. How does this game conjure the atmosphere or exploring an underwater wreck, or how does this one make you feel like you’re in the middle of a war, running for your life. ETS has an amazing amount of atmosphere: you really will feel like you’re sat in traffic on the M56. And if that sounds mundane, fair enough, it probably is, but somehow this game seeps into your pores and you start to care. You want to make your delivery on time, and you want your cargo to be undamaged, and you want to ease the trailer into the bay like a boss (your first time around this will seem impossible). It can be tremendously satisfying to get things right, and very stressful when things start to go wrong. I remember driving past my exit somewhere in Germany and having to take a huge detour. Pressed for time and with my truck running on fumes, I started driving faster, more recklessly. That job cost me a lot of money, and in real life, would have earned me some serious jail time.\n\nSpeaking of jail time, the way fines and penalties are handled in this game is a little odd. There are no rozzers to speak of, and when you, for example, hit another car or run a red light you will automagically be fined a set amount of money, curse under your breath and continue on your way. That’s it. It’s a bit disappointing to me that even if you careen into a mini at 100mph, there will be no real negative consequence to that. A small fine, that’s it. Worse still is the infuriating way speed cameras are handled. If you’re doing 31 in a 30 zone as you pass one, you’ll get a fine. Shouldn’t there be a bit of leeway, like in real life? I’m not sure what the game is “simulating” in that situation.\n\nThe AI in this game is hilarious at times, too. I remember once a car flashed me to let me out of a busy junction, and I thought that was great. It didn’t seem like a scripted response at all, and I honked my horn in approval. That’s only even happened once in about 60 hours. More often than not you’ll see drivers stopping dead on the sliproad for no reason, or entering a roundabout in the wrong lane at the wrong time as you pull 22 tons of furniture in their path. I remember one particularly determined driver who got himself wedged under my trailer as he tried to change lanes. I got a big “collision” fine for no reason, and he put his hazards on, pointlessly. I’d like to say this stuff is rare, but usually you’ll see some crazy AI behaviour on every job you take.\n\nLook, I love this game. It’s what I love to play when I want to unwind. Undeniably, it is repetitive. Even if you’re going somewhere new - and on a map this size you often are - you’re still essentially going through the motions. But, like taking a big dump, these motions are very satisfying, and the odd glitches and quirks of the AI add to the charm somehow. It’s a big achievement that a simulation game, such as it is, has managed to find quite so broad an audience. Give the generous demo a try, and I think you’ll soon be seduced by its shiny, chrome encrusted charms.","February 3, 2015","true","98.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","1"

This is a game where you can chill, as though you are indeed driving through Europe. When you do the larger missions, completion is fabulously rewarding, as is the excitment the game manages to give when you purchase your own truck.\n\nThey have managed to get the scaling down of Europe and the speed of time spot on in my opinion. The perfection means that it's not too slow going from one country to another, but there is a certain marathon of time to fare in driving. I think this plays an important role in how much satisfaction the game gives you; getting 20,000 virtual pounds has never felt so good after an hour's drive.\n\nI'm not going to pretend this game is bang on though. Things do end up being repetitive; for example the locations for a company are exactly the same style of building no matter where you are. There are limited AI cars (themselves a bit dim-witted), the motorways could do with being a little bit busier (like rush hour), and the turn off junctions on motorways are extremelly inaccurate.\n\nMy suggestions for an update would be to allow the driver to skip a track whilst driving in music, and for the fuel prices to be updated through the internet to match the current prices. Surely that's not too difficult?\n\nThat may sound like a proper moan, but these are tiny issues that can't overlap the fact that this is a very well designed game with jaw-dropping physics on the trucks. Just don't tell your friends that this is a more enjoyable game than most action games out there...","January 18, 2014","true","190.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You should have, as there is no way getting around this wonderful simulator, at least not if you want to be a real PCGamer... but what makes that sim-game so special?\nEuro Truck Simulator makes it easy for any new players to jump right in and is very suitable for beginners as the options allow for massive customization when it comes to how realistic the game shall be. Talking about beginners, you don't need to have the latest and greatest PC in order to enjoy the game, it even runs on a five year old Intel HD Graphics but trust me, if you're lucky enough to own a high-end graphics card/ a decent rig in general, you will be able to push the graphics to a level on which you might be able to forget that you are just playing a video game! Anyways, if you don't want to sleep, you don't have to, just remove the mark in front of the fatigue simulation and you are free to drive for how long you want! But if you're one of those players, who would give everything for realism, you will also be absolutely pleased by what ETS2 has to offer. Let it be the fuel consumption of your truck or the air brake system, the possibilities for realism fanatics are endless. At that point, I should also mention that the game has great support for various steering wheels and TrackIR to give you the best possible driving experience. It is also possible, to mod the heck out of your personal Euro Truck Simulator version, in order to make it your very own experience. For those of you that aren't very interested in modding, you can also purchase a wide array of DLC packages that will add new parts of Europe or some new tuning options.\nBut does that mean that the game is flawless? No, it's not. Considering the AI drivers' behavior or some of the old parts of the map, there are some minor problems here and there but they definitely don't brake the game or make it unplayable. Just enjoy the game and listen to some of your music in the background, you will not regret it!","February 8","true","430.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","9","10","4","0"

The graphics and scenery of this game are amazing although I believe that it could be improved upon in the future as well.\n\nThe game reflects simulation well, you pick up a cargo, you deliver across countries and drop it off, this process will not be enjoyable for people who are looking for a fast paced games or non-repetitive games as developing your in-game company will take a long time, from completing a delivery that might take over 1 hour of real life time, to having enough money to purchase a truck for you and your employees, hiring employees for your company and purchasing/upgrading garages.\n\nThe game also supports steering wheels which is a very important aspect to this kind of game, and it also supports mods which there are thousands of that were created by the community members that allow to expand upon the basic game.\n\nNow moving back to the development of the game, the developers are doing an amazing job. With the release of Going East! and Scandinavia expansion packs, this really opened up more kinds of deliveries, more amazing scenery (Mountains!), more diverse roads and most importantly, more locations to travel and explore to from the basic game. In the basic game (without Going East! and Scandinavia), the motorways were pretty boring to drive on as 70% (estimate) of the time you would spend continuously driving on the motorway which can get quite boring really fast especially if you have a long journey ahead of you. However, Scandinavia and Going East! opened up more diverse type of roads rather than just plain motorways which I really liked.\n\nTo top off the review, this game has an unofficial Multiplayer mod that you can download and play as long as you own an Euro Truck Simulator 2 copy, it allows you to meet and play with your friends in a single server which is a really nice addition to this type of game, now if there could only be an official Multiplayer!","January 14","true","550.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

I don't understand.\n\nThis game... it shouldn't be fun, it's got all of the makings of everything boring. It's a game where you drive on the motorway to deliver stuff to warehouses. But it's fun...\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is sort of like being shown a 4D cube as a citizen of the 3D universe. It just baffles you. For starters, I haven't played the other "simulator" games like Train Simulator or Garbage Truck Simulator (seriously?), I bought this because something just compelled me to. Perhaps it appealed to my secret yearning to drive around Liverpool in a giant truck in the rain with my windscreen wipers on. It's a great simulation, the controls work brilliantly (though I had to tweek them a little to fit my preferences) and it recreates the roads of the world quite accurately (I assume, I only know the roads of North England).\n\nMy only real gripe with the game is that it doesn't seem to actually simulate the cities of Europe. When I said you can drive around Liverpool, you can only really drive around the outskirts of the city. It's really a shame, but I suppose the game makers didn't have time to recreate the major cities of Europe.\n\nYou'll probably find this game a lot less bewildering than I did if you like boring stuff like driving down the motorway. It practically infuriates me how this game is fun when it shouldn't appeal at all.\n\nI don't think I'd pay the full £15 for this unless I was a real truck/driving fanatic, but in the sales I'd go for it.","January 2, 2014","true","6.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I know it may seem rather unusual for a woman to be interested in a game such as this, but that's mainly a stereotype. I enjoy the relaxing feeling I get from just driving around from place to place taking in all the scenery from city to city. Euro truck 2 for me captures the very essence of logistics. It's a game I could see myself playing non stop, and I am talking hours at a time of game play. My favorite series of trucks in this game are of course Scania, but I found that all of the trucks besides Scania have a unique look and feel to them. The graphics are amazing simply breath taking and the ability to take photographs in game are an added bonus that I am sure will please anybody trying this game for the first time. I highly recommend you grab this game try the demo first see if you like it. I am pretty sure you will find it as pleasing as I did.","March 8, 2015","true","39.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","5"

The truck driving and beautifully weaved scenery gives you goose bumps for the immersion it hands to you. The game itself is quite unique in its own respect as it breaks all the arbitrary boundaries and restrictions that many other simulators place on the table. Euro Truck Simulator 2 liberates itself and goes above all the others.\n\nBut why is Euro Truck Simulator 2 fun?\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 completely redefines the epitome of the simulator. Even though it is quite esoteric in the way it is built, it still offers a wide array of features which all come together to make it a fabulous game.\n\nI consider Euro Truck Simulator 2 the leader of all simulation games and is very idiosyncratic to me as it gives me open world features which lead me to have  a freedom of choice in all my actions including  as where i want to go around Europe. Aswell as that, the multiplayer enviroment allows me to junket around and witness the often hilarious moments of seeing others jack-knifing their trucks in traffic which leads them on to rage in chat.\n\nMany open world games are quite infinitesimal; but not Euro Truck Simulator.\n\nThe world is large and has many different high poly models which help it represent what it is. These models include world wonders such as the Eiffel Tower.\n\nOnce you are immersed in the world you often become oblivious of your real life chores and you struggle choosing between bed time or "Just... one.. more.. job!". Your real life will become a red herring to Euro Truck.\n\nAlthough this game was released in a precocious state it has been patched and made better with recent additions and when Multiplayer was added. Multiplayer has revolutionalized the state of the game for many players, including me. Aswell as that, multiplayer has paved the way for social interactions between players and players making rules as to what is propriety.\n\nNow what is Euro Truck on its own?\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is a vast and open world game with a high amount of immersion thanks to its highly detailed cabin with fantastic textures including normal maps and high poly models. These highly detailed models allow for us to revel and bask in all their eternal glory and is just scintillating in the way they are designed exactly like the real trucks.\n\nThe sound engine in the game is just phenomenal ranging from turbo whistles to indicators and to idle truck noises it really pops into your head wherever you are and becomes very ubiquitous.\n\nOverall I consider Euro Truck Simulator an absolutely marvellous game which all compiles together to create a fantastic experience through sound, graphics, immersion, social aspects and even the driving mechanics.\n\nJust don't mention the Artificial Intelligence. (atleast it's disabled in MP)\n\n.. please.","August 29, 2014","true","32.5"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","6"

It's important to note that the trucks are very fun to drive and feel pretty realistic, and once you gather enough money you can upgrade and mod them.\n\nThe game itself provides great graphics, physics and mechanics. Also the map and the environment are very beautiful and very massive, which is making your trucking experience even better!\n\nWhat also is worth to be mentioned is the huge modding community which is taking part into improving the game a lot, for example there is multiplayer mod that came out few months ago, so now you can truck with your buddies as well!\n\nSome people will find this game boring at first, but once in a while its good taking rest of fast-paced games and just drive, chill and listen to your favorite radio station meanwhile, not to mention the fun situations you will get into. :)","June 21, 2014","true","57.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The thing which grabbed me were the nice graphics, the story (having your own logistics company) and well that's it. After playing it I realised that this game is very addictive, because it's very entertaining. Do you think that wasting gaming time on driving virtual trucks is boring? Well, think again mate. This game offers a lot of hours in ways such as customizing trucks, exploring cities & roads, explore trucks & garages and making sure your logistics company runs smoothly. The game might be stressful in the beginning, because truck driving is different from driving a car. But trust me, it's totally worth it. This game not only satisfy me, but it also gave me some passion about trucks. So, stop looking at reviews and check this game out immediately!!","September 15, 2015","true","57.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","3"

You can easily put hours into this game and never realise. After putting 162 hours into the game myself, I figured I should leave a review!\n\nBasically, this game gives you the freedom to travel the roads of Europe, driving any truck you desire, completing jobs from Aberdeen in Scotland to Lublin in Poland and everything in between. The trucks are fully customisable, and there is also a level up system, allowing for longer distance jobs, eco driving, more important cargo and better trucks unlocked.\n\nYou may purchase your own garages in the cities you visit across Europe, and hire drivers to work for your company. The more you earn, the more upgrades you can do to your garages and the more trucks you can buy as well.\n\nThe devs at SCS are excellent and come out with great updates and DLCs. Also, if you're a modder, this game has a great modding community and awesome scope for mods of all kinds.\n\nIt is a great simulation game, if you have a wheel and pedals to use, the experience is even better. But you can also use a normal gamepad if you desire rather than keyboard, it is up to you how you play. The trucks drive like they should do, you can feel the weight of the trailers you pick up.\n\nOne of the things I love most about this game is the environment. SCS have done a great job with creating the world of ETS2, and each country has a slightly different feel. I love driving through the Austrian mountains as well as the countryside in the UK. The weather and lighting is also brilliantly done.\n\nI have owned ETS2 since February 2013, and I still enjoy playing. I highly recommend this game!","August 10, 2014","true","329.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/recommended/227300/","wrath-","Wrath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wrath-/","145 products in account","This is an odd game to review because, like Crusader Kings II, it's fun - but a very specific kind of fun that might not be for everyone. This is obviously a driving sim with a healthy mix of logistics and entrepreneurship and it's hard to sell that to people who aren't already interested in it, which is why the trailer to this game looks lost and confused. People like videos that highlight the action and, honestly, this isn't a game that has a lot of it. This game doesn't have explosions, it's relaxing, if anything. You transport objects and make money doing it. For some people, this is boring, but for the target audience, that's a cool concept in and of itself. It's probably the meat of what people describe as being the intangible backbone of what makes this game good.\n\nWhat makes life in this game tolerable?\n\nWell, the first thing that comes to mind is that an enormous amount of time was spent trying to get the roads and scenery to look convincing. If you're on the M5 and pause the game, go to Google and drop the streetview cam on the approximate spot where your truck is, it's going to be pretty darn similar to what you'll see. Road signs will toned down and simplified, but the traffic cams will not. People without cars will soon learn what a pain in the butt they are for commuters. Road patterns like interstate on/off ramps will be recycled, but that's pretty much what happens in real life as well.\n\nWhen driving down an interstate, it's obviously not in anyone's interest to make a two hour trip to Bristol actually take two real world hours, so time and distance are abridged. So are cities and the insane traffic patterns and congestion associated with it. This means that, sometimes, it's O.K. to go to London.\n\nThe game can be as accurate as you like when it comes to operating your truck, from incomprehensible (how gears work in real life) to arcade (magic transmission - W means go).\n\nRadio stations are real. If you choose, you can have your truck radio stream the actual radio stations of whatever country you want and whatever languages they are broadcast in. This is a pretty fun feature and adds to the immersion in the game.\n\nThe biggest downside? Traffic. It's inconsistent and has a few bugs. The most pressing one is that NPC drivers have no concept of their own safety. Honestly, I'm not sure what their pathing is, but they seem to cruse right into you as if you were not there, even with proper signaling. That said, they're better than I expected for AI behavior for the most part. If you signal that you want to turn across an oncoming lane, the cars will ocasionally stop and flash their lights to indicate that they're willing to stop for you to get across.\n\nAn unrelated disappointment is that weather is not dynamic to your location, it's a global setting. So, the chance of rain in Glasgow is the same as Paris.\n\nThe final remarkable disappointment I can think of is that, like I mentioned earlier, roads and cities are abridged. And while I definitely don't mind avoiding cities for their suicidal traffic AI, they're very unconvincing for the most part. Unless it's is a larger city that they are particularly proud of, like Klagenfurt and Venice, the majority of "cities" are maybe ten blocks? Residential areas and all? It makes the final destination a repetitive anticlimactic end to a long drive.\n\nThe game is still being worked on, obviously. Scandinavia will be released at some point and there's already a host of mods for amateur-created areas. At some point, it's possible that the drawbacks I've mentioned will be taken care of. Even if they aren't, there are far worse and game breaking problems that it could have, but doesn't. The devs have put a tremendous amount of time into this unfathomably large and complicated project and it's solid because of that. As far as a truck driving sim goes, this is probably as good as it gets for the foreseeable future.\n","March 18, 2015","true","45.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The game feels very different compared to what it was in April 2013 compared to December 2013 due to various improvements (dynamic auto transmission, dynamic fuel, other tweaks)\n- New trucks are being added to the game for free.  In other games, these would be DLCs.\n- DLCs are very modestly priced, great value for money.\n- Very easy to install mods from a highly active modding community.\n- SCS official forums are a great place to ask for help in a mature manner.  i.e. Very informative, but not suitable for the attention-deficit crowd.\n\nNegatives:\n- You'd better love trucks and simulation or else you'd die of boredom.\n- Trucks probably handle a little too well around tight bends.\n- Some bends and gradient changes can be smoother.\n- UK motorway design is very Continental.\n- AI traffic have their annoying quirks  (but the developer says they are working on improving this).","December 9, 2013","true","058.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You can pick a radio station to listen to (or put in your own music), and relax to some music as you drive to your next destination.\n\nThere's a ton of customization options for your truck, if you are into that sort of thing.  But this game has a lot to offer casual players as well.  I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you enjoy driving and you are looking for a change of pace from the usual racing games/crash simulators.\n\nAlso, you can play this game with a keyboard or mouse, but I highly recommend a steering wheel.  I ended up buying a Logitech GT racing wheel with pedals.  My daughter makes fun of me because I have this fancy setup, and all I do is deliver cargo with it.","November 25, 2013","true","114.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Lately the game came with many graphical improvements and physically. You have several options to customize the tractor for free. The big problem with this game is financial. Expansion packs, custom paints and other things like "Cabin Accessories" cost. The game updates are focusing just for fixing bugs and implementing a single new thing, everything else costs.\nTo buy the game, the expansions, 2 DLC (High Power Cargo and Cabin Accessories) and all of the paints cost around 89,21€.\nTo buy just the game and the expansions with the 2 DLC it's cost 56,45€.\nI think is too much for a game like that.","November 27, 2013","true","195.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I have played this game for nearly 4 years and it is astonishing. As you can tell by the amount of hours I have on it, you can see that this is a game that I am very fond of. The single player is good as it gives you the opportunity to build your own company from scratch and also use some of the awesome modifications that the games brilliant modding community has created. Then we get to the multiplayer....... this mod brings a whole new life to the game as it allows you to truck around Europe with your friends! Not only that, the MP allows you to build up your own virtual trucking company or join one of the many ones that already exist. If this doesn't interest you, why not join one of the many convoys that are hosted each week? After all, the multiplayer is free so you have nothing to lose.\n\nI stronly recommend you purchase this game if you just want to sit back and relax and hit the endless amount of tarmac that this game has to offer.","March 30","true","428.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

Or a giant foam hand that sends mooks flying into the stratosphere, never to be seen from again? These are generally called Lethal Joke Items, and are usually something you laugh at for the silliness and keep using for their inherent power.\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is the Lethal Joke Item of videogames.\n\nI bought this purely for giggles. 'Oh look, a trucking game, hahaha!' I though. 'I bet it's boring!'. I was completely wrong. The game boasts a high level of accuracy to real-world trucks, and the amount of care put into it is staggering. Dials, readings, even seats and mirrors are recreated with obvious care and detail, not to mention the audio. The gameplay also has varying levels of complexity to allow for both hardcore simulator fans and casual drivers to play on the same field (even more-so with the Multiplayer mod, still under development). The game manages to keep itself fresh, breaking up the long motorway driving with tricky country roads, or even throwing roadworks, tollbooths and traffic at you. And the customisation can keep people like me occupied for hours, tweaking and twiddling with paintjobs, wheels, even the lights. Coupled with a side of business management in the form of hiring and training drivers, there's enough to keep players going.\n\nHowever, it's not without its downsides. Unless a player takes out loans, getting your company going is a slog. On top of that, the business management could do with some expanding (such as having hired drivers appearing on roads, or simply being more involved in setting criteria for jobs). However, these are minor issues on top of a rather excellent simulator cake that, quite frankly, surprised me with how good it actually is. The premise is a bit silly, but discount it at your own peril. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is still a quite good game.","July 7, 2014","true","100.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

I attempted to play this game as it was intended, but I soon discovered that being a complete and total sociopath was much more fun and rewarding.  Like my namesake Sanic, I made it my mission to make every delivery as fast as humanly possible, regardless of mechanical, monetary, or medical consequence.  On a 2 lane highway I'll drive down the center line, leaving a long line of cars behind me, unable to overtake.  On 3 lanes or more, I'll sit in the center lane, watch my mirrors, and if anyone tries to overtake me, I'll move into their lane to cut them off.  If I get lucky I cut them off in the process of overtaking me, charging me 400 Euros for a traffic violation, and sending the zippy little sedan into the median in order to wait for ADAC.\n\nI find its helpful to yell obscenities at the foreigners.  On the way to Dresden from Berlin, I drove a minivan off the road.  As I passed them I leaned my head out the window and shouted "That was for Pearl Harbor!"\n\nI've collected enough speeding violations and vehicular damage (both to my own vehicle and to those around me) that I'm now several thousand Euros in debt.

I've now made it my mission to become a bigger drain on the European economy than Greece.\n\nThe internet radio stations were a nice touch.

If I get lucky I cut them off in the process of overtaking me, charging me 400 Euros for a traffic violation, and sending the zippy little sedan into the median in order to wait for ADAC.\n\nI find its helpful to yell obscenities at the foreigners.  On the way to Dresden from Berlin, I drove a minivan off the road.  As I passed them I leaned my head out the window and shouted "That was for Pearl Harbor!"\n\nI've collected enough speeding violations and vehicular damage (both to my own vehicle and to those around me) that I'm now several thousand Euros in debt.  I don't exactly know how their monopoly money converts to actual currency like USD, but its more debt than I'm willing to pay off.  I've now made it my mission to become a bigger drain on the European economy than Greece.\n\nThe internet radio stations were a nice touch.  It really topped of the atmosphere of the game, and taught me how to pronounce the funny made-up words they put in the game like Poznań and Szczecin.\n\n10/10","January 13, 2015","true","15.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","100","6","6","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/227300/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","This game without a doubt is awesome, but is missing a few key elements for it to be complete.\n\nI'm not sure why, but I got in the mood to drive a truck with a trailer. For some reason, the challenge of wanting to be able to maneuver a tight turn was a yearning. Therefore I was willing to try the best of the best so they were saying.\n\nUpon choosing a character skin, truck skin, and company logo I embarked on my journey to become a trucker. The menu is extremely friendly (and very chic) and allows you to change almost anything. Controller compatibility is also accommodated here to a great extent. ETS2 has great gameplay. Steering, driving, shifting, turning, backing up all feel quite accurate. Don't go around holding the gas all the time though. I got a few speeding tickets that way. This would be an ideal dream for those who played Grand Theft Auto and loved to drive by the rules. Actually following the rules of the road in such a big machine is quite tough, at least from a first person view. Lining up the truck nicely when coming out from the curb to see oncoming traffic poses quite the challenge. This game definitely gave me an inside look of the difficulties truckers face when driving. There are a lot of side jobs that are offered and jobs that you can take upon yourself counting towards for your company. I would highly suggest practicing driving in reverse as it is one of the most difficult tasks you may encounter. The ability to build up a company and hire drivers is an enjoyable experience, but can feel like a grind at first. What was a neat feature was that sometimes the AI would let you merge when changing lanes, and sometimes there were AI that crashed into one another which would lead them to turn their hazards on. Sounds cool, up until your stuck behind crashed AI that won't PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD! It's hard going around signs and cars with a giant tractor trailer.\n\nVisuals are extremely appealing and all the truck details seem to be there. Roads are complete with beautiful scenery and weather conditions. Besides driving in the sun, night or the rain, it would have been nice to be challenged with a bit of snow.\n\nSounds seem as real as they get. It's nice driving and simply hearing a motor running.\n\nWhat I do want to make a few remarks about is the fact that you aren't able to drive up on ferries and board them when going across seas... which was sort of disappointing considering. Another disappointing fact was drivers don't seem to have any personality. Bland AI seems to be driving around everywhere. I wouldn't mind seeing someone react to me honking, or some crazy idiot driving swerving through lanes or trying to cut me off, or the slow guy that everyone passes. I know this game was meant for proper driving but I'd love to see a few collision mechanics at their best. What would be a huge deal breaker would be to add pedestrians. Yes it could be gruesome (so add an option to turn it off?) but watching over for civilians crossing is something to keep in mind when driving!  All that being said, I would still like to see a truck driving simulating game that puts the player in a city where they have to make turns in busy pedestrian and traffic scenarios. Sure it would be hard to make entire maps for cities, but even have a few scenarios to choose from with a few tight roads to outmaneuver through would be cool. On the road in the country side, adding wild animals would be another idea to think about. Would make night driving interesting. This may be veering to close to reality but adding actual police cars that pull the truck over would intensify the experience. Imagine a car chase with a truck!\n\nThe game is good and would recommend a purchase on sale. I really hope though they do add what I mentioned into future games as I would literally like to foresee the trip on and off the road.\n\nRating 7.45/10\n\n***Also, having a walk through on how to use the mods would help!\n\n***Local co-op or split screen would also make this game un-real!\n\nEDIT SEPT 2015 : They have greatly improved the interface of this game. Everything is a bit easier to manage.\n\nScreenShots :\nProud owner of my first IVECO truck\n\nEven if it's green, check the small signs out that indicate to yield\n\nPassing a coach and another semi\n\nVisual","April 4, 2015","true","22.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

You won't regret it!\n\nUpdated after patch 1.9:\nAbsolutely fantastic work by the devs! New AI makes the NPC AI vehicles behave closer to real-world drivers (and sometimes they behave like idiots too, just like real world drivers!). New physics means your truck now will shake, wobble, etc etc depending on the weight of the load and the speed you're going at, as well as the terrain you're moving on.\n\nFine attention to details such as traffic lights going from red to green immediately in some cities, and in other cities, going from red to amber to green.\n\nTruly amazing update! Makes a great game even better!\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED!\n\nNormal version:\nWow... this is a sleeper hit for me. When this first got released, I never even gave it a second look - "What's so fun about driving a truck?". I play simulators like F16s, Flanker, and so on. To me, this would probably be as boring as watching paint dry.\n\nWell amazingly, it IS fun. A friend kept recommending it to me so I finally caved and said "Ok I'll try it but I'm not gonna like it" and so I downloaded the demo, gave it a whirl and I changed my mind really quick! I was wrong about all the preconceived notions I had about this game.\n\nI can't really describe to you how sometimes it can be relaxing to be driving across Europe, or sometimes it can be frustrating as heck. Adding mods to this game, changes this game from "great" to "awesome"... like how Skyrim is great in its own right but when you add mods to Skyrim it becomes awesome. Same for this.

You also advance in your driver's career, adding skills every time you gain enough XP; those upgrades are needed to take longer trips, carry fragile/expensive/dangerous cargos which let you earn money faster.\n● You can listen to your favourite music in-game, being it a Streaming Radio or MP3 files.\n● ETS2 is highly moddable and there is plenty of Mods: I can suggest "ProMods" for Single Player and "ETS2 Multiplayer Mod" which adds a living layer to the game (only human player are in there).\n● You can have your favourite avatar and plate, registering at World of Trucks website (they will also give you a free key for a "Metallic Paint Jobs" DLC).\n\n\nSome downsides too:\n\n● The AI is not the best, sadly. You'll have to pay a lot of attention when driving near crossings or when switching lanes, because the AI drives faster than you and it doesn't care very much about you; a little delay in your maneuver and some car can easily hit you - and yeah, you're the one being fined - always.\n● Mods: they're cool but you should chose wisely and do not draw the longbow. Some game breaking is to be expected, so always save your game before adding a new Mod. Another problem with them is that if you want to remove any, you'll have to reload a previously saved game and all of your gameplay with that Mod will be just gone; so, again, pay attention while modding.\n● The game is a little "heavy" on Graphic Cards, but I guess that's to be expected.\n\n\nI've got this game on sale, no DLCs, but I'm enjoying it so much - recommended.","April 1, 2015","true","396.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

It's a simulator which means you have got to be patient while you develop driving skills. The driver skills are a great way to upgrade the driving experience.\n\nIt's not just about going places and admiring the scenery. You have got cash which means you gotta bank it. You start as an employee but sooner or later, with more jobs and more money, you get to have your own rig and build your own company. This is where I just love the gameplay! Especially when you are looking at the showroom and the expensive choices that feels just about real to make you value your hard earned income.\n\nThere is a very dynamic weather available that can go from a quite sunny to a gushing thunderstorm that can test your road skills. The night cycle is really dark and you can customise headlights to view better. Nothing becomes frustrating. The cargo you carry come in different varieties and payloads.\n\nFor my final verdict, I give this game 9/10.

Simple, right? Not as much as you might think. The bones and meat are a driving game, yet it’s so much more than that. It’s making those late night deliveries, driving through thunderstorms, and racing down freeways to make sure those Just-In-Time deliveries are delivered, well, just in time. It’s those situations that take the game to another level. Even when it’s a lazy drive though, the game is still great. In my opinion, the cities are a little bland, but where the game really shines is in the landscapes. Countrysides look fantastic, from the rolling hills and fields of sunflowers to the trees swaying in the breeze and rays of sun illuminating the pavement ahead of you. The game has a lot of content, and does a great job with what it gives you. Driving, doing deliveries, obeying traffic laws, it’s just fun. Of course, that isn’t all the fun to be had…\n\nBeing only about 4 hours into the game, I can’t speak much about all that you can do, so I’ll just tell you about some of my experiences.  My first experience was in the demo, where I learned how to drive while responding to traffic flow, obeying traffic rules, and even parking a trailer (harder that it looks) in a simple and fun tutorial. My second experience found me being cut off by some jerk during a peaceful delivery, chasing him down at terminal velocity, and then spotting and proceeding to drive through a meadow of sunflowers (so pretty :D), which eventually led to the detachment of my trailer and first ever service call for engine trouble. As fun as the game’s core is, it also teaches you about yourself, and allows you to stray off the conventional path a bit.\n\nSometimes it's fun to follow the rules and soak in the scenery, and sometimes it's fun to be a little unconventional. There's no "right" and "wrong" way to play this game. It's your game, do what you want, and just have fun. It is what you make it. I'm not going to tell you to buy it, but rather this review's purpose is to influence you into trying the demo, and forming your own opinion. It certainly isn’t the type of game I normally play, but has proven to be a worthy entry in my library. And maybe, just maybe, in yours as well.\n","June 4, 2014","true","47.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I always thought it‘s very boring and repetitive and it will be fun only for an hour or so. But i was wrong. I decided to risk and buy this and i didn‘t regret this. The game is great. It looks repetitive and boring but when you play it somehow time flies very fast. It‘s very relaxing game for me. Just open the beer, turn on the in game radio (which by the way has real stations) or your music library and start driving. It really feels very good. Especially when you‘re driving at night on narrow roads while raining.\nThe controls are very precise, trucks have fully functioning dashboard. Everything you do is displayed correctly on in-game dashboard, from wheel turning to wipers and turn signals. The game is designed to play with a steering wheel, it really adds to the game. I tried to play it with an xbox gamepad before, but it wasn‘t so fun.\nThe graphics can be ugly at times and sometimes it‘s great. Especially at night while raining, it looks amazing. Worst thing about graphics is that the game does not support AA. The performance is not very good too. Bearing in mind that the graphics is not the strongest side of the game the performance should be much better. You need quite a powerful computer to play it on high settings. But it's nowhere near unplayable. It just could be better in this department.\nThe game has plenty of mods which adds new maps, trailers, logos or improve the graphics so the game will not get boring for a long time.\nDon‘t think and just buy it, especially if you have a steering wheel and you love drving games, this is a must have.\n","May 14, 2014","true","161.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","4"

This game may be labeled Indie but don't let that discourage you, the attention to the finer details and the quality surpasses many AAA titles. ETS2 is an absolutely shining example of what a simulation game should be. This game offers amazing value and should not be confused with the many shovelware simulation games which continue to be pumped out on an almost weekly basis.\n\nNot only is the game amazing but so is the team behind it. 2 years past initial release and ETS2 is still seeing frequent updates which offer both improvements and additional content of which many of these are offered as free upgrades to the original game.\n\nPros\n\nSome of the small but amazing elements which make this great:\n\n- This game doubles as both a truck driving simulation and management game. As you progress through the game you obtain the funds to hire workers, expand your garage and purchase additional trucks.\n\n- The map is virtually endless and feels immensely larger than I have seen in any other game I have ever played. After ~25 hours play time I've only explored 15% of the available area.\n\n- The AI is awesome. They abide by road rules, use indicators when turning, provide ample space for pulling out once you begin enter the lane they occupy. Not only that but they overtake slower cars, adjust themselves and continue after their path is interrupted and more.\n\n- Licensed truck brand names with multiple visual and performance impacting upgrade paths which are unlocked as you progress.\n\n- Places an emphasis on playing the game as if you were a truck driver. The environment, physics and mechanics of the game force you to behave as if you were really driving a truck. To some this may feel restrictive but in my opinion it adds a good amount to the realism of the game.\n\nCons\n\nOf course, having said all this no games are without flaws. The issues I have with this game are largely related to focus on more refining what is already an amazing game, these are:\n\n- The lack of vibration (Xbox controller) makes driving feel too stable.\n\n- The lack of roadkill on the roads, leaves/branches falling from the trees and blowing around on the ground and small number of pedestrians are a missing element of the game which would certainly add to the realism.\n\nOverall a 9/10 rating for this deceptively enjoyable game which is great for both small and long gaming sessions.","November 30, 2014","true","105.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","4"

I've never driven a vehicle in real life, but Euro Truck Simulator knows that not everybody is skilled driver, so i can change the "difficulty", aka just press W to go forward and S to slow/go backwards. First 50 hours, i've been driving with a keyboard. Drove about 55 thousand kilometers, then i left the game for a while because it was quite boring. But now i've made a fresh new profile, which is fun to play. Euro Truck Simulator 2 also beats Euro Truck Simulator 1, which was so boring for that money i spent on it (about 40 euro then) by several aspects\n\n1. Graphics - ETS2 has beautiful graphics and good optimalization, so with some time spent, you can make the game playable (My setup is Intel Core 2 Duo and 650GTX for your info)\n\n2. Features - I don't have to park at the end (much better for me, i'm lame at parking correctly, always took me like 15 mins), GPS! You don't have to check the map every 5 seconds, you always carry your GPS which points you to the end of the journey! Also the GPS has ETA time (calculated time when will you arrive), time left to ship the trailer, and other good things\n\n3. AI - Sorry for swearing, but before 1.9, AI was total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Not because cars are flying around, but cars that driven like idiots, made me slow, waiting 5 minutes, blocking, crashing because you're lame and stuff, but after 1.9, the drivers have gotten brains so they arent driving like drugged ♥♥♥♥ers.\n\n10/10 would play again\n","May 26, 2014","true","145.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

I have driven just about every type of truck, hauled most types of loads, and did so for nearly 18 yrs. Since being forced into early retirement for medical reasons. I have tried every truck simulator out there, looking for a means to keep my skills sharp. Though this is based in Europe and it's primary focus is on COE's. This is the most realistic semi/ truck simulator out there. The world dynamic's are the most true to life I have ever seen. The shifting actually behaves like it should in a real truck. This is by far the best truck simulator out on the market. Can't wait for one to be done for America and Austrailia.\n\nIn no other truck simulator out there, could I drive from the 1st person view. This one I haven't had to take it out of it. The views are spot on, the feel that comes thru is fantastic. All you need is a real truck cab mockup, a vibrating device tied to the engine noise, rumble strips and with a large enough screen, it's doubtful you would realize this was just a game enviroment. The only downfall I have found, the engine noise level inside the cab is way too low. I'm used to being able to drive by the sound without gauges, because of this I have to look from time to time. Generally I find this to be a worthy value and a great trainer aid. I am glad I found this simulator here on Steam. I'v also added some DLC mods as well as other mods that expand the map, trailer types and cargo. Makes it much more to life. But ETS2 is still a great starting point on its own.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/227300/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","I saw this game was the Deal of the Day about a week ago, and so I checked it out. It appeared to be one of those forgettable games with a generic name that was just trying to cash in on based on just the picture from Steam's store page, but I was intrigued anyway because I love all things cars and trucks, though I've mostly been stuck as a car hobbyist and racing genre fan, and never played driving simulation games. Based on the reviews I saw, this one was worth checking out--so I bought it and the Going East DLC.\n\nShort summary: this game is awesome in so many different ways. You start out as a low tier leveled business owner, and they don't give you any benefits of the doubt--you have so little money, you don't even get your own truck (yet). You can work for other companies, using their trucks to deliver cargo to a handful of cities across Europe. You have to obey all traffic laws (I made the mistake of rolling through a red light because I hadn't noticed they were there to be obeyed, and was charged a fine), and you have to deliver the cargo in a timely manner. If you damage the truck you're working with, the repair cost is deducted from your pay. The time you have to finish the job is also pretty relaxed--this is no Crazy Taxi, though they do have skill upgrades that allow you access to more time sensitive jobs that pay more for the benefit of a quick job.\n\nSpeaking of which, yes, you level up in this game, and this is also great. You can level up in different ways such as in fuel conservation, where you use less fuel and therefore save more money, or you can unlock a number of different jobs by leveling up your training in different areas. High valued cargo? Check. Fragile cargo? Yep. All of these give you access to even more jobs from the extensive list you already had, and you're able to pick the jobs that pay more (it's also great to pick jobs where the delivery is in a city you've never visited, so you explore more of the map and see new sights).\n\nControl-wise, this game also plays extremely well. At first, my time with the controls was chaotic. I've been using a 360 controller to play, and I tried to mess with too much at once, and ended up getting stuck in parking lots because I couldn't figure out how to reverse (ha). If you want to use a controller, I'd suggest not changing the controls from the standard they pick for you at first. Drive around a bit before you decide to change anything.\n\nMoving on, as you make money doing jobs using another company's truck, the bank will eventually contact you and let you know they're offering you a loan. It's enough to buy your first truck, but you'll have to be diligent in making sure you make enough money each day to make your loan payments. With your own truck, you're free to explore the map without a time limit (though you do pay for gas!), finding new truck dealers, farms/factories/cargo drop offs, recruitment agencies, and even future garages that you can buy to expand your grasp in the truck business industry across Europe. Once you work hard at that, the bank will increase your credit limit--allowing you to upgrade your garage if you wish, allowing you to buy additional trucks and hire drivers for you.\n\nDriving simulation now gives way to business management, and this is pure enjoyment of the genre here. You have a number of garages you can obtain later on in the game once you have enough money, but at first, you'll just be buying another truck and assigning it to the additional space in your garage, where you can hire a driver to use. You can use any recruitment agency you've found to hire a driver, and from there you can hire them based on their skills and rating. Not only do they also level up, you can choose how you want them to work. For example, I chose to have my first hired driver focus on long distance jobs, since I myself was focused on shorter jobs that dealt with fragile or valuable cargo. Your hired drivers will also improve their rating over time, as they constantly are driving and working to improve their skills, though you have the authority to fire them if you so wish.\n\nLast but not least--part of the charm in this game is just driving. It felt great to be driving a truck pulling 16 tons of cargo down the highways of Europe, discovering new cities and fulfilling contracts. I knew that with each job I completed, I was a tiny bit closer to paying off my loans, proving my worth in the industry, and making enough for that next truck or next upgrade. Also, the game has a radio feature, which lets you listen to live streams of a great selection of European radio stations--yes, real stations in real time while driving in a Euro truck simulation--and this is awesome. Last night while playing this game, I was driving my truck to a city I'd never seen before, pulling tons of cargo in the dead of night. Only once in a while would another car drive by because of the time, so I was mostly alone on the road. The radio station was playing some older American rock hits between commercials in another language. I was able to zone out. It was simply beautiful to just drive alone on a highway at night, listening to classic rock. I've never played a game that makes you feel so relaxed, so in awe of everyday things...and I've played thousands upon thousands of games. This game does it right.\n\nI can't really say this game surprised me--based on the list of positive reviews, this game is a hit with many. But to think a game named Euro Truck Simulator 2 could be one of those games where you're watching the time get later and later and you think to yourself, "Just one more, then I'm done, I swear!" If you like trucks, you will love this game. If you like driving simulation, you will love the game. Heck, if you just enjoy driving like I do, you'll love this game. If you like business management games, you'll love this. If you love games where you start off dirt poor and actually have to work hard toward proving yourself, this game is one of the best you can buy. If you're looking for something you can pick-up-and-play to relax, yeah, this game is that, too. When I bought this game, I had hoped I made a good choice, and my husband kind of made fun of me for the purchase since he knows anything with cars or trucks makes me weak, but when I played it, he kept looking over and saying, "Wow. I guess I can see why that would be interesting." And he has zero interest in automobiles and rarely plays simulation games!\n\nSo, with that said, the long summary comes down to this: this game is awesome for pretty much everyone.","April 14, 2014","true","103.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

ETS2 is a very relaxing, enjoyable, challenging and therapeutic game with so much to do and so many things to achieve. The concept is incredibly simple but as an actual game it works so well, it is difficult to explain why it's so fun, but just is!\n\nYou start off as a cargo truck driver for hire, doing small or large jobs for money so that you can form your own business with your own fully customisable trucks in a beautiful realistic environment. The cities and routes are not 100% accurate and not as long (that would be ridiculous) but it doesn't matter. There is still hundreds upon hundreds of hours of game play on offer and fantastic scenery all around the developers vision of Europe in this amazing simulator.\n\nThis time last year, I would have said that I do not understand how a truck simulator could be any fun as ever since I was a child I have questioned the fun factor of simulation games, but I am so glad that I spent £7.50 for the collection (ETS, ETS2, Bus Driver, Trucks and Trailers, Scania Truck Driving Simulator and plenty of DLC for ETS2), an absolutely amazing bargain.  Some of the best money I have ever spent and I have only played the one game of the collection so far!\n\nETS2 is worth every penny, so if you see it even cheaper than it's full retail price pick it up and you won't regret it.

While driving across beautiful landscapes, manage your business, hire and fire drivers, fully customize your truck, and play through the most moving story any game has to offer. One man, alone, no shoulders to cry on, no crutches to help him stand, must strive to avoid bankruptcy in an unforgiving and realistic environment. The graphics are stunning, the driving is amazingly realistic, and the dynamic environment with moving cars is mind boggling. If the player turns on his blinker to make a turn, there is a chance that the car opposite of him will stop and let him make the turn. And when a player collides with another vehicle or object, the truck actually takes damage that costs money to repair, is deducted from the payment if the damage was done to the trailer. I can't think of any other game with realism as immersive as that. The leveling system is even better then that in games well known for unique and superior leveling systems such as the Call of Duty franchise and the classic E.T. for Atari. It provides this unique learning experienc that you can get no where else, making you feel as though while your character levels up, you gain a certain understanding of the real world. There were a few downsides of the game, though. For example, this game does not give you the experience needed to qualify for a CDL-A, which disappointed me, given the exemplary story and graphics. Also, it does not provide you with a steering wheel or pedal set for the complete Euro Truck Simulator experience. While most game designers wouldn't, I expected this games creators, or artists, if you will, to put themselves where everyone knows they belong: Above the rest of us. All in all, 10/10 must have, with an ending sure to bring tears to your eyes.","January 5, 2014","true","48.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/recommended/227300/","lovinglife139","lovinglife139","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lovinglife139/","1123 products in account","I saw this game was the Deal of the Day about a week ago, and so I checked it out. It appeared to be one of those forgettable games with a generic name that was just trying to cash in on based on just the picture from Steam's store page, but I was intrigued anyway because I love all things cars and trucks, though I've mostly been stuck as a car hobbyist and racing genre fan, and never played driving simulation games. Based on the reviews I saw, this one was worth checking out--so I bought it and the Going East DLC.\n\nShort summary: this game is awesome in so many different ways. You start out as a low tier leveled business owner, and they don't give you any benefits of the doubt--you have so little money, you don't even get your own truck (yet). You can work for other companies, using their trucks to deliver cargo to a handful of cities across Europe. You have to obey all traffic laws (I made the mistake of rolling through a red light because I hadn't noticed they were there to be obeyed, and was charged a fine), and you have to deliver the cargo in a timely manner. If you damage the truck you're working with, the repair cost is deducted from your pay. The time you have to finish the job is also pretty relaxed--this is no Crazy Taxi, though they do have skill upgrades that allow you access to more time sensitive jobs that pay more for the benefit of a quick job.\n\nSpeaking of which, yes, you level up in this game, and this is also great. You can level up in different ways such as in fuel conservation, where you use less fuel and therefore save more money, or you can unlock a number of different jobs by leveling up your training in different areas. High valued cargo? Check. Fragile cargo? Yep. All of these give you access to even more jobs from the extensive list you already had, and you're able to pick the jobs that pay more (it's also great to pick jobs where the delivery is in a city you've never visited, so you explore more of the map and see new sights).\n\nControl-wise, this game also plays extremely well. At first, my time with the controls was chaotic. I've been using a 360 controller to play, and I tried to mess with too much at once, and ended up getting stuck in parking lots because I couldn't figure out how to reverse (ha). If you want to use a controller, I'd suggest not changing the controls from the standard they pick for you at first. Drive around a bit before you decide to change anything.\n\nMoving on, as you make money doing jobs using another company's truck, the bank will eventually contact you and let you know they're offering you a loan. It's enough to buy your first truck, but you'll have to be diligent in making sure you make enough money each day to make your loan payments. With your own truck, you're free to explore the map without a time limit (though you do pay for gas!), finding new truck dealers, farms/factories/cargo drop offs, recruitment agencies, and even future garages that you can buy to expand your grasp in the truck business industry across Europe. Once you work hard at that, the bank will increase your credit limit--allowing you to upgrade your garage if you wish, allowing you to buy additional trucks and hire drivers for you.\n\nDriving simulation now gives way to business management, and this is pure enjoyment of the genre here. You have a number of garages you can obtain later on in the game once you have enough money, but at first, you'll just be buying another truck and assigning it to the additional space in your garage, where you can hire a driver to use. You can use any recruitment agency you've found to hire a driver, and from there you can hire them based on their skills and rating. Not only do they also level up, you can choose how you want them to work. For example, I chose to have my first hired driver focus on long distance jobs, since I myself was focused on shorter jobs that dealt with fragile or valuable cargo. Your hired drivers will also improve their rating over time, as they constantly are driving and working to improve their skills, though you have the authority to fire them if you so wish.\n\nLast but not least--part of the charm in this game is just driving. It felt great to be driving a truck pulling 16 tons of cargo down the highways of Europe, discovering new cities and fulfilling contracts. I knew that with each job I completed, I was a tiny bit closer to paying off my loans, proving my worth in the industry, and making enough for that next truck or next upgrade. Also, the game has a radio feature, which lets you listen to live streams of a great selection of European radio stations--yes, real stations in real time while driving in a Euro truck simulation--and this is awesome. Last night while playing this game, I was driving my truck to a city I'd never seen before, pulling tons of cargo in the dead of night. Only once in a while would another car drive by because of the time, so I was mostly alone on the road. The radio station was playing some older American rock hits between commercials in another language. I was able to zone out. It was simply beautiful to just drive alone on a highway at night, listening to classic rock. I've never played a game that makes you feel so relaxed, so in awe of everyday things...and I've played thousands upon thousands of games. This game does it right.\n\nI can't really say this game surprised me--based on the list of positive reviews, this game is a hit with many. But to think a game named Euro Truck Simulator 2 could be one of those games where you're watching the time get later and later and you think to yourself, "Just one more, then I'm done, I swear!" If you like trucks, you will love this game. If you like driving simulation, you will love the game. Heck, if you just enjoy driving like I do, you'll love this game. If you like business management games, you'll love this. If you love games where you start off dirt poor and actually have to work hard toward proving yourself, this game is one of the best you can buy. If you're looking for something you can pick-up-and-play to relax, yeah, this game is that, too. When I bought this game, I had hoped I made a good choice, and my husband kind of made fun of me for the purchase since he knows anything with cars or trucks makes me weak, but when I played it, he kept looking over and saying, "Wow. I guess I can see why that would be interesting." And he has zero interest in automobiles and rarely plays simulation games!\n\nSo, with that said, the long summary comes down to this: this game is awesome for pretty much everyone.","April 14, 2014","true","103.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

That sounds a bit boring but hey, first give the game a try.\n\nWith the "simulators" trend growing insanely (have a search on the store) and most of them becoming a true joke (have a search on Greenlight), you would expect this game to be incredibly bad programmed and to have graphics from 2002. BUT let's have a look at the definition of "simulator" on the dictionary:\n\nA piece of equipment that is designed to represent real conditions, for example in an aircraft or spacecraft\n\nGrass simulator, Goat Simulator, Surgeon Simulator and all that are overcrowding the store granting a wrong idea of what a simulator actually is. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a seriously made simulator.\nWhat do we find when we get our hands on the game? First thing up, an amazingly huge amount of truck parametres to set up. Damn, every single thing you can control in a real truck is there and you can set them to fit your rig's capabilities.\n\nThen, the graphics. Although textures at some point are not as you might expect them to be, graphics detail is pretty decent if you set brightness and gamma to make the signals and road lines clearer.\n\nOn the controller field, any input is comfortable. I play with pad (xbox 360 controller) and it works well. As there are many parametres to take care of while driving, the more complex your rig is the better, but the devs had a nice touch with non-wheel users and you can mix even three kinds of input to work simultaneously. For example, you can drive with a pad and control the GPS and deeper truck options with the keyboard.\n\nAI is... erm... well, it's AI. On such complex game with hundreds of roads and signalisation it is a challenge to make a proper-working AI. The thing is that AI is right, but it lacks interaction with your truck. No matter you have your indicators on they will smash into you at insane speeds (speed limit doesn't seem to be valid for them...) and €400 ticket for you.\n\nThe game then will catch you on. It even has radio (!) which you can set with your local music. Driving around is relaxing and, although the cities you can drive to don't include the real life spots, it makes you want to drive to every single of them to bag some mileage in.\n\nAnother good fact is that the game is constantly updated and the devs are including enhanced sounds, new cities, and new trucks quite often.\n\n9/10","April 4, 2015","true","12.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","4"

ETS2 is a very relaxing, enjoyable, challenging and therapeutic game with so much to do and so many things to achieve. The concept is incredibly simple but as an actual game it works so well, it is difficult to explain why it's so fun, but just is!\n\nYou start off as a cargo truck driver for hire, doing small or large jobs for money so that you can form your own business with your own fully customisable trucks in a beautiful realistic environment. The cities and routes are not 100% accurate and not as long (that would be ridiculous) but it doesn't matter. There is still hundreds upon hundreds of hours of game play on offer and fantastic scenery all around the developers vision of Europe in this amazing simulator.\n\nThis time last year, I would have said that I do not understand how a truck simulator could be any fun as ever since I was a child I have questioned the fun factor of simulation games, but I am so glad that I spent £7.50 for the collection (ETS, ETS2, Bus Driver, Trucks and Trailers, Scania Truck Driving Simulator and plenty of DLC for ETS2), an absolutely amazing bargain.  Some of the best money I have ever spent and I have only played the one game of the collection so far!\n\nETS2 is worth every penny, so if you see it even cheaper than it's full retail price pick it up and you won't regret it.

A game where the basic concept is simple, you drive your truck from point a to point b, get rewarded with money and continue on with future jobs, but where other simulators fail to hook the player, Euro Truck Simulator 2 manages to do the job right.\n\nThis is not your average driving a truck simulator, in it you actually get to upgrade your vehicle, upgrade your character, level up, customize almost anything on your truck and even start your own company where you can hire other people to drive your trucks and make money for you. But hey, if you don't feel like doing any of that, there's always random jobs up on the job board from people that have a truck and need you to do a delivery, after you finish the job you return the truck and get your money, nothing more and nothing less, so this way I find it extremely easy to get into and just enjoy.\n\nDriving for great distances can sometimes be associated with "boring" which is not the case at all here. I find this to be the most relaxing game I have ever experienced, often times playing a couple of podcasts at the radio, sit back and enjoy a long drive, there's nothing like it really and you can't bash it till you try it, trust me. Time in the game is compressed, so for example, a 10 hour drive in real life will be about a 40-60 minute drive in the game, this is for a couple of reasons, but mainly to get you engaged on as many roads as possible, to admire everything it has to offer!","February 3, 2013","true","16.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The first time i played it, i didn't understand it. After playing it some more, i realised that it is one of the most engaging games i have played. For me, driving in a truck for countless minutes on end was quite boring but the deeper you go, the more there is to it. Leveling up and earning cash became more and more rewarding. As you begin to build up a fleet of trucks and drivers, the game becomes more exciting and engaging. Building a company and driving long distances is really what this game is about. If you enjoy the game you will probably try to install mods, addons and large maps that can sometimes even be a whole country. They have also added a radio in the game that can give you actual live music from real stations around the world! Its a sensible game with a user-friendly interface that anyone withought any previous trucking knowledge can play around with.\n\nNow to the negatives... The AI is just unbearable, having to bear with stupid drivers is a huge let down and ruins the realism the game tries so hard to deliver. [This will probably be updated in the near future so dont worry too much] Cargo choices are quite broad but the game somehow chooses to give you the same load frequently. One of the largest flaws of the game is head turning, i say this because everytime you look right or left at a turn. As a result you won't be able to achieve proper speed of decision-making. Although there are many more flaws, they are mostly tiny and you usually wont realize them.\n\nI guess what i am trying to say is that it has great potential as a game directed towards very particular group of gamers and the team (consisting of only afew people) have put a great load of effort into it. If you ever see this game on a good sale i recomend picking it up and trying it for a few hours.","November 8, 2014","true","199.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Euro Truck Simulator 2 just doesn't care and just became a really good game. If you like driving around, micromanaging your employees, or just like to mess around in simulators it is possible to do so in this.\n\nAt first I was skeptic and I bought it on impulse but at the point of writing this I have played more than 50 hours driving around Europe, every country really is a unique experience with a lot of details added to the side of the roads making you feel like you're really there. I thought it wasn't true untill I hit some areas I've been too in my past although sometimes the road was a lot shorter than in real life, it still really felt like I was there, looking around from my truck, in the mountains, over the bridges and through the forests, the view takes your breath away. If you just like traveling, this game really gives a good experience of traveling with a truck.\n\nI really have to mention the roads, they are different everywhere, whereas in the UK you'll find a lot of roundabouts and you drive left, when you cross the pond by ship or train, you get on roads that are really specific to the countries, in the Netherlands for example you have these roads with orange browny sides that are meant for bicycle riders, in Poland you get roads that are a bit broken left and right, they are a straight contrast. Not to forget the different gasstations on the sides of the road, the tollhouses for tollroads, the bordercrossings, they all have a lot of variaty, the cities difer a lot.\n\nThe truck handling really feels, when you drive without a trailer it feels like you're weightless, you pull up so fast and you corner so nicely, put a trailer behind it and it is the opposite. Depending on the weight of the trailer, it can be really heavy, trying to get up to speed can be a drag with those weights and trying to race the corners can be a large accident, you really feel like you're heavy when you have a trailer behind you. The things you can transport also make a difference a whole lot of difference, sometimes you transport bottom heavy diggers of 25 tons and you just feel you got a lot of grip in the corners, but then the next time it is sand which is heavier in the center of height, and you go through a corner at a medium pace and you start tipping, you just know right there that the next corner you can't go as fast anymore. The difference between two trucks is also noticable, every truck is different some have a lot of horse power and torque, whereas others have barely any and need to really pull their strength to get up a hill. If you go to a garage to repair your truck you can also upgrade it and customize it, making it even better than before.\n\nThe games controls are also good, though lacking controller support, it has support for steeringwheels and joysticks. It for example does support the sticks on my controller but it does not support any of the buttons, though this can be solved with things like xpadder, it would still add a lot to the game if it had native support.\n\nI would definitely recommend it if you enjoy trucking it really has the full experience.","December 24, 2013","true","178.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

The first time i played it, i didn't understand it. After playing it some more, i realised that it is one of the most engaging games i have played. For me, driving in a truck for countless minutes on end was quite boring but the deeper you go, the more there is to it. Leveling up and earning cash became more and more rewarding. As you begin to build up a fleet of trucks and drivers, the game becomes more exciting and engaging. Building a company and driving long distances is really what this game is about. If you enjoy the game you will probably try to install mods, addons and large maps that can sometimes even be a whole country. They have also added a radio in the game that can give you actual live music from real stations around the world! Its a sensible game with a user-friendly interface that anyone withought any previous trucking knowledge can play around with.\n\nNow to the negatives... The AI is just unbearable, having to bear with stupid drivers is a huge let down and ruins the realism the game tries so hard to deliver. [This will probably be updated in the near future so dont worry too much] Cargo choices are quite broad but the game somehow chooses to give you the same load frequently. One of the largest flaws of the game is head turning, i say this because everytime you look right or left at a turn. As a result you won't be able to achieve proper speed of decision-making. Although there are many more flaws, they are mostly tiny and you usually wont realize them.\n\nI guess what i am trying to say is that it has great potential as a game directed towards very particular group of gamers and the team (consisting of only afew people) have put a great load of effort into it. If you ever see this game on a good sale i recomend picking it up and trying it for a few hours.","November 8, 2014","true","199.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Euro Truck Simulator 2 just doesn't care and just became a really good game. If you like driving around, micromanaging your employees, or just like to mess around in simulators it is possible to do so in this.\n\nAt first I was skeptic and I bought it on impulse but at the point of writing this I have played more than 50 hours driving around Europe, every country really is a unique experience with a lot of details added to the side of the roads making you feel like you're really there. I thought it wasn't true untill I hit some areas I've been too in my past although sometimes the road was a lot shorter than in real life, it still really felt like I was there, looking around from my truck, in the mountains, over the bridges and through the forests, the view takes your breath away.

Chillin' in your methlab office, countin' your daily income. Your people downstairs are cookin'. Your boy Jaykwon standin' by the door with a shotgun. Nothin' happens.\n\nBut then, the hell breaks loose.\n\n"LAPD, FREEZE MOTHAFUKKAS!" Shieee, man muthafukkin 5-0 stormin your joint. Your guys grab their pieces and start firing at the police. Gunshots all over the place. First few cops get shot but unfortunately your guys are goin' down cuz shieee, they ain't nuthin' more than a bunch of niqqaz, nahmean?  *BAM BAM*  a cop breaches your door and gets inside aiming at you but your boy Jaykwon caps his ♥♥♥ and wounds a guy who followed him. Wounded cop drops his MP5 but draws his sidearm and guns your boy Jaykwon down. You pull your .44 from the drawer and commit 187 on that fukker. ♥♥♥♥♥ is goin' down so you use the zipline and roll down to the hidden garage where you hid your dirtbike and make a run for it.  *KABLAM*  the charges that you planted for this exact situation go off, blasting all the pigs inside. You reach your emergency plane and fly to Argentina where you live, disguised as a TV repairman until one day you get shot by your own son whom you abandoned 30 years ago.\n\nNow, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is nothing like that.\n\nBasically this is a driving RPG. You start as a low grade G with no truck, no rep, no woman, no money, no nuthin' and then you drive. And you drive long and hard until you get money. Then you invest that money. And, if you're lucky, one day instead of working for the money, money will work for you. (Well, you could get a loan from the bank but not only the jewish bankers will penetrate your goy butt but it's also more fun to earn the money yourself).\n\nNow I know what you guys are sayin "Niqqa, how is that fun? U high?" Well for some reason it is fun. Routes look pretty nice and kinda believeable, graphics are aight, trucks and their cockpits look good, you can install mods if you wish, you can listen to actual radio stations from all across the Europe n ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI said that it's an RPG because, except of fines, there is no punishment for not following the rules, speeding, ignoring the red lights and ♥♥♥♥♥. You can't really interact with the drivers you hire, business management is rather simplistic (I hire only blonde girls without even looking at their stats and i'm doing just fine), and the only place where you can see your empire grow are the charts. But the point of the game lays in the role playing. Using your blinkers, watching your speed, minding the trailer while taking narrow turns, taking satisfaction from buying new trucks, hiring new drivers and watching them making money for you. I would hardly call this a "simulator" but it does a splendid job being an RPG.\n\nThere are some downsides too like:\n- The cities look aight but they are very small with just some landmarks visible in the distance.\n- There are no roadside ladies of the night in a game about  driving trucks  (which is especially unrealistic for eastern Europe).\n- Streets in the cities look empty in general.\n- Even if you choose to be a black character at the start, your in-game model is a white dude. Racist.\n- You can't get off your truck to beat the ♥♥♥♥♥ out of AI drivers and I would really, really love that feature.\n- Some regions, in my opinion, are not as well made as other.\n\nI would reccommend using a steering wheel or a pad, but the game plays surprisingly well with mouse + keyboard. I would also strongly reccomend getting the "Going East" DLC  which in my opinion should be free but watchu gonna do? Money talks I guess.\n\nOverall, it's an alright game, definitely worth trying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE FUKK YOU LOOKIN AT, HOMEBOY?

More so because I was actually there numerous times throughout the numerous years, and in many areas. It was nostalgic when I was able to venture around the Slovakia area (Bratislava) to see SCS adding in all the cool detailing both in the scenery & the trucks themselves. Lots of fun to be had in this game, even if it is a trucking sim. Quite neat how you choose jobs by borrowing other company's trucks to then get your own, customize them, and expend your trucking Empire by both yourself & varying skilled drivers for hire. It's even sweet when you can listen to the radio from Europe as you truck around.\n\nThere's lots of details, more being added with each coming upate.\n\nPros:\n- Scenery details: It's simply overly beautiful. Cities are well crafted, just out of your reach. You can visit & admire the view, just that everything is treated like a 'back-drop'. Lots of detail & attention was put into everything.\n- trucking experience: It's amazing when you're trucking while being able to haul goods. The feeling of having to be cautious, signaling, not hitting the curb, and having to turn on thel lights. Lots to pay attention to & get into habit-mode. Even being able to customize & such.\n- Truck detail: Cabin shaking on bumps, the GPS, the horn, the way they sound, run, and operate. It's all interesting. Even the ability to buy & customize them.\nAi reactions (blinkers): Previously cars & vehicles did not react to your signaling & presence. Thanks to one update they now do, and even honk when they see you as a pest. They give way when you signal, and they're aware of your presence.\nNeeding to stop at red lights: It's sweet how you have to stay at a red light. It get penalized when you don't, and you also are forced to kick that Grand Theft Auto habit of running lines to stay professional. Stay within the speed limit or get fined....There's speed traps.\nRepair:: Even though there's no real damage, you do however have to repair from normal or AI stupidity. You have ot keep repairing from normal wear & tear, or else risk stalling & crippled on the side of the road needing to call a taxi.\nPhotography: Love the whole photography bit of taking & saving images. It makes the game more fun with the fun side-things you're able to do. I was able to spam my gallery with them from my journies around Europe.\nConstant updates: The game is always updating, and something that keeps me drawn to the game. The more it updates the more willing I"m willign to stay to see what's new. I love seeing new "small" features being actual "big" ones to enjoy. It added the whole "AI interaction" when you blinker.\n- There's even more that I just want to list. That awesome feeling of exploring, seeing you & your drivers level, while also seeing the constant updates. Even the nice little features of monuments, war museums, planes flying, ships sailing, and guys cycling. Nice trains even coming & going at random.\n\nCons:\n- Repair Bill: You're always penalized when the AI is at fault. Always finding myself cursing when I dent or get cut-off by these AI "greedy" drivers. They do react to you, just ignore everything else.\n- Back-drop Cities: It's a real shame that the cities in ETS2 behave simply like a place to go with landmarks being cut-off. Take Bratislava for example with how you can't go on the "UFO Bridge" (Novy Most), or with how Frankfurt & Paris both push you away from such. [Fixed in ATS, or so mentioned by devs].\n- Invisible & 'lazy' Drivers: It's a real shame you can't see your own hired drivers with their own customized vehicles. Even if it's simulated, then pops up briefly for you to see. It bothered me how your hired drivers didn't bother to go trucking to a neighboring town or city to try and get a job back. This was a forced "low economic" feature that irritated me the most. They're intelligent & capable of improvising their way back since I was able to do the same.\n- No Multiplayer: No official, though there is a nice 2nd party type. It's awesome when you finally do managed to play on there. ATS needs to make note of this to also find its way into ETS2.\n\nEven so, this game is awesome. I love it, and still would play it with how much fun it is simply driving out accomplishing tasks. That feeling of detail alone is what is wanting me to come back in. European made games are so rewarding and so much fun. They know where the fun is at.","October 18, 2015","true","51.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game isn't complicated in the slightest which enables you to pick up and play straight away without worrying about minor attention to detail that in other simulators you may have to adhere to.  This game provides a realistic experience but retains the fun which is a major factor for its success.\n\nThe presentation is simple but slick with a well organised menu and beauitiful visuals.  The trucks look fantastic as do the other vehicles and weather effects.  The world map covers Great Britain and a large part of Europe on a watered-down scale which is a truly excellent accomplishment considering how big this game is regardless of being scaled down. You can go from Edinburgh to Warsaw in under an hour but this helps keep the gamer interested and allows you to complete several jobs in a single session.\n\nThe career mode sees you starting off a truck business from scratch where you are presented with a rundown shack as a base. You need to raise money to buy your own truck to further your bank balance or you can just grab a loan to kickstart your venture off with that extra bit of captial.  You can improve your base, customise and improve your truck, buy new vehicles from numerous real-life manufacturers and hire staff to enhance your growing company. You can rank XP to unlock extra items from new engines to even extra mirrors and minor truck accessories.  You also have a skill tree to unlock more lucrative jobs and longer distance trips.\n\nThe driving side is absolutely fantastic from manual to auto controls, filling up petrol, taking a rest, speeding fines and crashes. Everything is there that you'd expect. You can even be penalised for a late delivery. All these factors add to the challenge and ensures that you don't take crafty shortcuts in trying to complete your job.  The sleeping and fuelling element also adds some tactical spice to the game so you have to plan some jouneys beforehand else you may have an accident or breakdown which can lead to penalties such as fines or unnecessary expenditure.\n\nOverall this game is a perfectly balanced sim that isn't overly serious but is executed superbly so it appeals to all gamers who enjoy driving experiences. The excellent presentation and learning curve makes this instantly playable with a well-designed career mode and brilliant driving physics.  Definitely the best simlator out there and highly recommended.","December 12, 2013","true","77.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game is basically where you can drive around Europe in a tricked out truck that you can customize. After doing lots of jobs in the jobs market, or just getting a loan in the bank, you can expand by purchasing larger garages and using them to hire drivers who will work for you! The graphics are amazing in the game, as well as the scenery in some of the cities and routes. Downsides? The AI are really dumb as they tend to slow down on turns and speed off all of a sudden, which could potentially cause a collision. Second of all, the physics S-U-C-K!

I'd love to drive a truck. I don't even own a driver's license. So I can't drive a truck. Or a car. I'm not allowed to. Unless, of course, it's a pixeled truck.\n\nGuess what, ETS2 has pixeled trucks! Lucky me!\n\nDespite not having played ETS2, considering my gametime, I realised this game deserves a (extremely) positive review.\n\nIt's just not possible to not like driving a truck around ETS2's roads, honking at lazy drivers, getting some speeding fines and even the occasional bump. From driving over the edge, while trying to deliver your cargo in time, to having to park the truck to get that extra XP, ETS2 has it all. You can even set your own playlist for the radio, with your own songs! Hell, I can't listen to some musics now without linking them to the game straight away.\n\nThe truck design is incredibly good, and it's actually a thrill to drive (and mess around) in 1st person mode. Every truck is a different truck. From the noise they make to their acceleration, and it's easy to tell.\n\nIt's a relaxing game, which I'll end up spending hours on. You'll even say: "Hell, just one more delivery.", and when you noticed, you've done 10 more, and "wasted" a day.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone that just wants to have a good time.\n\nPS. I don't recommend going max speed on a curve. Really.","March 18, 2015","true","37.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This is actually a really, really solid experience.\nOn the one hand you've got a driving simulator, shipping stuff all across Europe on the big road listening to the radio or what have you, which is all well and good on it's own, but the game also has a tycoon bit in it, where you buy garages, hire drivers and equip them with trucks to drive.\n\nLeveling up is fast enough that it doesn't feel like too much of a chore to get bigger and better, but slow enough to give the game a good lifetime. Couple that with the tycoon aspect and you've got a long game in front of you, potentially endless if you really like cruising the French countryside on the way to England to drop off a shipment of forklifts while managing a hundred drivers across the continent.\n\nThe physics are very solid and well-rounded, there's a lot of difference between driving with no trailer, driving with a few tons of corrosive acid or driving with sawdust panels. Try not to go too fast around corners with too much weight, you'll regret it. Turned into a highway into mainland France like 15 minutes away from my drop-off point and I had to call for assistance because I ended up on the side.\n\nIf you're skeptical, give the demo a try. If you find that you like it, I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing it and getting to work on your truck empire.","December 1, 2013","true","57.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In Euro Truck Simulator 2, you are not a hero. You do not posess superpowers and neither will you make much of an impact on the world around you. All you are is a guy (or gal if you're into that). Norman Nomal, John Doe, Mister Smith. You have a full-time job and plenty of bills to pay, yet you long for a little bit of luxury. But, this is real life and there are no quests, no bosses to slay for loot, no hidden treasure to unearth - there is only good and honest work.\n\nYou are a truck driver, nothing more. Plus, you're only at the start of your carreer, no money, no truck. To change this, you can either sign up as a driver for other companies and earn a little cash, or skip that bother alltogether and take a loan to kickstart your own small enterprise. With your very own, somewhat customisable truck (visually and performance-wise) you can start raking in some real cash by transporting various goods all across Central Europe. From the meadows of Paris to Warsaw, from Edinburgh to Vienna, you can drive whereever your assignments will take you, all without loading-screens. The roads and landscapes are inspired by reality, though significantly scaled down and simplified. A drive from the most northern part of the map all the way down south would take you anywhere between 40 minutes and an hour.\nIn addition to making all the hauls yourself, you can hire more drivers to work for you, if you can supply them with vehicles. They will then automatically do their routes and get you a nice, daily income. Spend the money you make on upgrades for your truck, your garage or on more drivers. There is even a rudimentary skill-system that will allow you to unlock additional missions, like long-range hauls or high-value freight.\n\nThe graphics are actually quite pretty, especially when considering what you usually get with one of these simulator-types. Complexity is where ETS2 suffers, the missions are always the same (transport cargo X from A to B), other than upgrading your truck there really isn't anything to spend your money on and the whole freight-business aspect is very shallow.

None of that is possible and at the end of the day, it will always be you doing all the work - drive, sleep, fill up gas, rinse and repeat. Expanding on the business-sim elements might have let ETS2 truly stand out.\nAll that aside, though, you might find ETS2 strangely mesmerising and highly addictive, quite similarly to what Papers, Please did to me - a queer feeling that made me actually enjoy playing a game simulating work.","May 28, 2014","true","20.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Relaxing and enjoyable to play. Beautiful graphics and extremely well detailed trucks and physics. Although it's a simulator, it's very easy to pick and play. It controls very well on keyboard but if you can play with a wheel, do it!\n\nI recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a good driving game; or just a good game in general. If you had a tough day simply start up the engine in your truck and drive around the beautiful roads of Europe and relax. And if you get bored, just smash into the traffic. lol You can always load a save later at any time.\n\nTons of options to costumize your truck and make it unique are avaiable and SCS (the developers) are always adding new content to keep the game fresh and also fixing any problems they might find.\n\nThe money you spend on this game will be worth every cent. This is a must have.!\n\n10/10\n\n\n\nP.S: There is a multiplayer mod, by the way! Get it for free and show your amazing truck and driving skills to literally thousands of other players. Make friends on the road and drive in convoys around Europe, if you wish! The fun is doubled in multiplayer but also is the stakes. After all, you won't be driving with the AI, anymore. You'll be driving with real people, each with their own mind, ideas and driving skills. Almost like in real life!

I was a hop, skip and a slide away from the Lord Regent's chamber when this seriously compelling lorry sim sped into my life. Suddenly, stealthy vengeance seems far less important than ensuring a load of new JCBs gets to Bratislava on time.\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is that rare thing, a strong sim tethered to a strong game. Where other vehicle-obsessed devs seem to take player motivation for granted, Czech studio SCS understand that a pleasingly modelled steed needs a pleasingly modelled environment to shine.\n\nOn this occasion that environment is a swathe of Europe stretching from Plymouth in the west to Wroclaw in the east, from Aberdeen in the north to Milan in the South. The tangle of motorways and major roads is stylised and condensed, but feels massive. After a splendid week of non-stop trucking the stats screen tells me I've still only seen 50% of it.\n\nThere's satisfaction in exploring new routes, seeing new golden been-there-done-that squiggles appearing on the in-game map, but it tends to be the promise of cold, hard cash that gets you out of bed in the morning. Like Farming Simulator, ETS2 has a simple yet resonant economic sandbox at its centre.\n\nThe only time when the game itself loses concentration is when attempting to evoke certain regions and sounds. The further you get from central Europe the less convincing the landscapes become. No one seems to have told SCS's countryside crafters that rural Britain features long green things called hedges. Cities are often depicted with the shortest of visual shorthand – a few warehouses, the odd landmark if you're lucky. Don't expect to see a favourite local roundabout, slip-road, or speed camera in this highly-recommended HGV-driver RPG.","February 7, 2015","true","10.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's really noob friendly in terms of UI, gearing and even driving. Haven't seen any bugs of any kind yet, although through research, apparently they're out there somewhere and there's mods available which fixes them, just be careful as some mods are impossible to remove without losing your save files. Gameplay is very addictive and staying within the lanes while using just a keyboard is much easier than 18WoS was, though ppl recommend a joystick or wheel to play as apparently it's even better than keyboard. The career path is far better than 18WoS was, although it's pretty much the same, it's much more polished (like Porsches and their stubborness to keep their engines at the back but eventually made it work properly). I like the level up system where you can improve on skills and abilities to haul different / more valuable cargos and also improve on fuel efficiency.\n\nCons: AI traffic are both intelligent and stupid at the same time: they sometimes behave like typical bad drivers do (they cut you off and then slow down faster than you can brake, stuff like that), but they also do really dumb things like drive right into you or put you in a situation where you have no choice but to cause an accident which will happen a lot if you're not careful enough and experienced. Realistic lights mod is almost a necessity to have because otherwise you can't really see AI in the mirrors and you can't see oncoming traffic until they're close (might of been fixed by now, I'm stuck with the mod though so I don't know). GPS is not that great, though definitely needed (slightly improved with v1.11), but that's for the most part realistic since most GPS's are terrible. The infractions are very strict with no leniency at all and you WILL get a lot of them no matter how much you try to obey the rules of the road. Truck dealerships start off as hidden in the cities until you discover them which is difficult to do since you don't start off with your own truck to explore with, so you kind of need to become a rebel and use the employer's truck to explore with and hope to still be able to deliver the cargo in time. Analog controllers are definitely not something I'd recommend ppl to use for this game... way too twitchy and unpredictable. While taking damage can affect the truck, it takes a lot of crashes in order for it to need those repairs, also, no matter what condition the trucks are in, no damage is ever seen on the trucks, that also includes AI cars. The world feels really flat (even though it isn't), there really isn't any major hills other than in the quarry.\n\nEven though I listed way more Cons than Pros, I very much highly recommend this game if you're a fan of simulation games or driving games of almost any kind as it really is a fantastic game in many ways. It's far better than 18WoS and any other trucking game I've played. It's a game I keep coming back to.\n\nEDIT: With the 1.9 update which apparently improves the AI system... well, it doesn't improve the AI system, it only made them worse. Still doesn't stop me from playing and enjoying the game though, just keeps me more on my toes when around them.\nRE-EDIT: Some cons removed with 1.11 update. AI is still very stupid (but not bad for AI limitations)","December 4, 2013","true","86.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You may be researching this game to find out what could possibly make driving trucks so fun. As with the Egyptian pyramids, this seemingly pointless game is a phenomenon in and of itself.\n\nLike the individual stones of a pyramid, driving trucks is nothing special. It is when you stack the stones, when you combine driving Scanias with driving Volvos that you get a phenomenon known as Euro Truck Simulator 2.\n\nTLDR; ETS2 is comparable to an Egyptian pyramid.

Euro Truck Simulator 2 is basically an upgraded version of Euro Truck Simulator. As more game updates were released, all the trucks have real names. My favourite truck is the Volvo FH16, which comes with analog and digital km/h or mp/h display. The game features a huge Europe map. Some countries, like Spain and Portugal are currently not available in the game. I hope it will be included later as a DLC. The trucks are looking really nice. You are able to customize it with many features. For example I can set a Cabin adjustment to the truck. Music can be added manually, and online radio stations can be added as well, which requires live internet connection. GPS is a very helpful gauge in the game. It always shows the speed limit on the road you are travelling. So if you are a trucking fan, I definitely recommend the game. Can't wait from SCS Software to release American Truck Simulator. It will be a must have game for me. :)","June 13, 2015","true","57.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

I would also recomend getting exspansion packs too.\n\nMy gameplay hours are not correct as I got this game hours after it was released, then more recently switched to steam.\n\nIt is one of those games in a funny sort of way, is real addictive. MODS make this game awesome.\n\nHere Is Some Of My Reasons To Recomend The Game    The Open World Map - is vast so there are always new places to go that you have not yet driven\nYou Can Take Your Time - with a long distance load and park up and save your game, and do a little bit everyday or you can just drive hard.\nA Rare Thing - the developers have listened to the community and while they can't do everything, on the whole they have designed the game towards what the players want and in my opinion that is a huge plus when you consider Ubisoft who ignores everybody\nThe Modding Community - the game was designed with the modders in mind, I use promods map and drive around in an old Mercedes or new Volvo.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kubajam/recommended/227300/","kubajam","[PM] KubaJAM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kubajam/","52 products in account","Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a genuinely surprising game.\n\nIf you want to just get to the hard facts of the review, scroll down a bit.\n\nAfter playing the demo of the original Euro Truck Simulator over a year ago now, I was very satisfied with what I saw. However, I later went on to try the demo of ETS 2, and have never looked back since. Don't be fooled by my mere 48 hours (at the time of writing) game time; I owned the game for ages before buying it with the DLC through Steam on discount. When I first started playing, the game was v1.2.5.1, which had the attraction of a newly aqcuired DAF license. You have to bear in mind that SCS used to be (and still sort of is) a tiny company, which didn't have the most outrageous budget to create a game.\n\nThat is why Euro Truck Simulator 2 is even more remarkable; from producing a mediocre game (harsh but true in terms of graphics, physics and sounds) in ETS 1, SCS has worked its proverbials off to deliver a game that has been improved and added to in literally every aspect. Since its 'birth' 18 months ago, ETS 2 has grown a gigantic amount. When it was released, there was only a license for MAN, Renault and Scania trucks. After the DAF license of 1.2.5, 1.3.1 saw the aquisition of IVECO and Volvo licenses, 1.4.1 saw the introduction of the IVECO Stralis Hi-Way, 1.7 saw a new Volvo implemented, likewise 1.8 a new Scania. 1.9 completely re-wrote the AI. ETS 2 has grown a huge amount, adding detail updates like fuel economy, adaptive automatic transmission, the list goes on.\n\nAmazingly, all these crucial updates have come in just over a year after release, meaning they happen quite regularly, more than can be said for most games. Like Mendeleev's Periodic Table, SCS knew that gaps would be left by them when they made the game, so they also made the game easily moddable. Thousands of mods have been distributed on great sites, like the one second from top after you type 'ETS 2' into google, so players can easily choose what they want to make their game suited to them. I currently run around 40 mods, from everything such as real logos for AI cars to more realistic weather.\n\nSo what's it like to actually get behind the wheel?\nGameplay:\n- There's no denying that the concept of ETS 2 is boring to an awful lot of people; You find a job, drive to it on your satnav, pick up a trailer of some yoghurt or organic logs, drive a thousand miles, park up awkwardly and recieve a seemingly small paycheck for your hard work. However, by following the "If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen" proverb, if you don't like truck driving, don't buy a truck driving game!\n- However, you don't neccesarily have to enjoy truck driving or be an ex-trucker to like this game, although a lot of players are. ETS 2 has been designed with at least some thought of enjoyment to players; with many customisation options for your truck, trucks to buy, sights to see etcetera. Generally though, you can't avoid the sole purpose of the game for too long, as you will get bored of the customisation very quickly and some customisation mods will crash your game. However, some are genuinely a nice touch. Also, you do sort of have to drive to see the sights anyway.\n- ETS 2 offers a large map area to explore, the default stretching from Aberdeen in Scotland down to Vienna (Wien) in Austria. You can buy the Eastern Expansion DLC, which I highly recommend, letting you explore a whole lot more of Poland and Hungary/ Czech Republic (In my opinion, they could have expanded the latters slighly more for the £9.99 price tag). I also run a well-known map mod which I don't care to name but let's it works with the "quality not quantity" idea ;)\n- The timing in ETS 2 allows day/ night cycles to pass quickly; a minute in game is about 3 real life seconds. This means you don't actually have to drive a thousand miles, as the scale is shortened too; a mile takes just a couple of seconds to cover at full pelt. (90km/h or 55mph)\n- The detail in ETS 2, such as fuel consupmtion, fuel tank, headlights, indicators, hazard warning lights, and the like, really adds to the realism.\n\nTrucks:\n- Truck physics are 1 billion times better than the first game and actually feel right, although I've never driven one in real life\n- Huge variety to choose from when you take mods into account. Most people who play (40%) tend to drive a Scania mostly but I'm a Volvo guy myself. Engine choices aplenty.\n- Truck engine sounds are to my taste but some say they are too quiet or wrong. Again, mods fix this.\n\nMenus and discoveries:\n- ETS 2 has a single-screen interface from where you can easily manage your trucks, garages, drivers, buy trucks online or in dealers, change you settings, configure your controller, free drive across Europe, etcetera.\n- You can get jobs in new cities by driving into them and discovering them, you can also access the city's truck dealer and recruitment agency, but you can also do this 'online'.\n\nEnvironment:\n- Graphics are very good inside the truck and of the truck exterior but lack somewhat on AI cars and distant landscapes. Generaly higher than most simulators though.\n- AI re-write as of 1.9 claims to have improved the God-awful previous AI a lot, but some areas I still think could be improved. However this could be due to my running of complicated map mods.\n- In-game trailers and companies are incredibly dull, not that many default colour schemes or loads, no oversized or heavy trailers (ignore what the game says). You will want to install trailer mods as soon as you can.\n\nEducation:\n- You learn a surprising amount about European geography as well as trucks from this game!\n\nLasting Appeal:\n- If you can get into the mindset of the owner of an enterprising truck company, the appeal is already there for you: Buying trucks, upgrading them, earning money, garages all across Europe, cities to discover, drivers to hire and fire.\n- However, if you don't think you will like driving lots of things a long way, then no, it isn't. My advice is to then buy the game on a £5-£10 deal, or $12 deal on Steam, then you can't really be disappointed.\n\nVerdict:\n- Good things\n- Big map\n- A must for truck lovers and drivers\n- Lots of things to do\n- Detail\n- Regular updates with actually useful content\n- Never known a game quite so moddable\n\n- Not-so-good things:\n- Hard to control with keyboard, reccomend at least an Xbox Controller, however not worth disreguarding if you don't      have one\n- Useless content in terms of trailers and companies without a couple of decent mods\n- Customisation of truck gets boring quickly\n- Can be repetitive in some cases\n\nOverall:\nGameplay: 8/10\nTrucks: 9/10\nMenu accessibility: 10/10\nEnvironment details: 5/10\nDriving feel: 10/10\nValue for money: 8/10\nMap: 8/10\nMods: 10/10\nHow many bugs and glitches?: 2/10\nFinal Score:\n\n8.5\n---\n10\n\n\n\nUPDATE: 26/11/14\n\nNow it's been more than two years since the release of ETS 2, and I'm still enjoying the game hugely with over 250 steam-hours of play. I have discovered the Multi-player mod, and, whether you like it or not, it definitely adds something to the game. The latest update (1.14) added the Euro 6 DAF XF to the game, and a Scandinavia DLC is imminent. I even feel I was a bit harsh about my earlier score, so I can now safely give ETS 2 a;\n\n9\n---\n10\n\ndue to the continued expansion of the game and the fact I still enjoy it!","April 15, 2014","true","583.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","4"

If you're looking for a truck simulator, a good simulator, a relaxing driving experience, or all of the above, you have to check this out!\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is the proverbial diamond in the rough simulator game landfill. Most simulators have hilarious physics or graphics, horrendous mechanics or UI, and terrible quality all around. It's an unfortunate reality that we'll have to deal with for a long time. However, as we all know, there are some simulators that manage to shine regardless of all of that. The ever-popular Train Simulator 2013/2014/2015/whatever it is now is the go-to for train simulation, and Microsoft Flight Simulator X is still the go-to for flight simulation (and it's just come out on Steam!). In that vein, Euro Truck Simulator 2 can be considered the go-to for truck simulation.\n\nETS2 throws you, a rookie and under-respected truck driver, into the midst of starting your own truck company. However, you'll have to crawl before you can micromanage. The starting part of the game will involve you taking "quick jobs" across Europe for meager amounts of cash. Truth be told, I can't do this for long at one time before I start to get tired and have to quit the game, but I suppose that's partly the point of it. Eventually, the money you earn will be put to use in purchasing your own trucks and garages and expanding your empire. Oh, and fuel. Can't forget about that fuel.\n\nThe thing is, doing these quick jobs is actually really calming. In real life, I've done light driving to begin preparing for my license exam, and it's a completely different world. Traffic everywhere, people being incredibly stupid, and having to focus really damn hard on everything is just really frustrating. In ETS2, all of that is still there (AI drivers have slammed into me on occasion - at least the game realizes that sometimes it's not my fault!), but somehow it just feels so much more calm and relaxed. It's a lot easier to handle driving in this game than in real life - and trucks are notoriously more difficult to drive than cars!\n\nThe graphics in this game are likely better than most games I have ever played. That is seriously saying something; I have rarely seen such realistic graphics. Of course, people who go crazy about graphics will point out the problems here and there, and not to mention I'm restricted to Medium due to this being a heavy load game (haha, I made a pun...), but I still think it looks absolutely gorgeous.\n\nThe sound design isn't quite up to the standard of the rest of the game. I mean, some trucks have their own distinctive sound effects, and it's pleasing to hear them, but every truck more or less sounds the same to me. This is probably something that people who know trucks would know better than me. But what's there sounds good anyway. As for music, that isn't really existent. Instead, the game has a built-in radio that allows you to select an internet radio station. My personal favorite is Euro Truck Radio, a fan-driven radio station specifically for this game.

I have been playing this game for a long time, on and 'off' steam and i cannot get enough of it. It also helps that this game has great community that is constantly developing new trucks, routes, cargo packs etc. which make sure that you don't get bored with it very easily. if you are into simulators this is a must have and is worth every penny of its asking price (i bought it on sale BTW).\n\nLike all other games it has its weak points like you not being able to see the trucks and drivers you hire like you could in 18WoS and absolutely no interaction with other trucks on the road.

This is the very game that got me into simulators (til I found out 90% of them is crap), If you are to buy any simulators get this. Its more than just driving around in a truck. Theres a whole management side to it with hiring drivers, buying garages, and buying trucks. It gets updates every once in a while, but they are always big updates, the traffic AI is the best of any game yet. On the minimap it tells you the speed limit of the road you are on which is helpful as speeding tickets are rather expensive. It is very realistic, the trucks feel like trucks and trailers affect the trucks performance based on the weight of the trailer, the road you are on and the damage of the truck itself. There is loads of mods you can get for this game and has a huge map, To get from the UK to the very opposite edge of the map will take a good 3 hours, and thats straight across. Even after a few hundred hours of playing, you'll find there are still roads you havent driven yet the map is so big. Graphically it is amazing, and is very well optimized, and the trucks are very well detailed. The trucks are mostly licenced, from the Scania R Series to the Volvo FH, with the only unlicenced truck being the Majestic Across (Mercedes Actros). There is a load of customization, plus there's new paint DLC's that really enhance the look of your truck. I really recommend Euro Truck Simulator 2 at full price, but this game isn't for everyone so take a look at the demo (its essentially the start of the full game) and if you like it, buy the full game. 9.5/10","April 2, 2014","true","43.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As my cousin would say, it's one of the greatest and most self-rewarding acts any human can undergo. Long winding roads, the ease of the motorway, getting a scratch on your first truck, the missed deadlines. Every town you visit is a new playground, a maze to navigate, corners to perfectly turn through. While it may seem a daunting and lonely career, the road and the radio will comfort you on the countless journeys through the boroughs of the countryside, the rises in terrain and the beat of the music are truly the greatest pleasures.

I have no idea how i got into this game, but this game had me hooked.\n\n(Update 11/12/2014)\nThe problem most people see in this game; is that how can it be fun driving a truck, wasting up to 5 hours a day. You seen the gameplay in youtube, twitch, steam broadcast and thinking "Huh... okay so what"... Here's what, it is not suppose to Grand Theft Auto, there is no cops(weirdly) but there is system that keeps your driving speed and manners in check. It's not about ramming or running over an AI with your truck.\n\nThis game is your getaway game if you're seriously sick of gun-shooting, exploding bodies, plane-jihading while trying to waste a good amount of time. To be honest, this is a very good way to relax yourself after rage-quitting ARMA 3/COD-whatever-warfare.\n\nDon't believe me? Try it, hook it up with a 'console' controller(at least, please!) and play up till at one point you are able to afford a garage, by then think back was it worth the money you spend. If you're still not satisfied then....\n\nMods for this game are plenty but be aware that there are ALOT of outdated mods, with every new patch from SCS may broke some mods. Promods and realistic driving(by KacakTV) is a best way to start your journey. If you have found nirvana, and peace with this game, may i suggest you to "ETS2MP.\n\nPlay with REAL players, some purposely trying to crash onto you every corner you turn. A fine challenge to keep yourself calm and be forgiving. Get connected, join in on a convoy or organise a convoy from ETS2MP forums, have a friendly chat at the "Official" ETS2MP teamspeak. A fair Warning though, read the teamspeak rules thoroughly and some particular admins are very power-abusive. Another fine way to learn to keep yourself calm and cool while admin repeatedly bans you for some reasons you may never understand.\n\nMost DLCs in this game are aesthetic for Trucks, while others unlocks countries/areas for your driving pleasure. All DLCs are cheap to aquire, even cheaper while they're on sales. If you're sick of driving European trucks, There are plently american truck mods for ets2, however SCS will release an American Truck Sim sooner or later.","July 27, 2014","true","712.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiftedReality/recommended/227300/","ShiftedReality","Donald Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiftedReality/","136 products in account","This is without a doubt the best simulator out there. The world is HUGE. And when I say HUGE, I mean HUUUUUGE. It takes HOURS to get from one side of the map to the other side.\n"Well, in that case, the graphics will be bad!" is what you might think. To be honest, this is one of the most beatiful games I've ever seen. The attention to detail is incredibly high. The scenery is really well detailed and there will always be something to look at. The sun shining through the trees, the incredible reflections in the water, the beatiful cities, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhat I would really reccomend you to buy too is the Going East! DLC. It might be €9,99, but I've never been so surprised about a DLC pack. It expands the map a lot, with completely new cities, towns and even more beatiful scenery! After having played about 45 hours at the time of posting this, I've only explored around 40% of the map. There's so much more for me to see, even after playing for 45 hours!\n\nAnother cool thing about this game is that you start out as a 1-person company. Later on, you will have the option to expand your company to unknown limits! You'll have multiple garages around Europe. In these garages, you will have countless trucks being driven by AI companions you can hire. That means this game isn't only about driving your truck, but also about expanding your empire! This gives the game an even deeper layer which means even more fun!\n\nThe driving mechanics also surprised me. I've never seen driving mechanics like this before and they are really, really pleasant! The mechanics make really small movements in the steering wheel possible, even while using a keyboard. I myself stopped using a keyboard because I had a steering wheel laying around. The steering wheel made my experience even more pleasant.\n\nAlso, the AI cars and trucks in the game are terrific. They really take not in what you are doing. It feels like they are predicting what you are going to do. Sometimes they do screw up by not letting you go first when you have the right to, but this is no big issue to me. This rarely happens.\n\nAnother great aspect is the modding community. There are countless amounts of mods, of which my favorite one is the Multiplayer Mod. Yes, that's right. There is a multiplayer mod for this game. Another massive pro! Other mods include map expentions. There is a Scandinavian Map, which is also huge. This mod is available for download for free. This means there will be even more to explore! An extra plus, modding is as easy as trowing some files into the Mod folder.\n\nIn my experience, this is BY FAR the best simulation game I have ever played. You should definetly try it.\n\nThe score I am giving: 10/10\nI guess you could say this score is for clear reasons!","July 22, 2014","true","66.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oneofmanyjacks/recommended/227300/","oneofmanyjacks","Oneofmanyjacks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oneofmanyjacks/","105 products in account","Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a diamond in the rough of low budget simulator games. The aim of the game is to grow your haulage empire by purchasing trucks and depots around Europe in order to increase your company's profits.\n\nThe struggle to progress past your first one or two trucks may possibly put you off. It might just be my inability to follow speed limits and stop at traffic lights, incurring me loads of tickets, but to finally get past this stage took me over 15 hours; factoring in paying off loans that I had to take out to get to this stage, it would take even longer. If you're looking to spend a lot of time playing ETS2, I understand that the going gets much easier once you get over the initial progression curve.\n\nThe modding community has helped the longevity of the game by adding new trucks and customisation options along with new map content and a multiplayer mode. I'd recommend downloading these as the base game can get somewhat repetetive after a while, but given that ETS2 (despite having an in-game menu that lets you select from currently installed mods) does not currently have steam workshop support, finding which mods to download can be a bit daunting for first timers. I'd be wary of certain websites that bundle in malware with your downloads.\n\nIn terms of performance, the game runs well at highest settings on my system. Anything less would be unacceptable; the game could be considered a looker compared to other simulator games but is no Crysis 3 when it comes to pushing PC performance.\n\n- Worth anyone's money but wait until it's on sale which usually cuts it down to less than a fiver.","December 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I honestly don't know. I can't figure out why this game is so entertaining, but it is. Maybe it's the empire building aspect, combined with exploration, and trucks. Regardless, even though I am not able to pin-point why this game is hours of entertainment, it is a lot of fun. I was surprised when I kept loading it up to play more.\n\nThat said, there are a few quirks to the game that bug me, but they are all minor enough as to not really take away from the overall enjoyment factor. AI traffic is mind bogglingly stupid, but that's just realism. The interaction between the clip planes and the working components of the truck don't always want to work together. That is to say, the trucks are rigid, and don't allow for the tires to drop to meet the contours of the ground, which gives you a high centered effect, but it's rare.\n\nI don't have a whole lot more to add, but if you're into sims, give it a try.","May 24, 2014","true","66.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not because it delivers something utterly astonishing. Not because it delivers a big name brand from a big name developer with big pockets and licenses. This grabs people because of it's pure simplistic gameplay.\n\nTo begin, you start off on your day driving. You work for employers for a set price, and one delivery only.  The game starts off slow but eases you into the game mechanics and internal workings. As you begin working for employers, and obviously wanting to start your own business, you can sit back and let the employer take care of fuel, toll roads, and of course, lorry damages.\n\nAs you begin to grow in the game and earn some money, you have the option of purchasing your own lorry and begining your own business ventures. You start off with a small shack-like garage and from there you must build your own logistics empire!\n\nA lot of the lorries are locked out as you will find out, and so are some of the items for customising your rig. These become unlocked with "levelling" up. Consider it on the same track as, the more you drive, the more you understand how your vehicle and the road behave. So you can spot an issue beforehand. Once "levelled" up, more options become available. Such as bull bars, light rails, spotlights, beacons, wheels, axles, and paints.\n\nAs well as driving for your own company, you have the basic management of drivers, such as hiring a driver, choosing what, if any, type of "levelling up", they should do to aquire newer licenses and new skills in driving. Along with this you can also assign them to any garage you own (more can be purchased throughout the game), and assign a lorry for each driver to drive. Of course you must pay the bills too.\n\nFor a main point of note is the handling of the vehicles. Each lorry handles amazingly well under the Logitech G series wheels and Driving Force wheels. It is constantly being refined, with FFB as an example. you can feel the power steering on the rig when you switch the engine on (note, less stiff to turn).\n\nAlong with this is a built in MP3 and internet radio player. Fully modelled cabins, weather effects, and more mods appearing everyday.\n\nOf special note: Any new trucks added by SCS come free in update patches.\n\nGraphics: 90%\nSound: 95%\nPlayability: 100%\nMultiplayer: 0% (none available)\n\nScored: 98%","January 30, 2013","true","172.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The world is HUGE. And when I say HUGE, I mean HUUUUUGE. It takes HOURS to get from one side of the map to the other side.\n"Well, in that case, the graphics will be bad!" is what you might think. To be honest, this is one of the most beatiful games I've ever seen. The attention to detail is incredibly high. The scenery is really well detailed and there will always be something to look at. The sun shining through the trees, the incredible reflections in the water, the beatiful cities, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhat I would really reccomend you to buy too is the Going East! DLC. It might be €9,99, but I've never been so surprised about a DLC pack. It expands the map a lot, with completely new cities, towns and even more beatiful scenery! After having played about 45 hours at the time of posting this, I've only explored around 40% of the map. There's so much more for me to see, even after playing for 45 hours!\n\nAnother cool thing about this game is that you start out as a 1-person company. Later on, you will have the option to expand your company to unknown limits! You'll have multiple garages around Europe. In these garages, you will have countless trucks being driven by AI companions you can hire. That means this game isn't only about driving your truck, but also about expanding your empire! This gives the game an even deeper layer which means even more fun!\n\nThe driving mechanics also surprised me. I've never seen driving mechanics like this before and they are really, really pleasant! The mechanics make really small movements in the steering wheel possible, even while using a keyboard. I myself stopped using a keyboard because I had a steering wheel laying around. The steering wheel made my experience even more pleasant.\n\nAlso, the AI cars and trucks in the game are terrific. They really take not in what you are doing. It feels like they are predicting what you are going to do. Sometimes they do screw up by not letting you go first when you have the right to, but this is no big issue to me. This rarely happens.\n\nAnother great aspect is the modding community. There are countless amounts of mods, of which my favorite one is the Multiplayer Mod. Yes, that's right. There is a multiplayer mod for this game. Another massive pro! Other mods include map expentions. There is a Scandinavian Map, which is also huge. This mod is available for download for free. This means there will be even more to explore! An extra plus, modding is as easy as trowing some files into the Mod folder.\n\nIn my experience, this is BY FAR the best simulation game I have ever played. You should definetly try it.\n\nThe score I am giving: 10/10\nI guess you could say this score is for clear reasons!","July 22, 2014","true","66.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The aim of the game is to grow your haulage empire by purchasing trucks and depots around Europe in order to increase your company's profits.\n\nThe struggle to progress past your first one or two trucks may possibly put you off. It might just be my inability to follow speed limits and stop at traffic lights, incurring me loads of tickets, but to finally get past this stage took me over 15 hours; factoring in paying off loans that I had to take out to get to this stage, it would take even longer. If you're looking to spend a lot of time playing ETS2, I understand that the going gets much easier once you get over the initial progression curve.\n\nThe modding community has helped the longevity of the game by adding new trucks and customisation options along with new map content and a multiplayer mode. I'd recommend downloading these as the base game can get somewhat repetetive after a while, but given that ETS2 (despite having an in-game menu that lets you select from currently installed mods) does not currently have steam workshop support, finding which mods to download can be a bit daunting for first timers. I'd be wary of certain websites that bundle in malware with your downloads.\n\nIn terms of performance, the game runs well at highest settings on my system. Anything less would be unacceptable; the game could be considered a looker compared to other simulator games but is no Crysis 3 when it comes to pushing PC performance.\n\n- Worth anyone's money but wait until it's on sale which usually cuts it down to less than a fiver.","December 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlock better upgrades and skills for you and your team.\n\nAll of these aspects are great, but for me - and it seems for a lot of people - the best part of the game is just the experience of driving. Discovering all the roads and locations, enjoying the views, navigating the long wide turns and tight corners, pulling off that perfect braking at the red light.\n\nDriving at night in the game (and in the real world), listening to European radios online, or your own music collection, both accessible through the in-game music player.\n\nThere's something soothing and special about driving at night, in the rain, listening to oldies and talk shows on a Czech radio. To me, that's the real joy of ETS2.\n\nEven with the next game in the series announces (American Truck Simulator), the developers are still upgrading ETS2 and releasing new content. I'm looking forward to the Scandinavian DLC. It's a good sign when you look forward to a game's DLC.\n\nPS. Try with a controller / steering wheel and face tracking.

There's really quite a lot to recommend in this game, so I'll get to it.\n\nPros\n\n1. Very realistic driving simulation, from game pad and joystick support, to manual gear changes, faithful replicas of various brands of trucks, etc.\n\n2. Somehow they compress time -- a 4 hour journey can be completed in 30 minutes of real time game play. This was one of the biggest questions I had before buying this game since I didn't want to be stuck at the wheel for hours at a time. I don't know how they do it, but they compress driving time very well, so that you feel the longer deliveries but at the same time don't burn an afternoon travelling a simulated highway.\n\n3. Great graphics and physics engine -- rain, cloudy skies, wiper action, water drops on your windshield, headlights, all nicely represented.\n\n4. Some RPG elements included -- running your own trucking business, buying vehicles, hiring drivers, all add a nice touch to what was supposed to be just a sim.\n\n5. The most amazing thing to me is: the landscape and the scenery look real! I don't know how they mapped thousands of miles of roads, signs, landmarks, scenery, etc. but they did a damn fine job of it. You really feel like you're in Europe!\n\nCons\n\n1. Kind of steep learning curve, figuring out the driving controls/keys, had to keep pausing and checking the game setting options (there are a LOT of functions). I wish this part could be covered in a tutorial of some sort.\n\n2. A sandbox / practice mode would have been nice. You literally get thrown into the driver's seat from the start. But I guess some people like jumping in right away, but some like me prefer to have a decent understanding of all the controls first.\n\nAlthough I'm not as good a driver as I want to be, I'm actually having fun (minus the tickets and accident citations)!\n\nRecommended!\n\n7.5/10.0","June 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

An incredibly surprising success.\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 (aka ETS2) is THE premier truck driving simulator game available on Steam. Very few games (actually, are there even any?) rival its amazing depth. Its Czech developer SCS Games is well-known for their truck simulator games, and securing the licenses of all the trucks you see in the game is no easy feat.\n\nYou play as a trucker, delivering various loads of cargo from city to city. Journeys can be very long or very short, depending on where you start from and where you end. In addition to the whole driving aspect, you're also in charge of running a truck delivery company (it starts out with the grand employee total of 1 - yourself, but then expands as you hire more workers and buy more trucks).\n\nFor the most part, the simulations in this game are very accurate. Trucks feel like a joy to drive (acceleration when the truck is transporting a heavy load is terrible, as it should be). Your employees also take jobs lasting several hours and you are credited the money (in-game) when you are done. If you have the money (real-life) to spare, for increased realism you can use a physical steering wheel controller and TrackIR so you can realistically drive the truck and look around.\n\nAlthough there is an amazing degree of realism in the truck models and world textures, there does not seem to be as much (I stress "as much" here because there is a certain amount...just not as much) care put into the menus. Compared to the rest of the game they feel comparatively close to a mere afterthought. Consider, however, that this is but a merely minor nitpick of mine, as you won't actually be spending most of the game looking at the menus, but rather driving.\n\nA slightly more frustrating flaw detailed here is one that is very likely to spike blood pressures. As much as I want to be nice about it, because this is a game I really like, I'm going to go all out here and say: ♥♥♥♥ the AI drivers with a force of a thousand suns. They are among the most suicidal and idiotic computer AI I've had the misfortune of playing with. They refuse to give you the right of way, they refuse to stop while you're turning out (and cause some much unneeded fines/damage), they are literally douches in general. Come to think about it, isn't that a sadly accurate simulation of most drivers nowadays?\n\nThe good news is, you can disable the AI by playing on a multiplayer server. You have to download this ETS2 Multiplayer[ets2mp.com] client. Do note that you may need to downgrade your game version in order to run this - thankfully, older ETS2 game versions are preserved as "betas" in Steam for that purpose. The only downside is that you aren't allowed to auto-park your truck on these servers, and I can tell you this first-hand, parking is HARD.\n\nTime to end off with a few funny anecdotes: This is actually quite a fun game to stream gameplay of, both for the streamer and for the viewer. Especially when the streamer reads chat while driving, gets distracted and goes pinball trucking off the road rails and/or trees!\nAnother fun thing to do, if the streamer hasn't changed default controls, is to ask him to use camera mode 8. If you have this game, you'll know what it does. Then see how long he goes without crashing. HAHA!\n\nWhen to buy: Game has been bundled a few times. The most recent bundle, as far as I know, did not contain any DLC. Try to wait for the Collector's Bundle to hit a sale.\nAs far as DLC recommendations go, I'd recommend as bare minimum the High Power Cargo Pack and the Going East expansions. The Scandinavia expansion seems great too (note that I don't actually have it at this point though).\n\n8.5/10\n\n\nI originally intended to write this review as a thank you to my friend Oddllama, who graciously gifted me this game and a ton of DLC, for his website revamp...but then he shut his website down.

The aim of the game is to grow your haulage empire by purchasing trucks and depots around Europe in order to increase your company's profits.\n\nThe struggle to progress past your first one or two trucks may possibly put you off. It might just be my inability to follow speed limits and stop at traffic lights, incurring me loads of tickets, but to finally get past this stage took me over 15 hours; factoring in paying off loans that I had to take out to get to this stage, it would take even longer. If you're looking to spend a lot of time playing ETS2, I understand that the going gets much easier once you get over the initial progression curve.\n\nThe modding community has helped the longevity of the game by adding new trucks and customisation options along with new map content and a multiplayer mode. I'd recommend downloading these as the base game can get somewhat repetetive after a while, but given that ETS2 (despite having an in-game menu that lets you select from currently installed mods) does not currently have steam workshop support, finding which mods to download can be a bit daunting for first timers. I'd be wary of certain websites that bundle in malware with your downloads.\n\nIn terms of performance, the game runs well at highest settings on my system. Anything less would be unacceptable; the game could be considered a looker compared to other simulator games but is no Crysis 3 when it comes to pushing PC performance.\n\n- Worth anyone's money but wait until it's on sale which usually cuts it down to less than a fiver.","December 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Euro Truck Simulator 2.\nI dont really know how to start with this review, but all I can say is that you will want to read this if you are not so sure on buying the game. Let me put it out there, this game is one of the BEST simulation games I have played. It puts you in a EU map, with realistic city/town names. It gives you a fariety of delivering jobs to haul across Europe, or even just to the same city that you're in.\n\nThe truck is one of the most important things in the game (obviously). SCS software put in HUGE amounts of time, to record sounds, take pictures just to make sure the truck in game is as perfect as it can be. The company (scs software) is suprisingly a small (ish) company. They have only less than 40 people working in the WHOLE company, which for a developer of a massivley sucessful game, its quite good.\n\nSCS Software team keep updating the game, they keep adding DLC (extra content) which is sometimes purchasble, or just downloadable. They update maps, trucks, handling, coding... anything you can think of.\n\nThe modding in the game, is also what makes it so lovable. They make it easy for modders to put new things in the game, such as new aspects like maps or new trucks. to keep the community rolling. This promtly puts me forward into the community side. There are thousands apon thousands of people playing as realistically as they can, to stand themself out of the rest.\n\nIf you have a spair bit of cash, why not try the game out... its perfect for all types of players!\nI 100% recommend this game!","March 1, 2015","true","650.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The world is HUGE. And when I say HUGE, I mean HUUUUUGE. It takes HOURS to get from one side of the map to the other side.\n"Well, in that case, the graphics will be bad!" is what you might think. To be honest, this is one of the most beatiful games I've ever seen. The attention to detail is incredibly high. The scenery is really well detailed and there will always be something to look at. The sun shining through the trees, the incredible reflections in the water, the beatiful cities, and so on and so forth.\n\nWhat I would really reccomend you to buy too is the Going East! DLC. It might be €9,99, but I've never been so surprised about a DLC pack. It expands the map a lot, with completely new cities, towns and even more beatiful scenery!

There's so much more for me to see, even after playing for 45 hours!\n\nAnother cool thing about this game is that you start out as a 1-person company. Later on, you will have the option to expand your company to unknown limits! You'll have multiple garages around Europe. In these garages, you will have countless trucks being driven by AI companions you can hire. That means this game isn't only about driving your truck, but also about expanding your empire! This gives the game an even deeper layer which means even more fun!\n\nThe driving mechanics also surprised me. I've never seen driving mechanics like this before and they are really, really pleasant! The mechanics make really small movements in the steering wheel possible, even while using a keyboard. I myself stopped using a keyboard because I had a steering wheel laying around. The steering wheel made my experience even more pleasant.\n\nAlso, the AI cars and trucks in the game are terrific. They really take not in what you are doing. It feels like they are predicting what you are going to do. Sometimes they do screw up by not letting you go first when you have the right to, but this is no big issue to me. This rarely happens.\n\nAnother great aspect is the modding community. There are countless amounts of mods, of which my favorite one is the Multiplayer Mod. Yes, that's right. There is a multiplayer mod for this game. Another massive pro! Other mods include map expentions. There is a Scandinavian Map, which is also huge. This mod is available for download for free. This means there will be even more to explore! An extra plus, modding is as easy as trowing some files into the Mod folder.\n\nIn my experience, this is BY FAR the best simulation game I have ever played. You should definetly try it.\n\nThe score I am giving: 10/10\nI guess you could say this score is for clear reasons!","July 22, 2014","true","66.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Face it! With almost 98% thumbs up, approval rating, this game has earned it.  SCS had done a great job here with ETS2, and has even improved the platform with the slowly expanding ATS spinoff.  With over 55k Positive reviews, there isn't much new to say, eh.\n\nMMO is not directly available thru the SCS game, but can be achieved through other means, though I stick to the Single Player, and couldn't be happier with the game.  Also, some players use keyboard only to play the game (poor devils), but I can't imagine getting through it without a few accessories.  I play at a desktop with the Steering Wheel & Pedals connected, Keyboard to the left side, Mouse to the right, and XBox360 Controller right next to Steering Wheel, for all of the various functions right at your fingertips.  It was all stuff I already had from playing over the years, and it works together great.  Go to You_Tube & see actual truck console rigs that some have built with working gauges, buttons, knobs, actual turn-signal stalks with multiple controls built right in - amazing - and I'm sure Expen$ive - LOL.  Some players even have headsets that IR track so that onscreen camera movements follow where the player/driver looks - amazing stuff yes, but, all too rich for my blood.  Ahhh, to have infinite disposable income - any gamers dream come true!!!\n\nAlso, while you're driving down the highway, you'll want music to listen to, right?!  The game has a built in feature allowing you to listen to your own music right from your computer (boring), OR, ...Wait for it.... you can actually dial in live radio stations from around the globe.  What's more realistic than dropping off a delivery in England, Germany, etc., and listening to an actual station from that area, or that exact city?!\n\nI've played this for years, where I'll get into it intensely for a month or two, then lay-off and emersively play other stuff, then come right back to ETS2 over and over.  All of the continuously developing Mods you can easily plug into the game can make it a new & different experience every time you turn the key.\n\nThis game can be as Real as you want to make it.

I don't know why it is. It might be just that it is a very relaxing game as it relieves stress from me when I'm stressed. Maybe it might be that sound of the truck inside of the truck. This game is really fun but all I'm doing is driving a truck with cargo to my destination. Driving with a controller feels really nice and this entire game feels really nice. ETS2 is also moddable but I like to keep this game vanilla because I feel there isn't much wrong with it. The huge open world is really nice, too. The addition of the radio is really nice so I can listen to my own music or music from European radio stations. There is also a management system where you can manage your own company and buy cars for your garage and send drivers out on cargo delivery missions. ETS2 is also very atmosphereic. I feel like I'm actually driving the truck and I don't want to leave. The car AI could be worked on but it works fine most of the time. ETS2 feels very polished for an indie game. And with the announcement of American Truck Simulator, now is an even better reason to pick it up. I recommend playing with headphones on and while listening to some radio stations at a lowish volume. Buy this game if you're looking for a game to play to relieve stress or try out the demo because the demo actually offers quite a bit of content and can keep you busy for a couple hours. I really don't understand the concept of driving a truck being fun but hell if it isn't.","April 27, 2015","true","20.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have played these trucking games since 18 WOS first came out to market. I was hooked ever since. I would kill the sound for the game and just listen to my iTunes play. It served my in game radio. The game is so immersive, after a period of playing I would notice hours have passed by. Then I would say "one last load" and after that "eh, one more wouldn't hurt".\n\nETS 2 is a good step away from the American trucking scene for awhile, while the new simulator is in development. Learning some of the roads in the game and seeing the large maps. The DLC, the skin packs, the truck add-ons, everything that keeps me coming back for more.\n\nThe career driving is still great with some added features. I did not play the first one so I do not know if they were in there. However you can now add skills to your driver that will make your earnings rise. You can have garages to hire drivers and station them in a town/city. It just goes to show that while you are grinding away, load after load, there is still something to work for. I recommend not playing with any money mods as that may take away some of the fun of looking forward to your next purchases. Currently I have just 2 drivers but I am working very hard for more. It feels really rewarding knowing that I trucked those miles so that I could buy more trucks, more garages and grow my company. I recommend you play this game and forget about your clock because time will certainly pass you by.","December 1, 2014","true","79.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

If you want to enjoy this, then you're going to have to put in some effort. Go put on a flannel shirt and a trucker cap, and perhaps if you're male, grow out a bit of stubble. Once you're ready, and only when you're ready, you can jump in and start trucking.\n\nI don't know how to drive, so knowing the rules of the road is a bit sketchy for me, but after driving a truck I got to know the rules.

However this is also an issue with the game, although the mods are great they are pretty much all on third party sites which are designed to trick users to click on adverts or dubeous links, I wish SCS would take the reigns on this and produce a SAFE central site for all this content, it would make a much better experience for the end user.","September 11, 2014","true","633.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

An incredibly surprising success.\n\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 (aka ETS2) is THE premier truck driving simulator game available on Steam. Very few games (actually, are there even any?) rival its amazing depth. Its Czech developer SCS Games is well-known for their truck simulator games, and securing the licenses of all the trucks you see in the game is no easy feat.\n\nYou play as a trucker, delivering various loads of cargo from city to city. Journeys can be very long or very short, depending on where you start from and where you end. In addition to the whole driving aspect, you're also in charge of running a truck delivery company (it starts out with the grand employee total of 1 - yourself, but then expands as you hire more workers and buy more trucks).\n\nFor the most part, the simulations in this game are very accurate. Trucks feel like a joy to drive (acceleration when the truck is transporting a heavy load is terrible, as it should be). Your employees also take jobs lasting several hours and you are credited the money (in-game) when you are done. If you have the money (real-life) to spare, for increased realism you can use a physical steering wheel controller and TrackIR so you can realistically drive the truck and look around.\n\nAlthough there is an amazing degree of realism in the truck models and world textures, there does not seem to be as much (I stress "as much" here because there is a certain amount...just not as much) care put into the menus. Compared to the rest of the game they feel comparatively close to a mere afterthought. Consider, however, that this is but a merely minor nitpick of mine, as you won't actually be spending most of the game looking at the menus, but rather driving.\n\nA slightly more frustrating flaw detailed here is one that is very likely to spike blood pressures. As much as I want to be nice about it, because this is a game I really like, I'm going to go all out here and say: ♥♥♥♥ the AI drivers with a force of a thousand suns. They are among the most suicidal and idiotic computer AI I've had the misfortune of playing with. They refuse to give you the right of way, they refuse to stop while you're turning out (and cause some much unneeded fines/damage), they are literally douches in general. Come to think about it, isn't that a sadly accurate simulation of most drivers nowadays?\n\nThe good news is, you can disable the AI by playing on a multiplayer server. You have to download this ETS2 Multiplayer[ets2mp.com] client. Do note that you may need to downgrade your game version in order to run this - thankfully, older ETS2 game versions are preserved as "betas" in Steam for that purpose. The only downside is that you aren't allowed to auto-park your truck on these servers, and I can tell you this first-hand, parking is HARD.\n\nTime to end off with a few funny anecdotes: This is actually quite a fun game to stream gameplay of, both for the streamer and for the viewer. Especially when the streamer reads chat while driving, gets distracted and goes pinball trucking off the road rails and/or trees!\nAnother fun thing to do, if the streamer hasn't changed default controls, is to ask him to use camera mode 8. If you have this game, you'll know what it does. Then see how long he goes without crashing. HAHA!\n\nWhen to buy: Game has been bundled a few times. The most recent bundle, as far as I know, did not contain any DLC. Try to wait for the Collector's Bundle to hit a sale.\nAs far as DLC recommendations go, I'd recommend as bare minimum the High Power Cargo Pack and the Going East expansions. The Scandinavia expansion seems great too (note that I don't actually have it at this point though).\n\n8.5/10\n\n\nI originally intended to write this review as a thank you to my friend Oddllama, who graciously gifted me this game and a ton of DLC, for his website revamp...but then he shut his website down. Boooooooooooooooo! :(","March 12, 2015","true","39.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In general I probably have racked around 100 hours on this game.\n\nThis game is really interesting to me. Usually people like games similar to GTA or Need For Speed, which I do like as well, but I also like simulators, like this one. They can really teach you how a lot of the things work, and how to properly drive, check your mirrors, etc.. The tasks are pretty simple. Choose a quick job, drive from point A to B. Along the way you may run crash, run out of fuel, or you may just end up with a traffic ticket. You are able to create your own company, but you don't really have the necessary funds from the beginning of the game in order to buy a truck, a garage, or hire workers. So in all reality, you have to grind out all of the quick jobs in order to even get to that point. Time consuming, sure, but along the way it becomes a second nature to you.\n\nCustomization for trucks is great. I believe there are paint job DLCs, which I find to be really nice! Makes your truck stand out from the others and be something unique. You can change basically anything on your truck, from the engine to the transmission, and even the cosmetic stuff, like mirrors, wheels, and much more. Lots of reputable truck manufactuers are present in the game, such as Scania, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and many others. The choices are great. Trailers have a good amount of variety as well, and there are a lot of weight differences in them as well.. which is very important.\n\nI would honestly give this game a 8/10. Since it's a huge open world game, a lot of the cities look very similar. I'm sure it's necessary to due that to make it run smoothly and to keep everything working properly. I'm really excited and interested to see what else will be added to this game.. I'd also like to add that the creators of ETS2 are going to release American Truck Simulator next month (at the time this is being written) so that is also something else to keep an eye out for.","January 5","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However this is also an issue with the game, although the mods are great they are pretty much all on third party sites which are designed to trick users to click on adverts or dubeous links, I wish SCS would take the reigns on this and produce a SAFE central site for all this content, it would make a much better experience for the end user.","September 11, 2014","true","633.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Face it! With almost 98% thumbs up, approval rating, this game has earned it.  SCS had done a great job here with ETS2, and has even improved the platform with the slowly expanding ATS spinoff.  With over 55k Positive reviews, there isn't much new to say, eh.\n\nMMO is not directly available thru the SCS game, but can be achieved through other means, though I stick to the Single Player, and couldn't be happier with the game.  Also, some players use keyboard only to play the game (poor devils), but I can't imagine getting through it without a few accessories.  I play at a desktop with the Steering Wheel & Pedals connected, Keyboard to the left side, Mouse to the right, and XBox360 Controller right next to Steering Wheel, for all of the various functions right at your fingertips.  It was all stuff I already had from playing over the years, and it works together great.  Go to You_Tube & see actual truck console rigs that some have built with working gauges, buttons, knobs, actual turn-signal stalks with multiple controls built right in - amazing - and I'm sure Expen$ive - LOL.  Some players even have headsets that IR track so that onscreen camera movements follow where the player/driver looks - amazing stuff yes, but, all too rich for my blood.  Ahhh, to have infinite disposable income - any gamers dream come true!!!\n\nAlso, while you're driving down the highway, you'll want music to listen to, right?!  The game has a built in feature allowing you to listen to your own music right from your computer (boring), OR, ...Wait for it.... you can actually dial in live radio stations from around the globe.  What's more realistic than dropping off a delivery in England, Germany, etc., and listening to an actual station from that area, or that exact city?!\n\nI've played this for years, where I'll get into it intensely for a month or two, then lay-off and emersively play other stuff, then come right back to ETS2 over and over.  All of the continuously developing Mods you can easily plug into the game can make it a new & different experience every time you turn the key.\n\nThis game can be as Real as you want to make it.  Like the kid (Mikey) in the old TV commercial used to say - "Try it!  You'll like it!!"\n\nCheers","March 5","true","756.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Then I have gone for Rally, like Kimi the Iceman. Now I am a truck driver with a €100,000 bank loan. In a strange way, I am loving my new job.\n\n* My first job was to deliver apples from Cambridge to Birmingham. Not quite recalling how UK road system works (left UK since 95, true story), I have ended up with a huge detour.\n\n* I have learned that making a U-turn with a loaded truck is actually an art.\n\n* Finding a place for a U-turn is even more challenging!\n\n* I have turned into a small road thinking that I could find my way back to Birmingham. My truck nearly got stuck!\n\n* Crashed a few cars along the way. Went through speed camera twice. They took my money, not my license. Phew.\n\n* Dented the truck due to my obvious lack of experience. Luckily, that ain't my truck.\n\n* I hate working for people. After 2 jobs, I have decided to take up a €100,000 bank loan. The banker was nice. No question asked.\n\n* I randomly picked some jobs. Oops. Why didn't I pick a job that starts where I am?!\n\n* Drove through the sunset to pick up my first job as a proud owner of my truck.\n\n* Continue through the night to deliver my first job - logs.\n\n* My body outside the game is alert but my body inside the game was tired. I am seeing my computer screen blacking out.\n\n* Fortunately I found a motel nearby. I don't think they have charged me a penny. I love UK.\n\nNow, my body (outside the game) is tired. But I really want to deliver another job for some virtual currency to pay back my virtual loan. I may lose my real life job if I continue this way. Don't buy this game. It will destroy your life.","January 3","true","83.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

No twitch gameplay here.  Just the mechanics of driving a tractor-trailor long-haul across the nation.  Is it uber realistic?  No, not really.  The scenery is abbreviated, the distances severely compressed and many of the systems are simplistic in their representation.\n\nBut it works for me.  Why?  Because I used to drive long-haul in the lower 48.  I wouldn't want to spend several hours to get from one town to the next.  The distances in ETS2 are appropriate for a representation of what it is like.  But at the start and end of the journey the mechanics of picking up and dropping off the trailer remind me of my trucking days.  There's something satisfying in cutting the perfect corner, of figuring out how to approach that tricky dock and then just doing it.\n\nColored by nastalgia?  Maybe.  But if the game is evoking nastalgia in this former trucker then clearly SCS is doing something right.","May 17","true","48.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

On the surface it seems more like just "driving trucks," but no, the game goes much deeper than that. This game is not about driving trucks, it's about building an empire. Either way, driving trucks in this game is still an incredible experience. Though the physics was thrown a little off in v1.9, and the traffic AI is kind of stupid, that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. This game is surprisingly relaxing and enjoyable. It's also extremely detailed: SCS Software's recreation of Europe is absolutely stunning. The countryside, that is. Cities are extremely tiny and leave a lot to be desired, but modded maps make up for a lot of that. Speaking of mods: this game is extremely moddable. There is a mapping team which has created absolutely stunning maps for anywhere from Northern Africa to Southwest France and Spain to Scandinavia and (coming soon) Iceland. The graphics (especially with anti-aliasing) leave a bit to be desired but that doesn't generally detract from the experience. Aside from anti-aliasing this is a model PC game, especially with the absolutely grand scale (an entire continent!) and capabilities of the engine. I certainly wouldn't pay full price for it, but if you can find it on sale, it's worth every penny and has almost infinite replayability.","May 20, 2014","true","308.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

(Edit)\n\nThis game offers a uniqe truck experience, not the like the otherones, in ETS2 you can freeroam once you've bought your own truck. I've played my own bit, and if you -really- want to play this game alot, I suggest you to invest in a steeringwheel controller, as it's more fun and realistic.\n\nOnce you've started getting into the game, you don't want to stop playing it, mainly because you have your own company. As you play, your company will grow if you want it to, the game offers a uniqe trucking company simulator at the price of €20, you'll get both a trucking- and company simulator.\n\nThe gameplay of ETS2 is fun, with the ''Going east!'' DLC you get a bit better roads, more challenging and more road interaction, i.e roadworks.\n\nOverall I'd rate this game a solid 9/10\n- Gameplay 7/10\n- Interactions 8/10\n- Player system 10/10\n- Map 9.5/10","March 17, 2014","true","16.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yes, it is a game about driving trucks.  Yes, the hauls get to be long distance.  If you're looking for something that keeps you on the edge of your seat, with non-stop action, this is not your game.\n\nHowever, if you're looking for one of the most true to life, masterfully done, in-depth simulator you've ever sunk your teeth into, you've come to the right place.\n\nI remember joking with my buddies "LOL who wants to drive truck".  Then a few weeks later, I find myself bored on a Saturday, lo and behold, ETS2 has a demo.  I'll give it a shot, what do I have to lose?  Just my entire Saturday.\n\nI can't quite put my finger on the exact thing that kept me playing this game for an 8 hour marathon session (I had stand alone before the Steam version).  Beautifully, accurately crafted European countryside is a brilliant start.  I plopped my trucking company down in London, as I wanted to tour the UK.  I buy my first truck, and jump right into my first haul.\n\nWell, the minutes turn into hours, and suddenly I'm the owner of a successful trucking company, myself and 2 employees with my own fleet.  As you progress, you level up and can spend points on hauling more dangerous/fragile cargo, longer hauls, more economic hauls (gas/wear and tear), and more.  As your employees complete more hauls, they also level up and start bringing in more cheddar.\n\nMy only gripe are the punishment systems.  I was expecting active traffic police, aka being pulled over for breaking the law.  However, the only punishment system is a series of fines.  A fine for running a red light, for driving in the wrong lane, for hitting other cars, and traffic cameras (which I'm told are quite common in Europe) for speeding.  No lost time in accident investigation or being pulled over, just a popup fine.\n\nThe only other punishment system is a damage system to your truck and trailer.  Damaging the trailer results in a poor score for the haul, and damaging your truck ends up costing you hefty repair bills.  It's also worth mentioning that it seems you get to a point where you make enough money that any punishment is negligible.  You make enough money on the haul where a few $500 tickets don't phase you, nor does a small repair.\n\nThis game is a perfect getaway when you're looking for a lazy escape.  Throw on your favorite tunes, and get to haulin'.  ETS2 gets a 4/5.\n\nApocky+Tawok\nwww.GuildLeaders.com","December 31, 2013","true","12.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggtooth/recommended/227300/","eggtooth","Eggtooth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eggtooth/","687 products in account",""Truckin' was never that fun before!"\n\nWhen I've started Euro Truck Simulator 2 for first time, I knew I won't be dissapointed. How could I be? It's SCS Software. They never dissapoint.  As everybody else I had my worries, but as soon as I've bought my truck and started driving it, all my worries were gone.\n\nThis game is AMAZING.\n\nWhat shines here are the possibilities. You can hire drivers, expand your business to other countries, buy new trucks, upgrade them, you can level up yourself, you earn money... there is a lot to do. You start as a driver without truck and need to do a quick job. So you hop onto borrowed truck and off you go. After certain amount of time you will earn enough money to get your first truck. The true pleasure starts when you actaully do free roam across europe. You can visit lots of cities, including Warsaw, Poznan, Berlin, London etc. There is a lot of them in game, and all of them contain their recognisable landmarks which adds to the overall immersion of the game. The only complaint I could have towards cities is their size. Often they have 3 to 4 roads, but other than that they are nicely looking. Outside of cities you have beautifull enviroments, rich with details. Sometimes you'll encounter a road works where you can observe workers doing their job, you can see planes landing and taking off from big airports or just observe traffic. Ai is improved from ETS1. They actually pay more attention to you and other drivers, hell, when you use high beam lights, they will flash to you to inform you about that. It's a nice touch, and I love it.\n\nGraphically speaking game is beautifull. I mentioned oustanding map and it's enviroment (plus map is AMAZINGLY HUGE). Truck models are made with huge attention to detail, so are traffic cars and other models. Truck interiors are incredibly well done and well detailed. I love looking at sunset, it's just amazing, the amount of colours, those sunshafts... Just wow. Sound-wise game is great aswell. Trucks sound realistic, they have their real engine sounds, but I think that in interior camera, outiside sounds are too quiet. Overall sound is nicely done but has it's flaws. Game has lots of options to choose from, you can even disable built in speed limiter. Optimisation could be a little bad when using outside mirrors, but that is subject to change because SCS is still improving game by adding new free trucks and some paid DLC's, which are definetly top notch quality as the game is (Going East!). Tuning is strong part of the game. You can improve not only engines, but also design of truck by installing grills, more lights, beacons, chromed mirrors etc. There is a lot to do for someone who loves to customise their vehicle. You can literally make a christmas tree out of your truck!\n\nPhysics are improved. Trucks doesn't "float" on road anymore, they have weight, and thank god the cabin has it's own suspension too. I like that you can use mouse to steer the truck, but Xbox 360 controller after configuration works flawlessly. Game supports all common steering wheels without any problem.\n\nGame does not contain multiplayer.\n\nThing worth mentioning is that game is moddable. Lots of mods (maps, trucks, Ai, physics mods, interior mods) have been released, and there is even more. SCS supports modding which is great, and they are improving this game by adding new trucks for free.\n\nOverall game is worth asking price without doubt. Truckin' was never that fun before, even in Rig'n'Roll. It has everything: customisation, advanced tuning, lots of trucks, business to expand, loads of cities to visit, and discover, drivers to hire... What are you waiting for? Go get it! Your truck business will not build by itself...\n\n9/10","November 25, 2013","true","66.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I'm playing for about seven months now and still not bored. You can make it has hard or easy as you want to, just by turning on or off some of the simulation aspects. It can be a very relaxing game to play. Just driving about, enjoying the beautiful scenery and listening to your music in the background. I often play it at the end of the day, just to cool down from work and all the daily worries. The game is also constantly being updated with new features and improvements. (A big AI update is coming too) The game itself is already great but there are tons of great mods available, wich make it even better. New trucks, trailers, maps, you name it. A steering wheel is recommended but certainly not necessary. You can play it with controller or keyboard too. Using a good steering wheel though is a totally different and greatly improved experience. If you have the proper hardware, this game can look absolutely gorgeous for a sim game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Knowlesspot/recommended/227300/","Knowlesspot","Knowlesspot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Knowlesspot/","311 products in account","Score: 8.5/10\nThis game is a gem which unfortunately has to tumble through the simulation genre with the rest of the ordinary boring rocks. Many other simulation games out there give the genre a bad name, but this game is truly incredible not only to the genre of simulation but to gaming as a whole.\n\nTl;dr\nThis relaxing, addictive game is for anybody. Simulator enthusiasts. Gamers. Children. Adults. Men. Women. Anyone. It's potentially captivating to such a wide range of an audience, that it's definitely worth downloading the demo to see if you like the flesh of the game. And if (when) you do like it, you can buy the meat.\n\nWhat is it?\nEuro Truck Simulator 2 is a game where you lead a trucking company, at first making money fairly slowly doing freelance jobs for random people (using their trucks) until you can afford your own truck. The quickjob part of the game shows you the flesh of what's going to come within the rest of the game, it lets you get to grips with the mechanics of driving the trucks in game, and gives you a general feel as to what you're going to be doing.\n\nWhen you get your own truck, the real meat of the game starts to show as you can make much more money from jobs which can then be used to do a series of things:\n\nBuy more trucks (♥♥♥♥ yeah).\nHire workers to drive your trucks for you and make you money (we talk about this next <3).\nPimp yo' truck.\nBuy a big ♥♥♥ garage in every city in Europe and keep your freshly-pimped trucks in them.\nThe main things here are buying more trucks and hiring the workers. Once you've hired your first worker, you realise "Actually, this is turning into a company, old turbo Joe himself is under my command in his fresh little pimp mobile. I'm gonna make the big bucks."\n\nAnd that's how it goes, you do more jobs, get more money, buy more trucks, hire Turbo Joe and Rod Stewart to drive your trucks, and voila, you have an exponentially growing company.\n\nThere is also a leveling system in the game, which gives you a skill point for each level. This leveling system allows your to get longer distance jobs, hold fragile cargos, get bonuses for driving economically, getting to your destination earlier bonuses, and other things. The leveling system is good, but it doesn't add much to the content, just allows you to make more money for each individual job.\n\nThat doesn't seem like a lot content?\nOkay, so you don't want to splash the twenty buckaroos on Turbo Joe trucker Sim 2 because you're worried you won't find enjoyment in the game?\n\nHere's what I'd suggest.\n\nPlay the demo for an hour or two, see if you find enjoyment in the driving mechanics of the game, if you find it satisfying to haul a load of heroin (or potatoes) across Poland. If you enjoy these two key things that make the flesh of the game, the meat of the game is going to add to the experience tenfold as it gives you big goals to go towards, but doesn't make them impossible to get.\n\nHow does this game make you feel inside?\nI feel like the sexiest thing on earth when I haul that big load straight into the delivery point. And you will too (if you don't think you will, try that god damned demo).\n\nSeriously though, this is an incredibly relaxing game. I find it really good for winding down after a long day at college and suchlike. You don't have to pay too much attention, just enough to stay in your lane and to know when to turn off. The game proposes a constant low level difficulty, meaning that it's easy to play and you can be great at it as soon as you start, but this constant low level difficulty means that you've got to balance between relaxing and fully enjoying the game and keeping your eyes on the road. In my opinion they've done a really good job with this.\n\nI currently find myself coming home and playing this over WoW, which tells me the devs have done a really good job at giving the game a pull factor, making you want to come back to it time and time again.\n\nAny mods worth getting\nThe Euro Truck Simulator 2 Multiplayer mod makes the game a different experience, replacing all of the virtual traffic with real life players driving across europe completing similar missions to yours. When driving long distances, you may go a long distance without seeing anybody, which may make the game slightly lonely for you but when you do see somebody, the humble honk of the horn that you exchange makes it all worth it. In other journeys however, the roads teem with over players, all trucking away individually but the united cause of mothertruckers makes everyone united in away.\n\nThe winter mod is pretty much just a mod that makes everything snowy, and does a damned good job at it too. The snowflake textures that stretch on the windscreen aren't great in my opinion, but that's my only criticism of the mod. The Multiplayer mod runs this during the holiday period.\n\nScore: 8.5/10\nTl;dr (also at the top <3)\nThis game is for anybody. Simulator enthusiasts. Gamers. Children. Adults. Men. Women. Anyone. It's potentially captivating to such a wide range of an audience, that it's definitely worth downloading the demo to see if you like the flesh of the game. And if (when) you do like it, you can buy the meat.\n\nI'd recommend buying this in the sale, reddit, or the dispenser as that's where you'll get the cheapest price (maybe ♥♥♥♥♥).\n\nI hope this review helped you, please rate up if it did. :)","January 30, 2015","true","48.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have been driving trucks and hauling trailers since I was 18. I even have certificate of profession to show for as a trucker. To put it short, I know trucks. I have driven them for all my time under the hardest conditions - because I have driven in western and northern Norway. These roads are pure hell during the winter - and the winter is LONG here. Imagine blizzards, short periods of daylight, narrow roads twisting around mountains and over bridges to reach that one ferry that only crosses 7 times a day. Stryn Mountain. Hamarøya. Korg Mountain. Iceroad Truckers can go wet their beds.\n\nI am a trucker. After 9 hours on the road, I have often sat down in my Volvo or Scania or DAF or whatever office I would be driving at that time, to play Euro Trucker 1 and 2. Pretty strange. One should believe that after so many years, I would have had trucks and diesel too far up my troath - but no. I like these games. Although very simple and not that demanding as it can be in real life, they are fun, relaxing and addictive. It also helps that there is a HUGE community providing a high level of addons for this game.\n\nCan't wait for the Scandinavian addon.

The driving mechanics are great. The AI can be stupid at times, but it somehow adds to the charm of this game. The aspect of customizing your truck keeps you working to get the extra cash you need to upgrade your engine or put on that new coat of paint or even add some lights or horns.\nWith any good sim, certain aspects of the game can be changed to accomadate your play style, like turning off the sleep simulation or the speed limiter (but sadly traffic fines cannot).\n\nWhile the vinalla game gets dull after a couple hours, the moddability adds hours upon hours of awesome. There are truck mods, trailer mods (my favorite), and even map mods to freshen the game up.\n\nThe one problem you might face with this game is finding the control style that's right for you. Some people like it, but I would strongly caution you to NOT use the keyboard or mouse/keyboard control schemes. The second option is better if you're on a budget, but it's still not great. If you want to get a great experience out of this game, buy a Xbox controller (which I'm stuck with at the moment) or get a racing wheel (strongly reccomended); it will make the game infinitely better.\n\nThe game's not for everyone, but I suggest you give it a try; you might like it (I sure do)\n9/10","August 8, 2014","true","171.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Additionally, many companies no longer localize their titles for the U.S. and Europe due to their belief that their games will not sell well enough in the other countries. For example, Square Enix's Final Fantasy series began as a JRPG true to its roots, instantly becoming a cult classic. In recent titles, however, there has been an influx of cinematics and high fidelity graphics, all of which are seemingly the trade-off for the qualities lost. Many things that defined the genre and made the stories and gameplay interesting were lost as JRPGs got more and more caught up in the "new and fresh" looks and styles in more modern titles.\nDespite the apparent loss in quality in JRPGs, the genre is very much alive and well! Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out only a year ago, and yet it is proving itself to be a JRPG true to its elements. The story progression feels real and well-paced. The characters feel very human and never fall into any of the stereotypical roles filled by JRPG characters ( i.e. the edgy one, the tsundere one, the emotionless one, etc etc). This is in part due to the fantastic voice acting by great signature voices such as Nolan North, Troy Baker, and Danny Devito. I praise this, yet I would go as far to say that the game is just as good without any voice acting, but I digress. The gameplay in Euro Truck Simulator 2 blows every AAA title in recent years out of the water. So many puzzles and combat mechanics in the game are well refined and done so with the story in mind.\nOverall, I could not recommend this game any more to any true die hard fan of the JRPG genre, or someone new to the genre.

Need I say more?\n\nCon's:\n-The map is massive, but while driving through England or france there are'nt any landmarks. This isnt too bad if you just enjoy the core gameplay (driving) but it can make it a little repetitive\n-Levelling up can take a while\n","January 5, 2015","true","110.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The driving mechanics are great. The AI can be stupid at times, but it somehow adds to the charm of this game. The aspect of customizing your truck keeps you working to get the extra cash you need to upgrade your engine or put on that new coat of paint or even add some lights or horns.\nWith any good sim, certain aspects of the game can be changed to accomadate your play style, like turning off the sleep simulation or the speed limiter (but sadly traffic fines cannot).\n\nWhile the vinalla game gets dull after a couple hours, the moddability adds hours upon hours of awesome. There are truck mods, trailer mods (my favorite), and even map mods to freshen the game up.\n\nThe one problem you might face with this game is finding the control style that's right for you. Some people like it, but I would strongly caution you to NOT use the keyboard or mouse/keyboard control schemes. The second option is better if you're on a budget, but it's still not great. If you want to get a great experience out of this game, buy a Xbox controller (which I'm stuck with at the moment) or get a racing wheel (strongly reccomended); it will make the game infinitely better.\n\nThe game's not for everyone, but I suggest you give it a try; you might like it (I sure do)\n9/10","August 8, 2014","true","171.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Additionally, many companies no longer localize their titles for the U.S. and Europe due to their belief that their games will not sell well enough in the other countries. For example, Square Enix's Final Fantasy series began as a JRPG true to its roots, instantly becoming a cult classic. In recent titles, however, there has been an influx of cinematics and high fidelity graphics, all of which are seemingly the trade-off for the qualities lost. Many things that defined the genre and made the stories and gameplay interesting were lost as JRPGs got more and more caught up in the "new and fresh" looks and styles in more modern titles.\nDespite the apparent loss in quality in JRPGs, the genre is very much alive and well! Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out only a year ago, and yet it is proving itself to be a JRPG true to its elements. The story progression feels real and well-paced. The characters feel very human and never fall into any of the stereotypical roles filled by JRPG characters ( i.e. the edgy one, the tsundere one, the emotionless one, etc etc). This is in part due to the fantastic voice acting by great signature voices such as Nolan North, Troy Baker, and Danny Devito. I praise this, yet I would go as far to say that the game is just as good without any voice acting, but I digress. The gameplay in Euro Truck Simulator 2 blows every AAA title in recent years out of the water. So many puzzles and combat mechanics in the game are well refined and done so with the story in mind.\nOverall, I could not recommend this game any more to any true die hard fan of the JRPG genre, or someone new to the genre. Everything from plot, to combat, and to graphics do not fail to impress me. This is definitely my game of the year, the decade, and maybe even the century.

You can also impliment your own songs and play them from the radio as you venture into the wild blue yonder!\n\n+Start your own company, and rise to greatness as one of the best truck companies in Europe.\n\n+The game is very realistic, where you use your driving wits to get you through each trip.\n\n+Trafic acts realisticly, where cars will go into the other lane to get ahead of you, people will honk at you for being to slow or not going at a green light, etc etc etc.\n\n+Explore parts of Austria, Germany, the UK, France and many more countries! With the DLC, Heading East, you can explore even more!\n\n+Modding support!\n\nCons:\n-The game is quite expensive, and you have to play a bit to get your money's worth.\n\n-There are a lot of things to remember, but if you're like me and like that, then you're fine.\n\n-You  must  set aside some time every day or so to play this game to get anywhere in it.\n\nAll in all, I definately recommend this to anyone who likes roleplay, exploring Europe, or just like semi's.

The game as a whole is very well produced and I haven't encountered any obvious bugs. I'd say this is high quality stuff all-around.\n\nEven though I already have over 20 hours of the game time (at the moment of writing this review), I haven't even touched the garages feature not hired any drivers for my truck company yet (didn't even upgrade all my skills yet). All I did so far was bought my own truck (you don't have your own truck at the beginning) and upgraded the engine and transmission with money I made from cargo deliveries. I'm taking my time to enjoy it and it's not getting boring, in fact just looking at the Steam store screenshots makes me eager to play more.\n\nDriving the truck feels very satisfying with Xbox 360 controller for PC and the game is very generous with force feedback (and I'm not talking about raw intensity but details, you'll feel virtually everything).\n\nNote that for force feedback to work with Xbox 360 controller, you may need to install the additional translation-driver because newer versions of Windows no longer fully support DirectInput which this game uses. See Steam forums for more info (that's where I found the "Force Feedback Driver for XInput" by Masahiko Morii which works great on Windows 8.1 for me).\n\nAlso worth noting, this game is great to play while listening to the talk-podcasts or audio books. The game is relaxing and non-interfering in nature. As one of the reviews here say, it's zen-like.","December 18, 2014","true","76.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a great way to wind down after a long day at class or work.\n\nWhile it is possible to play with the keyboard, I reccommend at least using a controller, but the best experisnce is with a 900 degree turn radius steering wheel. If you have force-feedback on it, it will allow you too feel the truck as you start driving: you can feel the road under the tires, and occassionally hit a rumble strip.\n\nYou can't go wrong, it is an amazing experience, and I reccomend it to anyone who loves to drive, race, or likes open-world driving.","October 29, 2013","true","222.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's relaxing, driving around in your big rig to music from the many online radio stations from around the world.  It's challenging, trying to park your rig to earn that extra money and XP.  It's got a very nice progression system, earning experience to improve your skills.  Customizing your trucks with better equipment and paint styles.  It's deep, in that you can buy your own garages, hire drivers, buy trucks for them to drive and grow your business.  It's beautiful, the scenery is sometimes breathtaking as you drive across farming fields, through cities, over mountain roads, through the rain and fog and night time.  It's one of my favorite games of the year, and although I find that surprising to say out loud, it honestly is.  It's like the Elite or Privateer of driving simulation games.

This is one of the most fun games I've played in the past 5 years, and probably one of the best driving games I've played in my life. It proves that a game doesn't need to be a racing game, to provide an enjoyable driving experience. Match this with the beautiful scenery (that changes frequently enough to keep things interesting) and you have a great game. It won't appeal to everyone, but if you enjoy driving and have always had an interest in 18 wheelers, then I would suggest giving this game a shot.

Anyone who has played the game before however, knows this isn't the case. Euro Truck Simulator 2 brings more to the genre then the conventional simulation game. They really take the simple idea behind the game and drive it home. No pun intended.\nThe game does a great job with the progression speed, it's slow, but not slow to the point where you find yourself bored. You gain skills over time permitting you to haul different cargo, drive longer distances, and more.\nAfter my initial skepticism, the game has since grown into one of my favorite games. No other game can quite capture the relaxing feel you have when playing ETS 2. A game where you can turn on some music and just drive to most any of Europe's most prominent cities.","December 29, 2013","true","167.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I bought it on a lark during a Steam sale for under $3. I've plowed about 70 hours into it over the last few months, playing almost every night. There's something very peaceful about this driving game -- almost completely the opposite of the average racing game. It's about driving carefully, obeying traffic rules, and slowly building your truck empire. The graphics are lovely - you'll send a lot of time driving around, just looking at the scenery and the wonderful little touches that make the in-game locations look like their real-world counterparts. My favorite part of the whole game is the ability to listen to (European) radio stations while you're driving. I grew up in Belgium and now live on the West Coast of the US; as a result, I can now listen to the Belgian morning radio shows as I drive around at night. You may be skeptical about a truck sim game -- I was -- but put plain and simple, this is some of the most fun I've had playing a PC game in years.
