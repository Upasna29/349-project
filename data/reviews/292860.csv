This game is the Citizen Kane of the digital world. It is so perfect, you would need to destroy it to make it any less good. I first recieved this from a friend. He sent it to me as a gift, and he said "You gotta play this." At first I was sceptical. Was this Pajama Sam game any good? What would it be like? These questions were soon to be answered.\n\nI installed the game. The 30 second download and installation time was a long wait, but, it was indeed worth it. I loaded the game. Instantly, all I hear is clapping, like the game itself is congradulating me for installing the game. After that, I see a suggested age that says "3-8 Years Old". This was a false suggestion. No mere child could see how great this game was truly. I opened up the game, and was instantly shocked by how amazing the opening scene was.\n\nA man, alone on his planet. It is his planet. He was strong enough to live there by himself. Without any warning, a spaceshuttle comes by, and lands on his planet. The man, enjoyed to see someone other than himself, welcomes the visitor in open arms. The visitor was a monstrosity that was out of Lovecraftian mythos. It rejected the man's offer of peace, and instead chose an offer of war. The man agreed to this war, just to defend his own planet. Everything stops. A woman's voice asks if someone would cleanup their room. This person was a god, who orchestrated the events on the planet. This person... was Pajama Sam.\n\nPajama Sam put on his glorious red cape, and ran under his bed to find lost goods. After arriving under his bed, they were suddenly in a river. Sam leapt onto a boat, and then a wonderful German voice greeted me. After this point, my 32-core, 50 TB computer with 24 GTX 780 Ti's with Liquid Nitrogen cooling seemed to be having a panic. Weird sounds began to spew out, and then... BANG. My computer exploded, caught fire, and died. It had seemed like Pajama Sam had destroyed my computer with its sheer minimal requirements. I still know the glory of Pajama Sam today.\n\nMusic: 240000000/10\nGameplay: 23343000000000/10\nStory: 6422343400000000000000/10\nGraphics: 11/10","June 6, 2014","true","0.7"," 66 of 81 people (81%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","81","66","81","18","7"

I'm sure many of you will think me childish for liking a childish game. I assure you I am not. I used to love this game when I was a kid. I would play for what seemed like hours day after day. I probably racked up around 20 hours of this game as a child, and I can honestly say that those hours were full of enjoyment, just as my time playing this on Steam has been.\nIf you want a game that's actually pretty fun and lets you reminisce and puts a smile on your face no matter how rough your day was, buy this. I'm sure many of you haven't played Pajama Same before, but trust me,\nIt is so worth the money.","June 19, 2014","true","1.1"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Before i got this game i was a weak beta who only managed to scrape through life by the skin of my teeth. I was 5'6 and weighed 300 pounds and had more grease in my hair than a McDonalds deep fryer. No girl would touch me, i was nothing. That all changed when Pajama Sam came into my life. His sheer determination to find all of his lost items inspired me to change my life. I forced my self to grow till i was 6,5, i then started to work out and got a body that causes women to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the sight of me.

Well, I hope you enjoy 100 levels of that.\n\nRecommended for those 5 minutes of enjoyment and 2+ hours of sheer self-loathing for not stopping after those 5 minutes.","May 7","true","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Arcadey side-scrolling thing where the screen autoscrolls and you pick up a bonus puzzle piece. Levels aren't distinct enough to keep me entertained at all, the bonus minigames are generic as well, I dunno. I tend to find myself only playing through the humongous arcade games when there's at least some semblance of level design, so basically just the puzzle games yeah.

In this game, Sam has to clean up his room so he imagines finding all of his stuff by going through various worlds he has visited in the first two games along with some new worlds exclusive for this game. Otto the Boat & King the Mine Cart from the first game return along with the Forklift from the second game. While the only new characters are Rosie the sled and Trigger the wagon. So the game has a bit of old and new concepts mixed together for this spin-off. Its an arcade style game containing 100 levels of a slide scrolling level where you collect points, power ups, and items while avoiding obstacles. There's even bonus items to collect in order to do a choice of three different bonus levels for additional points. The only flaw I have with this game is that sometimes its hard to know how far you need to jump over an obstacle. But its a flaw I can look past while playing this game. The best way to beat this game is either writing done the codes for each level or the option to skip levels you feel is too hard to trek through. Overrall this game has its fun factor and can keep you occupied for a few hours.","July 7, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
