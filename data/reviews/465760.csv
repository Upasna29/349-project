Why always spiders?? WHY?\n-You can change keyboard settings outside of the game, but when you load the game, controls are the same, basically the game ignores the controls you have set (bug i guess maybe will be fixed in the future)\n-sometimes textures lag and you cant see the obstacle you are jumping at\n-the most annyoing part for me was - whenever you kill the mob or pick up the crystal - you get microlag, 100% of the time, kind of frustrating i say, specially if you are jumping between platforms and pickups around, its making things harder.\n\nIn conclusion, if you like games for kids or if you just like machinarium, this is a good buy for you, most of the problems i faced were bugs, means that they will be fixed sooner or later\n¯\_(ツ)_/¯","May 10","true","6.5"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

So you set out on your own to search for other robots who may have survived. The story is told with a narrative, and cut scenes with dialog between characters.\n\nThe game is primarily a 3D platformer, you will spend most of your time collecting enough crystals, and keys to open doors in order to progress. The characters are cute, and graphics are decent. Overall, the game is very casual in nature; there are some super simple puzzles you’ll have to solve, a few tablet inspired mini games, and combat that is simply jumping on top of monsters to kill them.\n\nPros:the graphics look good; the environments are visually appealing, and the characters are adorable\neach level has its own style, and different boss fight mechanics\nvoice acting for the characters was alright for the most part\nmost of the music was decent and relaxing\nCons:keyboard controls didn’t feel very smooth\ncamera angles were sometimes irritating - especially using a mouse because it was overly sensitive, and there’s no settings to adjust it (using a controller felt much better for both movement and camera)\nthe narrator’s voice felt too slow, drawn out, and was a bit boring to listen to, and you can’t turn off the subtitles\na couple audio parts in the game that were a little bit annoying (in the basement), and you could sometimes tell when the audio track was looping (it paused and there was briefly no music on the first boss fight)\nsome invisible walls, and you couldn’t walk there even though it looked like you could\nin some areas start sliding for no reason while standing still, and sometimes it would cause you to miss jumps and fall\njumping was inconsistent: couldn’t double jump reliably, especially when indoors\nbug with some of the breakable boxes throughout the game: jumping from really high up, or double jumping to land on a box still wouldn’t break them (it wasn't THAT frequent, but it did occur on multiple occasions)\nThe inconsistencies with the platforming and jumping were a bit annoying. I didn’t die that often, but when I did die, it was usually because I slide off of whatever I was jumping to even though it looked like I was fine. My biggest complaints about the game were with the platforming aspects of it, and when a game revolves so heavily around platforming, I feel it takes away from the experience.\n\nThe game took me 2.5 hours; the story is linear, and there isn’t any need to replay it unless you want achievements. Scrap garden isn’t a bad game. Visually, it’s very appealing, and the game is cute, but it is also very short, and it certainly has a few flaws.","May 28","false","2.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","16","20","4","1"

A robot which otherwise wouldnt have amounted to much in this robot world finds himself as the last hope of saving all life across the world!\n\nThere's 2 things about this game that i feel sums everything up without going into to much detail.\n\n1# It's not a hard game, but thats okay because that's not what it's about. It does have puzzling moments along the way that are entertaining and i did find myself getting killed a few times by trying to rush a boss encounter.\n\n2# What mate this game for me was the tone and it's pace. It feels like im being read a bed time story leaving me unable ot sleep until i find out if the hero Canny wins. As each world passes my love for Canny grew and grew. He doesnt have a lot to say "Beep boop" but you can tell the kindness in his heart is pure, and that we all could learn a little from him.\n\nI clock this game at about 2hours if you're not rushing and I'm more than happy having paid for it.\n\nIn the name of being critical, it wouldnt be fair for me to praise the game so much without saying something critical, but in the hope it could be taken helpful.\n\nIf i could suggest a couple things, It would be a more diverse sellection of animals / monsters. And coupled with that, i'd like to see them become more of a threat as with how it currently is, they're just 1 boop on the head away from the graveyard regardless of what they are.\n\nGreat game, have a very humble time. Would recommend to a friend.\n\n7/10. :)","May 8","true","4.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","3"

It's short, it's not too challenging, and it has a nice storyline.\n\nFirst, some drawbacks (for me personally):\n\n-  I must say the voice acting was a bit iffy -- but it was also entertaining to listen to (perhaps unintentionally). The English grammar was also a bit odd at times, but I imagine that wouldn't bother most people.\n- The storyline lost me sometimes, though I don't know if that's because of an issue with the way it was written, with a hazy storyline in general, or my own inattentiveness.\n- The puzzles weren't very challenging, so I would've liked a bit more in that regard (but this level of difficulty would probably be great for kids).\n- The controls using a mouse and keyboard were a tad frustrating at times but not impossible.\n- I felt like there was little incentive to collect more red crystals than required, and it was a bit disappointing to see all the crystals I collected get used up in each level even when I had more than necessary. Maybe there is an incentive to collect more that I'm just not aware of.\n\nThings I liked:\n\n- It felt really personal. This is why I like indie games. They give you a glimpse into the creators' minds and imaginations, and that really came across in this game. It certainly has a unique feeling to it, despite being (I imagine) inspired by a variety of similar kid-friendly puzzle games.\n- The music is really nice and pleasant to listen to; it added to the overall feeling of the game as relaxing and sort of magical in a melancholic way.\n- The game world is pretty to look at.\n- Canny is quite adorable and I really liked its R2-D2-esque way of communicating.\n- There are moments of odd and unexpected humour in the game that made me laugh out loud. It's an inoffensive and slightly absurd humour that perhaps appeals most to the young at heart.\n- The game felt a bit old school in some ways. It reminded me of when I used to play games as a kid in the 1990s. I'm not sure how to articulate what specifically about the game made it come across that way, but it was both nostalgic and refreshing.\n\nAnyway, it's a pretty nice game, and I'm glad I played it. If you think you appreciate similar things to me in an indie game, go ahead and try it out!","May 9","true","2.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

You play as Canny, a lonely robot, who awakens in a post-apocalyptic world to find all other robots shut down and seized up. What happened to the City? Why did all robots stop moving? Did anyone survive except him? Little rusty Canny has to do all he can to find answers to these questions... and try to fix it all.\nThe story isn't really all that charming and interesting: while it starts out as a small version of Wall-E, it quickly turns into your typical "find-x-object-to-save-the-world" storyline without bringing anything new to the table.\n\nGRAPHICSMade with the Unity engine, the game's graphics are okay: the character models are mostly fine, the enemies are very repetitive (only two types for area) and the environments are varied but without anything interesting to look at.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game is a 3D platformer that thankfully controls very well. But the real problem is how repetitive and not engaging it is: in every area you start out by collecting red gems to open a door that leads you to a small puzzle area (pick up objects or jump on a couple of buttons) to then face a boss that is killed by either throwing rocks at him or by following a straight path while avoid his attacks.\nYour only buttons are (double)jump and pick up/throw objects, and good luck trying to aim: most of them times you will throw an object off screen since Canny hasn't fully turned around. This got quite annoying, and it made the game not as fun as it could have been.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game is very, very easy: you one-hit kill any enemy by jumping on them, and the puzzles are (hopefully) designed with children in mind. The bosses don't require that much strategy, but the semi-final boss had a quick-time event that felt bugged, and it took me 16 times to manage to beat him. Now that ain't good, and I hope they fix the margin of error on it.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is pretty mediocre, and the sound effects are fine. The small amount of voice acting that is in the game is decent at best.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game lasts around 2 hours, but you can replay it to find hidden objects that can be used to access a secret on a website. Otherwise, I will never play this game again.\n\nOverall, the game is well done, but it unfortunately becomes very boring very quickly and it is way too short. Recommended when sale.\n\nStory: 6.5\nGraphics: 7\nGameplay: 6.5\nChallenge: 5\nSound: 6\nReplayability: 6\n\nENJOYMENT: 6.5\nFRUSTRATION: 2\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","May 12","true","5.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Everything about our little robot protagonist and the world he lives in makes me smile (Well, except maybe the spiders… but that’s beside the point). There is a ton of charm and atmosphere packed into this game, from the lonely piano music and quaint voiceovers to the number of fun (and sometimes destructible) details the developers put into the environment.\n\nScrap Garden is a simple, light-hearted platformer (with the occasional puzzle element) that does what it sets out to do very well. It reminds me a lot of 3D platforming games I played as a kid. The gameplay elements are varied… each chapter plays around with a different mechanic or two; there is a little bit of everything. Some are quite fun, others a little frustrating. It keeps things fresh regardless.\n\nThe game recommends using a gamepad (I used an Xbox 360 controller). The controls were simple and straightforward besides the occasionally wonky camera and double jump. Performance also seemed pretty good. I play on a cheap laptop with integrated graphics and it ran flawlessly on low settings and occasionally stuttered on medium. And despite playing on lower settings, the game still looks great. I ran into a few small graphical glitches and experienced a crash in a particular area, but the developers seem very responsive and good about getting out hotfixes.\n\nScrap Garden is on the shorter side and is not a particularly difficult game (I still died plenty of times), so if you are looking for a challenge, it might not be for you. However,  if you or your kid wants to relax and spend a couple of hours casually hopping around trying to help a little robot save the world… this fun little game might do the trick.\n","May 9","true","6.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
