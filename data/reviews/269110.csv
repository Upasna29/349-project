"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/269110/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","Your adventure in Super Motherload begins as Employee 1001 - a miner working for the Solarus Corporation on Mars. Solarus is hungry for precious minerals, and it's your job retrieve them. Aided by Mister Fix-it (your AI partner), you descend deep into the planet's crust to find minerals to exchange for cash to upgrade your rig. Refueling, repairing, and buying upgrades are the main staples required to continue the descent into the unknown.\n\nThe further you dig, the more you begin to learn about the secrets of Mars and the strange occurrences happening throughout the various Solarus bases. Excerpts of video logs and sound bytes come through occasionally throughout the dig, and as a result you’re sometimes left with a fetch quest. The interruptions are interesting but brief however, allowing more time to do what you do best: dig.\n\nDigging and refueling is a very simple gameplay mechanic, but despite the repetition the game is somewhat complex. Mostly, this is due to the fact that the deeper the dig, the more complicated the soil gets. For example, after hitting the third base I started to notice less open space and more metal plates blocking my path, forcing me to find a way around (or through) them to reach valuable gems.\n\nThe game ramps up its presentation as well, with more and more complicated systems. At first, the Motherload starts off with a smattering of minerals such as “bronzium” and “goldium” which are fairly easy to obtain. Soon enough, the treasures become more valuable deeper into the descent, from rubies all the way to “unobtanium.” Eventually, upgrades can be bought to automatically “smelt” minerals together which make interesting combinations like “katana gold.” Smelting adds a bit more variety to the mining gameplay, allowing for the crafting of bombs and forcing players to think more carefully about the order in which they collect minerals.\n\nGameplay isn't restricted to just "digging" though, as there are a number of different bombs that are made to blast through different types of elements, as well as some interestingly shaped bomb explosions to help navigate through barriers. For example, a “T” bomb will help blast the area directly above and one space to the left and right, creating said "T" shape. Some valuable minerals are trapped within rock or metal barriers that players must explode properly, without destroying the loot. I really enjoyed these short challenges but longed for a bit more complexity and variety as the same puzzles showed up over and over again.\n\nDespite the repetition in bomb puzzles, maps are randomly generated upon each new game making it so you’ll never play the same map twice. Characters also have a different set of upgrade levels and abilities, making gameplay a bit different depending on which character you choose. For example, the unlockable character Laika is a ghost dog who doesn’t take any hull damage, and another extra character, Demitri, has unlimited electron bombs.\n\nI also noticed that stations have different abilities and items for sale upon each new game - in one game I purchased an ability to turn magma into money but in another game I found the same station selling an ability that makes “ironium” turn into fuel. Some of the upgrades can feel like downgrades at first - like increasing the rotor speed is potentially dangerous as you can quickly damage your digger. However, once you get to the endgame these speed upgrades come in handy.\n\nAbout three quarters into the game though, I found a lack of plot movement and an increased difficulty in navigating around blockades. Even after purchasing all possible upgrades for my character it still took quite some time to get to the end and I was not prepared for what I had to do next. After spending hours digging through Mars, the endgame delved into new mechanisms that took me by surprise. However frustrating, I found it rewarding to complete it in the end.\n\nLocal co-op is available, but to be honest I found it to be more stressful than playing alone. Players share a fuel tank, which means that fuel gets wasted a lot more easily so it’s a bit harder to progress. Everyone also shares a single screen - all players have to be in the same area for the game to function. If you leave your controller sitting for more than a few seconds, the game automatically removes your character from play. I can see how co-op could be fun with the right group of people, but I personally prefer the single-player experience.\n\nAnd what a fantastic experience it is, despite its flaws. Super Motherload is simple enough so that anyone can pick it up and play, but complex enough for mining veterans to keep coming back to fully upgrade characters or even risk playing in hardcore mode. The sci-fi ’80s vibe is delightful and the perfect setting for this ridiculously addicting game. I find myself coming back to it at the end of every day, ready for a new adventure underground.","September 21, 2015","true","13.2"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","22","24","2","0"

I also backed it on KS(though it failed).\nI was sad by the early PS4 release and later PC release on this game, but it worthed a wait.\n\nYou do the digging for resources, sell them and upgrade your digger. Deeper you go, richer resources found.\nIt contains more puzzles than the original, requiring you to plan your routes, and use of bombs(Dynamite, TNT, Shaft Bomb, etc) for better profit and faster progress.\nIf you dig resources in certain order(or combo), you get more profit. like "Platinum + Iron" = Rare Earth Magnet and is worth 2500, which is far more than those resources dug alone. These combos are unlocked with Smelter upgrades.\nBe careful with terrains(landing/hitting hard will damage you) and fuels to stay alive. on death you'll lose collected minerals on that run(on normal, Hardcore sounds like a permadeath but haven't tried yet).\nThere are several characters and some unlockables have different stats than 4 main characters. Upgrades are saved on them except Radar upgrade which is tied to the world save. So, if you're stuck just go "New Game" with your previous character(You only lose radar upgrade but the world is renewed, so it won't be too hard to re-upgrade it).\n\nI know it's in Early Acecss, but there's stuttering problem on my computer. Particles and stuffs are not too optimized yet it seems.\n\nIt has multiplayer, but LOCAL only. And the game is designed for local multiplayer(with shared screen and stuffs). If it really had online multiplayer, it would be instantly GOTY, <b>all the time</b> for me.\n\n9/10, -1 from performance issues and no online multiplayer. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.\n\nThe Good:\n- Dig, Sell, Upgrade. simple and fun.\n- Still faithful to the original\n- Good controls(with Xbox360 pad).\nThe Bad:\n- Performance problem\n- Radar could be bigger on singleplayer(or non-4 player games)\n\n-------------------------\n\n前作(2004年)Motherloadに凄くはまってた私は、この続編に凄く期待していたしKickstarterに寄付もしてた(失敗したが)。\nPS4版のリリースが先で、PC版がかなり後になるという話はうれしくなかったけど、待つ価値はあった。\n\n基本は「資源を採掘＞資源を売却＞その金でアップグレード」を繰り返し、火星の奥深くまで突き進んでいく。\n前作よりもパズルめいた地形が生成されることが多くなり、ルート構築(前作と同じく、上へ掘ることはできないし空中採掘もできない)や各種爆弾の使用を考える必要もある。\n資源を特定の組み合わせで掘ると、コンボとしてより高価な資源が手に入る(例：プラチナ+鉄=レアアースマグネット、2500の価値)。溶鉱炉(Smelter)をアップグレードすると使えるコンボの種類が増える。\nダメージバランスは前作より厳しく、落下以外にも横方向や上方向に強くぶつかってもダメージを食らうので注意。ノーマルなら死んでも今持っている資源を失うだけですむが、ハードコアはワールドセーブが消されるのではないかと思われる。\nキャラクターは初期４人＋アンロック数人といて、アンロックキャラは初期とは異なるアップグレード上限と特殊能力を持っている。\nアップグレードはキャラクターごとに保存されるが、レーダーだけはワールドセーブに保存される。資源を採掘しつくすか詰んだ場合は「New Game」で前のキャラを使えば、レーダー以外のアップグレードはそのままでプレイできる(レーダーアップグレードもそこまで高くないので、すぐに買いなおせる)。\n\n早期アクセスだからバグやその辺は仕方ないかもしれないが、頻繁に動作が重くなる。その辺の改善を期待。\n\nマルチプレイヤーが目玉要素として挙げられてるが、ローカル限定なので注意。ゲームデザインもローカル前提なのでほぼ絶望的だが、オンラインマルチが実装されたら永年人に薦められそうな名作と評価してた。\n\nパフォーマンスとオンラインマルチ不可と言う点で減点して9/10。超オススメ。\n\n良いとこ:\n- 採掘・売却・アップグレード。わかりやすく楽しい。\n- 前作の雰囲気とスタイルそのまま。\n- 操作感良好(箱○パッドでプレイ)\n悪いとこ:\n- パフォーマンス問題\n- レーダーもう少し大きくして欲しかった","March 12, 2014","true","10.4"," 38 of 52 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","38","52","0","0"

What kept me playing was the fact that I was making progress despite starting from the top again at times.  Digging into the earth, harvesting minerals, returning to the surface to sell, repair, refuel, and upgrade is the norm for the game.  For others it's tedious and mindless because it is just lather, rinse, and repeat.  For me, it kept me entertained when I had nothing to do.\n\nSuper Motherload brought that formula and gave it an overhaul.  Everything was updated and upgraded.  There are even outposts to reduce many needs for a teleporter, which is commonplace for Motherload.  The basic mechanics were still there but there are no longer those pockets of gas that instantly destroy your pod.  Replacing it is magma and metal blocks which require certain explosives to do so.\n\nTo be honest, this game felt a little shorter than Motherload.  However, the reason Motherload was longer is likely the lack of those outposts and the gas pockets.\n\ntl:dr This game isn't for people who like tedium, like Minecraft and Terraria.  For the others, I'd recommend checking it out.","May 19, 2015","true","10.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

Unfortunately super Motherload simply lacks the charm and emotion of the original flash game. It just doesn't elicit the same response. Before I get to the negatives I have to say I quite like the aesthetic of the game... Mostly. There are still some aspects of its style that I'm not too keen on, but it can pass. Now what really pisses me off is death. It never bloody happens! When I remember playing the original I remember getting so aggravated because I didn't keep track of how much fuel I had left and blew up half way to the surface. This doesn't happen here. You just can't drill, and because of that you don't even have to keep track of your fuel. And that was part of the fun of Motherload, getting a good way into the game and stupidly killing yourself after going thousands of feet down, losing all of the stuff you managed to collect because you stupidly forgot to save. You don't get that here. My other problem is with the upgrades. Simply put, they're absolutely ♥♥♥♥ and completely soulless. Part of the fun  of Motherload was having to save up to buy the energy shield hull that you've been eyeing up through half of the game of the jag engine, or whatever. But you don't have that in super Motherload, just a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing upgrade bars. No pictures or dumb names, it's boring and far too serious. Probably the thing I miss the most about the original was the feeling of depth. Every time you needed to refuel or buy upgrades you had to go to the surface and to drop down you had to have dug a path this meant falling thousands of meters and seeing through all the colourful layers, it was awesome, and that sense of depth just can't be felt in super Motherload because of all the bloody bases. Maybe as a standalone title, I could have a more fair review, but as a fan of the original flash game I just can't recomend this.","April 9, 2014","false","7.8"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Smotherload uses textbook skinner box incremental numbers to keep you playing, but it does it so well and so flawlessly that you barely notice. For once, making those numbers go up is truly fun. It's FUN.\n\nToo bad it only has a lifespan of about 2 hours, and very little replay value.\n\nMotherload is a pseudo-rogue-like game where you dig down down down and collect ores ores ores in a randomized crust of minerals on Mars. Sell the ores, upgrade your miner, mine more ores, sell more ores, upgrade more parts untill youre strong enough to dig to the core and uncover a conspiracy. It's great, incremental gameplay with a solid ending.\n\nThe game plays like butter, which is strange because there is not really any call for tight controls in this game (apart from the pitiful boss fight). The game is all about thinking laterally and not getting greedy. In the original motherload the entire point of the game was not to get greedy, because there is SO much ore to collect that it blinds you to your health and fuel reserves. So many gems and minerals... calling for you. You can spare the fuel to go get that last ruby right? No, wrong. Stop it.\n\nThe game expands it's lifespan via randomly generated puzzles that spawn under the surface, you have to think long and hard about how to get the valuable gems without blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and causing them to be unattainable forever, it's rewarding gameplay and a good player can use them to help speed up the grind. Unfortunately the game hits a wall only 1 hour into gameplay. After the first hour of solid fun, the game turned into a long, wet fart as I grinded ores to upgrade my miner to get to the bottom, at which one of the stupidest boss fights was waiting for me.\n\nIf you played the original motherload you'll want to get this. There are no longer random deaths from gas pockets, running out of fuel doesnt make you explode anymore (seriously what was even with that?) and it's a lot harder to die. These changes go together to make a much better feeling game... it also kind of took away the challenge, somewhat. The game is not very hard. I'm glad the changes were made, but not enough was added to make the game's difficulty curve up.\n\nAt the end of the day though, I was enamored by this game, it's short and ♥♥♥♥ in spots, but the gameplay, the story and even the graphics are wonderful. If it were any longer it would be in danger of being far too grindy. I'm sure this game could have been far better, but as it stands, it is still a fantastic way to waste an afternoon.\n\n11/10 would drill again.\n","September 23, 2014","true","39.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","10","13","3","0"

A few new features peaked my interest, and I managed to get through to the ending within a couple of sessions.\n\nUp sides were that the game seemed pretty polished, and I feel I missed out by only playing solo. The story had me interested as I delved deeper, intrigued to see how it developed. As a resources hoarder in other similar games, I was given ample ability to hoard and upgrade to my heart's content.\n\nThe downside however was that 'developed' seems to be a word that was a little lacking in the game as a whole. The ending seemed half baked, and I couldn't help but feel like the interesting item combining system basically devolved into a much simpler mechanic than it could have been. I didn't feel that mentally exercised by it, and my early hopes were left feeling a bit flat.\n\nOverall, if you enjoyed Motherload as a casual time killer, this will probably give you the nostalgia you're hoping for. Otherwise however, don't expect to get much more than an afternoon or two out of this before it joins your other 'I'll play this if I'm bored' titles in your steam library.\n\nAlso, being totally petty...

Now, all that happens is that your spaceship/drilling machine just goes a bit slower than usual and you cant mine anymore until you fill your tank again. You could die from taking to much damage by slamming to hard into the walls, but even that suffers from this puzzling game designing choice.\nIn the original game, an almost empty tank meant time pressure, which resulted in that you had to get faster to the surface in order to not die, while still managing to not kill yourself my slamming into walls as you go faster. Here, that element is completely gone! You can take all the time you want in the world to be as careful as you like, which make everything a slow paced uninteresting grindfest.\n\nIts truly sad, that this one little mistake of leaving this mechanic out just completely breaks an otherwise fantastic remake of the original. As ive already said the graphics are awesome, and hints to a soviet union space rocket type of style and the warm red against the cold green are excellent use of color palette. The soundtrack is also really nice and marries the estethics and story into a great feeling game. I highly suggest that the developers release an update where the empty-tank-death mechanic has been reimplemented, as i see here that im not the only one complaining about it.

Thats not too bad, plenty of games function fine local like Magicka and Gauntlet. I feel Super Motherload behaves the same in that aspect, especially with controllers (Plays best with gamepad, Comrade!). The game also seems to lack in content to me but thats remedied by the high replay value. Honestly, thats the only real downside I see and I feel they can easily make it online multiplayer and may even be planning on it.\nMany complain about the game being too easy and actively ignore hardcore mode or complain about the storyline and how its different from the original. Of course it is, they don't want it to get stale.\nThe graphics are improved of course and I LOVE how it has clever little puzzles that you can solve with different bombs. Nothing feels better that getting a Universe Chain of unobtainium.\nMy brother liked the smelter, I didn't care for it too much.\nThe transmission cutscenes are fully voiced and I absolutely loved that.\nHonestly, this is one of those games where if you like this type of game but you don't like Super Motherload, its your own damn fault. Many complain about broken textures or black screen and say the GAME is bad for that. Don't listen to them.\nGreat game, great music, great graphics, great replay value, can't really ask for more in a game.\n\nBONUS: It comes WITH the original Motherload Goldium edition as well for the nostalgia.

With adding chains, combos, special items such as turning magma into cold-hard cash, and unlockable characters(The first four share the same unlocks, the locked characters have things like take no hull damage), there's more to do in Super Motherload. It also doesn't have some of the bugs that plagued even the Goldium Edition(I vibrated off into unmined territory. While hilarious, it was confusing also).\n\nSuper Motherload still keeps core what Motherload established. It's a puzzle digging game where you get copious amounts of cash for digging. It feels almost exactly like the old one, with the addition of looking pretty and having a solid soundtrack. Althoguh the game on the normal difficulty is a lot easier than the original game, the Hardcore difficulty is...actually difficult. God save you if you explode three layers in the setiment and then have to select a new character(THE MAP DOESN'T REGENERATE ORES because you gotta man up sometimes).\n\nIf you're a fan of the old Motherload, it's totally worth the asking price. This is keeping in mind that I never was able to co-op with anyone also, since it IS local co-op only. That is the only fault with this one, really.

It shows once again how great Xgen is.\nHow the game Improves\nThe game improves in numerous ways besides removing death from running out of fuel. (Still on of the best improvements) The new smelter and combo feature just made the game feel more fun. Now instead of just digging up random minerals, It makes you want to dig up minerals in a certain order, as well has harvest chains of minerals. Speaking of which, the ground isn't exactly random anymore. Now you can somtimes find caverns, whole motherloads of resources, tunnels making different shapes, and puzzles. Yes, there are now puzzles. You can sometimes find special areas with valuable resources that are blocked by a puzzle, which you must solve by bombing it a certain way. This made the game have much more to it then just digging. But you can't just carelessly bomb the puzzle to get to the center. Instead you get more bomb types. Bombs can also be made underground while mining. The world feels much deeper than the last game. To solve this there are now underground stations to make mining easier. No more long trips back to the surface!\nStory:\nIm not supprised that the story is much better because they hired a proffesional comic book writer to do their story. Still, it is fantastic! Much better than having a boss who's name is satan when spelled backwards. LIke the last game you are sent to Mars. This time you are working for the Solaris corporation in an alternate cold war era as the minerals have almost run out on Earth. Within the first year of business, connection with Earth was lost after it was sabatoged by rouge miners. The story progresses as you dig deeper with fully voice acted transmissions. I can't say much from here because I don't want to spoil it.\nGraphics:\nDon't be turned off at the fact that this game is 2d. The artwork is beautiful and full of color. Also at 1080p and at 60 fps! Also, Mars is actually red this time!\nAnything bad?\nThere aren't to many issues. There arent really any that get in the way of gameplay. First I felt that it was confusing to try and start new games and switch characters but mabye that was just me. Second, I had issue's with the key configurations. I wanted to swith movement to WASD. Everytime when I would open the game again, the keys would'nt save. It was a bit annoying to keep switching everytime I would start. When It comes to the game, I just felt like the game progressed a bit to fast. I also felt some upgrades were insanely expensive. But thats pretty much it.\nFinal thoughts.\nXgen did a very good job at the sequel. It improves in so many ways and has so much more meaning. It's very well suiting for their console launch. I doesn't hurt to buy this game, it's worth it\n9.5/10","March 13, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Progressing in the game is very satisfying and the game itself is very fun.\n\nThe addition of local co-op was fantastic. Being able to dig twice as fast and all. This is only local, however. Online multiplayer, especially in this day and age, is a must. If you’re going to include local, online should be included as well. Although I do appreciate the addition of local co-op (very few games seem to have it these days), it’s unacceptable to ship a game with only that.\n\nThe gameplay itself is very good, mostly due to the immense amount of focus placed on your progression through the game. It became rather addicting, wanting to upgrade that little cart with everything available, and that’s a good thing. Aside from the game’s progression, the gameplay is very simple. Just dig in the ground for ores and other goodies (like fossils!) to get money and upgrade your cart with that money. You’re also able to purchase explosives and other fun tools to help you dig further.\n\nOverall, Super Motherload is a fantastic game. With its great sense of progression, simple gameplay, and charming graphics, it definitely earns my recommendation.","April 7, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game however, leaves alot to be desired.\n\nLet's start with the positives. Graphicly, this game is a big step-up from it's older flash cousin. It has a smooth and clean look that suits it well.The voice acting is not gonna win anyone an award or anything, but is professionally done.\n\nAs for the negatives... Oh boy. This game does a astonishingly bad job at explaning the properties of the different obstacles you encounter. An example: early on you will encounter "X" blocks. The game tells you to build a plasma bomb to get rid of them.. ok? So how do I build it? Sure, you could google that sh!t, but I feel like the average user can't be asked, myself included.\n\nThe consumables shop is gone, so you're forced to salvage the upper layers in order to progress, which I found to be extremely tedious. The shop lacks any kind of tooltip to indicate how much different upgrades help you.\n\nI bought this game hoping for Motherless 2.0, but got the 0.5 instead. if you're looking for the same I advice you to continue looking (or just play the original game)\n","February 24","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Not demanding, an integrated gpu should do well.\n-Bugfree so far.\n-It comes with the gold edition of the original flash game! (there's a free version and this is the otherwise paid one)\n\nCons:\n\n-Flying upwards back to base seems a bit twearky for me, as I take quite some\n-Upgrades & items do not have icons like the original did.\n-Some underground structures and formations seem too artificial and out of place. I prefer the more "natural" underground.\n-Random explosive gas pockets are gone. (I liked the danger they brought)\n-When flying (up) back to base, I often have a hard time no taking hull damage...\n-Overpriced (I say this about most games though)\n\nConclusion:\nI would recomend you try the original flash game first (which is free) (just search for "motherload flash game").

So I'll just c/p my review for it.\n\n\n---\n\n\nThe best word to sum up SteamWorld Dig is "transparent".\n\nThe game loop consists entirely of going into the mine, collecting ore, going back up, selling it, buying +1 to your pick, and repeating. It is an extremely mindless and unchallenging way to spend 3 hours. It's not fun or interesting at any point.\n\nI get it. All games require some sort of loop to keep you playing it and keeping the feel consistent. But SteamWorld is, as I said, completely transparent. Nothing exciting or shocking happens, there are no interesting puzzles to solve, challenging monsters to battle, or interesting characters to talk to. There's nowhere to explore, and nowhere to go but deeper into the mine, where the gems are a new color and the numbers are bigger.\n\nIf, like me, you play this game to the end, you will hate it and yourself all the way through for being so obviously manipulated into dull, glassy-eyed complacency by a skinner box's "reward" of a bigger number next to your mining pick. Do yourself a favor and don't buy it - and if you have bought it, just say no.

A lot.\n\nIt's like they took Motherload, and made it super. I hope this is updated often, I'm definitely enjoying it more than I anticipated! The game is very simple and has a solid art style, for the most part it feels solid and extremely high quality. Some things are either broken or I'm not understanding (blue science cubes not breaking? not sure what to do about them, apparently nothing). The feeling of Motherload is still there and doesn't miss a beat, this expands on the concept and takes it much further than I expected. I like ittt.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you were into Motherload, this is not a disappointment.\n\nIf you haven't played the original 'Motherload' browser game, it's free and basically the same concept. One of the greatest flash games of the generation if you like hottness.\n\nhttp://www.xgenstudios.com/play/motherload","March 24, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Super Motherload is the sequel to Motherload, a flash browser game made in the early 2000's. Though there has been minor refinement to some of the original title's systems, the gameplay at the core of Super Motherload is largely the same. You're the pilot of an underground/aireal digging machine and you've been tasked to aid the Solaris Corporation in excavating the planet Mars for precious metals, gemstones, and other rarities.\n\nThe sequel has allowed for up to 4 players on screen simultaneously, and the result is a much more chaotic session of play. The soundtrack is lovely, having an industrial techno feel to it. The story is interesting as it deals with something many people today deal with themselves; corporate greed, and how it leads to ruin. There are multiple characters, even some hidden unlockable characters to discover. There are two modes in Super Motherload as well: Normal and Hardcore mode. Fans of the original flash game will find all the challenge they've become accustomed to in Hardcore mode, where your ship will immediately explode in a firey deathstorm, should your fuel ever reach 0.\n\nMy girlfriend and I love to kick back after an exciting day and chill out underground with Super Motherload.\n\n8/10 would dig again.","December 5, 2014","true","24.1"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

[minor spoiler alert - very subtle reference is used.]\n\nWow. I strongly recommend this game! I love the graphics. The story is interesting and the new elements such as bombs make this game really good. When you start out everything is easy and you can just mine away but as you reach lower levels making sure you know where to place bombs is very important. The story can be confusing, but i like it. They could have added some gameplay tips, but you can find everything you need in the menu. I had to discover that myself and i first found out late into the game. I have yet to complete it because the boss is quite hard. Theres a multiple choice ending (all i will say to not destroy any of the story for you).\n\nIf you want a good solid and addicting game. This is the game for you. If you have played miniclips famous Motherload game, then it will bring back a lot of memorys.

[minor spoiler alert - very subtle reference is used.]\n\nWow. I strongly recommend this game! I love the graphics. The story is interesting and the new elements such as bombs make this game really good. When you start out everything is easy and you can just mine away but as you reach lower levels making sure you know where to place bombs is very important. The story can be confusing, but i like it. They could have added some gameplay tips, but you can find everything you need in the menu. I had to discover that myself and i first found out late into the game. I have yet to complete it because the boss is quite hard. Theres a multiple choice ending (all i will say to not destroy any of the story for you).\n\nIf you want a good solid and addicting game. This is the game for you. If you have played miniclips famous Motherload game, then it will bring back a lot of memorys.

For fans of the original Motherload, there's a Hardcore mode where the original death penalty for running out of fuel is still imposed. If you're expecting that, the game might seem easy to you; for example, in normal mode there's no need for teleportation to the surface beyond convienence rather than the thing that will save your life.\nThe smelting feature adds a layer of complexity to my mining, as do the puzzles. Minding my order and making sure to leave space to pick up ore in the correct sequence to make new compounds does make the mining more interesting and less of a slog than it was in the flash game.\nMy only real complaint thus far is the apparent lack of an inventory screen. I would like to see what ore I've collected, what upgrades I've outfitted my vessel with, and what quantifiable difference the upgrade made (I particularly miss the measurement of the cargo bay. I'd prefer the game tell me how big my new cargo bay is rather than me trying to count how many pieces of ore I've collected until I hit 'Cargo Bay Full'). I would especially like some sort of reminder of what was the last piece of ore I collected.  For example, say I'm trying to make White Gold. If I forget whether I've picked up the bronze or just the silver, then I won't know whether I should go grab that piece of gold or now. Or, suppose you have a diamond sitting in there that you've forgotten about, and you pick an emerald to collect before an amazonite. Now you have a much-less-valuable green diamond instead of the blue diamond you could have had.","May 5, 2015","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You "explor" the inner from Mars by digging your way into it. By getting stuff like gems and ores, you can Level up/ upgrate your Digger like more Full or can store more gems and stuff like. Its nicely made and the only (more or less) enemy is how greedy you are coz you only can DIG left, right and down and NOT up. Of course you can go back up coz your lil digger has helicopter wings too, so no problem to fly back and go back digging.\n\nBut what IS the problem about the game feel...."lush"?\nIm honest, i only played it single player and had a good time with it but it feels like i just digged around like an idiot, searching the best ores and gems and...well...thats pretty much it. Good 2/3 of the game you just dig around till youre close to the middle of the Planet Mars, where anyhow the fun ended. Suddendly a lot really bugging things blocking your way like magma- and steelblocks you cant pass or only do by taking a huge % of dmg. the next problem is that I had to srs go back and clear up the sh*t i stored with my digger coz even a full upgrated store-place let you only carry 50 ores at the same time - and at the end you srs NEED to store more.\n\n"Why that?" you may ask, "arent 50 gems/ores not enough?" Hehehehe - NO. There we come to the last 1/3 of the game, grinding. At the end it gives, and it is the ONLY one (ok lik ein the original but still), a END-Boss whom you need to deal dmg too. The problem is the whole game is about "digging" so it gives absolutly NO REAL weapon in this game (which makes it still weird looking for me if you see this "Boss fight" comming~). So what you have to do? The only way (as much as i know) is to "bomb" the sh*t out of the Boss and how you do that? With Bombs of course. So the problem is that you more or less need HUGE bombs which COSTS more of course - so where the grinding begins - and it sucks at the end coz of those magma sh*it and what not which bugs and blocks ALL possible ways. And it also slows the game a lot more down at the end: Where you simply can dig around the first areas you get pretty slower keeping forward at the end places where those stuff srs just bug you and you only get the GOOD stuff down there coz you need it to effort the high prices of the bombs.\n\nGot that?\n\nAs i said i played ONLY the Singleplayer so i guess with at least 1-3 Friends it makes maaaaaaybe a bit more fun, sadly its ONLY LOCEL MULTIPLAYER, which means a Online-Multiplayer would be more fun at all (or at least handy~) but thinking about that we just "dig and grind" around...i guess after some minutes me and my friends would stop playing it...\n\nAND if i see it really GIVES a achievment that you CAN finish it in less than a Hour it makes it even more worse looking that Super Motherload has such a high price from 15€.\n\nSo if i come to the facts\n\nIts just...digging and grinding.....and that for 15€? I mean even Terraria has not that high price and i can BUILD something there and digging....and...grinding...you know  (i DONT compair the games just in case someone would think so)? So i would coment to lower the price (like 8€ maybe) to get a fair deal out of it, you should really think twice about to buy it full price, really coz i guess you may play it ones and if youre done, you ARE done with it...","July 21, 2015","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The original Motherload held it up with the character progression elements and the story, such as it was anyway. The need to upgrade your capsule kept you mining, and the curiousity as to just what the heck is going on keeps you interested.\n\nSuper Motherload doesn't have that. The character progression is there, but it doesn't feel as satisfying; it's too fast, too easy, and upgrading your engine or your drill no longer feels like an accomplishment, nor does it feel satisfying when you actually get the upgrades. In the original each and every upgrade made you feel like you were riding a substantially more powerful mining machine, digging twice as fast or staying under twice as long - but in Super Motherload I'm not sure what the effects of the upgrades even are!\n\nI honestly think the UI streamlining detracted from the experience; in the original, going through the motions of refueling, repairing, restocking, and finally checking the upgrade vendor to see what you can afford made returning from the pit each time feel a little bit refreshing, a "yes! I made it!" experience and a breath before you go back to the main gameplay - which is, after all, literally nothing but grinding (well, drilling, but that's close enough). In Super Motherload you literally just swing past the dropoff, fuel, and repair vendors and then it's right back into the pit with you, feeling less like an accomplishment and a break from grinding and more like a pointless "do you wish to not lose the game" prompt that comes up every five minutes. The fact that the resource indicators are less obvious and harder to read, and there's no audiovisual cue that you're about to run out of fuel doesn't help either.\n\nThe story in the original definitely isn't going to win any Pulitzers, but it was simple, clear, and served its purpose. You're a miner on Mars. You dig for a bit, your boss occasionally congratulating you on your successes, and then you pick up a transmission from another miner just like yourself, except he's trapped deep underground, and there's something there with him... followed by your boss telling you that it was probably just a radio glitch. Things progress pretty predictably from there (did I mention your boss's name is "Natas"? Yeah...), but it's an interesting enough mystery to keep you engaged, and there's a clear situation (you're a miner on mars and your employer is Up To Something) and a clear goal (find out what he's Up To, or else you might well be next!).\n\nSuper Motherload may have that eventually, but not in the amount I played. Instead you first get a few minutes of a robot literally just text-dumping you the game's instructions (which can never be called up again, of course) and then as you dig you intercept a message from some underground base that their life support has been sabotaged, demanding your employer send help. Maybe I screwed up or something but there doesn't seem to be a way to get to them and help them - the message is literally pointless to you. And then you get a call from another base telling you "base xyz isn't a ___, it's a laboratory, they're experimenting on us!" "They" is presumably the company you work for but... so? The player character can't do anything about it, no-one's asking them to do anything, and there's really no mystery; the company is doing evil ♥♥♥♥, okay, yeah, so what do I do? Apparently nothing. So the story is more annoying than compelling.\n\nI wanted to like this game; had good memories of the original. But the new additions add nothing of value and ultimately, all the good parts are the ones copied over from the original Motherload, except oftentimes not even as good. Super Motherload has little to no redeeming value; go play the original, it's better and it's free, or indeed any of XGen's old Flash games.\n","July 25, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wish you could actually see the parts that you could upgrade like in the old game, or that the parts would impact the look of the ship. Upgrading isn't quit as fun because of this. This game also needed some element of danger like with the earthquakes of the original game.\n\nPuzzles were okay, but some of them really needed better/more interesting rewards for the amount of resources/effort you might put in solving them. Sometimes you might barely break even on the profit, which is really the main goal of the puzzles since the solutions of the puzzles are always obvious. I might even have taken a loss on a few puzzles.\n\nThe smelter was alittle too cheap with the value of smelted ore. Expecially considering you have to get 2 in a row to get a smelted object which might mean avoiding other sources of income to get the combo. I'd say the value of the smelted ore need to be 50 percent more and they should have given you 2 bombs for every smelted ore combo.\n\nArtstyle was nice. Soundtrack was very good and is easily the best part of the game.\n\nThe boss at the end was kind of cheap. You have to fly all the way from the bottom to the top through a tunnel he makes, and fight him at 3 chokepoints while you do it. The screen moves very quickly and the boss can sometimes troll you and make an unexpected turn and if you hit a wall once it is very difficult to recover. If you die at any point, you have to start all over.  It's very easy to mess up. They should have made it only 2 chokepoints, one at the bottom, one at the very top. Especially since you have to fight him over and over again if you want other endings.\n\nPretty much no post-game content that I can remember, so no reason to continue mining once you get a couple endings.\n\nWorth trying it out if it's on sale anyway, especially if you haven't played the original game.\n\n3.25/5","March 21","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep that in mind for this review.\n\nNo, I don't think it was worth $15. I bought it when it was about $3.99, and I still feel like that was cheating the developers, but I wouldn't have paid $15 for this.\n\nI noticed a lot of people were not happy with this game, and for some reasons, I can see why: the minimap is really tiny, especially when playing on a big screen. Sometimes blocks just float a little strangely, don't break in the right way. The controls sometimes get a little soggy feeling on the keyboard (so it's worth shelling out for a controller!), which can lead to some enraging drops, and upgrades process doesn't really keep you updated on what you've actually bought, and what that does. Some of the explosives challenges are annoying, and can lead to some aggravating situations (That one unobtainium up on the top edge! Damn it!)\n\nBut. For a game that brings back my memories of the original Motherload (which is included in buying this, by the way!), I couldn't think of anything better. A beautiful world, spectacular design, a great update to the filling/selling/upgrading process (just... driving over the buildings? Holy cow!), the checkpoints and bases system, the smelting/combining system, which totally revitalised my joy of mining... the list goes on. The music is amazing, though I wish I could have had that original jam updated... could have listened to that on repeat for days! The replay value is... okay. For some, getting to the end is all they wanted. For  me , the replay value was through the roof: I could drag a few friends over, throw the game up on the TV, and have a hysterical time. I could put it on my laptop and kill some time mining instead of writing press releases. I could put it on my screen in my room, and play it before going to bed. I enjoy mining way too much. I have issues.\n\nSo it's a good purchase. Play it with your friends. Play it by yourself. Go mining.","December 23, 2015","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all the start of the game is rather overwhelming in that there's so many blocks at once, which of many can't be destroyed which is very annoying (in a larger extent than the original). Furthermore  the upgrade screen is a major downstep as you can't skip upgrades or see the numbers to an upgrade (I want to know how many litres different tanks hold, how fast different drill speeds are etc). There's also no way (at least I found none) to open your inventory to overlook what you're carrying and also to drop certain ores. You take much more damage from crashing in Super Motherload than in the original, and it really is annoying to have to micromanage every foot you travel, both going down AND up.\n\nThere are some quests and the first half of the game is decent gameplay this way, although the Quest-boxes being invulnerable initially (as in before you knew what they were) was yet another confusing element. As you approach the end game you come to the realization that there really aren't many high end resources available as you'd expect when you go really deep, and even to the end the world is dominated by mid-tier resources.\n\nAnd then you decide to go all the way down there anyways despite being unable to farm enough to max out all your upgrades. You have no idea what the boss is going to do and perhaps die a few times (it will one-shot you in phase 2 as well). You respawn at the station, which means you're in for 5 minutes or so of really boring travel just to have another go at it.\n\nIn sumary, the game it really does feel underwhelming in terms of content, as the asking price is 14.99€. The quests were decent, but there's only three of them! The game should definitely be at least twice as long. There defeinitely could be much more imaginative upgrades available late game; being able to drill through different kinds of previously invulnerable materials for example. There should be more kinds of ores and generic (fuel, drill speed etc) upgrades available.\n\nAt least you don't have to deal with the earthquakes from the original in this one, but the original still reigns supreme by far in comparison because of the reasons above, and because it's free.","August 18, 2015","false","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/schilcote/recommended/269110/","schilcote","Schilcote","http://steamcommunity.com/id/schilcote/","122 products in account","Keep in mind I didn't play very deep into this game; it didn't grab me at all, so maybe some of my critiques become invalid further into the game.\n\nMotherload's main mechanic really isn't all that terribly interesting -  it's not *bad*, but it's not good enough to hold up the experience on its own. The original Motherload held it up with the character progression elements and the story, such as it was anyway. The need to upgrade your capsule kept you mining, and the curiousity as to just what the heck is going on keeps you interested.\n\nSuper Motherload doesn't have that. The character progression is there, but it doesn't feel as satisfying; it's too fast, too easy, and upgrading your engine or your drill no longer feels like an accomplishment, nor does it feel satisfying when you actually get the upgrades. In the original each and every upgrade made you feel like you were riding a substantially more powerful mining machine, digging twice as fast or staying under twice as long - but in Super Motherload I'm not sure what the effects of the upgrades even are!\n\nI honestly think the UI streamlining detracted from the experience; in the original, going through the motions of refueling, repairing, restocking, and finally checking the upgrade vendor to see what you can afford made returning from the pit each time feel a little bit refreshing, a "yes! I made it!" experience and a breath before you go back to the main gameplay - which is, after all, literally nothing but grinding (well, drilling, but that's close enough). In Super Motherload you literally just swing past the dropoff, fuel, and repair vendors and then it's right back into the pit with you, feeling less like an accomplishment and a break from grinding and more like a pointless "do you wish to not lose the game" prompt that comes up every five minutes. The fact that the resource indicators are less obvious and harder to read, and there's no audiovisual cue that you're about to run out of fuel doesn't help either.\n\nThe story in the original definitely isn't going to win any Pulitzers, but it was simple, clear, and served its purpose. You're a miner on Mars. You dig for a bit, your boss occasionally congratulating you on your successes, and then you pick up a transmission from another miner just like yourself, except he's trapped deep underground, and there's something there with him... followed by your boss telling you that it was probably just a radio glitch. Things progress pretty predictably from there (did I mention your boss's name is "Natas"? Yeah...), but it's an interesting enough mystery to keep you engaged, and there's a clear situation (you're a miner on mars and your employer is Up To Something) and a clear goal (find out what he's Up To, or else you might well be next!).\n\nSuper Motherload may have that eventually, but not in the amount I played. Instead you first get a few minutes of a robot literally just text-dumping you the game's instructions (which can never be called up again, of course) and then as you dig you intercept a message from some underground base that their life support has been sabotaged, demanding your employer send help. Maybe I screwed up or something but there doesn't seem to be a way to get to them and help them - the message is literally pointless to you. And then you get a call from another base telling you "base xyz isn't a ___, it's a laboratory, they're experimenting on us!" "They" is presumably the company you work for but... so? The player character can't do anything about it, no-one's asking them to do anything, and there's really no mystery; the company is doing evil ♥♥♥♥, okay, yeah, so what do I do? Apparently nothing. So the story is more annoying than compelling.\n\nI wanted to like this game; had good memories of the original. But the new additions add nothing of value and ultimately, all the good parts are the ones copied over from the original Motherload, except oftentimes not even as good. Super Motherload has little to no redeeming value; go play the original, it's better and it's free, or indeed any of XGen's old Flash games.\n","July 25, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You spend your funds on upgrades that allow you to go deeper and deeper, receiving cryptic transmissions along the way - eventually reaching the center of Mars.\n\nThat might sound boring but this game does a pretty good job of keeping it fresh. Soon you will encounter rocks that block your way, find upgrades that reward you for picking up specific minerals in order, and lava that you can drill through at the cost of a good portion of your health. Soon, the game becomes a puzzle, trying to figure out the most efficient way to drill in order to reach the valuables.\n\nIf you want a basic idea of how this game works, look up Motherload. It's an old (free) browser game this one was based on.\n\nPresentation\nThis game's presentation is fantastic, featuring a powerful and atmospheric soundtrack by Eric Cheng and beautiful art by Scott Carmichael. Despite being a simple digging game there is crazy amounts of atmosphere.\n\nThe voice acting ranges from "good but weird" to "unintentionally hilarious". It can break immersion but usually it's not a problem.\n\nHardcore mode\nRegular mode is fun for a while but it gets boring when there's no consequence of being stupid. Enter Hardcore mode. Hardcore mode is not for giggles with your buddies.\nIf you die, that character is dead forever. You'll need to start a new save to use that particular character.\nIf you run out of fuel, you die. Also, all players in the session share fuel so die, die, die, and die.\n\nI love it.\n\nThe story\nIt's pretty good. It's not absolutely captivating, but it's... reasonably compelling. You are an employee of Solarus corporation, mining into Mars. As you drill deeper and deeper you hear strange transmissions from the other miners and discover that something's gone wrong - and that's not Solarus talking to you.\n\nOverall\nIt's a good game. It isn't fun in the same sense that some games are, but it's absolutely worth playing. Again, if you're on the fence, look up the original Motherload.","April 28","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/racemaster7/recommended/269110/","racemaster7","Racemaster7","http://steamcommunity.com/id/racemaster7/","63 products in account","Motherload/Goldium Edition\nI'm a longtime fan of the original, just like many of the people posting reviews here. While I admit this version of the game is a pale shadow of the original, but it still can be fun. You have to remember that back when the original first came out and I was playing it flash games were in the golden years. It was everything a game needed to be:\nFree\nSimple\nAddictingEventually they did release a "premium" version of the game called "Goldium Edition" which at the time I didn't think added enough value to consider the purchase. (I think it was like $7 USD). You have to remember this was back in the pre Steam pre Smartphone age where most kids got "allowances."\n\nMotherload did have a shelf life though, so despite how amazingly fun it was you could only play it through a couple times before it did get boring, despite how satisfying that BZZZT drilling sound was. It was one of those games you remembered and thought back on "Oh yeah that was a great game" and then went on with your day. Memorable but not so much that you went to go pick it up again you know what I mean?\n\n\nSuper Motherload\nTo be honest I didn't even know this game existed until it showed up as a featured sale item. I did not purchase this game at full price and honestly I can't recommend anyone to do so. This version really only waters down the original and while the new powers are interesting the fact that the map is the same everytime means you will never be able to afford them. All the characters with unique abilities are also neat, but don't add enough to the game to make you want to try them all.\n\nWhile I understand the want to add a "story" to the game I feel that Motherload really didn't need it. I think it stems more from the fact they couldn't leave the final boss as SATAN HIMSELF due to obvious reasons. Thus they had to find a "new" final boss and therefore had to create a story to explain it all. Personally I think THE LITERAL DEVIL hanging out on Mars and exploiting humans for profit was pretty amazing. But keep in mind the original was made before "PC culture" even existed so they could get away with that. Big Bird with a pirate hat does not cut it in my book.\n\nAlso on a side note: While I did enjoy the final boss fight I feel that it should have had a sequence at the core before the surface race began. You two duke it out and then have to escape the rising magma and the destruction of the planet is due to your climatic battle for the planet. The whole Death Star laser was just in bad taste I think.\n\n\nIN CLOSING\n\nPROS\nDecent voice acting\nFun special abilities\nCo-op\nStill addicting gameplay\nInteresting final boss\nCONS\nProgression is much more streamlined and oversimplified\nUpgrades cost WAY too much\nThe map is the same every time. No random generating\nStory is uninteresting\nInsane volumes of the same 2 hazards = "difficulty"\nNot worth it for full price.\nGet it on sale and its a great purchase. Besides it comes with the Goldium Edition of the original so if you hate the new one you can live it up with the classic.\n\n**Edits for typos I missed","May 26","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
