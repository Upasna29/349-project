Then the credits started rolling. Look up 'disappointing' in the dictionary and it probably shows the title of this game.\nAnd it was pretty good actually. Possessing objects and interacting with them is fun. Especially if you can scare a bunch of people at the same time. The animations and designs are just excellent, by the way.\nAnd sure, the controls for possessing objects could've been much better (a mouse would've worked better, or a 'snap-to' system), and the UI could've been more intuitive but the game was fun for as long as it lasted.\nStill, some extra levels couldn't have hurt the game, they could've even improved it a bit.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","June 9, 2014","true","1.7"," 98 of 120 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","98","120","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/backyoudirtyape/recommended/270630/","backyoudirtyape","Bulbasaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/backyoudirtyape/","235 products in account","Haunt the House: Terrortown  is a charming side-scrolling game, in which you play as a mischievous little ghost. When the night falls, you float from your home in an old clocktower and start wandering around the town, scaring people to death. You can possess objects and interact with them, making townfolks running away terrified.\nThe game has colorful and cartoony graphics that really stand out. Each playable ghost has its own style and signature howling.\nThe soundtrack is fitting and catchy, I really love the North Pole theme.\nThe game includes achievements, and some of them are actually kind of challenging: after many attempts, I still miss a couple of them (those people just won't jump from the window!).\n\nI fell in love with this game at first sight and just bought it without thinking about it twice. It was during its launch week, around a year ago. The game was pretty short back then (there was only the Terror Town level) yet it was so cute I didn't regret my impulse purchase. During the past months the developers have added a tutorial and three more levels for free (Mansion House, Ghost Train and North Pole) including new achievements and new cute ghosts aswell (by the way, the stuck-out tongue ghost is totally my favorite). I'm impressed by the great work they did.\nAs a huge indie game supporter I'm really glad when I find cute little gems like Haunt the House, so I totally recommend this game even at its full price (but it has been on sale during the year on several occasions, so you can actually get it at a lower price).","November 30, 2015","true","10.4"," 37 of 38 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","37","38","2","0"

Very impressed that everything has its own animation and can be interacted with. Being a ghost and scaring people out is a creative concept and leads to a lot of laughs. There is always something new to discover. The art style is full of love and character.\n\nCONS: The game itself is pretty short. Achievements are finicky, some are simply not working, or have to be jarred by messing with the menu options. AI can act a little wonky, especially if you've been messing with them for a long time, (as you would when trying to get certain achievements.) Not much of a challenge, otherwise.\n\nOVERALL: An extremely cute, family-friendly game that is a safe bet gift-wise around Halloween especially.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/recommended/270630/","dsp21","[J7] Dsp21","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsp21/","350 products in account","A very casual and really unknown game this is. I stumbled upon it on the Halloween Sale and it looked like it could be fun. There's little to no story, and that's good when looking at a simple game like this. In Haunt the House: Terrortown you play as ghosts who possess objects in order to scare people. Your objective is to empty the buildings, by making people leave, or actually making them jump out the windows. You have a meter which indicates the atmosphere of the situation and it goes up by scaring people. While it is going up, you unlock more actions (up to 3) in each object to cause a bigger scare and actually make everyone run for their lives!\n\nSee? Simple as that, but the overall look of the game makes it so appealing for me because of how contradicting it is. Contradicting because you have this really cute ghost, who basically wants to scare everyone away :D\n\nThe game lasts a mere 5 hours, maybe 7-8 for completionists, but rather than that it's a bit short. It seems that new levels are added once in a while though, and that's great. For 5 euro, it's definitely worth a buy if you're in doubt to get it, the casual and cute-looking "horror" game definitely deserves a bit more fame, hence my spooky review! 7/10","February 1","true","8.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/270630/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Haunt the House: Terrortown is in essence a game about playing the man behind the haunted house curtain. As a lonely ghost (or so I would assume, given the story centers around reclaiming the souls of others so as to collect a band of ghost friends...or something like that) it's your job to float around and posses objects to scare the living daylights out of party goers until they either abandon ship (sometimes literally) or out of stubbornness end up dead at your ghostly hands.\n\nThe problem I have with HtH is that there really isn't enough - it - here. It's mechanics are incredibly shallow and inconsistent, largely boiling down to spamming random scares until the person you are scaring finally gets the idea and fleas the scene, which doesn't really give you much of anything to work with. It never feels like you have any real control over anything, as people will run any which way they want often irregardless of how scared they are or where the source of their terror is. It makes actually getting anyone out of the house (or wherever you might happen to be) rather tedious and uninteresting, like you're shooing flies with a newspaper, occasionally lucking out and hitting one.\n\nI guess it's somewhat a blessing then that the game is completable in under 30 minutes, as any longer and I'd likely have dropped it out of boredom, but that then falls back into the issue of there not being much of anything here. It feels like a free game fancied up into something that might resemble a fuller experience, which is pretty much exactly what Terrortown is: a slightly larger version of the original Haunt the House flash game, which more than likely lasts as long as you would want to spend with the game, and is far easier to recommend being that it's still freely available.","October 3, 2014","false","0.9"," 40 of 64 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","40","64","0","3"

Back then, I was charmed by the creativity that was shown with the concept, one I had not encountered previously, and as such it made the game stand out. Years later, I found it on steam, and played it again, hesitant to see if it stood the test of time. I was pleased however to discover that it more than stands up against it, in fact it shoos it away.\n\nPros:\n- Fun, easy gameplay\n- Cute soundtrack and noises\n- Scaring the ♥♥♥♥♥ out of people with a teddy bear you haunted\n\nCons:\nThe only downside that comes to mind is the fact that the game is much more suited towards left handed players than right. Traditionally, games use the wsad key map for movement, and leave the directional keys alone. As such it's almost an industry standard. However this game uses the wsad keys for interaction purposes, and the directional keys are used for movement.\n\nAside from that, its a charming game that's worth the purchase!","January 5","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I saw this on sale and really just couldn't resist. It has the same flaws as the flash game does when it comes to trying to get the "Spice of Life" achievement (which entails using every spook action on every item). In both versions of the game I really wish there was some tracker just to let you know what you still have left, even if it was a simple counter saying "x actions left." I swear I went through every room in all four buildings (and the holiday expantion) and did every action on every item, but I guess I must have missed something somewhere... Doesn't take away any of the fun away from the core game though.\n\nIt is also a very short game, running really about an hour at most, though trying to get the achievements can certainly push that a little bit further. But if you're looking for a cute little Halloween themed game to pass a little time, I totally recommend playing the game.\n","June 7, 2015","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a fun, if short game. You float around as a ghost and posess diffrent items to scare people, and depending on how spooky the house is at the moment, you can do diffrent things. Some of the spooky actions you can do are actually a little creepy (like the spector strapped to a gurny) while others are silly (like making the dino moonwalk). It's a really fun game.\n\nBut it is VERY short.\n\nI wish it was at least a little longer (it's only 4 levels plus one DLC Christmas themed level), or that, at least, the various ghosts saved between playthroughs so I didn't have to unlock my faves each time. However, it being so short does make it something I can play for a half hour to a hour and be done with it, without worrying about being pulled into a long thing. I'll play it for a little bit while waiting for, say, stuff to be done cooking becasue it's pretty fun way to kill some time.\n\nI'm not sure if I can fully reccomend the game for full price, but I got it on sale for half price and feel that was a fair price for it.","June 22, 2015","true","3.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While it is true the main map can be completed in under an hour, people that do that miss out on the humor and the strategy of the game.  Besides, not every game has to be some 40-50 hour epic.  For me, this game is perfect for those times when I don't have a lot of time to play and want something fun I can complete in one sitting.\n\nTerrortown is quite simply a cute little game that features a lonely little ghost searching for what was lost.  It's also one of those rare games that the whole family can play and laugh at.  The developers have also added extra levels at no charge (the new train level is a blast), and continue to support the game in an effort to make it better than before.

You play as a ghost who needs to scare people out of various places by possessing objects with your soul and performing various actions. If you want to get sort of a taste of what this game is like, you can play "Haunt the House" on a flash gaming site like Armor Games. This has about five times the content, with the christmas update from the developers. I think the audiovisual combination creates a world that you'll remain fond of even after finishing the game :)","February 17, 2015","true","3.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Nothing much different aside from an improved atmopshere. As people say it is short but right now you can get it for less than 3 dollars and that's the price of a candy bar or something.

The whole concept is interesting. For once you're not hunting ghosts or running away from 'em, you ARE the ghost and you're out to scare the hell out of everyone. Very nice game in general.\n\nThe major downside has got to be the content. There's like 3 places (if not mistaken) where you can have fun before the game ends. Took me about 30 minutes to finish it on the first ghost (yeah you unlock more later on). If this game has more content it would be a really great game. Perhaps with some variations instead of pulling the same routine on more different places. Challenge mode and story perhaps.\n\nSo I'm conflicted, to recommend or not to recommend. I'm going to go for yes. This game deserve to be known (although pewdiepie covered it I'm pretty sure he got the message through). More people should buy this game, support the developers and perhaps if they hear our woes they'd make it better for everyone!","June 12, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I generally bounce between casual puzzle, indie, and dark horror games so I figured this would be a great all-in-one package for that. The art and animation are absolutely beautiful. The gameplay is easygoing and fun, though I'll admit the "button-mashing" feel  gets a little old by the third or fourth level. Honestly since the controls are so simple and the death elements are fairly tame and comical, I'd say this game would be excellently challenging for children around ten or so (at parents' discretion, of course).\nYes, it's super short. Like everyone else I'd love for the game to be longer, or updated with more levels, but even for the price it's a really fun and high quality game.

Great graphics! Love the cartoony look. This is just as much of a toy as a game, and I love to break it out and play a level or two when I need a laugh. Rather than puzzle solving, this game concentrates on exploration and escalation: you need to roam around your environment, continuously scaring people and pets, until the terror meter gets high enough that everyones abandons the location.  There's a genuine sense of mischief, and while it might not be suitable for a hardcore gamer, casual gamers and kids will have lots of fun with this!\n\nThe reviewer who said there was a monthly fee is completely and absolutely wrong about that.

Afterwards, you can play as their ghosts and listen to their various undead calls (for example, the chef has an evil French laugh).\n\nHowever, I do have a problem with the game. It's a small one, but it seems that the AI of the people intruding your home becomes worse when there's less of them. For example, on one of the levels I cleared out a majority of the people, with only two left. These two people took 15 minutes to get rid of, despite the fact that they screamed for most of the time.\n\nBut like I said, it's a small problem that I might be subconciously exaggerating and is definitely worth the price.","December 31, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Even if you take your time and fool around, you're going to be done in less than an hour.\n\nThat being said, there's definitely replay value in trying to clear achievements, figure out the "secret goal" they hint at in the description, and improve your score. You can try playing with all the different spooks. The art and music are really cute and engaging, too.\n\nThe game definitely has a sense of humor. In the museum, for example, when your spook level is maxed, try posessing the "Eskimo" statue and then choose "Bend." I laughed.\n\nAll in all, it's short but I still feel it's great value for $4.99 and I heartily recommend!","July 3, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The whole concept is interesting. For once you're not hunting ghosts or running away from 'em, you ARE the ghost and you're out to scare the hell out of everyone. Very nice game in general.\n\nThe major downside has got to be the content. There's like 3 places (if not mistaken) where you can have fun before the game ends. Took me about 30 minutes to finish it on the first ghost (yeah you unlock more later on). If this game has more content it would be a really great game. Perhaps with some variations instead of pulling the same routine on more different places. Challenge mode and story perhaps.\n\nSo I'm conflicted, to recommend or not to recommend. I'm going to go for yes. This game deserve to be known (although pewdiepie covered it I'm pretty sure he got the message through).

I generally bounce between casual puzzle, indie, and dark horror games so I figured this would be a great all-in-one package for that. The art and animation are absolutely beautiful. The gameplay is easygoing and fun, though I'll admit the "button-mashing" feel  gets a little old by the third or fourth level. Honestly since the controls are so simple and the death elements are fairly tame and comical, I'd say this game would be excellently challenging for children around ten or so (at parents' discretion, of course).\nYes, it's super short. Like everyone else I'd love for the game to be longer, or updated with more levels, but even for the price it's a really fun and high quality game.

It's not that it isn't cute or enjoyable, but there's not enough content to justify the price tag, even at $4.99. There's supposed replay value, but why would you go through the trouble of choosing the other ghosts when there's literally no difference between them? They don't have any different powers, so you're better off just sticking with the default ghost and playing through it once.\n\nTo me, there wasn't enough innovation here. The "hundreds of objects with different powers" get old fast, and not all objects are worth possessing. For instance, the little bottles only spray into the air and don't really scare anybody at all, so if a good portion of your objects don't do much, why would we bother seeking them out? Why not just go for the big ticket items? I could understand if they had interesting animations, but the little objects I'm talking about flat-out don't. I didn't see the big fuss there, and by the end of your first playthrough, it's likely you've possessed them all anyway.\n\nThis game might be good for kids who like repetition and don't mind replaying the exact same thing over and over again, but it could have been great for both kids and adults, and that's what bothers me most. It feels like we got 5% of a game for $5. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.","July 11, 2014","false","4.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The creators clearly had a lot of fun finding creative ways for you to "spook" people, as you possess different items, each with different scary abilities. The environments and character designs are really distinctive, too. In spite of how fast it goes, all the different item combinations -- as well as being able to play different ghosts you can unlock throughout the game -- allows for lots of replayability.","January 9, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, simplistic mechanics and the brevity of this game make it hard to recommend.

It can be a little frustrating at times because it is not clear how you can scare the remaining individuals out of the house. It's a game for little kids.

You'll finish the game in about half an hour and if the mechanisms of the game don't charm you you'll be tired of it before that.\nA lot of work has been but in the game, each object has its own effects and all, but it's not really enough to make you want to try them all. There are different ghosts you can unlock but they don't do anything different apart from slightly changing the sound you make when pressing S.\nThe controls are kind of unfinished too, mostly I expected controller or mouse support but there wasn't any. It's all done with the keyboard and in a kind of awkward way (you use S to confirm in the menus instead of Enter or space, and D to come back instead of escape).\n\nIf you want some bit of fun I recommend it but only if it doesn't bother you to put 5€ in it.

This'll give you a good idea of what you're in for; however, like others stated, the game takes MAYBE an hour to beat, and there aren't really any extras besides trading cards and achievements. I bought the game only because I absolutely love everything about this little game: the art design, scare tactics, animations, and especially the ghost.\n\nBasically, what you do is you possess things around the place you're trying to scare people out of. The terror meter raises every time you do something, and as people leave the house, you'll sort of have to chase people down and scare them personally. The AI can be a little stupid, so sometimes it requires a little patience. In addition, there are people who don't react to your scare tactics- you're supposed to kill them! They each have special ways to be killed.\n\nI personally liked the original game much more. The ways to scare people were better, but there were a few that captured my heart. So, I'll restate- it's probably not worth the money, but it's definitely fun.","June 29, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is simple yet satisfying, and just the right length.\n\nYou take on the role of a ghost, whose only goal is to go about the town scaring its poor denizens. After getting sufficiently spooked, they will abandon whatever place you're currently haunting, and your goal is to get everyone to flee all the buildings.\n\nAs a ghost, you can float around freely, and the movement is rather quick and elegant. It really is a joy to just fly around the environments as an adorable little poltergesit. To actually scare people, you haunt objects and then perform one of a number of different preset actions, which is just a cute animation that scares any citizens that observe it. For example, you might cause a rocking horse to start rocking back and forth on its own, a phone to start ringing, or a skeleton dinosaur to snap its jaw. There are also some that actually involve some ghost/entity appearing and doing something that would be genuinely creepy if this game weren't so darn cute. You unlock more interactions as the citizens get progressively more terrified. Nothing in this game is actually scary, of course. The art style is playful and cartoonish, and all the animations are adorable (and very smooth).\n\nBesides scaring the pants off everyone you can find, there are also some special inhabitants (a clown, a cook, a boat captain) who you are able to kill by solving very simple "puzzles" (really just special interactions with the environments). Once they are dead, their ghosts become available for you to use, although this doesn't change the gameplay. Still it's a nice addition. Who hasn't wanted to be a ghost clown? If only there was a pirate ghost available...\n\nThere are only four locations in the game - a hospital, a boat, a museum, and a theater. They are each unique from each other and all have some great animations to behold, but I found the museum and theater espeically fun (in the museum you can move around as a statue and attack people, and in the theater you can play instruments). Even if you want to see every animation the game has to offer, it can still be beaten in about an hour. You cannot die (you are already a ghost!) or lose in any way. Overall, the game is more like a toy than an actual game, but that's fine. It's a delightful toy, that please 21-year-old me just as much as it would have please 10-year-old me.","June 23, 2014","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "haunting" mechanic feels pretty fresh when you're playing it, and it's fun to go around the different locations spooking people.\n\nBut where the game really shines is in the fantastic art direction.  This game is a treat to look at, and the screenshots don't really do the game justice - almost every prop is able to be possessed by the ghost, and each one has multiple spooky animations to them, each of which felt unique and distinct.  In most games of this sort, you'd expect to have the same object placed multiple times and each instance would do the same thing, but not this game - each spooky animation felt individually crafted, so much of the game was just the fun of going arouond triggering spooky effects and watching people get scared and run away.\n\nOne word of warning is that the game involves killing some people instead of just scaring them.  This game appears to be pretty kid friendly from the art direction, and I was going to share this game with my kids until I realized that was one of the mechanics.  This could be a solid kids' game without that mechanic.  It also feels somewhat at odds with the more whimsical presentation of the game - spooking people away feels lighthearted and fun, and the ghost murdering people undercuts that vibe considerably.  Not everyone will care, but if you have kids, you might want to play through the game once before deciding whether to let them play.\n\nOther than that, though, this game is really fun and polished.  Well done, developers!  Thumbs up.","June 9, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls on the Steam PC version are slightly different, but not terribly so.\nThe Steam version is essentially a collection of minigames, with not a terrrible amount of variation, but enough that each is distinct. The goal is always the same: creep people out enough that they leave your residence.\nThe Mansion\nThe browser game is, essentially, the Mansion. It plays pretty much the same, and you play the cute little inverted teardrop "Oooooh" ghost. This one I occasionally will just let float off somewhere and press the possession button a few times just to hear it's cute little ghost noises. The moans don't seem to really affect people so much as actually possessing things and creeping folk out. Some things don't seem as effective at scaring in the Steam version, such as the hand-plates. In the browser version, claws breaking through wall-mounted plates would be enough to send people to jumping out the windows, but here it often is only mildly frightening, and is less likely to induce panic.\nThe Holidays/North Pole\nThe little ghost that inhabits this area has the sniffles, and will sneeze when possession button is pressed apart from objects. This area has fewer strict rooms, and has a general holiday vibe (if you hadn't guessed). It isn't that much different from the mansion in terms of environment, but it still definitely has some interesting things going on.\nTerrortown\nIn Terrortown iteself, you return to the "Ooooh" ghost...sort of. You start out in the bell tower and float around scaring people out of a total of four locations: a hospital, a museum, a cruise ship, and a theatre. You will find a total of nine people whom you cannot scare. These people you kill off, in essence, and once they are dead they will haunt the bells, and you can play as them instead of "Ooooh", though I am reasonably certain everything does the exact same things, so it's really more like if you want to be a nurse ghost, now's your chance.\nGhost train\nDespite the fact that this level features a CARNIVAL on a TRAIN, this is, I believe, the only level where you cannot cause someone to commit suicide. At least, no one did when I played it. The dynamics here are unique: there are three cars, featuring a haunted house, a carousel, and a fun house. Each car has a different atmosphere, but people can walk through all the cars. The goal is to get everyone off the fun house car at the back of the train, This is a bit different than previous levels, because in, say, Terrortown, people did not come back into a vacated house; they just left, and stayed out. Here, though, you could have someone get chased out of the haunted house, go all the way to the fun house, and wander back, screaming the whole way.\nOh yes, and that ghost is a steam-shaped poultergeist, dubbed, the "Nyaaaah" ghost.\n\nIn conclusion, if you want a basic idea of what this game is like before you buy it, play the browser version first; it's a nice little preview, and should give you a pretty good idea whether you'll like this or not.","January 6","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
