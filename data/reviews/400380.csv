I designed an actual turn based soccer game so when  I saw this I was interested.  I have played a few matches on various accounts and machines.  Here is what I do like:\n\nturn based.  ive always liked turn based.\ngraphics arent too bad\nits pretty simple to play\n\nheres what i dont like:\n\n- in spite of having options like headers, etc.  I still havent found a use for them.  this is basically a run dribble run shoot kinda game - and shooting is if you get lucky.\n-takes a long time to play.  If i was playing a season, id be dead before i ever finished.\n- player models are wonky and out dated\n- after a bit, the game play is kind of limited...you find yourself doing the same thing over and over again...\n\nwhat i might change (and perhaps this exists and i just havent found em yet):\n\n- maybe allow for two passes in some instances\n- designate movement zones for run and jog (which affects fatigue)\n- update the graphics some\n- update the mechanics a bit.  i just feel like they represent a game from 1991.\n\nanyway - i applaud the idea and the effort of the dev or devs.  i think its a brilliant idea and would love to see an updated version of something like this.\n\nthanks.  if this game continues to get updates, then i can recommend it.","January 28","true","2.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"
