Then this is a game for you.\n\nYou have to manage a way for your trucks across the map, while your competitors do the same.. all the while trying to sabotage your roadway and transports. Therefore are two main types of utilities you can use. One are the road types from normal road to bridge and tunnels, which your trucks use, while the others are destructive tools to sabotage your opponents, these range from dynamite, nails up to police controls, emp bombs, radar and much more.\n\nThe gameplay is made up to four players at one map, while it can already get quite hectic with only two players, while you try to keep the balance between sabotaging and guarding your own. While there are some single player maps (which the first 8 mainly work as a tutorial) the main game is the multiplayer part against other human opponents.\n\nConclusio:\nAs one game usually doesnt take too long, for a quick play against some friends this can be quite a fun distraction.\n\nNote: This game was reviewed with a key given by the developers\n","May 31, 2015","true","1.2"," 91 of 120 people (76%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","76","91","120","11","2"

When dealing with a strategy game, I tend to want more than that. So I can not say it is good at that.\nAs for competitive, don't bother. It does not have a lot of skill involved aside from who can build the fastest(Which in itself is a matter of being the fastest at clicking). There is very little here that would be competitive, or that would draw anyone wishing to be competitive. There are way better things out there.\nAddictive? Definitely not. Play it once, maybe twice. Third time with friends and then you´ve seen it all. There is nothing to come back for, and I would say it is severely lacking in replay value.\n\nAt least it is realtime, and with 4 players throwing explosives it is chaotic so you can at least count that as a plus if you enjoy that sort of thing. For the single player challenges, they do take some effort, though the 'humour' involed in it is certainly not my kind. You are essentially challenged by a bunch of stereotypes which eventually end up teaming up on you. And then it just sort of ends.\n\nDetour is a game that sounds good in theory, but just doesn't cut it in practice. Maybe it was a good idea on the idea board that just didn't get fleshed out right, maybe they just lacked the skill or knowledge to make it work. But either way I would recommend against buying Detour - Your time is more valuable than any sale price","July 9, 2015","false","2.3"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","29","32","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MyNameIsntZee/recommended/92100/","MyNameIsntZee","zazzle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MyNameIsntZee/","238 products in account","First of all, my original review "Why is this game real?" was read by Senpai Studios, so when the update came out, they told me. So, this is my real review, since the game was fixed and is now functional.\n\n5/10 - Functional, but boring. Not good enough to really be a positive review, but not horribly negative.\n\nOk, so the basic gameplay is building roads to get a truck across the map to the other side. At this point, this works well, and has no design flaws. The bridge is a bit confusing to use, and should have adjustable length, but that's just a minor quip. The dynamite and other explosives can be used to destroy the enemy's roads to prevent progress. The dynamite is quite a core part of gameplay, but the larger missile-thing can be used too frequently to be considered balanced. The AI takes advantage of this, and so did my living opponent. This is a bit gamebreaking at times, and needs to be addressed.\n\nIn terms of "story," since there isn't REALLY much of a story, it was kind of offensive to certain groups. There are jokes making fun of transsexuals, activists, construction workers, the player, cops, and those weird African characters in anime that look like creepy magicians or something. What really bothered me was how they made it very obvious in some, such as the character "Tranny" who has a male-esque voice, and the construction boss guy acts awkward around her. He says he dated her and then he... Cuts off what he's saying. This is just an example of it, but the offensive nature of the NPCs doesn't really detract from the gameplay, though it's a bit irritating. I doubt this is persistent for most people, so this is something to think about.\n\nNext, bugs. Even though the menus were supposedly fixed, they are a bit broken after changing the resolution and not restarting. This was a bit weird, especially when I was just confronted about the update, but I figured it out. Then, there's the audio bug. For some reason, when I had just installed the game, there was no music on the menu, while the music played in-game. When I checked the audio settings, both SFX and music were fully muted, but... Well... They weren't. This was fixed by moving the sliders back and forth. The game crashed one time, but that's really to be expected. There were weird connectivity glitches, where I would connect to someone, then they wouldn't be in the game, but I would remain in the lobby. This, and the lack of players, makes multiplayer pretty pointless, especially since it's the purpose of the game.\n\nThe gameplay, as I explained before, is pretty straightforward. However, it isn't fun, or stressful in a good way. It is bland, whenever the AI doesn't just target you, making it extremely frustrating to try to play, when it isn't so easy it takes no work. I either hard to struggle and lose for no good reason, or I had no competition. In one game, a bit farther along, one AI character didn't even do anything at all, and no, its area wasn't under the FoW at the time.\n\nBeyond the broken AI, the gameplay just isn't that fun to begin with. Maybe other people would love DETOUR, but personally, I don't like it. So, if you want to purchase this game, consider what I said, but take it with a grain of salt, and just do what you want to, in terms of buying this game.","May 29, 2015","false","2.4"," 118 of 185 people (64%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","64","118","185","11","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinches/recommended/92100/","dinches","Akane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinches/","366 products in account","DETOUR is an RTS. You build roads to lead your trucks to the finish line while the enemy team does the same. You can disrupt each other with things like missiles and sentry turrets.\nControls\nSince it's a top down perspective game, you have camera controls which are the WASD keys and mouse to place your buildings and roads. Navigating through different buildables is a hassle. They're categorized into roads, aggressive offensive weapons like missiles, placeable weapons like turrets and truck upgrades. The buildables have each their own hotkeys. It's extremely hectic.\n\nSounds\nThe music is awful. It's generic and gets really annoying after a while. On top of that, the music usually doesn't fit the mood. While I was given a briefing during the tutorial, the song was intense and felt like it was out of an action movie. When playing a multiplayer free-for-all game, the song reminded me of a calm spring afternoon with its peaceful piano melody.\nSound effects were not as terrible. Pretty regular stuff if you ask me. Lifeless without much spice but did its job.\n\nGraphics\nHorrible. The menus seem to be work in progress. The font choice is bad, text starts from wherever and server browser is a background image of a table with text on top which doesn't even line up with the background. It doesn't help that white is a dominant color and the text is not outlined with a darker color.\nIn-game graphics are simplistic and nothing like the standards today. GUI looks like a mess with garbage visual appearance and placing. Maps are squares in an empty space. Objects are placed on a grid on the square. Effects are simple and nothing looks special. It's dull and unpleasant to look at.\n\nBalance\nNon-existent. Some maps are not balanced fairly to all players. Some maps are symmetrical and some have three player bases on one side and the last player sits alone in one corner. The AI is either not challenging or already sending its second truck while you're pondering where the second road tile should go to. Everything has a low cooldown so things like missiles can be launched almost constantly. Money doesn't really seem to run out because everything is quite cheap. Though, you can change the income rate and starting cash but I went with defaults.\n\nOther\nThe broken lobbies. I wasn't sure what was going on first but nothing seems to work properly. It's like that old 1960's TV which you had to give a good whack on the side to make it show clear image. When you select a color, it changes randomly. Sometimes the ready button doesn't work at all. Some game modes can't have more than one player. In a coop mode. Which specifically says "up to three other players". Random players could join spots that I had set as "Friends only", "Invite only" and "Closed". There are four gamemodes. I only had the chance to play one. Free-For-All.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a small RTS with an interesting idea but it feels like it wasn't finished. Barely functioning multiplayer options, generic music, low standard graphics and unbalanced gameplay. It's supposed to be a hectic game and that it is, I must give credit. The game is extremely cheap from the sales but I don't think it was really worth the time or money.\nI don't recommend DETOUR.","June 1, 2015","false","0.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/recommended/92100/","neon_cacti","feed the flies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neon_cacti/","383 products in account","DETOUR is an RTS game which focuses around building your highways and destroying your enemies' highways before they're able to send any of their delivery trucks. The game is pretty okay, first thing I've noticed it the nice interactive menu which changes with some graphic changes but also shakes when trucks pass by. The disappointment however was seeing how low the System Requirements were, but it still lagged. I had to switch to system cursor as it was laggy and the graphics options were scarce to begin with. I also noticed a lot of lag spikes when bombs were launched. The first missions were extremely easy and most of the times there's a loophole around them. Either be it just using bombs and continuously sending your trucks, or dynamiting the enemy's road. It's pretty simple. But then I reached a point where I got constantly nuked, which was really frustrating. The AI seems to have it much easier and the difficulties don't scale too well. Graphically speaking it's "okay" for an RTS, but the character heads that speak looks too childish and the sound the main person keeps making is pretty annoying. I can't complain much about the music, though. The UI however is somewhat confusing and takes time to get used to where is which item, making you lose essential time and potentially the match as well. Another thing to mention is the way you select items and the way you get the description should be reworked. I'd expect hovering over the item with my mouse gives me details and pressing on it will select it, but it works otherwise which disappoints me because it's really hard to understand what the item is by looking at it. I haven't noticed any bugs except for where it doesn't simply allow me to build somewhere and it doesn't specify why. All in all, if you're fan of RTS you can try this one out as it offers kind of a twist to the genre but there are better titles out there. Unless you're on a really tight budget as it gets cheap on sale. I wouldn't, however, recommend it at full price.\n\n>I'd give it a 7/10\n>Pros: Lots of levels, the objectives and the way the game functions are different than the usual,  multiplayer, cards and achievements, it has potential to be a good game.\n>Cons: Needs a rework on the UI, needs more optimization, better AI and/or fix the loopholes allowing for easy level clearing, annoying voicing.","June 15, 2015","true","0.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Again, due-to the lack of a "Mixed" option for recommendations, I'll ultimately go for "Yes" as the good features of this game outweigh the bad ones.\n\nDETOUR is a refreshing addition to the RTS genre, the goal is to escort a certain number of trucks to the opposite end of the map by any means necessary. Construct a safe passage overcoming all kinds of obstacles, including enemy players doing anything they can to hinder your progress at the same time. A nice and simple concept that plays out fairly well once you get the hang of things.\nThe game is fun in short bursts, things can get challenging and hectic quite quickly depending on the number of players on the map at hand, this makes for some great gameplay from time to time, but can be just as frustrating too. Micromanagement is key.\n\nFor me the number one problem with DETOUR is the interface, which is one of the most (if not THE most) important aspect of any RTS game. Things are simply not clear enough, and when the gameplay is hectic and there is so much going on at once, there is little time to spend glaring at the icons and making sure you are selecting and building the correct things, it's not uncommon to end up building something completely different to what you were actually aiming for because icons are small, unclear and similar-looking. The Missiles for example are the main culprit here.\nThis could be improved upon a lot, even simply by making the icons larger, clearer and adding some visible text on the images themselves, the hotkeys could also use some revision as they feel all over the place right now.\n\nThere isn't much singleplayer content in DETOUR either as of the moment, and with so few people playing online, you'll find that you'll run out of things to do relatively quickly. It's a shame that the online lobbies are empty all of the while because this games full potential probably lies within facing off against human opponents instead of the predictable AI.\n\nSo, do I recommend DETOUR? Yes, but it barely makes it as a positive review. The game is interesting and refreshing enough for me to recommend to any fans of the RTS genre, despite the clunky and confusing interface. Don't jump into DETOUR expecting one of the best games ever made, because it's far from it, but I'd say it's worth trying at least once. If you can round up some friends to play this game with you, you'll definitely have a better time with it than you will on the singleplayer missions, which are decent as tutorial stages at least.","May 31, 2015","true","1.3"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","14","20","4","0"

You can't select things with the mouse but rather have to use the scrollwheel to make each selection or memorise the number shortcuts.  Considering the gameplay can be hectic, an efficient interface is critical so it's a pity Detour doesn't have one.","February 28, 2013","false","1.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/92100/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nDETOUR is a real-time highway-simulator strategy-game developed by Sandswept Studios. The objective can be summed up as “get this truck across the finish line, on the other side of the map”. DETOUR gets increasingly complex with weapons, buildings, and opposing AI or Human Players (in Multiplayer).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=505839112\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: You work for a construction company over seen by not-bob-the-builder. I can't actually remember that guys name, I just know he sure looked like bob the builder, but wasn't friendly at all.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=505842603\nAs you progress through the game you are faced with different NPC's who are competing with you to get their trucks across the finish line. Sometimes they're all facing the same direction, other times you're pitted head-to-head with 3 NPC's against you.\n\nGameplay: DETOUR itself starts out very simple, and attempts to teach you the basic concepts as you play through, although the explanations are quite wordy and I concluded “I'll learn the hard way, I don't feel like reading”. (Yes, yes, shame on me. I didn't feel like dealing with Bob-the-not-builder's putting me down even though I did nothing but succeed for the company! *spit*)\nAs in most real-time strategy games, you reach a point where you can no longer click fast enough to compete, so you need to learn the keyboard shortcuts to keep up with the other players/AI. Unfortunately the keyboard short cuts are 1234567890 and some of the “F1-F2-F3-etc.” keys.\nThere are four categories of “build-able” objects; Roads, Trucks, Weapons, and Buildings. Roads are are used to cross different map terrain. Various truck upgrades can be purchased to speed up or defend your trucks. Weapons can be used to destroy, or impede other players/AI progress. And Buildings are limited but you can build ground turrets, air turrets, satellites and more.\nMultiplayer can be challenging and fun, however getting to that point is a whole new kind of headache. Naturally there are connection problems depending on the physical location of the person you're playing with, but just trying to CONNECT to that persons game can take nearly five minutes. And then sometimes you might get disconnected from that persons game.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=504388340\nNot to mention you need to probably arrange a game with a friend, since there aren't enough people playing the game that you can just drop in and play with a random person.\n\nAchievements: Now we come to my biggest complaint about this game... the achievements are painfully tedious. There are 28 achievements in DETOUR. After beating the game for the first time I had literally 4 achievements.\nMost of the achievements in DETOUR are actually exclusively unlocked in multiplayer mode. And none of them are quick unlocks, you need to coordinate with 3 other people for some achievements, but a handful of achievements can be unlocked with just another person (1 vs 1 matches).\n\nPrice: DETOUR is priced at $4.99, for an indie game that's a pretty fair price. I personally like to spend one hour in game for every dollar, that will easily show up on my game time, because... ...unfortunately connecting to a 4 player game requires about five minutes of restarting and reconnecting DETOUR.\nThe single player campaign will take about an hour or two, depending on how good you are at strategy games.\n\nConclusion: Story: irrelevant – I didn't feel like reading the day I did the campaign. A tiny note in my defense; a game should make you WANT to know more about the story, and this game failed in that aspect. Gameplay: the core mechanics were mostly solid, but there were graphical errors, and multiplayer connection problems. Achievements: Agonizingly long to work on these and un-soloable. Not an easy 100% completion game. Price: the price is a little high for how much time the average player will spend on the game.\n\nAll in all, DETOUR has a number of flaws and I haven't particularly enjoyed playing it. That probably means most “normal” people won't like playing it. However if you're looking for a game to play with a friend, this will give you several hours of entertainment, and even more hours of connection problems.\nI recommend this game to Indie-Game Supporters, Strategy-game-fans, and achievers who aren't daunted by several hours of coordinating with others to obtain 100% completion.\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update August 24, 2015:\nFormatting Updates/Adjustments","August 24, 2015","true","17.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/92100/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Detour is a race to the finish, strategy game where you play as a member of the Hard Head Construction Co, whose job it is to build a road from the player factory on the bottom end of the gameboard, all the way to the other end of the gameboard. This road can be constructed as a standard road, mountain tunnel, and bridge over water. Sounds simple enough; However there are multiple obstacles both environmental as well as Computer opponent created, which work against you. From Marshlands where protesters can be bribed to block, Boulders you need to destroy, Rivers to cross and mountains to tunnel through, Computer players destroying your roads and more, Detour offers an interesting challenge.\n\nOh, did I forget? You also have tolet loose your fleet of factory trucks and get them to safety before your opponent, otherwise you are out of a job. Detours might seem easy and simplistic, but as you progress it becomes more challenging, with a computer AI that knows right where to hurt you. Detour offers you the chance to play through 9 tutorial missions, with progressive difficulty, teaching you how to navigate various obstacles and use various tools such as road nails, dynamite, and truck speed upgrades to your advantage. All in all, even though the game comes off as simple, it grows on you and can be challenging the further you progress. Pick it up, give it a try.","May 30, 2015","true","0.7"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","12","21","3","0"

This game could be a lot of fun, but I'm still trying to figure out if the developers have even tried playing the game. The interface is clunky. Hot keys change your selection but don't take action. For instance you use WASD to move your view around the map and one of the most important tools, sensor sweep, is mapped to F2. Makes sense - your fingers are already in that general vicinty, however pressing F2 doesn't do the sensor sweep, it just makes the sensor sweep the selected action. You then have to hit the enter key which is clear across the keyboard from F2.\n\nFor single player, the first real mission after training is, as far as i can tell, unbeatable. AI opponents with no truck goals will target you, even if you also have no goals, over the AI opponent who is about to win. I tried several different strategies to foil the AI, including not completing my final road segment until a truck just needs that last segment; still no good. Learned all of the hot keys (such as they are) and the speedup still wasn't enough. I outspend all of the AIs, I nuke the AIs whenever I can... doesn't matter. There are 3 of them and one of you. There are a bunch more single player missions after that, but I've not seen them. The single player is just broken.\n\nFor multiplayer... my son and I played a few games, and while it was a little fun, the turret balance is completely off. Offensive turrets fire too fast and have too much health. They aren't taken out with a nuke and they can destroy roads as fast as you can build them. Defensive turrets are way too weak to be effective and the game quickly becomes an offensive turret race. It's cute for a little while, but quickly becomes boring.\n\nI don't feel ripped off, I had about 1 hour of fun and the game was incredibly inexpensive; I am disappointed that a laundry list of seemingly simple and obvious improvements are still missing that could make this a reasonably fun game.","June 7, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are a bunch more single player missions after that, but I've not seen them. The single player is just broken.\n\nFor multiplayer... my son and I played a few games, and while it was a little fun, the turret balance is completely off. Offensive turrets fire too fast and have too much health. They aren't taken out with a nuke and they can destroy roads as fast as you can build them. Defensive turrets are way too weak to be effective and the game quickly becomes an offensive turret race. It's cute for a little while, but quickly becomes boring.\n\nI don't feel ripped off, I had about 1 hour of fun and the game was incredibly inexpensive; I am disappointed that a laundry list of seemingly simple and obvious improvements are still missing that could make this a reasonably fun game.","June 7, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In my opinion you should not play it even if it is free.\nWhen you start playing the single player levels you start with a kind of tutorial. At the start of every level a man tells you something, Although you can skip it (by pressing the mouse about 20 times), it is very annoying.\nWhat you have to do is to build roads from one side of a map to the opposite. Then you have to launch trucks and they must reach the other side using the roads you build. At lower levels it is easy to do this. But at higher levels you play versus 3 other bots. You can destroy their roads but they can destroy yours. OK, the idea is good but it is not realised correctly. All bots attack only you and you CANNOT win. On the other hand destroying their roads is very tricky.\nSo, in conclusion this game is not funny and makes you nervous. There are a lot of other games that you can play - they are more interesting than this.

You've got the main goal (reach the end) and you have to go up against the AI with varying levels of difficulty. It's not difficult in theory. The farther you progress, the more power ups you earn. Building and power ups take points. Patience is rewarded but patience can be what causes your bitter defeat.\n\nYou're not going to be too entirely impressed with the artwork of the characters you meet in this game. The characters are very cartoony in style, but for something I'd call a time management board game, I don't find that part too important. You might. You need to know this. The actual playing field looks like your average grid filled with general pixelated grass, cityscape, rubble, etc. It's not entirely impressive. It's there. It's your playing field and it's enough for me.\n\nPersonally, I had a little bit of issue with relying on my mouse so there seemed to be something slowing me down with clicking on things. I'm not sure if it was because I'm unused to seeing an orange cone as my pointer or if there were actual mouse problems. I ended up being pretty happy to use the keyboard when I could. Clicking wasn't always my friend in this game.\n\nOtherwise, I really enjoyed myself. The games are very short to play and they are made so that a lot of action happens at once. There are a few unique personalities to deal with, but otherwise there's not really much of a story there. It's more like a bland, shell of a story. It's more like the sort of stories you're expecting from time management games you download to kill an hour from a certain website that has a lot of HOGs. You get a few laughs from some of the text and you proceed to simply play the game. That's how it works.\n\nSome players may find this boring and stop after the first part of the game, as yes, the easy section of the game is easy to blow through. You could purchase this for friends during the Summer Sale and use this just for playing against friends. This is a good choice if you're not into anything with gore (though most of us are, guilty as charged). Then again, those of us who are board game addicts (also guilty as charged) might enjoy this, too.\n\nOf course then there's taking joy in finding ways to completely obliterate your opponent and dominate the field so they can't build. Being that sadistic is a sort of joy that comes from the game, as is the quick win or the slow and agonizing type of defeat. It's not hard to win, it's just the matter of how to get there. You'll learn, but it's about thinking quickly and ensuring there will be a victory.\n\nIt's a game I'll likely revisit from time to time because you can pick it up and put it down. Though I'd rather give this a sort of lukewarm rating, what tips it over is I did like it and I'll certainly be playing during my "I AM JUST SO BORED!" between treatments and napping.\n\nYour handicap and health issues: The graphics can get a little bit bright and sometimes blink. I've got a mild headache after playing, but nothing too serious. Caution. Danger Will Robinson.","June 12, 2015","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It's also very easy to understand and play, it's just very simple and you can count that as a good thing or a bad thing,\nThe other piece I'm not a big fan of is for some reason instead of trying to out-do you the AI tries to just focus on attacking you and your projects rather then trying to win himself. I think it's just simply poorly written AI but maybe it is programmed to work that way. All in all, it's an okay game to get in a bundle which I did and it's not fantastic by any means but it's also not terrible.

The player will be playing against AI players and yeah, they'll do anything to stop each other from reaching the other side of the map whether they need to use dynamites, bombs or even those EMP missiles.\n\nDETOUR is a very challenging game since building a road to the other side won't be a stroll around the park. Though you'll all have the same upgrades but still, it'll require strategic planning and timing especially that resources are very scarce when all hell has broken loose. There will be times that you'll need to be cunning like having a decoy road while making a secret route or go for a straight-forward approach, and immediately aim for the other side or you could even go for a destructive approach where you'll save up your resources and wait for your opponents to finish making their roads and then destroy them to smithereens while stacking your road for the win. It's a strategy of your choice.\n\nI recommend this game for those who are looking for a cheap yet challenging game. The graphics and sound effects are simple but the gameplay itself can gob about 2-3 hours of your time. The game also features multiplayer mode. And just a little advice for new players, if you're playing with your friends on multiplayer mode, the large bomb weapon can end a lot of friendships.\n\nMy Personal Rating:\nGraphics: 6/10\nMusic: 7/10\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nOverall: 7.0","June 1, 2015","true","1.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","6","10","3","0"

I'm bothered that a lot of modern games of the genre can't run on cheaper laptops with common Intel HD chipsets. Besides one problem I encountered in the first minute the game. The game does not adjust the dpi with the resolution so the game is unreadable below 1024x768, the resolutions below 640x480 are so impractical it must be an Easter egg. Pacing can be a problem when explaining a strategy game but not here until the controls get in the way. Scrolling for items can be impossible on a laptop without a mouse around, (and even with one) nothing feels like cheating more than sluggish controls. It feels like a portable game for a certain fruit shaped company's tablet but the cross platform support isn't there so I doubt it because it uses DX9. I will check it out on max settings on my desktop in a bit and see what I'm missing from those shaders. I'm on the fence about the price but I would call it a buy, a bundle or sale preferably, and a 7.5/10. I almost want to play lowest resolution matches on Twitch. EDIT: The shaders help, 1080p helps. Upon playing to the first achievement I think 7.5/10 is fair. This Dev gives out free keys all the time and I really appreciate that. I plan to put a few hours on this before I consider uninstalling it. I have another game of there's I planned to review if I can remember what it is.","May 28, 2015","true","0.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","7","12","3","0"

Battling opponents to get trucks to the other side of the map. This involves bomb, missiles, and a bunch of other stuff. The game controls are slightly annoying, as switching from roads to tunnels to missiles takes WAY more effort that it could. The best way is to learn the hotkeys. The other downfall is not many people actually play the game at one time. So servers are limited. The best way to play is have some friends that wish to play as then you have someone to enjoy the game.\n\nSo overall Detour is a great game to play... with some friends.

This is going to be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written and recorded, since the game is pretty simple to describe.\n\nGRAPHICSReally poor graphics: absence of many animations, boring background, poor particle effects and\n\nGAMEPLAYYour goal is to build a road that goes from one point of the map to the other so that your trucks can travel there, while also trying to destroy the roads built by your adversary. The end. There are multiple objects that you could use, but it pretty much becomes a game of "the one who builds the road first wins", while in the singleplayer challenges you will have little to no problems since the AI is braindead and predictable.\n\nCHALLENGEAs I've already said, beating the AI is really easy, while in multiplayer you will spend more time using dynamite and hoping that your enemy doesn't notice you rather than using any real tactic.\n\nSOUNDThere aren't many sound effects, and the ones that are there aren't all that polished. The soundtrack is really uninteresting and annoying when playing, and you will find yourself muting it to preserve your sanity.\n\nREPLAYABILITY28 Steam achievements and multiplayer mode will make you come back if you were enjoying the experience. Singleplayer challenges will be beaten pretty easily, but you can try beating your highscores.\n\nOverall, Detour is not a game for everybody: it is very easy when playing solo, and it lacks strategy in multiplayer. I recommend buying it only when on sale, since its price drops a lot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ramsey26/recommended/92100/","Ramsey26","JK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ramsey26/","105 products in account","This is a good game and I can highly recommend getting it if it is on sale.\n\nThe game is great with friends and a real laugh.\nThe competition between each other is really enjoyable and working together as a team against bots (because there aren't many other players online) is also great.\n\nThe single player starts off easy but on challenge 10 you get repeatedly attacked by the other bots and have to focus your resources on repairing your route and stopping the others but you can never build fast enough to beat the team furthest from you. ( I am most probably just terrible at the game but after like 10 attempts it's becoming increasingly frustrating and less fun)\n\nThe soundtrack is really nice too and takes away the stress.\n\nYou should totally get this game with friends, especially if it's going for 15p. I don't know whether i'd pay £3.99 but you can always refund your money if you don't enjoy it.\n\nEdit: After playing some more I have come to realise it's very buggy at times and would definitely not  pay £3.99.\n\nIn the turret mode, you can build on one lane and neglect the others with no consequence. The rocks cost 6 credits and stop one truck, the turrets cost 5 credits and can shoot at trucks and also stop them through contact like the rocks, making the rocks seem very pointless. It's very easy and slow moving, it gets boring very quickly. It only ended because the game thought I was in another gamemode and it said the time had run out and no one had won, it then displayed the scoreboard with only 0s because it didn't register what I had built.\n\nMultiplayer doesn't let you do all of the modes and despite it saying 'max players 4' etc it doesn't let you do survival or turret mode with a friend.\n\nOne last complaint is that the bombs generate too quickly, they're basically the same as dynamite and can damage more structures at once so the enemy can spam bombs and destroy everything you have faster than you can rebuild and get a truck through/retaliate. Turrets have way too much health too and the bombs don't seem to do any more damage than dynamite on them, the most effective way i've found is just to spam roads until you get near it then add your own turret with aid of dynamite.","June 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Detour is sort of a competitive puzzle, sorta. You have a starting point and the goal is to make a road and get your trucks to the other side of the playing field. Honestly, the gameplay isn’t that bad, and it’s kind of interesting, it just couldn’t hold my interest. The artwork was really amateurish. There was some so called storyline that was REALLY lame. There were these really terrible jokes, including a slightly veiled booty pirate and some tranny. No joke, the character was called Tranny and looked like a woman with a slight 5 o’clock shadow. And your boss is trying to avoid “her” Ooooookay. It was incredibly awkward. The controls were pretty bad. The UI was terrible. Reminded me of customizing win 95 when I was 13 – the mouse pointer was a friggin traffic cone. Uugghhh.\nThe gameplay has you going against another person trying to get their trucks across the map. You can build regular roads, bridges, tunnels, and then work to destroy the competition. You can stop their trucks with nails, blow up their stuff with dynamite and bombs and stuff. And some other things. The difficulty massively starts to spike on the 8th level and I read in reviews that level 9 is next to impossible because the AI is totally unfair. Instead of being everyone against each other it ends up being 3 v 1 against you. So, I decided I’m not having enough fun to bother. So, this one went in the uninstalled category, never to be seen again.\n","February 9","false","1.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I will put actual effort into this one especially since this is a type of game I usually would not play.\n\nDetour has from what I read had a lot of work done on it. It is an RTS a genre of game I am not very experienced in this genre.  However the main point of the game is to get your trucks to the goal buy building roads, tunnels and bridges when needed and sabotaging your enemy’s attempts to get their trucks to their goal.\n\nThe game has single player challenges and online multiplayer I could not find anyone to play against online however. The Single player challenges do a good job at introducing the mechanics of the games. It starts off pretty easy and opens up the things such as using bridges over water and tunnels through mountains. Eventually you will get aggressive to the point where you can sabotage enemy roads with dynamite and nails to stop their trucks and even turrets to destroy enemy trucks.\n\nThe difficulties for the challenge modes are set by difficulty grouped by nine from what I could tell. The story isn’t much you are just Mr. Creaseys’ new recruit. He shows you the ropes and tells you to go get ‘em and be the best road builder/bomber ever.\n\nHonestly I could very well recommend this game especially since so much was improved although I never played the original before the update it plays just fine. I liked the concept as well since as I live somewhere where road construction takes forever.

It's not horribly buggy, and doesn't have glaring flaws, there just isn't very much game here.  The object is to build a road across the board, and send trucks to the other side, while interfering with your opponent's efforts to do the same.  The road-building itself is simple; the strategy of play is more about keeping an eye on your resources and cooldown timers so that you can act as quickly as possible.  It's somewhat reminiscent of competitive RTS play, but heavily dumbed-down.

Your opponent is busy doing the same, so learning to spy on their activity is just as important as developing your offense.  Four years on, the game's new pricetag is more than reasonable.

This game runs atrociously. The first thing that struck me when starting up the game for the first time is the inexcusable amount of latency when using the software cursor. The delay between my mouse movement and the cursors response on the screen varied anywhere from 0.5 to (not exaggerating) 2.5 seconds! If you’re really desperate to play Detour, your first priority should be to enable Hardware Cursor in the options menu. Following the debacle with the laggy mouse, I noticed there were a fair few grammatical issues with the level selection text. Typically with low budget/hobby games I sort of just overlook this, especially when the narrative is, for all intents and purposes, irrelevant to the actual gameplay. Unfortunately, after seeing the issues with the cursor, these errors were much more eye catching and set a precedent in my mind that this was either shoddily put together or unnecessarily rushed to release. Then I began the campaign. I actually quit midway through the first level just to activate Steams’ FPS counter and boot up Fraps to confirm my suspicions: this isometric mobile-port style puzzle game was running at 16 FPS on a GTX 680 and an overclocked i7-2600k. I suffered on through a handful more levels just to know what the game was trying to be, and as intriguing as the concept may be, the performance of this game is just abysmal.","September 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

On a computer that’s about 4 times the system requirements! However, once the game started, it didn’t disappoint.

However, your opponent can try to stop you through many methods. One of these is by bribing the police to stop your trucks. After getting sufficiently angry, retaliation can be had by bombing your fellow opponent off of the face of the earth. Mad at the fog of war? No problem! Just run a scan! Don’t want to be scanned?

The fun in this game truly lies in the simplicity of the gameplay, but the complexity the game can take on when played by two skilled players.\n\nAfter all this, I give this game a thumbs up.

Watch out for dynamite that destroys road, missiles that take out your trucks, and other hazards that others may send at you.\n\nIt's kind of an interesting premise, that leads to some interesting, fast-paced gameplay. That said, when there were four players desparately fighting for the middle ground, it was incredibly hard to figure out what was going on at any given time. I'd be repairing roads in one part the map while the other half was getting shredded by the AI. Half the time, the bridges and tunnels didn't work as I expected, and I didn't realize my roads weren't connecting.\n\nSadly, this ends up as an amateur attempt at a strategy game. There's a good idea here, but it's not well-designed, and as a result, really isn't all that fun and not terribly engaging for fans of strategy. It seems like it would be mildly entertaining as a dumb multiplayer game, since the frantic action could make some fun moments with friends, but I think that's about the only value you'll find here. If this looks interesting, check out Sid Meier's Railroads!, which is buggy and flawed but much more fun.","November 20, 2012","false","0.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Very good for children under the age of 10.\n\nThe game is pretty much racing and resource management. You build roads to get your trucks to the finish line as fast as possible while trying to hinder the AI from doing the same.\n\nIts a decent strategy game and with multiplayer, you are able to really test your on the fly speed thinking.","July 31, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will get your money back in cards you can sell and you can press "r" to crash the game in the lobby. Another great thing is if you somehow got 4 people to play this game only one person can join the green team. Also when someone joins you start moving from two different slots in the lobby. You can also make a dount shop. I don't why you can, but maybe it's useful. If you get a flat tire you need to spam the "z" or the "x" key not both going back and forth like the pop up looks like it does.

This game tried to be a strategy game and succeeded greatly at doing it, but the thing is you can't really do much with the strategies and fields you are given. It ends up just being the fact of who has more income and who has faster trucks and just ends up with a stand still most often between opponents. The missions were somehwhat difficult at first, but then you begin to learn and notices strategies you can use every time in order to beat them. Overall it is a nice game to play a round of with friends just to try new things and challenge yourself, but the initial game itself doesn't hold much strategy to it from there.","December 8, 2013","false","0.6"," 8 of 22 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","8","22","0","0"

Your aim is to go from the bottom to the top while the enemies try and get from top to bottom, left to right and right to left. You cannot build over enemy roads so must cause chaos in ways such as using dynamite to blow up part of their road and then building over it, using a large bomb to cause havoc to multiple parts of enemy roads, using an EMP to stop all trucks temporarily and there are many more options. It's an interesting game for sure, and if you want a cheap game where you can get a few laughs, test your brain and play whenever you're bored or want to waste a few minutes. If it's on sale, get it.

I haven't tried that feature out yet, as I am awfully competitive~ And I mainly play multipler as fps ;) But hey, that's just how I game.\n\nThe game takes place in a map that is parted into squares, it's your job to build a road and maintain a flow of trucks in order to win, your "$" is generated automaticly, and when a truck reaches the boundaries you'll win. It's funny enough single player, but there's a tool/ability that's way to powerful, the EMP. The EMP functions as an emp would do of course, but the time.. is actually so long, that if you time it right you can place some dynamite (on opponents tracks) and then emp the van at the correct time to make a double hit, that's something I wouldn't like to experience in multiplayer :)\n\nAlthough this game deserves some credit, it's new it's funky, but for me, it was a one timer.\nThe idea of "reach the end first with x ammount of things" has been done before, not that it makes this game any lesser great or something like that, it's simply just not MY personal game that I normally would reach out for~\n\nbut alas, this game has potential to entertain friends and strangers for quite some time, give it a shot :)\n\n7/10","May 30, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't tried that feature out yet, as I am awfully competitive~ And I mainly play multipler as fps ;) But hey, that's just how I game.\n\nThe game takes place in a map that is parted into squares, it's your job to build a road and maintain a flow of trucks in order to win, your "$" is generated automaticly, and when a truck reaches the boundaries you'll win. It's funny enough single player, but there's a tool/ability that's way to powerful, the EMP. The EMP functions as an emp would do of course, but the time.. is actually so long, that if you time it right you can place some dynamite (on opponents tracks) and then emp the van at the correct time to make a double hit, that's something I wouldn't like to experience in multiplayer :)\n\nAlthough this game deserves some credit, it's new it's funky, but for me, it was a one timer.\nThe idea of "reach the end first with x ammount of things" has been done before, not that it makes this game any lesser great or something like that, it's simply just not MY personal game that I normally would reach out for~\n\nbut alas, this game has potential to entertain friends and strangers for quite some time, give it a shot :)\n\n7/10","May 30, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
