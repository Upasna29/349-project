The tutorial itself teaches you how to spend money.\n\nBasically the game is designed around making the building as tedious as possible to entice the player to spend real money to skip absurd waiting times. I thought the '8 hours to collect wheat' must have been an exagguration but it's not. It's literally wait 8 hours or spend money.\n\nThe game isn't designed to be fun, it's designed to be tedious unless you spend money.\n\nThe battles are incredibly shallow. Three lanes of units move towards eachother without your control and you 'tap' them to 'charge' when prompted. You can tell archers to shoot (through a very cumbersome system that is clearly designed for your phone), and 'taunt' which is really the only way you can move between 'lanes'. It's utterly woeful.\n\nNot to mention you can again, pay real money to buy better units and buff said units. You also need to spend money to heal units. And spend money to avoid more ridiculous waiting times to build more units.\n\nEven on mobile phone, this game seems terrible. It's basically an excercise in tedium unless you pay money. They didn't want to make the game fun, rather they tried to make it as dull as possible unless you cough up money.\n\nAvoid like the plague. This is an abomination of a game.

Got to level 26 and was starting to gather materials for crafting units you have to normally pay gold for which you buy with real money. It was fun up until that point. The AI after awhile suddenly becomes nearly impossible to beat since they can have several elite units of the same type while you can only have one. And they will be higher rank than you can possibly achieve without throwing tons of money at the game specially with how fast you can level just trying to gather supplies that the missions will be beyond your troops capability of winning without you paying for buffs and gear and super troops bought from the store.\n\nThis unfortunately is too much pay to win for me to recommend.  I thought when I got to crafting that maybe hey I could just put some time into it and get the same items but with more time required. I gathered the materials for an item, hit craft, and saw that it said stage 1. Stage 1...So I have to gather the supplies FIVE times in order to build anything and if you don't use mastercraft you could end up making a pile of scrap metal instead of what you aimed to make. Mastercraft costs nearly triple the resources of basic craft.\n\nNot to mention it takes 12-18 hours to craft one stage. And it takes 12 hours per sheep to get one hide or cows which will take 6 days to recover their land before you can butcher them again and you only get 2 after 20 hours of waiting for them to grow. So with three sheep farms you get 18 resources a day..And the most basic sword/armor/shield takes 25 to start stage one and thats using basic craft not master.\n\nThis is a disappointing game that I am sad I wasted even a couple days playing after seeing how much of a cash grab it really is. You disappoint me CA...You made my favorite games of my childhood and then you spit out this piece of crap and insult your fans like this. Definite hands down, don't waste your time or your money.

It is a well known brand, and that is the only reason why that name is being used here. Lets think about it, they could have released a game called Battles: KINGDOM, but everyone knows that by adding Total War in the name, it will get much more attention, and that will lead to much more people trying it.\n\nAs for me, Battles: KINGDOM, as that is how I will call this game, because it is a disgusting cheap trick to call it Total War, as was explained before by me, is nearly a copy of Stronghold: KINGDOMs. I do not think it is a coincidence. We start in England, oh wow, so cool and unexpected. Whole world is made out of hexes, that can be edited. Build a building or change them into something else, such as terrain modification.

In the short time that I played KINGDOM I have already asked myself "what's the point to playing this?"\n\nBuilding different buildings and designing your own kingdom is a fantastic idea, backing it up with a total war style battle system makes it even sweeter, but KINGDOM, as others have stated, is basically a tablet game.  The battle system is too simple to be any fun, your guys just automatically walk toward the enemy and there is little you can do besides move a unit to try and trick your enemy (lol) or use a dopey powerup.\n\nAs others stated, doing anything in the KINGDOM building mode is ridiculous, with the game trying its hardest to get you to buy premium currency to speed up every resource gathering task.  If i wanted to play a game where I just check in for 2 minutes and then log out and not play for 8 hours I'll go break into peoples houses and water their house plants.\n\nAlso, building the kingdom feels very empty and pointless, the world does not feel alive at all, (no little medieval people using the roads or bustling about, or harvesting the resources) and since the ultimate purpose of the kingdom is to support the army for the dopey battles, there really is no point.\n\nUnless its some kind of end of the road/ high level feature, the building part of the game does not intertwine with the battle part.  Yes you build certain buildings to actually get your units for battle, but besides that there is no direct interaction between kingdom and battle.\n\nMy opinion to fix this would be to pull it off the marketplace, and bury the code with the E.T. Atari cartridges in a landfill.\n\nNo but seriously, what I would do is actually pour some depth into KINGDOM to make it almost more like a medieval sim city, then combine a fun addicting city/region builder with a battle system that plays more like an actual total war game like Rome II or Atilla, and your kindgom supports your army in way more depth.\n\nThey could even make it so your army invades other peoples realm and they try to plunder the castle and sack the village.\n\nIf you want to make a free-to-play game with microtransactions that's fine with me, but if the game itself is pointless/unfun, I will not play it long enough to even consider buying premium anything.\n\nI love the actual Total War games, but please either fix this or kill it with fire.\n\nNow if you excuse me my neighbors hibiscus needs watering.\n\n\n","April 12, 2015","false","3.5"," 109 of 125 people (87%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","87","109","125","31","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/moffcorrino/recommended/300080/","moffcorrino","Moff Corrino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/moffcorrino/","288 products in account","Disadvantages:\n1. The game seems to be purposely slow paced  (especially when it comes to equiping troops and leveling to 2nd rank), it's very likely for most to lose their patience and either buy gold or quit the game.\n2. Nonsense restrictions, such as on crafting, which can be carried out only by one blacksmith at a time.\n3. Gold buttons are everywhere, thus making it very likely to 'accidentally' spend even that little gold bars you got available from in-game leveling and battle quests.\n4. Enemy AI on challenging and 'brutal' difficulty,  has often additional soldiers which do not appear on pre-battle info. In general it feels the AI is 'cheating' on certain battles.\n5. The game is quite unbalanced when it comes to the gathering of resources. Insanely long cooldowns. As an example: gathering 20pcs of stone takes 2:30 hours... Upgrading structures consume an imposible amount of resources.\n6. Crafting gear is expensive and exaustingly slow, it takes 5 crafting 'stages' and takes about 4 days to craft a simple bracelet.\n7. There is no way to tell about the water level and flooding likeliness.\n8. When I reached winter season, I found it so terribly boring, no crops and no forests. Trees yield way too little wood, by chopping 1500 pcs (first castle upgrade) you end up clearing everything around making the map desolate and cold, like Isenguard... Furthermore 'tracking beasts' on winter removes all the last (if any remained) forrest left on the now depressing looking map. In retrospective, I think I mismanaged awfully the resources, however it is actually not hard to do so and go off track.\n9. The game fails to inform the player early on about building bonuses (forcing you around level 25-35 to demolish, rebuild and spent additional time and resources restructiring your cities). For example, I found out later in the game that you must build producers next to military buildings, it is rather vague how many residences you need to sustain a city and I had to count hexes to make out wood cutters range (tracking and wood cutting range is about 4-5 hexes).\n10. Has some minor bugs and disconnects from server 2-3 times (on average) during a 6h period.\n\nAdvantages:\n1. The game has very well polished graphics for a game of it's kind.\n2. Battle and map zooms in, up to a great detail, very pleasant to the eye.\n3. Terraforming (changing the flow of rivers etc) and the changing of seasons is quite nice.\n4. Great variety of troops, however I'd like more detail on weaknesses and strengths of certain units.\n5. I believe the game most probably might be much more playable on my tablet.\n\nConclusion:\nThere is lack of vital information about how things work and -alas- you got to discover them by yourself. It's very difficult to enjoy properly this game, you either must have got lots of time and patience or  spend a good deal of real cash. I'd prefer just paying a one time amount for it as a complete game, without the long resource 'cooldwns' and any other cash-involved transactions.\n\nSuggestions :\nReduce the cost of construction and cooldowns, amplify the benefits of gamer commitment to the game. Alternatively give the posibility of a one time purchase into a 'premium' status (global reduced cooldowns, reduced crafting costs) with the guarantee of no more gold transactions.\n\nEpilogue:\nWe choose to play a game in order to get entertained, enjoy some challenge and overall feel better at the end of the day. This game fails delivering such.","May 2, 2015","false","217.7"," 105 of 125 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","105","125","4","13"

This game does have total war features but it reminds me of a cross between age of empires and game of war. Positives of this game include its terraforming system which you can change the hieght of land and change directions of water intuiteively. Customisation was also a nice feature being able to make your character but I would like there to be alot more. Battles were fun and I like the inclusion of missions, duels and soon to be a campaign. Graphics and animations are quite good for a mobile game and excelled from what I thought they would be like. I can imagine this game progressing and more features being added to make an already decent game a good game.\n\nNow for the negative... I feel like alot of reviews expect this game to be like most Total Wars and if you have that outlook this game will disapoint you. This game is in beta and does not have all the features, it also lacks some polish and the game even crashed once for me and I noticed some bugs in the tutorial, but nothing major. This game also takes time to unlock things so dedication is needed to tend to crops, resources, buildings and missions. You can purchase gold (guys gotta make money somehow) but I don't like P2W, although this game does not seem like anything is unachievable by normal means, just takes a bit longer.\n\nMy Main gripe with this game is there is hardly any tactical depth compared to Total War, this was disapointing. This game is in BETA and it will get better, but if you do not like it now there is no point in getting it later. p.s narrator was annoying...","April 10, 2015","false","1.0"," 84 of 102 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","84","102","0","4"

Why not! It has to be fun.\n\nGod was i wrong.\n\nThe game is pretty good honestly, but its the crap you have to deal with that WILL annoy you.\nSo my DAY of game play (yes i played it that long) was awesome, i loved the game, but then came the 2nd day. I found that somehow my quarry flooded, and for half the day i was stuck with no quarry. Why am i complaining about that? Because i had earlier filled a dam that contained water that could leak into the quarry.... so the water magically broke the ground?\n\n\nMy 2nd problem is no tutorial. I mean come on, i deconstructed barracks thinking it was a permanent unit station, but nope, just disband it and your fine. But that's my stupidity, but aside from that, no In depth tutorial.\n\n\nNow here comes the part that got me.\n\n\n\nSo my army was fine, my economy was starting to recover, so i used the lovely wallet warrior shop (Market) to buy stone to finish my 2nd knights barracks. i had planned on getting some more long sword knights, BUT AVAST MY EYES!\nI CAN ONLY HAVE ONE UNIT OF LONG SWORD KNIGHTS? unless...  *GASP* I BUY ANOTHER ONE!\n\nGood Game CA, but luckily my wallet is empty.\n\nSo on with that, AI army's can have more than 1 unit of long sword knights, and at the same time you can only have 1 medium cavalry unit? while AI can have 2?\n\nCome on CA.....\n\nI dont think these are the guys i remember making awesome games like R:TW, Barbarian Invasion (Still unfinished sadly) and Medieval 2.\n\n\nso to sum it all up here's "le list 'o' worthless opinions" .\n\n*PRO'S!\n*Fun for a bit\n*Good Concept\n*\n\n*CON'S\n*Leans way to much on wallet warriors.

Firstly, I give it a go, a good go - I put in many hours to get a complete look at the game.\n\nFirst of all - The resource system doesnt even work properly - you wait for several hours to collect wood, for instance, but you have to actually be online to collect it. It's not like its a proper streaming economy - this would be so much better. You buy a woodcutter - all your work should be done.\n\nSecondly - The balance is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible - It's so obviously pay-to-win its excrutiatingly painful to play against other people. I muster the best units I can, with all the upgrades. I didn't purchase any gold so I couldnt recruit the most advanced units (which would cost 200 gold OR approximately 300 hours playtime to get 200 gold for free).\nMoreover, No more rock-paper-scissors style Total War. Archers now beat cavalry in melee, spearmen beat swordsmen etc.\n\nThirdly - The battles are so damn boring. I mean, who thought this could be fun at all? There's also a lot of UI lag, which makes it hard for you to get 'Good' or 'Perfect' charges to any level of consistency. At times it runs like a jet-ski on gravel despite it being played on a high-end PC.\n\nI know this is a seperate team of people from Creative Assembly and they may or may not have worked on previous titles, but I suggest that anyone in CA who has an ounce of goodwill in his body, kick these devs out of CA.

There are plenty of games that use free-to-play models well and are developed with a PC gaming audience in mind; LoL, DOTA, TF2, WoT. Generally the obstacle to progress in these games is an experience system locking out hightier or desirable items which you can unlock by playing the game, or alternatively they simply offer a cash shop with funny hats that people buy for reasons?!?!\n\nThis game is free to play of the mobile variety, so rather than making gameplay and "fun" (insofar as world of tanks could be described as "fun") the route to unlocking things it instead uses your precious time, or your money. Or both.\nWhile time lockouts might make a bit of sense for games you'll play occasionally through the day on facebook or your phone/tablet, they make no damn sense in a PC port. There are also shameless paywalls for powerful units and unit upgrades.\n\nAlso the UI is a straight mobile port so it's got chunky, mobile optimised UI elements.\n\ntl;dr I have no idea why this even ended up on steam.\n\nAs a casual game, the underlying mechanics are alright, but the implentation as a PC title seems poorly matched to the platform.\n\nEDIT: I have now played long enough to exhaust my gold and can't really do much other than wait or 'play' the battles.","April 10, 2015","false","2.2"," 60 of 71 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","60","71","3","4"

I can say I was very excited about it when I first signed up and when I got my beta key. Now, well... not so much. The game itself is a lot like a mix between civilization and clash of clans with the battles being much like the total war battles: shogun except without all the buildings you can build in battle. So as a sequel to total war battles: shogun, it is ok. As a Total War game, I do not recommend it.\n\nPositives:\nGraphics and terraforming are pretty cool\nThe simple strategies may appeal to less serious strategy gamers\nI enjoy building my town\nThe tutorial is helpful\nAlthough they are simple, microbattles are pretty cool to see because each unit is fighting against individual enemies\nOrders are cool as well as they give different bonuses to units and orders are attainable from churches\nNot everything is pay to win as some things you cannot use gold to get\nLogin is good and not buggy (which tends to happen in many beta games)\nI like the medieval feel of the game\nThere seems to be an unlimited amount of "workers" or "builders" which is great!\nThe peasant and craftsman systems (your workers) seems useful.\nI enjoy having to build multiple barracks and stables that each field one unit as this makes the town bigger and cooler-looking.\n\nNegatives:\nFighting is too simple (see above positives)\nNot at all what I expected from a total war game\nMore or less pay to win (strong units cost "gold", aka money) You can of course earn gold but it takes a very long time (I guess it makes sense because the game will be free so they need a way to make money)\nSome buildings are not available until much later in the game\nUpgrading buildings seems to take a lot of grinding and upgrading castles (main building) seems to require having multiple castles and towns and having a certain amount of buildings in your town.\nI personally think that the lord (basically, you) should be more customizable as right now there are only a few different options for hair color, bacjground of profile, etc.\n\nSo overall this is a fun game although not at all what I expected or wanted to play from Total War,\nI RECOMMEND IT TO JUST PLAY A CLASH OF CLANS/CIV MIX BUT NOT AS A TOTAL WAR GAME!\nand because of the pay-to-win aspect of this game, I will not recommend it overall.\n","March 1, 2015","false","7.3"," 75 of 95 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","75","95","2","3"

Before I get into the fighting ♥♥♥♥ spirit with this review I should tell you I am a long time Total War player and started with Shogun 1 when my balls first dropped and have played everything after that and enjoyed them thoroughly (although some more than others). Since the series has been around so long players have come to expect a certain type of game when they see the total war logo with the tiny samurai horseman logo next to the letter, you know the one I'm talking aboot ;)\n\nWHAT IS DIFFERENT?\n\nThis game for all intents and purposes is NOT a total war game, there is no turn based campaign map instead it is real time much like a command&conquer where buildings need time to finish contructing. While there are real time tactical battles, the open ended and diverse battle maps known from the other total war titles are gone as well. This means there are no terrain advantages or disadvantages (at least I have found) during battles and the battlefield is made up of 3 lanes.\n\n+WHAT IS BATTLE?+\n\nEach lane has 3 slots for units, and I will illustrate how you may distribute your units among these slots by making a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ diagram with text and little symbols here\n\nfront<- [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, Ranged, and Siege Weapon ]\nfront<- [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Siege Weapon ]\nfront<- [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, and Ranged ] [ Infantry, Cavalry, Ranged, and Siege Weapon ]\n\nAs you can maybe see there is SOME depth to battles, but the meat of battles and how they are decided is military orders and unit abilities and the traditional rock paper scissors gameplay of other TW tittles. And yes, I spelled titles that way on purpose. After your units gain enough experience they can unlock special abilities with a variety of effects depending ont he unit type. Each unti has 2 choices for ability. Military orders are like general abilities but you are able to use them throughout the whole battle but they have a timer cooldown between each use, unliek unit abilities which can only be used once. So troop choice is extremely important in battles and the right combination of orders and abilities.\n\n+WHAT IS CAMPAIGN?+\n\nThe campaign map is layed out before you like a giant deep dish pizza pie on hexagonal tiles. You can build buildings, gather the resources which are silver, stone, food, and wood *INSERT STRONGHOLD "Wood Needed" VOICE CLIP HERE*. I'm pretty sick of writing this review already so I'm going to wrap it up with the big important thign about this game.\n\n+WHAT IS LOVE?+\n\nThis game screams IPHONE WINDOWS TABLET TIME SINK. And like most other tablet time sink the pace of this game  is extremely slowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww. BUT: and this is where the magic happens; you can purchase a 5th resource known as gold and with this gold you can speed up harvesting, building, and purchase unique battlefield buffs such as flaming arrows and saxon mercenaries. But to be fair and ubjective you can acquire these things without payign gold, but much much slower. So slow that if you go in expecting this game to be as fast as traditional TW games you will be angry and write angry reviews containing 1 sentence referencing pop culture memes.\n\n+BABY DONT HURT ME+\n\nAll in all I WOULD reccomend this as a game you can hop into and SLOWELY develop your realm and then exit and do other stuff, that is assuming you are not plannign on purchasing gold. If you are hopping for a cool medieval total war game you will not find it here. But if you just want a game to pass the time with, and kick some ♥♥♥ in some hokey battles than go ahead, I am enjoying it but its definetly not a game I can spend hours at a time playing like other TW games.\n\nYou can add me in the game or on steam to duel me and let me farm your troops for xp, I will sure be willign to return the reach around/ favor. my lords name is Hershey and he is a grizzled peasant badass.","September 20, 2015","true","53.2"," 75 of 103 people (73%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","73","75","103","34","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fimfor/recommended/300080/","fimfor","Fimfor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fimfor/","110 products in account","Most humble and greatest review for a game, which is the result of miscarriage\nRemember those browser games, where you build stuff, farm stuff, destroy other people's stuff and steal all their resources so you can repeat this again? Generally they are all the same. You can pay some extra bucks there to get extra income of in-game resources, finish construction of virtually same buildings instantly with a level number increasing next to their name somewhere, so you can spend another 10 minutes of your pathetic life playing a game that's not fun but you can at least ruin other people's fun?\n\nThis game tries to be something like that. I'm thinking so the very least, in a way when that awkward guy you have as an acquaintance does something strange, you try to be polite and not make fun of him. Which I'm not trying to be, as this game is not my ♥♥♥♥ing acquaintance and it sucks major ♥♥♥♥♥. Almost literally.\n\nOkay, so here we have it. A F2P game with Total War in its name. A major AAA title you don't even have to pay for. Let's get to the gameplay!\n\nYou are the lord of some Britbong duchy/county whatever, turns out something happened to your daddy and some old regent dude is giving you a tutorial of doing things, which he was too wasted to do. You build a dam, which is the coolest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ part of the game, because there are water physics (!) then you get praised for clicking on something. Surely increased my self-worth.\n\nOh, and about clicking: you only need to use the left mouse button. Right click does nothing, it would be too hardcore for the game. It's obvious this was made with touchscreen in the mind.\n\nAnyway, from first glance it looks fairly average but it gets worse: you need two hours to saturate a resource tile which gives you 20 wood/food/something or you can click on harvest all button, which does it for all the tiles eight hours and nets you half that much per tile. And the best part is: you need to manually collect all collected things by clicking on them. Then wait for it to grow out again. Which won't start until you collect the resources. Then once it grew out, you need to order them to start saturating it again. So much fun to be had! But wait, it gets even better: if you pay money, you don't even need to wait for all this fun, it happens instantly! And you should pay, because getting 10 resources is not even nearly enough, you need about 100 to build the silliest of buildings. Then upgrading it, of course, which costs even more.\n\nThat's about the management part, but worry not, there is  COMBAT  like in every proper game! And it even gets you resources, so you can have more fun faster! But not so fast. First the concept: there are different units, which is the gathering of soldiers. A battlefield can hold 9 units on each side. To create a unit, you need to build a corresponding building, which gives you one unit of the type you want. There are barracks, archery ranges and stables, for starters. When a building is finished, you are asked to pick one of 4 possible units to be linked to the building. Too bad, two of them are more powerful and you can only buy them for real money, so get your wallet ready! More advanced barracks housing knights are avalaible later in the game but I don't think a living human being played this game long enough to get that far. One unit consists about 16-18 men, so that's about 150 dudes fighting against 150 other, assuming there are no siege engines shooting an army, because they are substracted from the lineup and are shooting offscreen. This is the Originally posted by Store Page: Large scale battles  I was promised, but it's okay, gotta give some suspension on disbelief. In Fall of the Samurai more people died in a single battle than in the entire war, historically.\n\nThe battle system is having the 9 units forming 3 rows and 3 columns, practically making a square. The first 3 lines charge each other and... you watch them fight. In the charging period you need to click once to get a charge bonus. Once a unit is beaten, the one behind them takes its place and starts fighting. There is no flanking if you have taken one of the columns, you just watch units 1v1 each other until one of them drops dead. Archers are worthless because there is a global cooldown on the fire order and at best they can kill 4 dudes from an idle unit before the frontline collapses. And you can never expect an archer unit to excel in melee.\n\nFor winning battles you get some resources, then you will wait 10-20 minutes for your injured units to heal. But fear not tovarich, you just need to pay and they are healed instantly.\n\nOh, and these are game-generated opponents of course. I have not met a way to play against other players besides inviting a friend to a duel, which is a waste of time. Basically: this is a f2p  single player  game which expects you to pay money for its incompetent gameplay. I'm sure they have plans for multiplayer and whatnot, but I honestly feel sorry for programmers who have to work on this pile of unfun ♥♥♥♥.\n\ntl;dr: The design is irredeemable ♥♥♥♥, so do yourself a favour and don't install it. Even better; forget it ever existed\n\nPros:\n-Water physics on the map are cool! You can grow crops and trees faster, if you make it flow next to them!\n\nCons:\n-This "game" exists","April 22, 2015","false","13.7"," 52 of 70 people (74%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","74","52","70","25","4"

In my opinion though, it is painfully p2p (pay to progress), everything you need to do takes way too long and it leaves the player sitting there with nothing to do.\n\nNo matter what you think about this game, you probably aren't really having much fun anyways as this is a passable IOS game at best.\n\nPS. ♥♥♥♥ you Sega\n","April 11, 2015","false","8.3"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","14"

The combat is plodding and has no depth, a severe limit to army size and variety, global cooldown when you tell a group of archers to shoot(must be a bug) so you have to wait to even give the order to attack, and limited maneuverablility when in combat which is frustrating.\n\nThe city building is decent if simple but trying to build where you want in the geography is needlessly complicated-roads and bridges can only be built on certain elevations. Excavating on land next to a body of water flooded stone I managed to find, building dams and trying to release the water somehow to get the stone didn't work so I gave up.\n\nBuildings and missions are gated behind a honor system which you gain by doing small quests(mostly just building up your city and battles) the early game is very slow and tedious. Building actions like gathering resources or earning money can take hours of time but can be expedited by using purchasable currency, also certain combat buffs can be purchased. Rather than have different outfits for your avatar or skins for units as their money maker his is where the developers chose to setup the gameshop, a clear pay-to-win formula.\n\nAs it stands the game does not offer anything of value worth the effort of installing and hours of waiting involved to get anywhere.","April 10, 2015","false","2.1"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","36","45","0","0"

I dont recommend it at all anymore. Even as an Idle game.\nThe combat is simple and fun, like rock-paper-scissors fun, and the game has a few cool features like terraforming the land...but thats about it.\n\nThe reward for actively playing is extra silver or resorces for winning in combat. You spend that to build up your kingdom. The only reason to build up your kindom is to build barracks to build your army. Everything else like farming, mining, and tree harvesting, is just too cumbersome to even bother. What they do in hours, your army can do in moments all on its own. Most idle games continue their task whether you are on or not. This game, when assigned to harvest, it does it, but once its done with the task, it stops until you tell it to go again. Now doing this for every farm, mine, blacksmith, tavern, peasant house, and tree farm, It gets cumbersom and annoying. Their timers dont end at similiar times, and the amount of resorces you get for it is minimal. Not to mention, you are out those resorces if you log in late.\n\nIf the pace on resource gathering was a bit faster, and resource buildings were automatic, this wouldnt be a bad game. But since thats combersome, and there is no need for it anyway...there is no point. Taking the fun out of both sides of the game. I would play a game with a map like that if everything about it was more along the lines of the normal Total War franchise. With scaleable armies, resource management, and rewards you for your time.","April 12, 2015","false","8.4"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","33","43","4","0"

There.  You’re warned.\n\nOf the handful of free-to-play, castle-style games I’ve tried, they have been a handful too many.  Stronghold Kingdoms was either too lonely or filled with inter-House drama.  Sparta: War of Empires was too deceptive with its trailers and required zero micro.  Kingdom Wars had too many bugs and performed too poorly.  Upon reading several negative reviews, I convinced myself internally that this game would prove no better.\n\nTotal War Battles: KINGDOM is none of any of those bad things.\n\nKINGDOM, firstly, plays very, very smoothly and quickly.  Controls are responsive and the game doesn’t waste your time.  “But stuff takes forever to grow and collect!!”  Not my point.  When you are in-game and interacting with the world, you don’t encounter slowdowns, or annoyingly-long cutscenes, or needless exposition.  The engine is a well-oiled machine, undoubtedly.  The music is also really good, complementing the game without getting in the way.\n\nKINGDOM’s depth really sells it, mind you.  The Realm overworld map is hex-based in style, with each space viable for manipulation: elevation, irrigation, terrain type, etc.  Building placement encourages wise structure layout.  During battles, your formation and tactics matter in equal measure. (a qualm I have is that the archers’ ranged attack acts like an ability and does not auto-fire on enemies; I assume this is done to encourage micro, but it’s more tedious than tactical)  Warfare requires very simple, but constant, micro.  It’s not too overwhelming, but also not "set and forget."\n\nAnd judging by the speed at which units gain experience and upgrade, there is so, so much more to do.\n\n“But Gold makes it pay-to-win!!”\n\nAccept it.  There is no way around that.  The amount of PvE and personal kingdom development, and strictly optional PvP (there's almost always a PvE option to quests), however, mean there’s more than enough to do without interacting with another human online.  And the prices for most things is extremely minimal in cost.  Need a boost this battle?  Sac 3 Gold.  Desperately need that bit of Wood absolutely right now?  1 Gold for your troubles.  The costs do not murder the player’s treasury, and a variety of in-game methods offer the chance to accumulate Gold independent of any real money you spend on the game.\n\nThe game does not persistently badger you to share with your Facebook friends with annoying pop-ups every time you successfully gather grain, or pester you to buy Gold every 3 minutes.  The option is up there, quietly sitting on its own, not bugging you.  Mad props for not beating the player over their head with it.\n\nTL;DR: Total War Battles: KINGDOM is not your average free-to-play, castle-style title.  It is indeed better than the simplistic tripe that passes on most on mobile devices or sits in the back tab of web browsers.  I would recommend people try it simply because it runs so blasted smoothly, but the profundity to the grand strategy of it all may arguably keep you hooked.","September 17, 2015","true","159.6"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","23","26","3","0"

The costs are insanely high and make it impossible for me to enjoy TWBK.\n\nGranted it is still a BETA and I hope for a though rebalancing.

I was amazed at the amount of money they were pouring into the game.\n\nOver a few days the gulf between me an non pay to win against a pay to win was evident and very frustrating as it is almost a guarentee that they win the PvP. I would get the same pay to win person over and over. Other non payers must be loosing interest, also being frustrated.\n\nOn the other hand you don't need to play PvP and can do quest/mission battles instead. However at 20 mins wait for a lvl 2 unit to heal if NOT PAYING means I waste too much time looking and waiting for things to click....\n\nSo the micro management, A lot of the time you do things and then find out you can't get what you need, ie you build a 2nd knights quaters to recruit more knights only to find you are restricted to only one knight. The reasource collecting is not bad at first but becomes painful as you progress with high costs and too many things you need to improve to increase your reasource pool, with things having different producer times you can spend hours on the game looking and waiting 5 mins between doing something and really when you look back you haven't actually achieved much.\n\nIt's a nice looking addictive game and the battles can be fun and frustrating, the tactics are quict simple and rely more on differences in army units and how quick you can click but over all there is little strategy to the game. The strategy is basically what to build where, how to maximim and prioritise reasources.\n","April 19, 2015","false","32.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

It is not meant to be.\nIt is also not pay to win, because there is no winning, and the wait times for things like growing crops and such are a few hours, perfectly reasonable for this type of game.\n\nNow for my review. To put it briefly, good idea but needs work. The game essentially tries to combine elements of Total War, Civilization, and farmville-style games into one. The problems?\n1. the Total War element, the battles, are terrible. Wayy to basic and repetetive, battle maps are too small. Not fun. Also the rewards are so minimal there is little incentive to do them.\n2. There is no purpose, drive to the game. No reason to push forward and in that sense the farmville-style element of it is a little too strong.\n\nFor the above two reasons, I would not recommend this game. As I play this, I really just get the urge to play Total War or Civilizations, it does not do what it should to mesh these game types together in a way that can stand alone.","August 17, 2015","false","10.4"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MewmewGirl/recommended/300080/","MewmewGirl","MewmewGirl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MewmewGirl/","259 products in account","I'm extremely conflicted about recommending this game.  So let me say that overall I'd recommend it as a single player game, but the multi-player mode is just as most reviews here say.  Multi-player is pay to win.\n\nThere are enough reviews that talk about just how pay to win the multi-player part of the game is and that's the part I would not recommend, so I'm just going to skip talking about that.  Let's just say those people are absolutely correct and there are plenty of reviews that talk about it if you want to read about it.\n\nWhat I do recommend is playing the game as a single player game.  It's a pretty okay simulation if you avoid playing against people who have paid to build themselves up.\n\nAlone you have this season changing strategy game where the elements can work against you.  Most people will be warned about Flooding early on, semi ignore the warning, and then be wrecked when that first flood comes in.  You can build dams but they can break depending on how much pressure is on them.\n\nEvery season brings changes to the game and some things you have to do over a number of seasons.  For instance, you can semi recover from some flooding issues and get land back if you build temporary dams and then make a channel that leads the water to the sea - but there will be some places that the water can still be stuck depending on how you dug things out.  If you try to deal with it during most seasons the water is too deep to do much and you can't build it up.  If you wait until winter when the water freezes, you can chip out the ice and then bend the landscape to however you want it - considering of course that the high waters will return sometime along.\n\nAs you play more functions open up that are somewhat interesting.  And while the game may not be super deep at the moment (there's a Campaign that supposedly is coming but it isn't in the game yet) it's pretty decent for a free to play game if you just do the single player stuff.\n\nYou can take as much time as you want building up and such before doing things in the single player version, you see exactly who and what you're going against before you take them on, etc.\n\nThe novelty of what happens during the season changes will probably wear off over time and all I'm sure.  But for a while if you stick to the single player version of the game it's actually pretty cool and recommended.\n\nFighting others is completely voluntary, so if you want to try this game out you can do so without fear of being destroyed by overpowered pay to win players.\n\nThere are always options in expanding your realm so far so that you can avoid ever having to do the multi-player part of the game if you don't want to.  It definitely can be more costly than just doing some multi-player battles but at least there still is a way to avoid them if you want here (although that's only a good thing because the multi-player game is pay to win, if it was more fair there wouldn't be a lot of reason to avoid it).\n\nI know there will be people that are upset the multi-player portion is pay to win and they won't play the game at all, they will keep far away from it because of that.  That is fine and great if you want to do that.  For me I'd rather just play the single player portion and let the Devs see I'm happy with that part of the game but not the multi-player part.  It's totally up to you what to do with your time but if you want to test it out you can get in with a quick download and test the waters (so to speak - you'll see what I mean :P) in the single player portion without worrying about dealing with the Wallet Warrior Whales that may dominate the multi-player game.","March 28","true","7.3"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

So here we go.\n\nI am a pretty easy person to please and this is actually my first negative review amongst all the other positive reviews i've gone over, so I hope in knowing that this adds just a little more gravity onto how I disliked this "Game".\n\nI don't think it is as harsh as some make it out to be but it sure isn't anything special, far from it. Compared to the other Total War Games, this feels even inferior to Medieval Total war 1 which at the time I had a hell of a time playing. If the combat at all is even the slightest related to the other total war games then it is an extremely bland and boring version of it. If my Horsemen are at all in trouble of spearmen why can't I dog pile the rest of my men to help aid the in trouble horsemen from the spearmen? But whats that? I can volley arrows at them and hit my own horsemen too? As realistic as it is my other men standing around with nothing to do either behind the horsemen or next to them can also not engage for a sheer number pile up.\n\nI guess it's entertaining for a few minutes but just gets bland. There isn't any real mechanic or system that makes it fun yet. It's pretty mild through and through and it does an annoying job at giving you offers to spend gold on....probably anything and everything in this game which of course makes it PTW. This is definitely more the speed of IOS. Yes, IOS. It feels more ment for IOS then PC and if you want my honest opinion i'm seriously sick of these PTW long time wait and manangment games which dangle offers of temptation to caress your thigh while they ever so seductively slip their other hand into your pocket and take out your time and wallet.\n\n"I don't wait for games, Games wait for me." -It is a known fact video gamers hate waiting to play a game, probably the #1 most annoying things in video games....did you guess it? Loading screens and any means that breaks the player away from the game for amounts of time. If anybody ever says they like waiting on games be it loading screen or timer, it will probably be because between that time they can have a moment to grab a few more potato chips.","April 13, 2015","false","2.2"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","21","30","7","0"

People compare this to other total war titles and, of course, it falls short of expectations. The truth is this really is something different. The only reasons it has the total war stamp is for publicity and because it also has a historical backdrop. However, this is not a bad game.\n\n1st - it is multi-dimensional: There is the aspect of building your land, yes, but there is also the aspect of battles.\n\n2nd - there is change: water rises and lowers; there are floods and droughts, and there are seasons which significantly change the way you play the game, so it stays fresh. Also, there are a lot of combinations of units you can use in battle, and even more unplayable units, for example danes and picts.\n\n3rd - waiting is not crippling: Remember this is a mobile game. Things take time to build, and people have lives. If there was no waiting, a dedicated idiot who played 16h a day would win the game easily. Instead, everyone has a chance if they can actually fight, which brings us to battles. if your units don't lose too many people, you don't have to wait. Waiting is a punishment for losing battles, or a necessary thing for building and collecting resources. Also, people keep saying this game has 8h waiting periods, but most times the waiting is 20 mins or so. It is like that with units and most collecting resources. If you decide to fell a whole forest, yeah, it is gonna take 8h, but that is dumb to begin with. Forests don't just grow back, certainly not when you wipe the whole thing out at the same time.\n\n4th - though gold can help you win, you cannot pay to win after the first few weeks. Once people actually have time to craft some special units, it becomes impossible to pay to win. The only ways you can help yourself with gold is by not waiting (which helps very little) and by getting special units (which you can also craft, though that takes longer), and special bonuses (which, again, you can craft). It is a known fact that, if you spend too much money on a game, you get bored easily and stop playing - too much money, too little reward. So after the first few weeks, older players who stick with it will be mopping the floor with younger players with lots of money.\n\n5th - Again, this is not a proper total war title. This is for waiting rooms, for work breaks, for commuting, etc. If you want a past time for that, this is a good choice. If you want a game to play at home, do yourself a favor and buy rome and/or attila. That's what steam sales are for.\n\n6th - comparison with other mobile games: this game is so much better than any other mobile games i've seen, it is not even fair. Candy crush, farmville, and the like are basically the same thing over and over again. There is very little difference. Also, here at least you get a (very tiny albeit existant) bit of history. You at least learn that there were picts and danes in england. To be honest, there should be more information about that, as well as about the game mechanics. But this is a beta, so I expect that will eventually show up - I HOPE. And you can just enjoy a casual game. If you want something else, something more encompassing, get another game.\n\nStill, not bad. For what it is.","April 20, 2015","true","168.8"," 51 of 85 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","51","85","6","2"

It reminds me of Paradise Life with castles.  Quite simply no reason to continue playing.  Last month of gameplay for me was logging in for 2 minutes to gather resources and restart constructions, then exit and go play something fun.\n\nCity building, terrain altering, and water mechanics were fun.\n\nCrafting system is terrible and very grindy, in addition to relying on RNG.  This is your alternative to the gold shop if you want the better available combat units and equipment; and not much of one at that.\n\nBattles are pay to win.  You will see people say that it is not pay to win because you can get all the same things if you grind enough.  That is technically true; but it takes so long to grind for those things that you are at a severe disadvantage for a really long time.  You can pay to win now, or grind to win a long time from now.\n\nIn addition, I had first installed this game on my PC and played for a while.  Once it was released, I installed it on my phone and logged into my (same) account.  My Kingdom on PC and on my Phone were completely separate despite being on the same account.  Not cross-compatible.\n\nI do not recommend this game.  Do not waste your time like I did.

Now, no.\n\nFirstly, they shrank the size of the map, not just overall but also the individual territories, this makes no sense whatsoever. Yeah sure they said it was too "allow for easier management of towns" but that is Bull because it was easy enough as it was. Now it's just too small and everything is increadibly cramped.\n\nSecondly, the water is completely screwed to hell. Seriously, I like the fertile land idea, where tiles within 2 of water are considered fertile, that makes complete sense for wheat field, but not for forests. Thanks to the shrunken map I can't even find a "large" forest to use the tracking on. Which is also increadibly broken now. FLOODING is out of control, even when a dam is built on a "Very High" tile (which is the highest elevation in the game) I have dams breaking left and right and flooding entire territories now.\n\nThirdly, Quarrying. This mechanic was not broken whatsoever in 0.2 but now it is beyond okay. Sure the prospect mechanic was a nice idea but the follow through looks like one guy in a dark room put it together in 2 hours. It's completely worthless. Why? Because it will put it say, next to the water (where you wouldn't dig ever anyways) or in the middle of land that can't be dug because of surrounding terrain. We need to control this not hte AI, give us control of where we dig for things and it will be fine, but as it is, this mechanic is broken beyond all hell.\n\nOverall this update (which reset all accounts costing everyone everything) is worthless in reality. The follow through is terrible, the shrunken map is terrible, and the quarrying is terrible. Honestly the update is much like a massive step backwards and I would seriously wait to play this until they either patch these horrible things (the map being too small now, the prospect mechanic being illogical and the flooding) or just waiting for the 0.4 update. This game was a ton of fun to drop in for some time and collect resources, do a few battles and then go off and do something back.

The soldiers look amazing and historically accurate, the buildings are cool to gaze at;\n- I really enjoy the feature of having an ever increasing map where you can build your kingdom the way you like it, aswell as being able to manipulate water, props for that one;\n- As a Medieval fan, I do enjoy how you start as a small lord commanding only levies and slowly growing your army to more professional units, according to your kingdom development, the idea is there however it's dampered by the ever present and obligatory need to pay. (Point will be developed in the negative aspects);\n- Finally, I enjoy the battles. They are very simple yet once you get to command a decent size force, you'll be able to see that one wrong move and it could be devastating, making it a more realistic and intense game of chess.\n\nNow onto the negative aspects:\n\n- I do know this is a Beta, but never have I seen a game forcing you so much to pay-to-win. After the tutorial (which is quite fast due to the bountyful gold you have at your disposal) you start to realize that the game isn't all it's cracked up to be;\n- I do enjoy the battles as I've previously mentioned but they aren't as large scale as the advert promisses. Allbeit, the game is not ment to be a fully fledged Total War game, however, you are very limited to the quantities of units you can have at your disposal, this could be fixed if a fourth line could engange instead of only three, but looking at the tendency of the game I'm sure if this feature is implemented it'll require for you to pay;\n- I don't like how you have to wait almost and entire day to do anything productive. Like I said, after the tutorial, the game slows down due to pay-to-win restrictions, however there are some features that can't even be bi-pased with money such as gathering resources through the facilities. I also have to mention that once you are able to withstand the patience of waiting 8h or more to harvest a resource, you only get a tiny tickle of that resource, making the waiting so insufferable;\n- Once again, the pay-to-win is definatly a must in this game, due to the fact that players tend to have the most fun battling other players, but this game has a hug disadvantage for players that don't really wish to waste that much money or no money at all. If you are like me, who doesn't risk real-life money on games like this, then don't bother playing the Duel feature. Every player I have met had dozens of pay-to-win units. I don't even like how all you can do is just battle the players, you can't even influence or destroy their kingdom or even sack it. All you do is click on search play and one will be provided and you have to hope to the GODS, that you don't face a rich player.\n- Finally, it seems that the game still needs to be balanced. I noticed a huge difficulty spike when I upgraded the rank of one of my levies to 2. The NPC battles just became mostly unbeatable, maybe I'm just bad but when those Viking 3 ranked units appeared agaisn't my ranked 1 swordmen and rank 2 levies, there was no need to even bet on who would win, so I just stook to Normal and Easy battles just to get a bit of fun out of the game.\n\nVeredict:\n\nAs it stands, Total War Battles: KINGDOM, is a game full of potential for growth and could become a very enjoyable browser game and could attrack casual gamers for a more military historical style game and maybe even convince them and a few others to join the amazing Total War Community. The game is fun at first, but the huge need to pay for gold really makes the player feel bored and outraged with how it shoves in your face how you really need to pay your hard earned cash to build that tavern!\nIf it wasn't for this huge need to pay-to-win and a bit more variety of gameplay instead of just battling the same army over and over again until you level up a few decent levels, then, the game would actually be good, but right now it's still bare-bones, and that is visible in the Multiplayer aspect. Let's hope CA manages to fix all these problems.\n\nI give it 4.5/10","April 13, 2015","false","51.9"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

No, because i know they need to make money but the way their doing in this game is horrible. im not aginst players paying to have "boosts" as in they collect more resources faster or gain more XP but being able to pay and have god units or to collect one barrle of wheat for 8 hrs is just so dang stupid, and for all you who are defeanding this game (who are most liekly the pay to win players ofcourse their enjoying this) why put that much money into it when you can just go buy Attlia or SHogun 2 and have waaaay more fun?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/masbroo/recommended/300080/","masbroo","gebratene indomie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/masbroo/","87 products in account","If I have the right to give points to this game, I'd give it 5,5/10. I know it is the first day of release and it is possible that a lot of content are going to come in the future, but this phase of development are still filled things that deeply dissatisfies me. Some of the reasons are listed below:\n\n1. Too much freemium.\n\n1.a 50% of the units you can train ingame can only be bought (at this moment) by gold, which is the real world currency translation ingame. Albeit these units are beatable, it would took a lot of effort to beat one, especially the cavalry units.\n\n1.b To upgrade your units with armors and weapons, you need gold. Sure the first upgrades are purchasable: +2 damage or +2 defense for 18 golds. But +4 damage for 3 times the price? And +6 damage for 8 times the price of the 1st item? Personally I'm not going to think its worth my while.\n\n1.c Costumization ain't costumzation at all. First, the original costumization is very, very limited. And guess what could you do to get another color or pattern scheme? 45 golds at minimal. If I'm to unlock all costumization possible, I'd probably able to spare for a meal in a restaurant.\n\n1.d Speeding up times; unless you are very patient on your woodcutter and farm, you might want to check this game once every 20 minutes, since it is usually the interval between starting things and things get done. 20 Stones for 1 hour is long enough, 20 silver for 4 hours and you have to collect workers and send them to work in the smith? The quicker way to get money is really just being a problem solver: fighting picts, rebels, and vikings.\n\n1.e Your army is too weak to beat up vikings? Don't worry, just with 2 or 3 golds per battle, you can gain support from mercenaries, or buy flaming arrow for the duration of the battle, or hire an old man as your short-time military advisor.\n\n2. Landscaping system: your enemy and your friend. With thelandscaping system in place, players are faced with new challenges in city building: floods and height control. Some buildings require landscaping which albeit payable with ingame resources, are quite fussy. There are some restrictions on landscaping which might forces you to destroy and rebuilt buildings quite often. I just visited the forum and found a thread about flooding. If this is true, then you would want to keep watch on the game for flooding, since flooding literally disrupts your army and silver income.\n\n3. Complicated building system. As said, you don't only need reaources to build buildings, you need other things you want to consider before building things: leaving enough space for other buildings to connect indirectly to your castle being one example. The other one is how much space would your farms take to maximize your food output or the reach of your woodcutter to maximize your wood output. Or how many houses or slums or mansions you have to build if you want to keep your blacksmiths running smoothly.\n\n4. Quests that are "too demanding" SPOILER ALERT: DO NOT HUNT ANY DEERS, COLLECT ANY BOULDERS, OR GATHER ANY DEADWOODS YET IF YOU ARE NOT YET LEVEL 10 (or about that level). The quests might look easy, but if you're a type that plays expansively (gather all the resources as soon as possible, etc) this might be quests that are unfinishable, since respawn of such resources took quite a long time if they respawn at all.\n\n5. Time. Yes, this has probable been the major complains of everyone: the game time. The battles are too short, the resource gathering took ages. If you've wasted all your resources on a building, getting it back might took hours and the games' pace would be significantly getting slower. A quite difficult battle might last for 3 minutes, while gathering resource took 20. The damage sustained by your units are healable between 18 to 5 minutes, so if you lost a unit in combat, you have to wait for a couple of minutes until it reaches full health, or pay gold. Although the healing are automatic and all units are heals itself directly after an engagement, the time between would leave a gaping hole of doing nothing.\n\n6. XP system: The XP system are probably the real reason you want to set throught those 17 minutes of healing your cavalry to get it readey for the next battle, since the more XPs you got, the more you can spend them on your units stats, which makes fights easier and more managable. If you're a military genius who can keep all your units alive at the end of the battle, it might not present as much difficulty, but if you're just a casual player, be careful since the drill is real. Although the enemies catch up to you (so the difficulty keeps increasing) the XP does not. After beating an easy battle with all your units surviving, you might get at most 9 XP points. In chalenging battles you might get 12 or more. If you want to add 3 more soldiers into your unit, you need 250 XP. which means getting more than 20 chalenging battles done with all units intact. Add waiting time to the equation and you get about half a day of grinding before you can add 3 more soldiers into your unit.\n\nI guess that's all of my complaints for now at this game. Besides the almost unbearably slow speed of this definitely freemium game, I feared that if the development team keeps up with this kind of freemium-style gameplay, things would crumble pretty quickly, and I would personally avoid PVP since playing PVP in this game would seem to be a long stretch for your regular ol'gamer. Yes the design and how the battle works are actually quite good, but with the system currently in place, I'd say you'd rather save your money for other games instead of putting it in this game, maybe on rome or shogun II, or other titles you might like, and generally, stay away from this game for the time being.","April 10, 2015","false","14.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

Downvoted! Rawr, rawr, rawr!\n\nI never played the Total War games so I don't have to contend with the usual "I love this franchaise, lets watch it get disemboweled", but having played this game I would like to play more TW games. This game is almost the usual free to play fare in that you have a city to build and it has timers. If you have played ANY free to play game then you know the deal.\n\nWhat I like about TWB:K is that, get this, you don't recruit peasants and then turn them into soldiers! You build a barracks and BAM you get troops. Troops also don't die?! Is this even a free-to-play game!? Instead they go on a cooldown/respawn timer.\n\nThis means you can fight and fight as much as you want. Yes you read that correctly, no stamina system! This game does so many things right compared to its competitors thats its almost a full fledged game in its own right. If the town didn't have cooldown timers for building things, you would be forgiven for thinking it was a full free game like Relic Hunters.\n\nThe downvotes and negative reviews this game has do make sense however because had this game been called, Flower Patch Kingdoms it would probably have had a lot of good reviews, but as it stands, it is not a Total War game in almost any sense of the word so for people who play Total War games you really want to avoid this game.\n\nFor everyone else, this game is fun, I recommend it. With, however, a huge 'Cavet Emptor'.\nThis game is balanced, very balanced infact oddly too balanced infact. You can't pay for an advantage, which I like, always a fan of that but what makes this game so 'oddly balanced' is that each troop has about 3 counters to it so their is no 'best unit'. This is fine for PvP and tough skirmishes, but when you are grinding mooks for resources you can't take a break and just hammer out fights for resources.\n\nEvery fight demands your full attention because one wrong move, wrong match up, wrong ability used at the wrong time, failure to charge, you get the idea. The battles are busy so grinding in itself becomes something you need to mentally take a break from. A real life stamina system as it were.\n\nThat doesn't mean the game is bad, but who is the target audience? People like me who are new to TW? Or casual gamers, whom this free2play market is usually targetted at?\nIf you ever wanted to get into the Total War series then this is the game for you. If you are a casual gamer, give it a try as it costs you nothing anyway and you might enjoy it. If you are a Total War veteran, download it so you can downvote it You know you want too.\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","September 29, 2015","false","25.9"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","15","26","4","0"

I did not even get far enough to see if it is pay to win, looking at it, doesn't look pay to win but heck even if it was- its like saying Daikatana is pay to win. Oh nooooooo!!\n\nCities:\nHonestly I don't care how good this is. Maybe it is good I don't know.What this game has to hold it up would be good battles.\n\nBattles:\nReally game? '3 lanes' with nearly turn based combat that is clearly made to be played on a tablet/phone? You put your little dudes in the right lane setups and then use rock paper scissors style combat with minimal input(click on your dudes at the right time to charge! Use a taunt on those archers!).\n\nMaybe if you like timegated games with turn based combat this could be fun. As someone who likes total war games this is not for me.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwCD53wlDgs < go play some actual total war\n\nSure this could be a decent game for your phone. I don't know that. As it is on my pc as a 1.6GB download, I get to compare it to things like:\n-League of legends\n-Cities Skylines/any other total war game\n-World of Tanks\n-Age of Empires Online\n-Any facebook game\n-Cookie Clicker\n\nAs such this game focuses on being lite strategy and a little building expansion game.

But ther is too much P2W feeling since the game is designed to force you to either spend some money or wait for days for somewhat higher end stuff. I can see CA put in some good efforts in the game, like having seasonal changes and stuff. However, the gameplay just falls short of expectation due to the p2w factors being too stronk.\n\nFor a F2P game like this, it is much better not to be so blunt about microtransactions while providing some gameplay with more depth and fun factors. I would rather spend 100 bucks on Kancolle than this thing.\n\nAlso, BUGS! I constantly getting d/c when trying to do a battle quest. and when I logged back, it just locks my army saying that it is in a duel for hours.

However, there are quiet a few cons to it as well.\n\nPROS :\n- Easy to learn (tutorials are great)\n- Free\n- Has multiplayer and a friend system\n- Has many types of buildings; the developers have thought about balancing these buildings prices and their purposes\n- Mining is especially fun, when finding out what resource you will discover\n\nCONS:\n- Gold is extremely overpowerful as a resource, and is able to be bought\n- Gold can be exhanged for every other material\n- Inabilities can sometimes make the game boring\n\nRECCOMENDATION TO CUSTOMER:\nI reccomend this game as it is very enjoyable and can keep you hooked hours on end. But, be wary of this pay-to-play system (although it's exaggerated by the reviewers), and think about if your wasting Gold.\n\nFEEDBACK TO THE DEVELOPERS & PRODUCERS:\nLook, you may be looking at all of those negative reviews and feel like you get no feedback; and say "Whats the point."\nBut, if you make some changes (examples listed below), people may feel more optimistic about this game.\n- Make Gold not able to be exhanged for other materials\n- Lower the hours it takes to build things, to minutes\n- Keep the use of Gold as a 'catalyst' for building\n- Keep the use of Gold for changing 'Profile' and 'Coat of Arms' aesthetics\n- Take away the use of Gold to get high level troops, make it possible with upgrading barracks and such\n- Add the use of Gold to be able to customise what your troops look like (without affecting their battle attributes e.g: Damage, Defence etc)\n- If you want to not have any more bad reviews about pay-to-win; I say put a price on the game, and refund anyone that payed money into it\n\nFEEDBACK SUMMARY:\nThanks for reading, and just making a few of these needed changes would make the player base alot less toxic.\n\n","June 2","true","18.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Being a diehard strategy fan, the series rubbed me in all the right spots. Unfortunately this one is a blemish on CA and the series. I understand that it may get better and that it’s still in development but oi vay. Anyway on to my review, the good points are that this game has a fun geo terrain aspect to it in which you can alter terrain to move water and rivers around. This can be fun and challenging at times as during flooding season your whole city can be flooded if you don’t know what you’re doing. I also enjoyed the tile aspect of buildings in which you can get different bonuses depending on how you pair up buildings and where you place them. The battles are scaled down obviously as this is aimed for tablet and phone platform. This kills strategy completely as battles come down to how upgraded your troops are and what gear you have purchased or smithed for them. Early on the only way to get good gear is to spend real cash on it, this gear will open up and be possible to craft later on in the game but you have to make it far to be able to do that. This makes the early phases very pay 2 win as you will struggle against even AI w/o gear. And dont get me started on other players, I didnt even mess with PvP after a few tries as the 5 people I tried fighting completly demolished me because all their troops were high end and fully maxed on gear where as I did not spend money and decided to get ther gear the hard way. The other aspect of battles is the charge mechanic in which you dictate when your squad charges the enemy. Your troops slowly start moving toward one another and if you time it right and click on the squad at the right time to charge you can get a damage bonus. This is very basic and has no strategy to it, to me the total war series was all about the battle mechanics. Now I know you can’t make a massive battle game work for touch screen but I feel they could have put more effort into it and included other detail. I do still want to see how it plays on my touch device though. The other downside is the ridiculous wait times to gather resources such as 8 hours for some (which has been mentioned before). I feel as though this game is aimed to take your money and nothing more, hopefully they improve it as it stand now this game was made to take your green paper with little to none fun compensation. For now, I am giving this one a thumbs down.","April 20, 2015","false","301.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

In general, the game could be cool, but from my point of view it needs a lot of polishing and maybe some mechanisms should be changed completely.\n\nLet´s start with concept of time. Personally I hate when you are gathering resources by clicking on them and these are not flowing automatically into your storage over time. Different resources people included have various time of "spawn", so you are forced to enter the game relatively often. The same thing is with battles. You fight, you win BUT when your units get hurt, you must wait until they will be allright, which can take some time and since you have nothing to do in between, you switch off and then on again to fight another battle. Once I was entering the game every 15 minutes just to fight. You can have more units and switch the healthy ones with the hurt ones but this is just a lot of senseless clicking for me. So you must be online a lot. I suppose people have life and who would like to check his online kingdom fifty times a day, right.\n\nOf course this all is so annoying in order to make people use the gold and make the game profitable for the creators. I understand making game is not a cheap adventure but this microtransaction thing should have been made differently. Instead of pushing people into using gold a lot, some real added value related to the game should be offered like special statistics, real bonus features (these what we see now should be mostly free to have things, I was badly surprised when I saw some units may be only purchased by gold!!!) and other stuff. Players could gain increase of production or whatever, but none of it should leave the impression of pathetic need for player´s money. The gold is present like EVERYWHERE which doesn´t make a good impression.\n\nI would still not call the game Pay to win, but Pay to make it playable.\n\nAnd the last thing I wanted to talk about, the battles. When you realize it is only rock paper scissors concept, it takes all the fun out of it. Not even two units of pikemen defeated one unit of swordsmen. Also you really can not swith unit´s places, just at the beginning of the batlle, after that, no chance. I know I know, there are these abilities and everything but I still have a feeling that you either win easily or lose "easily" depending only on what the deployment of armies at the beginning was.\n\nI was really looking forward to this game, try to give it more time so that I would see all the things, but honestly some things should be changed. So I am giving NO recommendation for now.\nBtw If anyone knows how to make forest grow or whatever, I would be gratefull, maybe level 2 woodcutter plants them? Slowly all the forests are disappearing from my country and I dont know what to do with it. :D","April 15, 2015","false","11.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

In the last year or so we have seen so many of these games, mine resources and anothers base. However never have we seen something like this on this scale, on PC. This mix of continuous world strategy and good old real time strategy battles seems to work quite well, however some of those battles can get a little confusing.\n\nIssues such as markability and platform prefrencing are big issuse CA is going to have to think about. One of my biggest issues with this game is the realism scenario, does CA really expect me to sit at my computer for 30-60 mins playing a game like this, its not the sort of game you do that with. I dont know about you but I dont really feel like sitting at my PC waiting 30 mins for something to be collected.\n\nNow dont get me wrong there are a lot of good features about this game and I thought battles would be one of them, I wouldnt say I was wrong they do have some fun parts to them, like seeing those little guys dance for victory or the dead corpses for lose. But one of the battles most basic mechanics have been totaly screwed up, 'charges' more like a nice walk in the park unless the person controling you is sliding his mouse across his desk back and forth like a maniac. Look I seriously think that this could work on an iPad or Tablet but seriously a PC?\n\nI think there are large chunks of this game that are really purpose built for iPad's and or Tablets. Overall I wouldnt say its a bad game, because its not but there is still a lot of improvements to be done before I will consider calling it a polished game. I know lots of you die hard fans will disagree with me but that the point of a review, me giving my opinion.

Then play about just one year of this game, across all titles, and really think about a new name. Total War: Heaxgon Grind Madness Campaign Pack Ever Moneythirst DLC.\nIt's wrong in every damn way.\nI don't care the game is p2w, thats not the problem, it's just CA testing how much can they abuse on this name in the name of profit.\nThe big challenge here, it's to fit hexagonal buildings that they get the most of proximity bonus, in a map flooding with water. Battle mechanic's isn even worth mentioning.\nU will see urself not even able to create a flag if u dont get into it some good amount of money, for a color, and it feels so grindy, DAMN CA! im playing X-COM:EW and other good games really smooth on my tablet, its not a bad ideia, but it's so messed up.  Sad seeing a big company, with a big feedback do this. 2/10 for clean interface, but would give it a 3 if it was called CLASH OF TYRANTS, or EMPIRE WARS at App Store.\n\nthis\nthis\nthis\nthis.... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\n\nCheck this:\n\n-FEATURES\n\n1-Build and expand your Kingdom, with farms, quarries, blacksmiths and more.\nNope. understand it more like, 1 unit = 1 building, chain it right, grind it a lot. Building and planning a kingdom it's not about that as i will say in the last FEATURE you are announcing.\n\n2-Alter the land by creating rivers, lakes and mountains.\nSpam blockades, with a really messed up sistem, just to try to make your farm safe, and watch a strange mechanic block you everywhere until you build more.\n\n3-Command your army in large-scale battles.\nHav nothing to say about this, u just set up ur army and click to charge making the time right. But if you buy a reinforcement, like more infantary damage, there may be no army to balance you. Didn't got it to multiplayer, but really would kill myself trying to build farms, blacksmiths and more.\n\n4-Battle other players in real-time.\nNot a big deal, really dont wanna see 9x9 battles about who spent the most on his units and click on charge, and you may find urself just rolling spear and horse in a 3 man line.\n\n5-Cross-Platform - Play on Phones, Tablet and PC, whenever you want, wherever you want.\nThis is positive, crossing plataforms it's a good ideia, but there are big AAA games on Steam, that migrated smoothly to Tablet's, and look amazing, they kick ♥♥♥, cause App Store it's harrasing youth with this feeding money sistem. Show that it is possible, to make a good game that it's more fun than the expectation of being good some day, but they never stop uptading and time get's bigger.\n\n6-Actions in your Kingdom will carry over onto any device you play on.\nNice, dont think that's what i'm reaally looking on a game presented by..............\n\n7-From the creators of the award-winning Total War™ games.\nAnd this single sentence gave me shame on read, i hav almost all games from this AAA, even bought some twice. Just bought the first Rome, because it is a good game! No matter how old, people are still playing big masterpieces there, about WAR, not cities, when you say this are large scale army battles, kingdom's (MTW2:K it's the franchise biggest, work, with only 4 DLC's, it's still more playable and even more enjoyable than Rome 2) and there's is potential when you say.. from the creator's of this franchise..\n\n\nDon't believe it anymore, not buying this talk once again, won't buy TW: Warhammer in a pre order, to be waiting on MOD's that fix little issues that you receive a feedback.\nPLEASE, don't turn your games the way award winning franchises are. Lot's of money, lot's of graphic's, no game immersion. Only problems, that I can fix doing research on forums (who the ♥♥♥♥ need to fix his TCP entry to play a MP award winning franchise, common..  and please  change the concept of this game or it's name!\nPut 200 hours of gameplay into ARENA, some money as well, and saw a good concept. That's a good concept, and a good presentation, on an Alpha stage, i had an amazing time, can't wait to see with all u collected from the feedback. Expectation's with your company it's always good, and when something reeeeally good as AoC make you look serious, i'm just really happy that you called that a DLC and showed what is a good DLC.

The hexagon-based simple city building has promise. I like the variation of the seasons, and that they actually have gameplay effects. I like how terrain, especially access to water, affects resource gathering. I like how terrain will change—grass will spread, trees will regrow. Combat is simple, but fun. A good mix of units, and there is room for effective tactics (and not just spamming orders buttons) to change the outcome of a battle.\n\nThe Bad:\nI do not like the running-clock mechanism; it makes the game feel like FarmVille or other FtP “FaceBook games.” Construction takes no appreciable time at all, but gathering resources hours or even days without forking over cash for in-game currency. Some of these times work (e.g. about 20 minutes to fully refresh an army after a defeat or pyric victory), others don’t (hours of quarrying for a measly 20 stone). So, really, what I don’t like is that it is free-to-play.\n\nThe Ugly:\nI think if they had kept the core of the game (the map, the combat model, terrain modification, hex-based town construction, seasonal variation), but instead reworked it as a stand-a-lone game WITHOUT the FtP model and constantly running clock, this could have been a solid “midrange” or “light” game. If seasons were “turns,” and certain things (planting, harvesting, etc.) could only be done during particular seasons, the game would be much more enjoyable to just sit an play—instead play for about an hour or less then log out and come back in 12 hours or so.

Went to bed, woke up, and realized how stupid I was.\n\nAll I can really focus on are the negatives...\n\n1. Pay to win\n- The better units require gold (which is purchased, with a very small amount coming from random events and such).  For example, a barracks allows you to recruit swordsmen, spearmen, macemen, and axemen.  The macement and axemen require gold.\n- the game is about gathering resources based on timers, but the timers can be instantly finished by spending gold.  Want tons of resources?  You can pay to get them!\n\n2. Complete utter timesink\n- Assuming you're masochistic enough to decide to play, all the timers are ♥♥♥♥ed up:\nSome are 4hours, some are 6, some are 8.  So if you want to maximize your income, you better log in all the time\n- There are battle missions which you can constantly do for more resources.\nBut heavily damaged units require time to heal (or, of course, spend more gold!  PAY TO WIN!).  These timers take around 5-30 minutes.  So again, the more you play, the more resources you get...  better check into the game all the time, or else you won't get those resources!","April 10, 2015","false","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","9"

I often have to work late and have long periods of time where I have to kill free time. Since acquring the Iphone 6 Plus, I've started playing games like Clash of Clans, COD heros and other forms of mobile games. Games that you can have quick action, such as couple of battles... then attend to resources and or upgrade buildings if need too. Saying that takes 10 minutes, then you are done, recieved a fix and move one. That's what a standard mobile game has become, that's what people do with mobile games. Play with it until something else comes up, and you come back to it in 15 minutes or 10 hours. Which total war kingdom follows that same pattern. The PC master race me, wants the climb to the tallest building AND SCREAM LIKE F*CKING INSANE PERSON at everybody! This is simply not a pc game, NOBODY WANTS TO WAIT for construction for 8 hours, PC games aren't a pick up and stop games like mobile games. This game has no right to be called a pc game and should have never launched for the pc. When I play total war on the pc, I want hard throbbing, none stop action like a chick in a gangbang. This pc version, fall quite short of that. Then again, I am looking forward to it on my Iphone 6 plus though.","August 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Instea of sweet flanking moves your stuck with lane based fighting.  Instead of huge expansive fighting maps, your stuck with tiny maps that just barely fill a 1080p screen.  Oh the graphics btw, their washed out.  Really really washed out. I mean they took the most awful pastels they could find and used those for this game.  Also, where the hell are the options?

Also, wtf is up with these time based buildings. Want some wheat? Want some ore? Yup mine it, and uh oh, it's going to take 18 minutes for that to happen.  Ofcourse you can spend gold to speed that process up.  Hmm sounds like some other cash grab games.  Oh those resources you just sped up, you gotta manually pick them up.  What a complete pile of poo.

I have been playing TW since the beginning. I downloaded and tested this game, and also bought a basic pack of gold to see, how far can I get with that. It is ridiculous. It is not only, that its a pay2win game, but it is almost impossible to do any advance (unless you spend hours every day for several months). In addition it is a terribly balanced game even with some gold.\n- The more effective units (knights, trebuchets etc.) can be only "crafted" with horrendous amount of resources or large pack of gold.\n- For example: a kinght with batlle axe costs 410 gold. At the merchant guild you can get 500 gold for 5 EUROS (REAL MONEY). So, practically even with playing the PAY version, the exchanges are RIDICULOUS. One knight with battle axe for 5 euros in a virtual game? COME ON!!!  The TW guys really went insane.\n- Unfortunately lots of people tries and pays until they realize that to complete the game would require so much time and money that no game would deserve that, especially not this one.\n- This is just the business part. I could write more about that the battles are jokes compared to previous TWs, nothing close to that. It is a pitty, because the game as a tap-and-play tablet game would be ok in terms of graphics and idea.\n\nThis game is nothing more than a resource draining venture of the evil cigarette smoking Grey Gentlemen from MOMO, COMPLETE waste of time and money.\n","March 25","false","23.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altairp/recommended/300080/","altairp","Alan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altairp/","155 products in account","I'd like to begin this review by saying that I am a great fan of Total War, and I have played almost all the games in the series - from the first Rome to the newest 'Attila'. While Creative Assembly does trip, sometimes, in the development of their games, they always manage to fix the bugs and provide additional - and fun - content to their players, in the end, and create high quality products for both strategy fans and newbies who try out the genre for the first time.\n\n'nuff said, I had high expectations for Total War Battles: KINGDOM. As always, Creative Assembly managed to meet them all, and hit the nail.\n\n\nTotal War Battles: KINGDOM is a perfect example of what Creative Assembly can make with dedication, effort and love. A blend of city building and those large scale battles we all loved, with deep gameplay and even a lil' bit of customization for our character. Players will pass hours trapped with the game on their pc (and even outside, thanks to the innovative tablet/phone support), as they create the reign of their dreams, command several troops in bloody battles, and duel against other players' armies. Total War Battles: KINGDOM is truly a high quality game of this generation.\n\n\nBut allow me to describe this game in depth, if you still are not convinced about trying it out.\n\n\nSTORY\n\nSadly, I cannot write much about this yet. This current Beta doesn't have a campaign, but I fully expect it to be released in the future, peraphs trough a cheap DLC or a transaction with the in-game 'gold'.\n\nGRAPHICS\n\nWell. The graphics on Total War Battles: KINGDOM are simply.. beautiful. The details of the landscape and buildings is truly astonishing, and the deep realism of your units' equipment, and features, will make the player be completely immersed within the game. Players will stop to stare at their screen for hours, both in the city  and battle screens, as they observe and fall in love with every graphic detail this game offers.\n\nSOUND\n\nTotal War Battles: KINGDOM's sound is well crafted, like the rest of the game, with original and innovative sounds (with some inspiration taken from ROME II) that will accompany the player during their quests and adventures. (I have to admit, however, that I overheard some of my christian soldiers talking about 'gods' during their taunts against the enemy. Peraphs the developers are planning to add a 'religion' expansion, in the future?)\n\nGAMEPLAY\n\nThe gameplay is quite different from the previous games in the Total War series. While battles are pretty much the same as the other Total War games, with numerous units battling for you against their enemies, the ability to conquer whole nations was removed. Players now control smaller kingdoms, but are able to efficently customize and control pretty much every aspect to it, like a true city-building game.\n\nIt's also worthy to mention about the realism this new game has. 'Turns' got replaced with 'hours', real life hours, that further adds to the realism of Total War Battles: KINGDOM. Everything that will be built or gathered has a timer, and the players will have to wait before the operation is complete - or speed up everything trough the aid of innocent 'Gold'.\n\n\nResources in the game are divided in 'Wood', 'Stone', 'Silver', 'Food', and 'Gold'. I don't believe that the first four require too much explanation. They can be gathered from the regions under your reign, and are required to build several buildings.\n\n'Gold', however, is quite different. This resource is only available trough cheap transactions with real-money (completely unneded, of course) and is used to speed-up constructions, resource gathering, troop healing and other processes or to buy, and obtain, new and fresh customization options for your player character, banner and temporary bonuses during battles. In my personal opinion, 'Gold' does not affect the game too much, effectively making this a non-pay-to-win game, and is only really needed if a player wants to buy innocent customizations for themselves.\n\nPlayers will utilize these resources to create their kingdom, spending them to build new buildings and create entire towns within their regions. They will be also capable of morphing the terrain based on their desires, raising or lowering the terrain and using 'dams' to block the path of rivers, preventing flooding or creating new areas where to build.\n\nBattles are pretty much the same everyone can find in the precendent games. Large armies will fight for their liege in bloody fights, and players will be able to put their personal tactics, and strategic thinking, to work. Bonuses and reinforcements are also available, with 'Gold',  that will help the player in more difficult battles.\n\n\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\n\nIn the end, Total War Battles: KINGDOM is a great and enjoyable game, with little flaws and bug despite it's beta state. I recommend every Total War fan to try out this game, since it's completely free, and my words cannot really describe how this game is. I hope that Creative Assembly, and peraphs many other game companies, will continue to provide games like this, and bring game industry to a new golden age.","April 12, 2015","false","23.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","2"

I've played the game now for around 40 hours all together and maybe 30min at one time. This is a game you come in, do so clicks go away play something else and then come back when you remeber you have it. The problem is, this is basicaly a mobile to pc port.

Example. A farm crop tile next to water growth time is around 5 hours. The same tile 2 hexagones away from water 22hours growth time... See what I mean. Time managment.

I come back 10 minutes later and find out that the game has crapped out on itself and needs me to sign back in so it can re-update.

I myself entered this game after looking through pictures, who developed it, and what its purpose is, and i find the game exellent for that.\n\nFirst of all, its not a total war game. its a total war: battles game wich is a spin of series developed by a different team then the people making shogun, rome, etc. they where aiming to create a "click on stuff and wait" game that was designed to be a bit "more", for people like my self who enjoy more advanced games as most titles from thhis genre tend to be a bit bland.\n\nAt this the game succeeds heavily. With things such as crafting units you otherwise have to pay real money for, and battles that include a lot of real time management this game manages to stand out, and i myself finds it the best in its genre from what i've seen so far. My only hopes are that when they finally introduces the "Campaign". it will resempble something like Strongholds: kingdoms inviting cooperation with friends and true wars against other players.\n\nTo summon up my review: Try the game, and don't judge it for its in-game transactions, because there is not one game in this genre that does not have them. Its how they work and without them it wouldn't be a free game.\n\nPros:\n-micromanagement for optimising you kingdom is well made\n-battles are fun and invites for creative thinking\n-the game can be played for free without beeing held back if patience and strategy is applied\n\nCons:\n-The current quarries are unplayable and needs fixing.\n-pvp is currently unbalanced.","August 11, 2015","true","176.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A bit slow at times but very addictive (Currently my most played game). Can't wait for the campaign to drop.\n\nWould be nice if more colors were added to the heraldry system. We should also be allowed to have more than one sigil.\n\nOne thing that bothers me is the trading console. You have to click once for every little bit of resource you wish to trade. There was a quest to trade 2,000 units in one transaction. Due to my 50% trade rate (the highest I can get) I had to click the LMB 1,000 times to trade 2,000 units. The hard part wasn't gathering the resources but the clicking. Hopefully they can change it to a slider or simply a box for us to type the amount we wish to trade.\n\nAll in all it's a game that keeps me coming back to it constantly and I would love it if there was more content added.","May 2, 2015","true","104.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

I have'nt got a gaming PC/ a decent computer, i have a laptop, but i can play Total War: Rome (1) on max graphics with 120 as a unit size with maxed out 3 v 3 ai battle so why cant i play a 9v9units battle in this game on the lowest quality at 8 fps?!?!?\nApart from that i do like this game and i like the choise of units, the way you can change the landscape, make your own castle, battle other player, battle Ai, have multiple castles and much more.\nWOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME, YES!

But if you compare it with other games in the genre it is one of the best. Maybe Steam is not the best place for this game but it is a really enjoyable game, people say that things take a lot of time to get done, that is the point of this games and I am really sure is not that long if you compare to other games in the genre (like 10 to 20 mins to gather resources and most building take like 7 seconds to build, others take like 2 to 24 hours). Well the game has microtransactions, but nothing new, you can adquire everything in the game with actual in game resources without spending a single cent of real money, except some cosmetics, but you need to be patient and manage your resources. Yes, some units are clearly pay2win but not to make it only a P2W experience, and you can still "craft" them with in game resources.\n\nThe game overall is pretty good, but you need to judge it by what it actually is, a mobile resource gathering game. I seriously think that it is going to be a great succes when it hits android and iOS devices.\n\nSo for me solid 7-8 out of 10. Fun combats, castle and town "building" on hexes, and interesting water mechanics plus really fun weather-season system.","May 31, 2015","true","44.0"," 14 of 28 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","14","28","0","2"

It's in the same genre as games like Travian, Clash of Clans, and Tribal Wars with the major difference being that the kingdom building aspect is 100% safe from attack and being conquered by others.\n\nCombat reminds me of the boardgame Oishi if any are familiar.  it is an eastern tactical combat style boardgarme.  games are quick and easy though sometimes a huge fight will boil down to a few hearty troops which is always dramatic.  the combat feels 'jousty' where you have a little clash and then are on your way.\n\nGraphics are great.  The feel of the most recent rome total war is brought forward and refined in this newest total war game.  in the most recent rome total war the iconography felt like cheap clipart, but in total war battles, the iconography has been given the love it needs to become a beautiful part of the rest of the game which is already beautiful.\n\nOne of the things that I like most about this game is that I feel like it's the BEST of it's genre because your kingdom will NEVER be destroyed or taken over by another player.  It is your kingdom.  you get 1 life, in that when you start the game you get your character name which is undeletable and tied to your total war account, so if you like your name, no restarts!  I digress though, since what you have is safe and yours, then you can develop your kingdom at your own pace.   I believe the missions scale to how much xp you've got in your army roster but I could be wrong.\n\nEarly missions are easy cakewalks and the easy ones can be done without the aid of the relics kept in churches so if you want to do a low religion level game (like for a long time in the beginning of the game, I destroyed almost everything and rebuilt, so my kingdom only had the holy grail providing a special 'order' power for my army for a good long time and I got by just fine).\n\nA last note about the spirit of this game, which I feel is important to talk about.  in other games in this genre, you're left feeling stressed like you could get attacked and lose your stuff at any moment, and the timers were like chains, binding you whether you liked it or not to the game.  In Total War Battles: Kingdom, since your kingdom is safe, the feel is totally different.  You can pick it up whenever you want, put it down whenever you want, take a break for a week who cares?  you can still come back to it and field your army and have fun battles at just your level and enjoy a stress free super beautiful castle builder on the side.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIt's free :)","May 9, 2015","true","78.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Is this a good PC game? No, not at all... Will it be good for mobile? Probably one of the best. These "browser-like" strategy games that we're all used to from way back in the early Facebook days, with games like Evony, Tribal Wars, Kingdom Age, Dawn of Fantasy, etc. don't work as a stand-alone PC game. Their models are pay-to-win, everything takes minutes to hours to harvest or build... These are the types of game you quickly jump on in your sparetime on your iPad or various other tablets.\n\nAt this point, I'm only continuing to play the game to prep myself for the mobile release so I have a good basis to stand on when the switch to mobile comes. Basically, me doing what I can with this accurent account to transfer to my iPad and keep playing.\n\nYou can definitely tell this game is meant for mobile as well.

It's in the same genre as games like Travian, Clash of Clans, and Tribal Wars with the major difference being that the kingdom building aspect is 100% safe from attack and being conquered by others.\n\nCombat reminds me of the boardgame Oishi if any are familiar.  it is an eastern tactical combat style boardgarme.  games are quick and easy though sometimes a huge fight will boil down to a few hearty troops which is always dramatic.  the combat feels 'jousty' where you have a little clash and then are on your way.\n\nGraphics are great.  The feel of the most recent rome total war is brought forward and refined in this newest total war game.  in the most recent rome total war the iconography felt like cheap clipart, but in total war battles, the iconography has been given the love it needs to become a beautiful part of the rest of the game which is already beautiful.\n\nOne of the things that I like most about this game is that I feel like it's the BEST of it's genre because your kingdom will NEVER be destroyed or taken over by another player.  It is your kingdom.  you get 1 life, in that when you start the game you get your character name which is undeletable and tied to your total war account, so if you like your name, no restarts!  I digress though, since what you have is safe and yours, then you can develop your kingdom at your own pace.   I believe the missions scale to how much xp you've got in your army roster but I could be wrong.\n\nEarly missions are easy cakewalks and the easy ones can be done without the aid of the relics kept in churches so if you want to do a low religion level game (like for a long time in the beginning of the game, I destroyed almost everything and rebuilt, so my kingdom only had the holy grail providing a special 'order' power for my army for a good long time and I got by just fine).\n\nA last note about the spirit of this game, which I feel is important to talk about.  in other games in this genre, you're left feeling stressed like you could get attacked and lose your stuff at any moment, and the timers were like chains, binding you whether you liked it or not to the game.  In Total War Battles: Kingdom, since your kingdom is safe, the feel is totally different.  You can pick it up whenever you want, put it down whenever you want, take a break for a week who cares?  you can still come back to it and field your army and have fun battles at just your level and enjoy a stress free super beautiful castle builder on the side.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nIt's free :)","May 9, 2015","true","78.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Even when you loose battles you'll progress which makes the game less discouraging and the quick play times means this game directly appeals to the mobile market. Unlike most MMO's out there TWB Kingdoms won't suck the soul out of your life once you start playing it.\n\nOn the downside though, you'll find it difficult to obtain special weapons and troops without spending money or doing some serious soul sucking grinding.

Most definitely.\n\nHowever, the biggest difference is the FREE TO PLAY label is most misleading, thus far I’ve spent $55.00 bucks to play this so called free game. I have about $9.00 left in my game account, so when I (admittedly) foolishly get that ripped off, I’m uninstalling this game from STEAM.\n\nIn fact the negative review I found to be my favorite is: About as "pay to win' as you can get. Shame on CA for stooping to a level I associate with doing the video gamer equivalent of running a casino direct targeting gambling addicts. A certain type of player will blow god awful amounts of money on this. The more rational gamers will be annoyed that those who spent a ton of money have such an advantage.\n\nThere are definitely a few positives to this game, but the negatives far outweigh the misleading FREE TO PLAY BETA.\n\nSincce this is a Beta, and SEGA desires feedback from those (PAYING TO) play this FREE GAME, I strongly suggest that instead of getting more folks addicted to gambling (like me), that SEGA put this much time, effort, and talent into turning this into a real traditional Total War platform and simply charge an up front price for the game.\n\nHere are a few other comments I found most useful.\n\n- The tutorial itself teaches you how to spend money – REAL MONEY from your Steam Account.\n- It's a "pay to win" game as you can get everything by simply paying.\n- All customization and speedups, do, as expected, cost a currency that you must buy with real money.\n- This game is terrible in how they are trying to market and profit from it.

This is a much limited game suitable to be played on a mobile device. Do not expect to play a full Total War classic game, those games need beefier computers.\n\nSo taking this game for what it is, a mobile game, it is surprisingly good, beatiful graphics and quite some Kingdom management options plus the combat aspect where the composition of your army, its positioning, upgrades and orders are all important. It is meant to be played esporadically, for 10 minutes at a time, loging a few times a day to manage your Kingdom.\n\nIt is also a free game with no ads and a non intrusive gold for money shop. Money gives you gold which allows you to speed up everything (buying units instead of slowly gathering resources to slowly craft them; instant construction of buildings, instant gathering of resources or instant healing your troops after the battle instead of waiting the rrequired time). So the impatient will spend money to buy gold to progress faster... and that is good, because the rest of us get to play for free at our own pace.\n\nEvery unit or improvement that can be bought with gold can be crafted in game, provided you manage your kingdom properly and take your time. Heck, I have got more gold in game than I need too.\n\nSo enjoy the game for what it is, a beautiful, well done, FREE mobile game.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\nNote: Some personal advice, the game does not detail every aspect of how everything works. the way I see it, I find it more fun to play the game WITHOUT looking in internet for detailed notes about how the buildings work or how the seasons affect your economy. Play the game and discover it yourself without any external hints. It is supposed to be a challenge where setbacks leads to learning.\n\nNote that you CANNOT restart the game, but nothing you'll do would break it. You can always recover from everything that the game throws at you, so if a season drought or an invasion wreak havoc with your budding Kingdom, take it as a challenge and raise again without ♥♥♥♥♥ing at how unfair the game is.","May 3","true","365.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Like its real time predecessor total war battles shogun the game is different in nature to other total war titles. However for this version the gameplay was split. In battles shogun you had to build buildings and train troops during the battles which behaved in a similar format. Your troops would mindlessly march across the hex based map and the only thing you could do to them was switch lanes. At this point not counting the pay to accelerate system in place there are a lot of gameplay problems with the game. unlike total war battles shogun the management and battles are split up. In this version  you have a hex based grid where you build villages that take forever to gather resources and also require player interaction to do so. The battles are summed up with your troops mindlessly go towards the enemy with a few player interactions in charging and ability’s to break up the boring aspect of battles. Now the part that really pisses me off and arguably breaks the game is the difficulty system. The game scales difficulty based on how powerful your army is and the game was designed with the logic “hey let’s make the AI more powerful than you all the time to make the game challenging.” The problem with that logic is that you get to a point where the AI is so powerful it takes any fun that’s left out of the game. Worse is that when the AI is weaker than you there is no reward for winning. The ridiculous difficulty is seen with the raiders that attack your villages every so often. Now for some reason raiders are not scaled with your army for difficulty. Instead they are scaled with the number of regions under your control. So I have 4 regions and am facing armies that have troops that are so powerful that I can only get through one line of troops with all 3 lines of my troops filled.(there are 3 lines in total for both sides and apparently the AI can get reinforcements) Raiders steal your resources and destroy your buildings so you have to get rid of them. If you can’t defeat them in battle you have to pay them silver (one of the resources in the game) the problem there is that the raiders demand ludicrous amounts of silver in the last case they demanded over 4000 silver which drained days (and I mean real world days) worth of resource gathering. That’s not mentioning the yearly droughts that dry up the rivers over halfway up the map, and the pay to accelerate system that is in place. It’s worth noting that this is a beta and I do hope that many of these problems get fixed but until they do I cannot recommend this game to anyone.","May 18, 2015","false","31.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can advance pretty far without dropping a penny on this game, but at certain points the game will place a huge wall where you will need to either put out money to overcome it or spend days/weeks on farming it yourself to pass it.\n\nAnother thing that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is that the game information is lacking, such as what army unit is best/weak against X unit, how to do X, and so on and so on.","December 4, 2015","false","8.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game was called Knightsdivine (only some pictures remained if you google), and was for reasons unknown taken down. The mentioned game was free at first, my guess to why the game went down, cause of bad payment options - as I was to young to get a credit card, other payment options were pretty much inaccessible for me back then (no prepaid option or mobile).\n\nI have been trying different tiles whatever I could find and nothing came remotely close. Well, this is not same obvious, while it has at same point gave me some satisfaction it makes me even more lust for this game to develop further.\n\nWhat does it miss a multi-player regional camps, where lords fight for the ultimate title "king of kings". Instead of using today model of destroying a player it took just a proportion of lord's land and the rest claimed as vassal lord and thereby open up a political hierarchy within the kingdom. Truly revolutionary. I have not seen this here yet, but I hope that once you claimed sectors something like that will be possible or implemented later.\n\nGames thrive to use renown, as progress upon unlocking better and new buildings (where in Knightsdiveine you had to spend learning points). This game is slow paced, but the renown and battle options can keep you occupied during  your waiting times. And it seems, the more regions you have, the more you'll have to do.\n\nI am excited about how this will develop on. Definitely has nice potential, and is a nice game already. It is real slow, but it pauses when you don't play (except seasons, the continue to move onward, that is great however).","February 17","true","055.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I tried to get the 4th region but the units they have are all level 2 and  3 units and they also have a onager that just flat out wipes your level 1 units off the map. So I figured yea this looks to be pay to win so what do I do I drop $20.00 to get some better units . Oh guess what you can only buy 1 of those units lol.... but your enemy has 3 of that unit and they are level 2 and 3 you lose. So next I figure I will just try level the one unit but guess what you need to level that building first!! OMG!!!.... yes for every unit you have you have to level that building up first to make it rank 2 unit and it costs 1800 of one resource and 1500 of some other resource to complete just one building.  Not sure what it will cost to go rank 3 but I can imagine a heck of alot more for sure!!....And you still have to grind to level up those units too. My concern is I noticed in the video it says that you protect your lands from other players. Though I have not been invaded by any players only AI so far.  But my concern is after all the time you spend on trying to level everything and spend real money just to lose everything to someone else who is Rich and wants your Land . your just SOL.. Not sure if thats just multiplyer version or not.  Single player version is all that is available atm.  But you can battle other players in what they call a Duel..  So my 2 cents is if you have alot of time and money this game is for you if not stay away.  I'm going to continue playing it since I have already donated to it and see what happens down the road when the campaign part opens up. I will then post another  review then.","April 19, 2015","false","135.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

This is a very accurate waiting simulator where you can wait around for hours at a time in order to build something that will allow you to wait even longer for something else.","April 25, 2015","false","102.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Altough it should not carry the Total War title + logo since there is almost no aspect from a Total War game in.

I am dealing with a severe drought problem, half my farms are dried out and the lakes are empty. this is going on for 4 days in a row now and only got worser.\n\n#2. The combat is a bit odd. I get it that it is a freemium game but paying for a 1 time fight upgrade (like flaming arrows or an extra mercenary unit) is really stupid and unneccesary. I know you can craft bracelets to use them too but that take ages so no one would waste their time on that.\n\n#3. Construction speed is odd.

It does however have something else to offer and that is a mobile or quick game when a long campaign on the latest Total War is just not possible.\n\nThe essence of Total War is there but made more accessible in a number of ways. Being cross platform is just a start but I do believe the actual mechanics of the game are easier to understand for those who do not have the time to invest in or concentration span for the main series. This game is a pick up and play kingdom building experience with combat, level progression and upgrades.\n\nWould I recommend the game; well yeah it is Free to Play, playable, nice enough graphics which any hardware could probably handle, audio is good but not sure about the speech at the beginning. Don't get me wrong there are still a few issues that need to be addressed but nothing major. One game mechanic that may annoy some people is the lowering and raising of land near water; it annoys me sometimes :)\n\nWhen this game is on tablet it will be great I think as having Total War on the go is a good thing. Used to carry a heavy laptop around so I could play the main Total War games on the go but that is just not practical now I have a desktop. This game is good for when you don't have too much time to play or just want to give yourself a break from more demanding games of the franchise.","September 16, 2015","true","22.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

My final verdict for this game is to stay away from downloading it on Steam, iOS and Android at all costs... play a diffrent Total War game that is alot better than this one.. play Shogun 2.. you won't be disapointed by that instead of this heap of microtransaction trash of a game.\n3 out of 10.","April 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nice going Creative Assembly.\n\nPros:\nVoice acting\nCons:\nVery boring battles, no strategy involved\nHave to log on every 2-3 hours, to complete 1 task, before closing the game\nPay to win, the best units cost a lot of in game gold, which is impossible to earn enough\nVery buggy, especially with dams you have to build\nBasically everything else in the game\n\nI understand this is still in beta, but unless they remove the whole pay to win aspect, ie, charging a lot of microtransactions for this game, then this is a complete waste of time. I've heard people saying, "its not pay to win if you play enough". Please tell me how it isn't pay to win, when just 1 unit of the best cavarly costs 180 gold, which would take roughly 2-3 weeks of playing normally to earn.\n\nThis isn't a mobile game, where you can simply switch apps within a few seconds, complete a task, then go back to whatever you were doing. This is a PC game, where you would have to launch your PC, launch steam, launch this game, do the 5 second task, close the game, close your PC. Repeat and rinse the process every few hours, till your friends get tired of seeing you launch this game so many times that they remove you.\n\nWhy the whole need for microtransations, or the need to wait 2-8 hours to complete a simple task? The Total War series on a whole has been a huge success, and now Creative Assembly releases this trash money grabbing game. If they're trying to make back the money they spent create this game, tell me and I'll donate the £25 it must have cost them to make this game in less than a day.\n\n","April 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

By hearing the title Total War I expect three things, a campaign map, epic scale battles and extended use of strategy. Unfortunately,I saw none of those main features in this game. Instead, it is mainly a city building game.\n\nThere are the main resources that you use for costructing buildings and recruiting units. However, some processes take hours to be finished and you have to use gold which can be collected by two ways, or by completing missions and objectives, (which are just to build a number of specific buildings ,fight battles or to conquer new parts of the map, ) or by spending real money. The only thing that I personally liked was the teraforming feature because lakes and rivers can affect both positively and negatively the production of some resources.\n\nThe battles are just a huge dissapointment because they are not huge and they have no strategy at all. Furthermore, you have to deploy your units on three lines , with maximum three units per line, they march towards the enemy and you have to just order charge at the right moment to have some bonus and there are some special abilities that give advantage to your units for a short time. Except from that, your units cannot move on a horizontal axis to help their fellow soldiers, they can attack only on the units that are in front of them. And the worst part is that the battles last for a few seconds.\n\nThe visuals are great for a mobile strategy game. The map and the battles are 3d and generally the game does not look ugly. Instead, it looks quite beautiful. The audio is decent except from one part, the voice acting of the soldiers is the same from Rome II and no matter the fact that the British used to be christians back then you may hear them say "praise the gods". That shows how much some people from CA probably cared for their game by throwing in it files without checking them.\n\nAfter years of playing Total War games and trusting CA for making one of the best strategy game series, I got dissapointed by the fact that they use the Total War title for games that have nothing to do with the specific series. This game claims that it is a TW game while it is not. Moreover, it has no strategy, nor epic scale battles, nor a campaign map (I personally don't consider the map of the game as equal to the ones of other TW games) or any other feature that could make this game a part of the famous strategy game series.\n\nTo be honest, It is addicting and fun,I will download it immediately when it will be released on android devices. On the other hand, I would not play this game on my pc, I would prefer to play some REAL TW games. I like it as a mobile game, Irecommend you to download it on your mobile devices, but it is not meant to be played on pc, it just screams out that it is designed solely for mobile devices.\n\nPlease CA, if you want to make some good mobile TW games, you could just release the first games of the series (Shogun ,Medieval) with some grafical improvements that mobile devices can handle and some gameplay features of the newer TW games implemented.","April 11, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They made the amazing large scale RTS game and turned into a crappy, mobile, pay to build this dumb structure, cash grab.

Take out all the filth, make it kind of like Civ, and you have a decent snack.

Sadly not at all what I expected.\n\nI have to admit I downloaded because I have played all TW games since Shogun 1 and I belong to those who enjoy Rome 2 and Attila, even so it is raining DLC.\n\nBut the Game has sadly nothing to do with strategy or any other game of the TW line.\nIt is a of the shelf clone of most “strategy games” on Android or other mobile devices. Build a “base” that produces resources, improve resource output over time and create and “army”. The army consist of a handful of units that slowly improve. The battles are the real letdown – a fallback to the old column-attacker games. You have three columns with troops. You can shift your units from column to column or change them from front row to second row or third row. You have very little influence on the combat at all – just a defense, offense and ranged weapons bonus you canm activate from time to time.\n\nRight now the game shines in no area at all. The aspect that I don’t like most is the glacial speed of the game. If you are not willing to invest money – and I am not at this stage – you have to wait until resources are harvested and your undying army units have regained health.\n\nAll in all an off the shelf Skinner box that has no special merits right now.\n\nSomewhere between 4/10 (because upset they used the TW branding on it) and a 6/10 if you are into click and wait games on Android or other mobile devices.\n","April 10, 2015","false","20.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Falls down on the use of the total war name most of all in my opinion (explained below). It's a tablet game and nothing more, if this were a play store or Itunes review the score would be very different. It's not a PC game, f2p or not, end of discussion. But if Sega insist on offering it as a PC game I shall review it as one.\n\n5/10\n\nI did have to think quite a lot about whether I could recommend this game and while it’s not a bad game per se it certainly isn’t a good game at the moment ( I appreciate it’s still in beta and a lot could change) . In fact to be fair to this game as a free-2-play it’s not too bad and miles ahead of Stronghold: kingdoms in both art style and mechanics.\n\nOn the positive side I thought that the building and settlement creation were quite well done though they are a little basic. Kudos to the team for pretty excellent terrain height, excavation and water mechanic programing, it really helps to create this felling that the world itself can be shaped to suit your needs. The time required for building and resource gathering was pretty good, not obscenely long as in most free-2-plays (read as free-2-wait). On top of this you can even find and mine premium currency allowing any player no matter how stingy to gain some of the advantages. In fact if the game was purely the build section then I would actually recommend it.\n\nThere are however massive issues with the battle system. And by massive issues I mean JESUS CHRIST WHY DID YOU THINK THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA? Yeah that level of bad. I do have to admit that most of my issues with the combat are simply that it is difficult to accept calling this a total war game. I am a die-hard fan of the series (hell I even like empire) and like many total war fans I love the complexity of tactics one can to utilize to win. The battles of Battles: Kingdom seem to have stripped all this away to be replaced with clicking to charge at the right time….what?..... WHAT?.... HOW HAVE YOU TURNED YOUR COMBAT INTO QUICK TIME EVENTS? QTEs in total war now, along with day one dlc you’d be forgiven for thinking EA had bought CA. That said Sega aren’t much better look what they did to sonic. I have't played Shogun 2 Battles but i see that the combat in that is turn based, why didn't they keep that? sure its not total war but at least it's still tactical not ♥♥♥♥ING QTEs!!! But my issues with the battles don’t stop there. I have a few other problems with it as well like why is there a cool down for ordering archers to fire? One unit fires on one enemy unit and I have to wait a good few seconds before I can order an entirely separate unit of archers to fire on an entirely separate unit of archers. The orders system is a nice idea but I don’t think it is well realised. The unit special abilities and general abilities from Rome 2 would’ve been a better style of system and each ability has advantages and disadvantages meaning that they are a tactical choice. The orders on the others hand you just spam every time the cool down timer is over.\n\nHow did they mess this up so badly?\n\nNot something that gets my personal recommendation but if you’re a looking for a well-balanced f2p and you don’t consider this an affront to the good name total war then it’s not all that bad under the surface.","April 14, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And for what it is its not a bad playthrough. But just some disturbing trends in it almost completely turn me off of it. Needing to pay gold (the games cash to coin currency) in order to unlock better units, such as spearmen. Though there is alternative options, such as forging them, not only do they not work 100% of the time, but you also dont even unlock it till later in the game. I was also rather bothered by the resources system, resources collected drop tiles which you need to click on in order to collect said resource. Needing to click on the tiles in order to collect them means you need to play the game in order to advance at all, and for the game being what it is I think its a dumb feature that would be immensely improved on simply by removing it. Also stone is very difficult to collect in large quantities, while you will never have any problems with wood or food, spending stone will usually leave you scraping the bottom of the barrel at early levels. And the combat system, while not being bad, isn't nearly good enough to hold my attention for long enough to keep my constantly playing in order to collect resources so I can advance.","February 12","false","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Would be a great game if you could manipulate your troops in real time and not have some standing doing nothing and cant use them yet because of formations, and for the love of God reduce the cooldown on how fast you can select targets for the archers, the 5sec cooldowns makes me not even want to use them at all, and the constant releveling of the ground is overkill, a waste of resources, and stupid.

Let the player pick where they want to set up shop with a 'wait free' first 48 hours of gameplay or something.. Then add in some more Kingdom customization options..  I just cant stand waiting around for no reason at all except to cater to your money needs.\n\nPersonally I would rather pay 5-10 dollars for a good cellphone game without this pay to win business model.","May 24, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And for what it is its not a bad playthrough. But just some disturbing trends in it almost completely turn me off of it. Needing to pay gold (the games cash to coin currency) in order to unlock better units, such as spearmen. Though there is alternative options, such as forging them, not only do they not work 100% of the time, but you also dont even unlock it till later in the game. I was also rather bothered by the resources system, resources collected drop tiles which you need to click on in order to collect said resource. Needing to click on the tiles in order to collect them means you need to play the game in order to advance at all, and for the game being what it is I think its a dumb feature that would be immensely improved on simply by removing it. Also stone is very difficult to collect in large quantities, while you will never have any problems with wood or food, spending stone will usually leave you scraping the bottom of the barrel at early levels. And the combat system, while not being bad, isn't nearly good enough to hold my attention for long enough to keep my constantly playing in order to collect resources so I can advance.","February 12","false","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Would be a great game if you could manipulate your troops in real time and not have some standing doing nothing and cant use them yet because of formations, and for the love of God reduce the cooldown on how fast you can select targets for the archers, the 5sec cooldowns makes me not even want to use them at all, and the constant releveling of the ground is overkill, a waste of resources, and stupid.

Normal battles can be easy to win, but at times you’ll get your ♥♥♥ handed to you. Challenging battles can be just that, challenging and you’ll win them barely. But at times the enemy will slaughter you before you can say “What the-!”\n\nThe mobile version of this game is horrible. Cause it barely works.\nIn Steam and for mobile, the loading times can be very long. But the mobile takes the cake.\nSometimes your actions don’t register on your mobile version. You can do a lot of stuff and at first it seems that everything is fine. Then you suddenly start to think “Hmm…somethings wrong” and when you go to Steam to check ( if you can ) you’ll see that every action you did on the mobile, didn’t register.\nAnd at times it can crash or just kick you out of the game completely.\n\nThe game mechanics are questionable too. Like crafting, which takes insane amount of time to do. A lot of resources to make. And when your crafting is finished and fails. You just want to throw your phone on the wall, because you wasted 60 hours of work and 125 crafting materials for nothing. Brilliant.\n\nI only tried the game cause it’s free to play and- well… I’m just glad I didn’t waste any money for this game. Cause I would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nAnd my friend is a Total War fanatic, who wanted to play something Total War related with me and haven’t tried this game before.\nProbably won’t come as a shocker, but he didn’t like this game either.\n","May 17","false","35.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I see how the game is supposed to be, but they dont seem to be able to reach that, the gathering times are too long, the resource respawning is too long, and the AI in battles can be realy hard to beat when they have 3 units of mercs and i have mostly Levies.\n\nIt could probably become one of the best games on the mobile market for this kind of game, if i didnt have to wait an hour to get my wood from a tree then wait for tree stumps to vanish, then grass to grow, then trees to grow, all this work will probably take a day or 3 and for what? 20 wood? i need around 500 wood to be able to UPGRADE that wood cutter.\n\nThen again. it is a good game, its nice to be able to freely expand my town/city while having to worry about rivers and hills to be able to build my town. the combat is 200x better than all the other bad/weird mobile games (except games like Clash of Clans wich have a pretty good combat system for Mobile games)\n\nI would not recomend this if your hoping for it to be a "conquer the world with a massive army" like in the other Total wars. Ofcourse i wouldnt call this a Total war game if i was CA though.\n\nI would recomend it thought to people that feel they want something to do while they are bored or have nothing better to do. Dont think that when you install this you will be met by being able to build hundreds of buildings in under a minute, its not, this is a time game, you will have to wait for your buildings, wait for your resources and wait for your army.\n\nI like that CA is expanding into new territories of gaming, but using the same name for some totaly other game is just not right. Even though i can see that calling it Total war would be able to make more ppl download it....smart move CA, smart move.","April 22, 2015","true","26.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

After all the game looked good this time around and the city-building seemed interesting. This sadly led to me wasting around 2 hours of my life.\n\nNow let's take a look at the good points first:\n\n-The graphics are great. From the landscape to the buildings and even the units (not that you will have a lot of time to\nlook at them)\n\n-You have the ability to build some truly impressive cities. it won't be easy and it sure as hell won't be anytime soon that\nyou have one, but in the end the player is (theoretically) able to do it.\n\nSadly the downsides easily outweight those good sides:\n\n-The combat is lane based. I personally HATE those kinds anyway but I thought "Hey, maybe CA actually made it good",\nbut the answers was a loud all-encompassinge "Nope". It's just run-of.the-mill lane-combat. No flanking, barely any\ncontrol over the units/battlefield, a very limited amount of troops, both in numbers and in variation and in general all\nthe suckage that is lane-combat.\n\n-Upgrading your units takes a lot of time. And I mean a LOT of it. The first upgrade for any of the basic attributes costs\n20 points, the next 40. Now I dont know if I'm just bad or what but I got around 7-12 per fight. That wouldn't be so bad\nif the fight themselves would be fun (they are not) and if there were no freaking enforced break after every battle (if\nthey were harmed). You can of course skip it but that requires hard gold aka real money.\n\n-The game in general is just slow, by the way: did you know that grass grows faster than this games plays? Okay that\nwas exaggerated but the fact remains that the amount of time you spend waiting is ridiculous. Gathering ressources\nfrom random spots takes 10 minutes which is okay, same goes for excevating stone but gathering wood and wood\ntakes days and this time I'm not even kidding. Wood and crops both take 8 hours to chop/gather and then another 10\nhours for crops and up to 2 (or 1 and a half) to regrow. Now it wouldn't be so bad if you would at least get a decent\namount but you only get 10 per field... 10! Though you can once again skip all this waiting with gold... hooray.\n\nMy verdict is:  BEST GAME OF ALL TIME 13/10!!! *shot*  Stay away from it, at least for now. It isn't the worst game of all time and maybe even not  bad game all together but it certainly if on the wrong platform. It might have been fun on a tablet or a smartphone (yeah sure) but for the PC?\n\nA easy way to improve the game would be to reduce the amount of time to do... well everything. I wont demand the removal because that will never happen (hell not even the reduce will happen). But if the taim for the ressources would be halved and the time for unit-recovery, unless they were annihilated, removed it would already be a way better game. Oh and add more strategic depth don't forget that... especially the flanking.\n","April 15, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

One can't expect the ordinary Total War game, because it isn't. It is an online rts game and that's why I don't find it strange or annoying with long building times.\n\nI would say this game is a mix between Total War, Civilization and Stronghold Kingdoms. Sure there are some bugs but it's still in beta and it's running better than I though it would on my laptop. So far I haven't felt that it's a pay-2-win game and that is also positive, since there are games like this out there that you can't progress in if you aren't paying a ton of money.\n\nAll in all I think it's a good game, and since it's free you should at least try it out for yourself and make your own opinion!","April 28, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

It has everything you need, and an easy levelling system, easy resources, and a tough setup that will keep you on your toes. Water works well into the terrain, and the layout of the buildings are well-done. The only downside I could find to this game is the PvP. You can be a low level, and it will literally put you with someone 7 levels higher than you just because they have a rank close to yours. This is extremely unfair and should be fixed, but I'm sure they're MUCH too busy to do that. Otherwise, a good game.

With many of the mechanics of the game being shody. There absolute no tactics require it more of how lucky you are and if you can play the system against it self. Resource gathering takes forever each resource gathering takes 20 mins only get 20 of said resources at times and you lose 10 resource if do the reap all benefit causing it to be at 8 hr wait.  To upgrade building take more resources to upgrade than to build new buildings. example building a lumber camp takes about 50x resouces of each food and silver. To upgraded it cost about 500x of resources of food and silver. the conversion rate is for upgrade to each builidng is about 100% of orginal for level 2. It get worse at third level and four level converison it becomes 1000% at level 3 to 10000% at level 4 of the orginal resource cost. Missions can go to relative easy to insanely hard and with enemie two to three level higher than your units even at easy calculation levels also mission quest have units that would require you to spend gold to obtain better units and equipment until you able to craft them at level 21. Crafting is really cheap system making nearly impossible to craft any items or unit as it take insane amount of craft material to reach levels of weapons example crafting a level 1 longsword  would take you 35 craft material and 1000 silver to complete for each stage and there are five stage for each weapon or unit making extremely time consuming and it would be cheaper to buy the said equipment with gold for the time wasted also the chances or earning gold is extremely hard as well.  The game force you spend gold in order to win the most easy of battles. Even if you have units equip to max and level to maxed you have 70-90% chance of losing each mission encounter if you just sat watch your unit fight easy mission.  If you actually do something such use the tactics and skill that units have you have maybe of 50-60% chance of losing on the easiest missions rating. Dueling system does not always work. It took me forever to wait for one duel and they pitted me against player rank six level higher than me with units several time stronger. If they can fix the resource gathering problems and lower the amount it take to level up to next level at acceptable levels then it would better. Also there unit caps on special units that you are allowed to build while with missions quest does not have these unit caps thus you can go against army of knights all at level three which really sucks.  Sorry for the long rant. I still play the game since invest a large amount of money into the game.","April 25, 2015","false","84.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Combat missions for begining players is at best a slaughter, which is designed to make you pay for gold to heal your units..pay to play..the map is not big enough to correctly build roads between the first new area you can win/pay tribute to gain. By the time you try to build roads adjusting the terrain to do so, you ruin the correct aspect of farming/herding/grazing mechanics, and oh yeah dont forget the flooding. It took me along time to build/rebuild buildings to locate them properly within the given terrain..its bearily possible because you place x amount of buildings before you level which unlocks the buildings you should have placed corectly the first time..woops wasted time and resouces again..then to realize the harbor once you can make one doesnt work right because the ships cant get up the river to the fish..lol..demolish.. rebuild terain..try to make a river to reach them..oops you cant lower terain uphill to the level of the fish..ugh..I hope the game has a wipe upon release because I really would do so much better now that I know what I should have done if the information would have been available to learn how beforehand!\nThe game has great potential if some better information was available to new players before they make game ending mistakes..flood entire map for example..hard to recover from..with no option to delete and start anew.","March 22","true","37.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jujak/recommended/300080/","Jujak","Briggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jujak/","175 products in account","TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nPeople need to realise that this is a game designed for tablet / mobile thus not a title between all the other Total War games but an offshot for a completely different platform. Imagine playing the latest Total War on tablet, not happening.\nHow can you tell? Controls. Mouse only, no keybindings.\n\nMobile games are coming to steam! So are console games! Deal with it! To start a hate train because a game seemed to come to the "wrong neighbourhood" is unsightly. They can do their part on steam too but you are not forced in any way to play them.\n\nThis game is also "F2P" (Depending on your definition) which with most certainty includes microtransactions like most F2P titles (Big suprise there). Being F2P also creates paywalls which are either non scalable because the content behind it is exclusively for paying users or tough but not impossible to reach for players who do not want to spend real money. And in the end becomes a slowpaced game for everyone who decides not to spend money.\n\nFirst of all I'd like to dispel some of the false or lacking information on which most reviews are based creating a maelstrom of bad reviews from players fresh out of the tutorial.\n\nThe most popular : Harvesting wheat / felling trees -> 8 hours waiting\nAfter building your farm wheat fields start to appear around it, depending on the distance to water the time until they are able to be harvested differs.\nAfter the wheat is finally harvestable you are given TWO CHOICES:\n1. Harvest a single spot : 20 min. = 20 units\nor\n2. Harvest ALL spots : 8 hours = 10 units / spot\nAs you can see option no. 2 is the worst possible choice.\nIf this is the reason you quit playing and gave the game a bad review then you should have paid more attention to what you are doing instead of causing a temper tantrum for no reason.\nIt is quite a waiting game at the beginning, but every sane gamer would not stare at the monitor waiting for the counter to drop to zero, that's why this is more of an inbetween games game.\n\nThe most concerning : Pay to win / Paywall (Paying users exclusive content)\nI think we all can agree that in a situation where you pit equally skilled players against one another, that the one who can pay real money to give him an edge in combat will most definetely win if the game is not heavily RNG-based.\nHowever the real question here is: Is the equally skilled player condemned to never overcome this hurdle even with zeal and competetive spirit? The answer to that is : He can, with time.\nLet me explain:\nThere are NO paying users exclusive : Buildings / Units / Buffs / Equipment, every player has the same selection and arsenal. Unlike other mobile games where the best buildings and units are exclusively obtainable through real money.\nAll players do not have acess to everything on the get go. You need to reach a certain level regardless wether you want to pay or not to have buildings (and their corresponding units) unlocked. Every military building comes with a selection of 3 to 4 different units depending on the building.\nExample : You build your first stable and it can house only one mounted unit. After building your stable you choose which one you want. (F2P ALERT) The first two of the three units you can choose without any hitch (100% free), however the third is behind a real money paywall (That shook you a little, right?). But against all odds you are able to "craft" the third unit and kick out the one currently stationed (no money paid).\nThose units are statwise superior than the other but not unobtainable for non paying users.\nAs for Buffs and Equipment those can also be crafted like military units and given to those or used on the battlefield.\n\nAs for the game itself. It is pretty slowpaced but steadily gains velocity as you progress. You start off with 1 of 6 regions and you have a restriction of how many buildings you can mantain within this region. This restriction gradually decreases the more regions you liberate and castles you upgrade within each region. Effectively increasing your playtime each session. I do not want to venture any further into the building system and the little tricks therein, because a little trial and error doesnt hurt.\n\nThe tutorial is rather short and gives you the basics of the basics but not all the vital information you desperately need. In my opinion this is a bad choice of tutorial, instead of having tutorial pieces pop up when you need them, say changing seasons, new buildings, new units, new regions, small events etc. they leave you out to fend for yourself and figure it out on your own.\nAlong with the tutorial the tooltips also lack information as well as numbers.\nTooltips need a desperate overhaul and the tutorial needs to be more than just an introduction to the basics of basics. To counter a lack of information a compedium of such would have been a nice way to make wating somehow enjoyable.\n\nThe combat is a squad based rock-paper-scissors system (if that makes any sense). Every unit consists of multiple soldiers and counter or is countered by another unit. Lance > Rider > Shield > Archer > Lance > and so on. Additionaly armor is a factor Mace > leather + chain , Axe > Plate.\nIf that wasn't enough, in the beginning the two facing units charge each other to engage in close combat depending on your timing, you do heavy charge damage before the brawl begins or none at all (pre-emptive strike). But wait! There's more!\nEvery unit can get one of two abilites purchased through experience acquired through battle. Making your units more diverse and useful in certain situation. For example switching your shield units with a your mounted units which are engaged with lance units (rock-paper-scissors, remember?) to avoid certain death for your horsemen.\nTo top it all of you can have in your 9-squad army up to 3 and at least 1 siege unit. Ranging from ballistaes, trebuchets or mangonels. Ballistaes hit only enemy units for moderate damage, instantly killing weak armored targets. Trebuchets hit all units for a good amount of damage. Mangonels leave the area they hit burning and damaging any and all units that remain in this area. Every siege unit act as an ability with their own innate cooldown before you can use them again. But if you have 3 siege units and 6 fighting units and on the other hand your oppenent has 9 fighting units which disperse your 6 quite fast you have lost even with the siege units still intact und unscathed. (I don't think you can actually damage / destroy siege units)\nQuite the arsenal and not as simple a battlesystem I dare say.\nAfter every battle your units need time to recuperate depending on how wounded they are 10 to 20 min. or if unscathed not at all. However you cannot engage in another battle while a unit in your army is still recuperating. Yes, you can skip waiting with a little bit of moneyflow but if you are eager to fight battle after battle it can become very expensive and you should play another Total War game.\nThe experience your units gain can be used to either upgrade the unit itself thus adding more soldiers to this unit, upgrade melee damage, range damage, armor rating or charge damage. Or as already mentioned purchase one of two abilites for this unit which may turn the tide of battle.\n\nTL;DR: It's a F2P inbetween-games-(tablet)game with no content locked behind a paywall (no paying user exclusives). Paying players cannot exceed the limits of a non-paying player. Slowpaced at the start with steadily increasing session lengths. Lack of information may result in uneffecient use of terrain, buildings or units. Not a game for the impatient.\n\nThis will get downvoted to hell because those who do, are either those you didn't grasp the concept of the game or jumped on the hate train for the lulz.","April 16, 2015","true","23.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Has some great concepts such as game effecting seasons and terrain modifying. If you like a slight mixture of civ 5, past total war games, and stronghold then you may like this game.\n\nBut I do think it would be a more popular game/ better to play if it was buy to play or if it leaned less on paying for gold to actually get/do stuff. It could focus more on advisors,perks,customization with the in game purchases rather than pay some gold to buy a unit or to get tons of resources to upgrade a building/ craft a unit. Also a sort of info panel on units, buildings, game concepts, etc. would help. Because sometimes I would find myself building in an area where it will not function or building something like the knights manor where you can only have one unit of that type.\n\nPros:\nCasual (if you like that)\nGood Concepts\nGood Environment\nCustomization of units,town,environment, etc.\nQuest system\n\nCons:\nCasual (if you dont like that)\nSome things cost rediculous amounts of silver/resources to upgrade, sort of forcing the player to grind for days or to use gold\nNo info panel\n\nSummary: You should give it a try, though depending on who you are you will probably uninstall it. It is in beta so you can't really hate on it because it is still being developed and does require info from the community to help out devs. To an extent you can play the game f2p but there will eventually be moments where you will end up spending gold to advance. It is built more for mobile device users who usually do spend $ for in game currency rather than pc gamers.\n\nI will probably continue to play it. But I do hope that it improves and leans more towards pc user gameplay rather than casual mobile players.","May 3, 2015","true","28.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

However for what you're paying (nothing) this game is really enjoyable, and if you don't mind a game you can only play for 20-40 minutes a few times a day the pace is actually pretty well done.  Yes, you can pay for things with gold to speed it up, and at the very start I would suggest doing that, but now that I've played for a while I have enough troops I can cycle through them and play for a comfortable amount of time before stopping to do something else.\n\nIt's not a total war game, and if you thought you were going to get anything like a full total war game for free you're insane.  This is a large step above and beyond pay to win games right now.  Yes, if you want to be the best you have to pay, but if you don't care about how well you rank on leaderboards and just play the game at your own pace it's kind of zen.","May 2, 2015","true","28.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

It's war, so let us wage war agains other players too!\n\nI'm gonna keep playing and expanding my territory for many hours yet, but what happend when the six regions is mine?

Wait ages to get a pittance from your resource supply nodes.\n\nBattles are a joke.  Minimal control over your units once battle starts.  Global cooldowns* applied to multiple units makes any kind of on the fly deployment reorganization or [ranged] target change a huge hassle.\n\n\nUnless you throw money at it, I can't see this as anything more than a minor distraction once or twice a day(like while you're on the can).  The four hours play time I have/[had at time of review], is about 10-12 sessions because there is so little to do.\n\n\n\n* They don't seem to apply to AI though.  I had one enemy end unit move two times in a row, to the other end slot.  It was a cavalry unit so I had my spears lined up to them before the battle.

This game is essentually a micropay journey through a sandbox that becomes smaller and smaller with every acomplishment. The further the player progresses in the game, the longer it takes to acomplish simple tasks such as upgrading troops and and buildings. While the game allows for multiple stradegies to "farm" resources, the cost of advancement is clearly designed to frustrait the player into buying gold. Unlike most micopay gamers, buying gold does little to quicken the play of the game. The gold component simply allows you to puchase better units that allow you to advance game play a little farther, prolonging the agony of farming for days to upgrade buildings or units. Oddly enough, after all of the time you spend saving and gathering, once you finally can upgrade a building, you have to wait a few hours more or spend some gold.\n\nOne silver lining is that the games use of changing enviroments .

However, if you are into that kind of thing - hopefully this will be somewhat useful.\n\nTLDR:\n- The game plays more like ANNO than it does total war. It's a great casual game for people that like building little cities, and the grind isn't prohibitive in the way many free games are. It's definitely worth playing if you enjoy casual games.\n\nWhat makes it better than most casual games:\n- You begin with enough resources and always have enough to be actively playing, not waiting. There are things to be done on an hourly basis to manage your cities.\n- There are new buildings to be unlocked for the first few days of playing, and it doesn't take too long to keep unlocking them. There is no way to pay to speed this up either.\n- The terrain can be manipulated, to give you more feeling of control in shaping your kingdom\n- The game relies more on placement of resources than just "having stuff", there is skill and thought to go into each building placement.\n- The water has dynamic flow, meaning you have to build proper channels that bring water from uphill regions to your farms. This is a major element of the game, and messing it can literally flood your cities.\n- The combat is a minigame, where you have some extra control over how your units fight. It's not just a numbers game on building a big army.\n\nWhere it is still lacking:\n- Forests only grow from existing ones, and can easily be cut down, making it extremely easy to snooker yourself into a resource-dead map\n- There isn't a great deal of unit variety, especially without using gold (premium currency that can be generated VERY slowly if you dislike paying)\n- There is a severe lack of explanation/wiki data on what buildings are/cost/etc. before having built one. There are instances you can waste a lot of resoures finding out that things don't work as assumed (e.g. only being able to have one "medium cavalry" unit in total - even after building a second stables.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend this to anybody that wants a game to spend 15 minutes every hour or so keeping their land in order. It's not for regular total war fans at all - but the creative assembly have made (in my opinion) an extremely polished, fun and non-restrictive F2P title. You can absolutely have a great time without ever spending a penny.","April 12, 2015","true","11.4"," 46 of 102 people (45%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","45","46","102","8","5"

You get to conquer territories and expand you empire usint tiles, which allow you to create your own cities.\n\n\nCons:\nWait times for building, gathering, etc can be a very long time (12 hours is the longest I have seen so far.) But compared to other free mobile games, wait times are really not that bad. *cough* CoC *cough*\n\n\nThis game is definitly one of the best free to play strategy games I have played. If you like the genre, this is a game you should try out. The only thing I would change is to make some things not require currency (Gold) that requires "micro-transactions" (I qoute that because you CAN get gold without paying for it, fairly easily compared to other games) But other then that, Im having a great time with the game.\n","April 13, 2015","true","8.0"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","5","17","0","0"

But, as a video game player in general, I think this a decent game. Sure they expect you to pay microtransactions, but I havent payed a single micro transaction and my game is going fairly smoothyl, this isn't a waiting game, this is a game that you should play for about 10-20 mins a day, go about your business and maybe check up on your Breton town with your electronic device. If you expect, a grand strategy, amazing, award winning, strategy game that can keep you entertained for hours on end, than you will be in for a sore dissappointment. But if you play it for what it is, than it will be a perfectly good game to spend some time playing.\n\n=======Pros=======\n-Battles\n-Graphics\n-City / Town management\n-Territory Conquest\n\n=======Cons=======\n-No Byzantines (Yea, I was kinda dissappointed we could only be Bretons. Can't even be Saxon or Norse, just Bretons... Hey I guess you could be King Arthur though)\n\nNow some of you might think that there has to be more problems to the game than 'No Byzantines.' Yea... not really, it's a free game and if you want you can put a few dollars into micropurchases, these micropurchases aren't actually needed to play the game though. Oh, and did I mention, IT'S FREE. There is nothing wrong with this game, people don't like it because it doesn't fit in the 'Grand Strategy' category that most TW games do. So, there is no reason, not to get this game. So get it, play it, hate it, love it, I don't care. This game gives me much more hope in the TW title than Attila (That over priced DLC that they call a game) ever will. Just because, this is a unique game that is fun and you can kill some time on.\n\nComments are welcome.

I love the mini version of the game. It will be great as a mobile game with the time frame of gaining resources. The idea that gold must be used to buy certain units is annoying.

You can do absolutely everything for free it will just take longer, which is typical of a mobile freemium game.\n\nThe game is quite aesthetically pleasing and the little nuances of weather and what the different seasons do to the land scape are a very nice touch.  The combat is pretty straight forward with some tactic and foresight required, very rock paper scissors with some buffs and debuffs you can use but only up to 3 buffs/debuffs at a time that you can unlock as you go.\n\nAll in all it makes for a great mobile game, something to check in on or play for a few minutes to an hour a day, but not a good PC game due to the amount of time it takes to do things and the style of play, I dont think it was ever originally intended to be a PC game and was the original design of it to be a mobile game, in which case I believe it excels very well.  As such I recommend this game and am patiently waiting for it to come to android, however if this had been originally designed for PC(which I know it is not) then i would be agreeing with the sea of negativity this game seems to have on steam.","April 14, 2015","true","84.2"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

The game is fun, although I'm not sure about the controversial "gold" situation yet; in some cases it will just take you longer without gold, but in other cases such as buying powerful units, you need gold. You start off with some gold, you can make gold yourself through gold mines, missions etc., but the amounts you get in that manner are quite limited - maybe 1-5 gold per mission, whilst some of the powerful units cost around 150 gold. I'm sure in the later parts of the game, these units bought for gold can be hard to get around. But then again, it's a free game.

If this didn't have its title no-one would play it.\n\nPros:\n-Adds a new spin on city builder games\n-Addictive\n-Not hard to get good\n-competitive with friends\n\nCons:\n-Autumn flooding is complete bull ****, you spend loads of time in summer trying to ge water through your lands and then along comes the f***fest of rain. One river overflow and 2 towns got flooded, 3 quarries, 2 farms and all of my f***ing roads were destroyed. But I can't do anything about it until winter comes to get rid of the sea in the centre of my kingdom.\n-Secondly the combat is completly broken, when taking over new regions the firs two are fine, the third is hard but not impossible and then comes the fourth. All you have to do is look at the army and realise it is impossible without paying them off. It seems as if they don't want people to progress without spending their life savings for an army. Also when you go into online duels there are no matchmaking, all that happens is they put you with some random person without looking a if you spent money or your level in game. In 3 instances I have been against people who have obviously spent loads of money which means I definitely will not beat them. A couple of times I have been against people using the starting units when I have a very strong army without spending money, this system is completely broken and must be fixed.\n\nAlthough it seems the cons are much greater than the pros I must still remind you it is in BETA so this game still has a while to go before it can be judged as a full game like Rome 2 was.","April 14, 2015","true","23.2"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","17","2","12","4","0"

And most gamers who like a series do not like to see that series do something different (like all shooter series). This game is more like tribal wars and settler online. If you like those games you will love this. Also the slow start will scare most gamers away, but like most building games you start with nothing and you will gain more when you play. Ones you have your second castle and 8 units (12 with militia) at your hands things will move faster and faster until you do not need to wait until your units are healed. By the time I'm writing this I have played the game for 4 days and I now have 4 castles and have 20 units and have not spend 1 gold. Gaining new lands is important and not impossible if you play smart. Also it takes time and practise to make the water your friend instead of your enemy (but then again I’m Dutch so building dams and cannels is in my blood)\n\nPro's:\nWater: is vital for growing grass, tree’s, grain and fish\ninteractive map: you can built more things on this map than another free to play game out there. From canals to serval city's. (but you need to think ahead)\ndifferent seasons: these will change the map and how fights look but also create new problems and opportunities (like droughts in the summer are great to change the flow of the rivers)\nYou can build all things: No need to pay for stuff with gold/ real money to get all stuff in the game.\ninteractive fights: the fights are interactive can be won with pure skill\nupgradable units: you gain experience, learn skills and you can build new and better weapons for your units\nsmart AI: the AI will use skills and will change formations of his units to match yours\ndifferent ways to gain gold: You can gain gold trough serval ways without paying for it with real money\nGreat graphics: best graphics for a game of this kind\n\ncons:\nPlayer vs player sucks: from cheating with buying all stuffs from unfair match making combine that with low reward and in sort multiplayer no fun.\nslow start: If you are not able to gain new area’s fast (by fighting) you will have to few units\n\ncons/pro's\nNo player raids: you cannot steal from others and they cannot steal from you\nRaids :  sometimes a raider will appear and steal your resources if you not beat him in 24 hours (or bribe him)\nVerdict: 8 Great game for those who are willing to spend\n","April 12, 2015","true","72.2"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","8","26","0","0"

It is Pay to Go Faster like most F2P's.  You can craft everything so by definition, not pay to win.\n-Many ways to obtain gold - Mine, wolves, tombs, daily tribute, markets, taverns, battle quests, challenges, conquering regions.\n-Wait times - typical of Free to Plays.  Get used to it or move along to buyable games.\n\n\nEDIT: ~6 hours in and I am just about at Lord level 15 (PVP unlocked at 15).  You unlock better units and coat of arms customizations too sometime after level 10.  There are a bunch of ways to earn gold for free too.  Could use a decrease in times here and there and some better explanations on certain aspects but I think it is a neat little game. Sorry not sorry.\n\nEDIT 2: 10 hours in - I have multiple ways of getting gold now, but slowly.  I am level 19. Still liking the game.\n\nEDIT 3: 20+ hours in - Level 27 Lord - a few cosmetics unlocked, 27 gold earned/received so far, 2 battles lost to the AI (which actually was smart in the last loss, dayum son).\n\n\n\nUpdate .3 Review\n\nOverall I'd say it is an improvement.  I played 53 battles on the first night of release.\n\n+\nReduced times, mostly. 20 minutes >> 1 minute.  1.5 hours > 19 minutes, etc.\nGold 100% on daily login. Tombs now give gold\nNew things to mine (although not as intuitive). Silver, coal, gold, stone.\nAdjacency bonuses - might still need tweaking but overall an improvement\n\n-\nRealm sized reduced. This is bad. We'll see how bad it is late game...\nFertile grass should be removed (wheat can't grow if it is 3 hexes away.)\nQuarry has a massive range and can't be built next to each other. We're pressuring them on forums for change.

Creative Assembly and Sega are probably exploring new grounds on the "free-to-play" market, a realm filled with casual players who don´t mind spending a buck or two for a few gold coins that will give them an edge like upgrading a unit or instant harvesting of a wheat field.\n\nBattles: Kingdom picks up the same battle mechanics of Total War Battles; Shogun and adds an hexagonal map were you build and manage your kingdom, similar to Civilization V, Master of the Arcane or Endless Legend. This is truly the high point of this game; you can actually terraform the environment to your liking, building dams to divert rivers and raising the terrain to your advantage. I spent hours just messing with all the options available. It´s alot more fun than the Beyond Earth terraforming features for example.\n\nHonestly, this doesn´t feel like a Total War kind of game but it doesn´t mean its bad. Just make sure that before you venture into it, be prepared for something different that you are used to.","February 10, 2015","true","25.1"," 9 of 37 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","9","37","0","0"

Is it a total war? Well.. Technically yes, but only at the bare minimum of comparisons. Is it a good game? Yes for a simple slightly more advanced "facebook" style of game, it is.  Is it worth all the negative reviews? Well that depends on if you were ignorant enough to go in expecting a Total War Attila style facebook game or not. If you don't like Facebook games, you won't like this. It's a good game to just manage when you're bored, or sitting waiting for something on your mobile.\n\nThe Game Itself:\n\nAlot of reviews are claiming this is just another usual facebook game with nothing new. Obviously they didn't spend any longer than a few minutes in the tutorial. There are quite a few interesting things in this game.\n\nOf course it is a pay to win setup, as all facebook like games are, however that doesn't mean there aren't alternative ways to getting gold. There are 2 currencies in the game, Gold and Silver. Gold being special currency to buy advanced soldiers or upgrades for soldiers. The main way to get Gold is through paying money. Silver is used to buy everything else, and is gained through Blacksmiths, Markets, etc. ingame by waiting for the timer to loop like most facebook games.\n\nThis doesn't mean paying Gold is the only way to get gold however. Linking several Taverns together can net you some Gold, as well as Mining. Mines can uncover Gold deposits as well. Chopping down tree's and uncovering ruins can also net you surprises including Gold. Completing Quests and Objectives will net you Gold as well.\n\nThere are other unique features as well, such as being able to raise and lower the land, fill land in, or use mines to dig land out gaining Dirt. Or simply raise and lower it. Why would you want to do this? Besides being able to sculpt the land to your liking for cosmetic reasons, there is water on the maps. Dams can be made to stop water flow, and make usually unuseable land, useable and buildable.\n\nBattles\n\nThe battles are pretty basic. With special skills gained from the churches you build, your soldiers are lined up 3 x 3. Like most Total War games, the basics are there. Swordsmans vs Spears, Spears vs Horses, Horses vs Archers or Swordsmans.\n\nChoosing the correct time to charge as well nets you bonus's.\n\nComparisons\n\nI mentioned this can be compared to other Total War games at the very basic and most minimum. The only real comparisons are the fact that soldier types are rock paper scissors at the basic like other Total War Games, and that you are essentially building up multiple towns to upkeep your armies... yea.. not really much comparisons, you can still argue it's not a Total War game at all, and I wouldn't say you are wrong. This is a facebook game however, so expecting more is lunacy.","April 11, 2015","true","19.8"," 11 of 42 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","11","42","0","0"

I really like this, games such as clash of clans may take hours for you to do upgrades, constructions, recruitments. This game however shortens it, making it a better experience\n\nResources dont run out quickly. I love this because in similar games, resources run out very quickly, in which you may have to wait hours to gain back. But total war battles makes it so resources are very well kept\n\nYou dont lose your army after battle. Yes you can keep your army, this makes the game even better, because you dont need to waste resources on another army\n\nCONS\n\nFeels very slow paced. It just doesnt excite you.\n\nBattles should feel more like total war battles. I prefer it when you can move your army about, and not have your army auto moving. You should have more options to what you can do with your army.\n\nThis isnt really a PC game. It more of a mobile-style game, but oh well.\n\nTurns. You know in these other total wars where you have turns, and after it recruits units and finishes constructions. I like that, however I suppose this isnt meant to be like it, I can accept that\n\n\nOverall I enjoy the game.\n\n\n\n\n","February 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 1 of 19 people (5%) found this review helpful","5","1","19","0","0"

It's a mobile-designed City Builder with above-average mobile-designed battles that, for some reason, is only being beta tested on PC. The tablet app is still "coming soon", apparently.\n\nWhen you and I think of "Total War", we think of great real-time battles. The battles here are more interactive than the Game of Thrones game or Stronghold Kingdoms, but it's not to the level you're led to believe or expect. No mobile game can pretend to be a full Total War, but CA's description here leads you to believe otherwise.\n\nCity building is more interactive and strategy matters more than in Stronghold Kingdoms. But Stronghold is about playing Lego Master with city walls.\n\nGive this a shot, but understand that it's not a Total War in the way Empire, Rome, Attila and Shogun are; this is a tablet City Builder.","April 10, 2015","true","52.3"," 4 of 26 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","4","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabatonsaboteurs/recommended/300080/","sabatonsaboteurs","Wulfhlið","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sabatonsaboteurs/","165 products in account","First of all - addressing most of the negative reviews of this game: Do not treat this as a total war game. It may have the name Total War on it but it was never meant to be compared to the standard TW games. I started the game up expecting something similar to Tribal Wars and nothing more and that is exactly what this game has offered. A highly polished cross-platform casual game with fast (but fun) real-time battles.\n\nAs with all games of this genre there is an option to pay for gold to speed up your progress and recruit different (not overpowered, just a slightly different role) units. You can still earn gold in-game but unless you intend on playing this game for long periods of time in one go then gold is not neccesary. The Kingdom building is fantastic, you can terraform the land to your liking, build it how you like focusing either on your military to capture enemy (AI) settlements or on your economy to buy them out.\n\nThe PvP multiplayer aspect I haven't yet reached but I'm assuming so far it is for 1v1 army duels only so I can't comment on this.\n\nYou can customise your coat of arms with a variety of options which will then show up on the shields of your units, loading screens, and various other places.\n\nDespite looking rather simple, the combat actually does have a lot of depth to it. In fact compared to any other casual-like game of this genre it has the most depth I have seen. There are 9 unit slots and you can build your army as you wish, individual-stat / ability progression per unit, special  ability-activated buffs you can earn from building churches and so on. There is more to the combat than this - try it! It seems mind-numbingly simple at the beginning but as the army sizes begin to grow and as you gain more abilities the game reveals more and more depth which was a very pleasant surprise.\n\nOverall unless you buy gold with real money (you do get A LOT of gold for a small amount of money!) apart from at the beginning this is not a game that you can play for more than an hour at a time due to the nature of the game, but for playing half an hour or so every now and then it's brilliant. A fun, casual game. I highly recommend it!","April 11, 2015","true","33.9"," 6 of 31 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","6","31","0","0"

I've been a fan of the TW franchise for quite sometime and don't usally play games such as this.  The game will have more appeal when it is cross-platform as the lack of hotkeys and dependence on a only using the mouse cursor to do everything becomes tedious.

Yes it feels like a mobile game, so it's more of a casual pick up once in awhile and collect and fight etc. The fact you can play on all your devices makes it a good mobile game.\n\n2. Yes a lot of units you have to pay in game gold, which is bought with out of game real money. But with that said, I haven't felt like I needed the extra strong units to win battles. And it feels like more of a pay to get ahead quicker rather than the pay to win like everyone claims. People really have a stupid view of what pay to win means.\n\n3. I haven't encountered many bugs, and since it's autosave if the game were to crash you wouldn't lose any progress. Loads real quick also.\n\n4. The battle is very submersive, you feel like a commander, commanding his troops on the battle field. You command when your units charge and who your bowmen fire upon. Do you shoot the men your horsemen are battling and risk killing some of your own?\n\n5. Reminds me of a slow paced Ages of Empires. The graphics are nice and simple, but still pretty and colourful. It's a free game despite what the idiot masses would have you believe. It's not very pvp focused so you don't have to fight people who pay for units, etc., and get slaughtered. Just play it as a casual medieval times simulator.\n\nSome things I would like to see implemented are, naming your towns, being able to move peasants to other towns, multiple profiles if I want to start a new game, more things happening graphically on the map i.e peasants walking around, trade carts moving from town to town, barracks has soldiers training, etc..\n\nTotal Wars games are usually $60 on release, the fact this game is free should tell you people that it's not going to be like a Total Wars game. It doesn't take 8 hours to farm crops, it takes 20 minutes, it takes 8 hours if you want to farm all at once.

Furthermore, this game is intended firstly to make money without any real marketing strategy. The basic gameplay is directly linked to the purchase of gold with real money. Otherwise the game is very slow. An example: my character is level 24 and I've done (almost) all possible developments after 20 hours of gaming. To go further, I need to have a castle level 2, which means 1500 stones and 1500 silver. If you don't speed up the game using gold (i.e. real money), you're making around 100 silver every 2 hours. Same with stones... So, just to get this damn castle to level 2, I have to wait around 30 hours!  The basic gameplay should be the same, gold or not. I have no problem with paying some money to the developers. Gold should allow to improve the gameplay, not to replace it. But in this game, if you don't use gold, there is no gameplay and the game is just a mock up version of old strategy games I played in the 80's on my first computers. The combat system is obviously made for tablets, not for PC. It is dull, with very little strategy and tactical choices (the biggest stick wins). The only interest I found in this game is the map and the way you can change it. There is a good idea there but it's a pity: no action (except economics and construction) is taken on the map... As if the devs had never played Stronghold or Civ. Strange!","May 10, 2015","false","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plenty of time to patch and improve things, right? WRONG! What do I see? The exact same, pay-to-win garbage.\n\nI was hoping that this wouldn't happen, but it did. This game is cashing in on the (fairly) good name of Total War. I am incredibly dissapointed, and will likely not play again.\n\n\nTHE REVIEW BELOW IS OUTDATED:\n\nAs a fairly experienced Total War player, I can say that this game still has some of the spirit of the other  games in the franchise. Keep in mind, though, that I am recommending this as a free-to-play mobile game. Do not expect the same amount of depth as other Total War games.\n\nCombat:\nFor a game of this type, the combat is amazingly good. For once, a mobile game allows you to have some control over your men (unlike letting them "roam free" as in similar games).\n\nGraphics:\nSo far, so good. I really like the overall atmosphere of the game. The lighting, textures, and objects all look crisp and good.\n\nPay-To-Win:\nIn the tutorial, battles were fast, building built in minutes. After the tutorial, it's a different story. I was quickly slammed with a 9 hour wait time.\n\nAdvice for CA:\nLower the building and clearing times in the beginning of the game. The jump is just too large after the tutorial. Also, try to lower the building restrictions.\n\nShould You Play?\nI think that this game has enough potential to give a reason to play. Although, to go from "having potential" to "great", changes have to be made. It is in Beta right now, so I am confident that CA will make the changes necessary for this to be a great game. Try it out.","February 26, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a great opening and a good tutorial. I also like how the troops control during combat. It has a very smooth feeling and appears to be a rather good game considering it is 2 days old. There are a few issues however.\n\nFirst is the teraforming issue. I like how you can change the altitude of the ground to help prevent floods or to create rivers. It is also cool that only certain buildings can be built in certain elevations. (Like how roads can only be built on medium height. it doesn't make sense for a road to go right over a mountain and then right back down) Now the issue I have is that when you want to raise something to be one higher than the area around the tile you can do that. BUT if you want to raise it 2 times you must raise all the other tiles around it. and if one of those tiles can't be raised you either have to raise all the tiles around it OR deal with the lower land and the inability to build something. So if I am at the top of the map and need to raise a piece of ground to medium for a road I have to first raise the tile I want to low, then the 3 below it to low then the nine below those to low. If you want to alter one tile you may have to raise 20 or 30 tiles. It is crazy. What should happen is that if I raise a tile from low to medium and the ground around it is very low it costs double and it just makes the ground look like a little hill on that tile.\n\nThe other issue is camera control. Just let me use WASD for camera movement. I don't to have to click and drag. It is alright for a mouse but what about anyone using a touch pad. It can take 30 seconds to a minute just to go from one side of the map to another just on the small starting one. Also, who likes a stagnate map? You are building a kingdom. Have people training in the barracks. Have a blacksmith hammering. people walking on the roads. If no one walks on them, what is the point?\n\nThe game itself is fun. Good combat aspects as well as animation and building design. I think for a new game it is doing alright but there is a lot of progress to be made.","April 11, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or a fluff of fanboyism.\nThis game is free to play. So in reality they need to make some sort of profit off of it to make it worth their time and money, Keep this in mind when you begin playing it.\nThis is a game built to cater to total war fans AND tablet F2P fans. Keep this in mind when you begin playing it.\nIt is designed to let you play for a half hour to an hour. And then set it aside and do something else.\nWhen you come back the next day you are rewarded with the things you did the previous day.\nHate this model or love it.\nBut this is a well built F2P game.\nLooks beautiful, has a strategy battle system that is fun. But can become a little annoying because it is very rock, paper, scissors.\nIf you are willing to pay for your enjoyment, then you will be getting the accelerated experience. But it is no different then someone who doesnt. Just comes to you faster. The F2P idea is interesting. But I am not usually a fan. I love creative assembly and appreciate their hardwork on every game they have ever made. Because they do things no one else is willing to try.\nThese games are more rewarding if you are willing to be patient. But I will probably spend between 10 - 20 dollars on the game if it continues to pique my interest.\nDon't turn away from the game based on the haters.\nGive it a try, and actually give it some time.

With maybe more substance in the "settlers/build" mode or more incentives to actually DO something between fights (even early on you will have to wait 8h to harvest something and between the . kinda nice - battles your troops will usually need 10-15 minutes to heal) this might work as a game.\n\nRight now (12.4.2015 and after more than 2h of playing this game) i just have to say that the FUN is missing.

Been a fan of the Total War series since the original Medieval Total War. For those gamers out there that can't seem to wait 8 hours to harvest wheat, then I suggest taking your daily dosage for your ADD or ADHD or whatever it is they call it nowadays, sit down and figure out the value of x in the equation x^2 + y^2=1.  And possibly graph it on a Cartesian plane. (and btw x^2 means x squared. x times x, yes I know you weren't taught the x times table but tapped out at the 12. 12 X 12 = 144 booyah!) and when you finish that parabolic curve, guess what? Time to harvest wheat! Now why does the times table tap out at 12 cuz in the duodecimal system, 12 can be counted with one hand and 144 with two hands lol Again great work Total War Team, I can't wait for your games to get into the American Civil War.

It is a mobile FTP kingdom building game with appointment mechanics.  Yes there are 8 hr cooldowns, but you're not supposed to sit and watch the cooldown.  You can use gold or you can come back later.  Its designed for short 5-10 min play sessions.  Obv this doesn't sit well on PC as its not what we're used to.  You can spend money to skip grind, but you don't gain utility value from spending so its not pay-to-win.  However if you spend as much as you'd be prepared to on a standard PC game, you will probably be able to compete with higher ranks, but only if you spend strategically.\n\nI've played 9 hrs (FOR FREE) - it's got some interesting base building strategy, like balancing expansion with managing water levels.  You do have to wait to re-heal troops between fights which can mean you only have 1 fight per session, but if you overwhelm opposition you can get away with zero casualties and thus fight again straightaway.\n\nBattles are more like a puzzle game than a traditional Total War fight, but still retains elements of setting up your formation to outwit opponent and making strategic moves mid game to counter act opponent's moves.\n\nBiggest failing is that the game doesn't pit you against real opponents soon enough.  After 9 hrs I still haven't fought a real person - I assume this is coming!?!?","April 12, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example I built my second city on high ground then discovered I could not get a road to it, so I had to demolish it and rebuild.  Structure that I have learned earn me incoming like smithy, merchants, taverns etc. Built my tavern near the water and it got flooded :p, slums good for recruiting peasants but best built near water, mansions give more craftsmen, building farm in an area with only 3-4 available hexagons is a bad idea as this is where farm land is. Building soldiers no point in upgrading them at early stage rather just buy better soldiers, better soldiers are ultimately cheaper and will win e.g. upgrade soldiers gives 1 point in defence, as you unlock better units, that unit could end up offering an extra 25 points, each point you earn from experience is more expensive, so to earn 25 point equivalent is not going to happen, can also upgrade soldiers, armour, weapons etc.","April 12, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Possibly ok if you want a game to log into 2 or 3 times a day for 10 minutes but if you are looking for a game you can spend any sort of time on be prepared to spend long times doing nothing or spen money.\n\nNot good","April 12, 2015","false","93.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With maybe more substance in the "settlers/build" mode or more incentives to actually DO something between fights (even early on you will have to wait 8h to harvest something and between the . kinda nice - battles your troops will usually need 10-15 minutes to heal) this might work as a game.\n\nRight now (12.4.2015 and after more than 2h of playing this game) i just have to say that the FUN is missing. And that is .... kinda bad, right?\nI might give it another try in a few weeks. But for the time beeing this is a nice looking but boring experience.","April 12, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Been a fan of the Total War series since the original Medieval Total War. For those gamers out there that can't seem to wait 8 hours to harvest wheat, then I suggest taking your daily dosage for your ADD or ADHD or whatever it is they call it nowadays, sit down and figure out the value of x in the equation x^2 + y^2=1.  And possibly graph it on a Cartesian plane. (and btw x^2 means x squared. x times x, yes I know you weren't taught the x times table but tapped out at the 12. 12 X 12 = 144 booyah!) and when you finish that parabolic curve, guess what? Time to harvest wheat! Now why does the times table tap out at 12 cuz in the duodecimal system, 12 can be counted with one hand and 144 with two hands lol Again great work Total War Team, I can't wait for your games to get into the American Civil War.

It is a mobile FTP kingdom building game with appointment mechanics.  Yes there are 8 hr cooldowns, but you're not supposed to sit and watch the cooldown.  You can use gold or you can come back later.  Its designed for short 5-10 min play sessions.  Obv this doesn't sit well on PC as its not what we're used to.  You can spend money to skip grind, but you don't gain utility value from spending so its not pay-to-win.  However if you spend as much as you'd be prepared to on a standard PC game, you will probably be able to compete with higher ranks, but only if you spend strategically.\n\nI've played 9 hrs (FOR FREE) - it's got some interesting base building strategy, like balancing expansion with managing water levels.  You do have to wait to re-heal troops between fights which can mean you only have 1 fight per session, but if you overwhelm opposition you can get away with zero casualties and thus fight again straightaway.\n\nBattles are more like a puzzle game than a traditional Total War fight, but still retains elements of setting up your formation to outwit opponent and making strategic moves mid game to counter act opponent's moves.\n\nBiggest failing is that the game doesn't pit you against real opponents soon enough.  After 9 hrs I still haven't fought a real person - I assume this is coming!?!?","April 12, 2015","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
