This is how bad this piece of trash is.\n\nYou have no idea how horrible this game is, it looks like the devs said " oh wow look there are similar looking games on steam, so lets download unity and use the assets on it and do no coding in it and put this on steam "\n\nDear valve, I along with a lot of other people are more than willing to moderate your greenlight section for free to stop crap like this from coming to steam, please consider our request.\n\nHere is whats wrong with the game.\n\n1 - there are no sounds only when you shoot.\n2 - most horrible bot that was ever designed .\n3 - Maps are sad poorly done clones from counter-strike.\n4 - Literally nothing to do in the game except move and shoot dumb bots.\n5 - Bugs everywhere.\n6 - Literally 0 players online, according to steamspy and its usually on spot.\n7 - Vehicles are bugged and keeps teleporting.\n8 - There are two "modes" That are basically the same exact thing.\n9 - shooting and stabbing bots doesn't do anything.\n10 - Broken English all over the game, I mean mine isn't anywhere near perfect but damn ... look at the store page .... clearly the developer is either a child or seriously just trolling steam.\n11 - the price is a joke, this shouldn't even be free-to-play, this should be removed from steam.\n\nAfter I saw the game for 4 minutes I kept waiting, refreshing the browser page of the store, waiting when can I review it so I can say what I just did ..... my .... what the hell are you doing valve ? There's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ on steam but this is just too much.\n\n"What is the current state of the Early Access version?\n“Stable, playable, just need some minor updates.”"\n\nNOPE This is not stable or playable, and it needs at least 4 years of constant updates to actually consider it to be a playable game that deserves to be on steam.\n\nDear devs, please reconsider your career as a "game developer" I put it on airquotes because you're not one, this is a joke.","February 8","false","0.8"," 98 of 128 people (77%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","77","98","128","30","7"

Ugh...\n\nOkay, so, this is a FPS game with poor Minecraft-ish graphics. It has ridiculously simple Mode Selection screen, where you can only see "Strike" and "Battle" buttons with no background, no theme song or any other detail whatsoever. Don't expect a title screen, because after the "Made with Unity" animation, it immediately takes you to choose modes, then you get to the menu. The only options you see in the Options menu is just graphics and sensitivity, but when you are ingame, it also gives you opportunity to change your screen resolution.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay... dear lord, the Battle Mode bears a strong resemblance to Battlefield 4 while the Strike Mode is literally a shameless copy of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive; same gameplay, same weapons, same objectives, etc. I guess we're gonna expect some copyright infringement right there.\n\nYou can play on Singleplayer (and apparently the AI isn't very good on this one), but you can't play on Multiplayer; the servers are always offline. I tried to connect to official servers and via IP a bunch of times and all I got is just "Connection Failed". Then I've hosted some servers on both gamemodes, but unfortunately, players are never coming on.\n\nNow let's talk about the Gamemodes that we have:\n\nIn the Strike Mode, you instantly get to buy weapons in the Purchase Menu (it stays up until you leave your spawn area, and will appear again when you come back), then the round starts as the Red Team (Terrorists, apparently) rushes to the Bomb Site and attempts to destroy it while the Blue Team (Counter-Terrorists) tries to stop them and defuse the planted C4. Strangely, you can only play Bomb Defuse at the de_dust-like map, but there isn't Hostage Rescue at the moment. But hey, you can see players' names through the walls! Hooray for free wallhacks!... Yeah, whatever, let's see the weapons.\nWhat do we have here? We've got an AK-47 (with the Vulcan Skin), Galil, AWP (Asiimov-styled sniper rifle), USP (silenced pistol), Glock and M9 Bayonet knife, and all of them are borrowed from CS:GO as well. But why does the AWP look so ♥♥♥♥ing weak?! It's not killing players in one shot and doesn't even have a bass-boosted eargasm firing sound unlike the actual AWP from Counter-Strike series.\nLet's take a look at the playermodels: everyone plays as the exact same young commando guy with different colors for two teams, but it doesn't look anything like the policemen or the famous crime-based faction members like we usually had back in Counter-Strike games. At all.\nOh, what is this? We can soonly have access to the the Inventory? I wonder what could it be?\n\nIn the Battle Mode, you can choose three classes - Assault, Engineer and Sniper. No, there's no Support/Medic class, but you can drop 5 medkits as a Sniper (this must be something new, isn't it?). Then the teams spawn in their bases and attempt to capture a flag and defend it from enemies.\nYou also have a set of driveable vehicles - Tank, Humvee, Jet Plane and a Helicopter. Humvee is fine, but I don't know if you can shoot through that turret. The tank is somewhat fine, except the projectiles and firing sound are acting weird; the firing sound doesn't sound like a cannon at all as it rather sounds like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rifle, and the explosions don't even make a sound! Oh, I might've forgot about one thing: nothing makes sounds at all, except for guns. As for the jet, meh, it sure has some wacky controls and physics. Now don't get me started on that helicopter, it's absolutely uncontrollable. I can only fire rockets from it but I can't go up in air. THIS IS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!\nAnd again, you can only play at one map and that's it. No train stations, no flooded Chinese cities, no snowy mountains from Final Stand, no deserts with industrial towers, nothing. It's only a big grassy field with a herd of static gas tanks and houses. How's that feel, ya blockhead? Oh, and I also noticed the yet another pistol when I played as a Sniper, and it's detailed as an AK-47. Must be P228, I don't know.\n\nOverall, this game is a godawful piece of soap (you Russians will know what I mean) and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ rip-off of CS:GO, Battlefield and Ace of Spades that should've never deserved a Greenlight support and should've rather been released as an Android/iOS version... uh-oh. I'm actually sorry about this, but I think I didn't realize this game is the early-access/beta version, so the half of my review may not be truthful. Still, I'd suggest you to not waste your precious money, even when it's on a sale (it's now 19 rubles), and move along. Buy something else, I say.\n\nAnd right now I've made a somewhat regretting decision to randomly achieve a Steam key for this game. Stupid NinjaScout. ._.\n\n2/10\n\nAlso, I've heard that the final version will allow players to edit maps and weapons, but I guess that won't give much hype to other people.","February 15","false","0.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","14","17","4","1"

The "AK" is the Vulcan from Cs:GO, the map for the "strike" gamemode is literally Dust II, in fact, this game borrows quite a bit from Cs:GO. Looking paast the fact that this game is completely unoriginal, it's also very brokenat the moment. In my experience, the "Strike" gamemode gets stuck in warmup (also inspired by cs:go) and then the game will not start. There's so much broken english you'd expect you were reading a menu in a chinese restaurant. Keep in mind this game is still in Early Access, so  obviously  these issues will be fixed soon.\n\nBTW, the devs said in September 2015 that the game will be in Early Access for 4 -5 months, so we should see this game fully completed by March 2016 or so...","February 20","false","0.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Nuclear shot is a game about the three major politcal powers during the french industrial revolution. Hitler, Max Payne, and Laura McCrowsky.
