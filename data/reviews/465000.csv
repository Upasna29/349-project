"http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrogamer/recommended/465000/","electrogamer","Electro Gamer UK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/electrogamer/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEvent Horizon is I would say a cross between Star Control and Space invaders/asteroid that I used to play when I was a kid, ts actually quite addictive!\n\nYou start off with a main vessel and 3 other ships, a scout ship, a 'thingy' (i have no idea what it was) and a cruiser type ship. Each have their own weapons systems and shield capabilities.\n\nA quick menu jump to the star map and you get a feel for how big this game will be, there are tons and tons of stars to visit. The only problem is that every star you visit involves a fight. In the 40 odd minutes I played I had about 6 battles. These were with ships of a similar class to mine but some had upgrades. Travelling to new star systems and then again within that system to planets and stations is done by clicking the star/station/planet you want to visit.\n\nIn most systems there are at least a couple of planets but at this time the exploration of planets is not included so despite there being a menu option to explore them... you cant. TRUST ME I HAVE TRIED!\n\nBattles take the form of asteroid style gameplay. Fire your weapon at the enemy and try to hit them to cause them damage. Most evenly matched ships took about 6 or so hits to kill, you can then collect parts and fuel and credits.\nOverall I like the idea of the game, it will become repetitive and probably a little boring but ship upgrades and new systems to explore may keep you wanting more. For me its a good one to play whilst the wife watches crap on TV!\n\nPro's:\nRuns well on a laptop!\nGame has a tutorial (takes about 4 seconds to complete)\nHuge skill/upgrade tree\n\nCons\nRepetitive gameplay\nNon existent story\nBattles quickly become hard","May 1","true","0.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I decided to play it a bit before I went to bed, and, all I can say is...\n\nJesus Christ, this is fun. The combat is exciting, the sensation of building something greater is ever-present, and the mechanics seem complex and nuanced.\n\nI'll update my review if anything changes as I play the game more, but, all the game really needs, right now, aside from the quests and the storyline the developer has pledged to create, is a REAL tutorial. Right now, there's a quick combat tutorial that allows one to test new weapons, ship configurations, et cetera, without any risk - brilliant on its own, but...\n\nHonestly, I have no idea if I'm ever playing the game correctly. Like, what are those icons in the beginning of the customization section? When do I get to research technologies? Can I not explore any planets, yet, or, am I missing something?\n\nThere are definitely some features missing, but, the base game is definitely worth it, as is. Highly recommended.","May 17","true","3.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/opther/recommended/465000/","opther","Opther","http://steamcommunity.com/id/opther/","72 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVery addictive and complex game.\n\nI will go straight to the facts;):\n\nPros:\n\n+ Space rpg.\n+ Lots of ships.\n+ Weapons, upgrades, modules, which can be purchase, looted and found on the ships and then unlocked and installed in our destroyers.\n+ Random loot of varying quality.\n+ Fractions with their own technologies and ships.\n+ Each ship requires a different approach to combating it.\n+ Shops where you can buy fractions of points, ships, modules, fuel, etc. (Items is renewed in time).\n+ Difficult and you need good brains in gear to extend the ship / fleet that met the challenges.\n+ Planetary exploration in search of resources, modules and foremost schemes of new ships.\n+ Very addictive.\n+ To walk far enough and get the first (any) flagship is the need to play hundreds of hours.\n+ There is a lot of builds and strategies in network.\n+ Very light and compatible with android save, can run on a low spec PCs.\n+ I have already mentioned is difficult? Game is very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult, but it is an advantage.Even a small change in one module in a ship can change the course of battle.\n+ 6 hangars ships. Like the modules in the ship, there can be almost freely lay ships and choose the fleet which we will fight in the next battles. 6 hangars allows you to store 6 sets of different fleets.\n+ Digits and "%". Here, everything is based on digits - armour, attack, speed, times of renewal energy and weapons, energy, funds, "luck", levels, it all depends on a large number of numerical values.\n+ You can create unique builds ships. Even properly "modded" small size craft is able to overcome the flagship ;).\n+ Satisfaction when, after long and heavy fighting finally destroy the enemy's capital and get access to the hostile workshop, where you can forge the enemy ships and new modules to our ships.\n+ Millions of stars (literally), and even more planets to explore ...\n+ Full of randomness on almost everything (loot, maps, quality of items, the whole universe, etc.).\n+ AFK grinding with "carriers".\n+ Passives tree.\n+ Points faction which unlocks alien technologies, and later conquer their capitals to create their "products".\n+ Continuously developed and seasonal events :)\n+ Gauntlets - grind / leveling :)\n+ Super stable, 300h and there is no any crashes :)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA couple cons (unfortunately):\n\n- Graphic does not knock.\n- No mouse targeting, which means that in the early stages of the game, it is difficult to hit a fast ship. In addition, the high value of the rotate speed of the ship can be too much "turn" and does not hit the enemy, and return to a good position may cost us time or/and defeat. Automatic targeting modules will "repair" this disadvantage.\n- Addictive and it takes a lot of time :D.\n- No automatic fighting, so we lose a lot of time on the easy/normal fights.\n- There is no way to create your own ships.\n- Can`t rotate ships in hangars and modules in ships (!), so we lose some freedom to deploy a fleet of ships and improving - the same applies to modules.\n- If someone does not like to grind, but such is the nature of the game ;)\n- There is no storyline and quests (yet) :(\n- A couple of skills / passives in the skill tree\n- No galactic trading. Of corse, we can buy and sell products, but the prices are fixed.\n- Difficult planet exploration, small drone versus the dozens of horny, well armed drones.\n\nI don`t remember more pros/cons ;).\n\nI recommend you buy it, or play the demo (look at FB ;) ). You can create and lvl up a fleet in demo, and later, when developer probably will add some storyline and quests, we already will have created fleet (if, of course, saves will be still compatible with the final version of the game) - for now saves from the demo is compatible with the version of Steam.\n\nIf You like rpgs, space, grind, loot, strategies, military, skills, lasers, torpedoes, black holes, drones, thinking, exploration etc.. I recommend this game, because it is addictive like a black hole :).","May 1","true","66.3"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Back when this game was still in Greenlight, I had downloaded the demo, as I had played it on Android, so I really have about 60-70 hours Idk.\n\nFly around to different star systems, battle ships, get money, buy new ships, battle more ships, buy more parts for your ships, customize your ships,  put your ships on your shipping wall,  explore planets, get resources from the planets, most of which you'll just sell to get more money to buy more ♥♥♥♥ for your ships. Attempt to destroy some flagships AND THEN GET YOUR ♥♥♥ WHOOPED BY THOR.\n\n10 Factions - Go to each faction's territory and duke it out with their ships. Earn research stars, research faction-specific technologies, unlock new ones. Capture their base in order to use it's workshop, and to construct their technology.\n\nPros:\n\n-Space.\n-Ship to ship combat.\n-Very customizable ships.\n-Combat is fun and enjoyable.\n-Faction territory is very common, you won't be wandering around too much.\n-There are no major bugs to report.\n-It is actually quite true that there are millions of stars; I think EH's universe might be infinite.\n-Did I mention space?\n\nCons:\n-Some technologies are un-researchable.\n-No storyline, although I expect one will be added soon. I always have my headcanon ;)\n-There can be a lot of grinding, if you're not a fan of grinding.\n-Thor is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n-Will consume your very soul with it's addictiveness\n\nTL;DR - This game is awesome and you should buy it.\n\nDid I mention there was space?\n\n8.3/10","May 15","true","48.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

This took me to a combat game so it looks like the training might be buggy.\n\nMy thumbs down still stands, but it does show promise once more features have been enabled and perhaps some hints or instructions added.","May 16","false","0.6"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","7","14","0","0"

My video and full reviews can be found by following the links below. Here's the short version.....\n\nIf you like retro space war games, but with way more depth, then this is an excellent game. Never played any of these old school games? No problem, pick this up and have fun as well. It has (limited) exploration, good game depth, lot's of spaceships, great battles, strategy, and nice gameplay mechanics. The upgrades and technologies available are impressive. Even in it's current state, which is way better then I expected, it's worth the price tag without a doubt. It is more completed then expected. You get a good game that can only get better. It gets an 8 out of 10 from me without hesitation!\n\nPure Gameplay video: https://youtu.be/seG8-Qii8hU\n\nFull English review: http://grandpagaming.blogspot.nl/2016/05/event-horizon-english-and-dutch-review.html\n\nVolledige Nederlands Review: http://grandpagaming.blogspot.nl/2016/05/event-horizon-review-nederlands.html","May 6","true","8.8"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

The customization options are huge, but the controls are finicky, and its lacking in a decent tutorial and tooltips, these are the things I'm hoping EA will add.","May 23","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you take a moment to learn it. The planet side stuff def needs work. I can see it was meant for mobile but with tweaks and adjustments this could be a great little PC gem.\n\nI've had tons of entertainment so far just trying to unlock stuff and exploring the systems. The high cost of ships and items is a little daunting with how much you need to grind to get them then unlock their premade structure (that could use some work). Better explanations of weapon sizes and slots would be nice also.\n\nThen again it is early access and the dev is looking for feedback so lets do just that! Instead of the one neg review I saw posted like 3 days ago... that person sounds like they got stuck at the start menu because there's quite a bit to do as is not just a few "buggy" screens lol","May 18","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
