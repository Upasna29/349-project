Easy and fun, and a perfect game for killing time without thinking too hard about what you are doing. Would have been extra fun with steam achievements :)  And it's weird that Wedding Dash 1 and 3 isn't on steam... If you like time management games, cute characters and the other dash games then this is a fun game for you :)","July 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's quirky, quite easy and can be played a little at a time or a lot. No matter what you are doing this game will give you some time to kill and something to do that can be kind of fun.","June 17, 2014","true","9.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you like these kinds of games then this one is a no-brainer! Great for soon to be Weds!","August 22, 2013","true","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
