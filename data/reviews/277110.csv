"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Celgaming/recommended/277110/","Celgaming","Celgaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Celgaming/","941 products in account","Myst meets Jules Verne's Mysterious Island, a match made in heaven. Does "Return to Mysterious Island" live up to these two great pieces of work? Short answer is: Yes!\n\nIt's 2014 now and it's been over 10 years since this game was released on PC, and then re-released on MacOS four years later. Created by Kheops Studio an indie company and published by The Adventure Company back in 2004 and now finally in 2014 available to buy on Steam. Kheops Studio is a game company that primary makes puzzle adventure games and it shows that they know the ropes when it comes to creating a fun and challenging adventure title with an interesting setting that mixes both fiction and fact. The studio is now well known for releasing successful adventure titles on the PC.\n\nMany adventure games are known for getting the player stuck constantly, but I never had this "problem" when playing the game. From the very start of the game, keen eyes and basic common sense will keep you busy trying out different survival techniques and before I knew it I was hooked. There's something about an adventure game that has more than one way of solving a problem with different item combinations than having only one absolute solution that makes you want to keep coming back. The setting of the game is also enjoyable as you're basically thrown into an exotic island full of beauty and told to survive.\n\nThe game is very much like Myst in that you control it from a first person perspective and the world consist of different animated images that you can pan around in. You never get a feeling that you're just going through a set of images as the animations are top notch and they bring the world to life. I did a live stream of this game and the audience, as well as me, concluded that the game looks crisp and clean despite its age. That's one of the plusses to these type of titles: they age really well and don't feel dated at all.\n\nThe puzzles and problem solving aren't too difficult once you get a hang of it and the UI is easy to use as well and the whole game is playable with the mouse alone. Don't get me wrong though, there are a lot of head scratching moments later on but the game eases you in just the right amount throughout the game. Mina, the main protagonist, gives hints and provides just enough bare information to ensure you don't get stuck too often. Later on if you manage to fix your phone watch you are provided with even more information on items in a form of an in-game encyclopedia.\n\nMany events in the game are pushed forward with hand drawn comic style cutscenes that are voiced and have vivid sounds, and it turns out to be a very effective way to keep the plot moving and you interested. They also act as a reward for figuring out a small puzzles.\n\nThe game also keeps a score for everything you do and says the "more improvised the solution, the more points you get" which essentially just translates to don't do stupid things, like try smash a coconut open with a rock when you have an improvised knife as you'll lose some of the contents. If you reach 100, 200 and 300 in score you are rewarded with hidden art work in the main menus gallery which is a nice bonus but nothing too great.\n\nAll in all Return to Mysterious Island still holds strong even today. The graphics look detailed and alive and the puzzles are fantastic. As for story all I can say is that it's probably the only weak point of the game. It's a mixture of fiction and fact as I stated earlier and relies heavily on Jules Vernes novel and there isn't any kind of arching of the character.\n\nThe story of the island is however believable and interesting with a lot of history and well thought out locations, but the game ends almost abruptly and as such is relatively short. Only 4 to 6 hours of game depending on how quick your wits are and this perhaps might turn some people away from a purchase.\n\nThere is a sequel to the game that pretty much continues right off of the first game in a very corny fashion, but I have yet to complete that game but when I do I will write a review of that game too as the time comes. Also I will live stream it on Twitch. (Shameless self promotion *cough*)\n\n8/10 - "Monkey goodness."","August 10, 2014","true","8.6"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","42","43","0","0"

It won't run in Steam. (More on that in a second).\n\nThis game is an absolute masterpiece for point and clicks in my opinion. A Solid 9.5/10.\n\nBut there is a major flaw. For a lot of people, this game won't run. I have figured out a workaround for this:\n\nFew things you have to do here depending on your OS; but all are collectively here.\n\n1. Right click the game in your Steam Library and select "Properties". Select the "Local Files" tab and click "Verify Integrity of Game Cache". You will notice that 1 of the files is corrupt and will be re-downloaded. This doesn't always happen instantly and you may or may not see it in the download section. If you don't see it, don't worry - It'll happen. Move on, regardless.\n\n2. Navigate to the Steamapps\Common\Return to Mysterious Island Folder. Once there, Right click Game.exe and select properties. Click the compatibility tab and select "Run this program in compatibility mode for: Windows XP (Service Pack 3). Select "Run this program as an administrator". Then click "Apply" and then "OK"\n\n3. Repeat this process for the file: RtMI.exe. Selecting BOTH the Compatibility mode as well as the Administrator rights.\n\n4. Setting Windowed Mode - (Optional, in some cases.): Open the file: config.ini with Notepad. Inside, you will find a line that says: "bFullScreen=1" Change this to say 0 (zero) instead of 1. Save the file.\n\nAt this point, you're finished, but you CAN NOT run the game through the Steam Library. Instead, launch the file: Game.exe FROM THE FOLDER (Shortcuts won't work) and the game should start. Most won't require Windowed Mode - so try skipping Step 4 first. if it doesn't work, you can change to windowed mode in the .ini and adjust resolution as needed by adjusting the "bScreenResolution" string.\n\nHope this helps anyone enjoy a wonderful Point and Click adventure! Don't forget to pick up Part 2, it's even better!\n\n--Reli","November 26, 2014","true","0.1"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","32","33","2","0"

It even has some replay value, because you get points for all you do and all puzzles you solve - and you can always try to get a better score and look which solution you might have missed last time.\n\nIf you can get over the "old" display settings and are into adventure games, you should give this a try. But beware - you might end up like me, searching for more games from the guys who made this.","March 10, 2014","true","2.7"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

Girl uses local stuff and lots of creativity to get by until she's rescued. Girl makes monkey friend.\n\nThat is pretty much all that happens in RtMI 1 but the game is something like a rite of passage you have to go through before you get to the really good stuff (RtMI 2 obviously). This isn't to say it's a bad game but it isn't a great one either. Story-wise it's pretty thin, the music and the graphics aren't fantastic so this kinda lands it in the "mediocre-at-best" pile.\n\nHowever, the voice acting was a treat, as we're talking Sharon Mann (you might remember her as the voice of Syberia's Kate Walker) trying to sound like a teenage girl. I also liked how the inventory system gave me more liberty in terms of choosing how to combine my items, and there were a couple of pretty creative riddles and math-based-puzzles I really enjoyed.\n\nIt's not often I get to say that a sequel was better but in this case: hang in there, the best is yet to come.","August 27, 2014","true","8.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You play as Mina, a young woman stranded on a mysterious island when a storm ends her attempts to sail around the world on her own. The premise is nice and the multiple solutions to the puzzles works very well with the survival theme. I'm not sure it really provides replayability though.\n\nTrying to tie her fate together with the Jules Verne story also makes for a very bland and forgettable storeline however. It would have been much more interesting to create a more unique story of a woman trying to survive on an island by herself. Moreover, while the interface works well for the most part, there is a certain lack of feedback when using items (either just an error sound or Mina says "I think something is missing") that can cause confusion and encourages the tried and tested method of simply trying to combine everything in the hopes it works. One example of this is in the early game where you get a knife blade. Combining this with wood will give it a handle and enable you to cut things at a distance... but what the game doesn't tell you is that the knife then for some reason loses the ability to cut things up close. So when you try this on close items you simply get the error sound, but no indication why it does not work.\n\nOverall it is a good puzzler with some interesting mechanics that makes it a bit different from a lot of other point and clicks out there. Had they just spent a bit more time on the story it could have been really great, but as is, I would still recommend it.","March 24, 2014","true","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The graphics I think hold up well enough to current standards, although other elements of the game's design, like the inventory interface and the menu, do feel a bit dated. But that wasn't a big obstacle for me.\n\nSince I'm a Jules Verne fan, I really enjoyed the Verne-inspired elements of the story a lot. The story felt to me to start slowly, mostly because the first part of the story you are collecting many items that you won't need until later, but the more I progressed in the game the more I enoyed the story. The game's real strength is in the well-designed puzzles and crafting that you do throughout the game. While the style in which the game introduces collectable items and hints on how to craft things and solve puzzles may take some getting used to, I utlimately found puzzle-solving in this game to be very rewarding and satisfying. By and large, the game assumes the player has some smarts, something that games these days don't always do. There are a few puzzles that allow you some variance in how to solve them, including the final puzzle that completes the game, and I think that is very player-friendly as the game doesn't expect every player to think the same way. And of course, there are many walkthroughs available should you get stuck. I would advise saving often, in case you miss something and want to re-do a section or simply want to try doing it a different way.","September 28, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well I have 7.4 hours on record for this game which turned out to be 7 hours too many.  This game caused 7.4 hours of argurments and anger in my household.  As a female game player I typically enjoy these types of games but after probably the first half hour found out that there was no logic whatsoever to this game.   You have to be some mad scientist MacGyver and craft items that make no sense at all.  This game was sooo irritating and I continued to play to see if ultimately it would make any sense or at least have a good ending.  But alas neither logic or a good ending came and at the end i was just left with far too many hours invested and a hugely disappointed ending.  So if you enjoy the type of game that you could be totally mindless and rely on the help of a trained monkey then by all means enjoy this game.

It's far more intelligent than I expected. Brush up on your maritime equipment and basic chemistry, hehe. The puzzles are clever and sometimes infuriating. The problem solving was quite engaging and I enjoyed the variety of ways that I could tackle obstacles. It's quite easy at the start and then becomes more complex and difficult. There were some things that made me walk away ranting once I figured them out, because I had a notion about how something was created which was not one of the solutions the game recognized. Damn you, oil lamp. And soap. Some of the reviews call the graphics and interface "dated", which technically they are. But there are much newer games with much worse graphics (and I don't mean the deliberately pixellated ones). Personally, I think the  graphics are quite lovely. The story could have been better, I suppose, but since I was raised on Jules Verne, the thrill of "oh my god its Captain Nemo" kinda overrode some plot deficiencies. I wish it had been longer. I wish I'd had more chance to use the items I cobbled together. But I'd recommend it and I'll play it again.\nAlso, for me it ran fine on Windows 8.1 64, so either the issue people were having has been resolved or I was lucky.","February 4, 2015","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the puzzles are inventory related and they all make "real-life logical" sense such you can create a Becquerel battery with the same items you would need to create one in real life. If you're a fan of all those surviving out in the wild shows, you'll probably enjoy this game because that's the main plot. Mina washed up on the shore of an unknown island without any supplies. She must explore her surrounding and forage for food and supplies. Eventually she'll need to create weapons from what she finds on the island as well. This is a game where you can "die" but it immediately reloads to where you were right before you died after showing an illustration of Mina dying so no worries. There are multiple ways you can combine inventory items to create the tools, etc. that you need. The more combinations you create, the more points you get. Every 100 points that you earn you unlock concept art to view. I love playing this game when I need to relax or just enjoyable pass some time. I highly recommend you give this game a chance even if you are just a casual gamer.
