"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/35450/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Red Orchestra 2 is pretty cool, I guess. I mean, if you like having post traumatic stress disorder.\n\nRO2:RS:MTV, is the sequel to Red Orchestra, which in turn is a sequel to an Unreal tournament 2004 mod called Red Orchestra, which in turn is a prequel to Battlefield: bad company 2: Vietnam.\n\nThe game takes place during WW2, a time in history when it was okay to wear a fedora, and it was only this time, so cut it out. Red Orchestra 2 focuses heavily on multiplayer, which is bad for me because that means I have to talk to people, which is bad for them because they can't understand meth induced slurring. Even with its multiplayer focus, the game manages to carry a narrative, and that narrative is "We should probably stop having these wars, guys."\n\nThe game takes no liberties with the horrors that are war, screams of pain are constant, cries for mercy will haunt you, and realism mode is so immersive you can smell the vodka off Gregor's breath.\nFor Christ sakes Gregor, brush your teeth you crazy Ivan.\n\nThe game is not about ideologies, you won't be getting a Medal of Honor type story about how country A saved the world from country B. The game is about soldiers, the men who fought and died in the worlds biggest game of finger points. Bang Bang.\nNone of the four factions involved are idolized or demonized. The game also has nation specific voices, so Germans speak German, Russians speak Russian, Americans speak American, and the Japanese speak in some language I've never heard of. Though I managed to pick up on some of their phrases. Like "Tuskete" means "Help me." and "Banzai" means "Put on some 3D glasses, because I'm coming right at you."\n\nBut that aside, with all the blood and carnage and butt stabbing. Is the game fun to play? I would say yes.\n\nIt's an acquired taste, like beer or ♥♥♥♥♥. It makes no efforts into easing in the casual crowed, or as I like to call them: the weak.\nIt demands that you learn how to play it, it demands that you work together with your new virtual cartoon pals, and it demands that you learn how to use the rod that makes bullets magically appear to kill the people you're pointing at. I call them bang sticks.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer campaign mode, which is probably the coolest idea a multiplayer game has had since Chromehounds, or Mech assault, or Armored Core. I would like more robots in my games please, but I digress. Players join a server and choose a side, this will be your side unless you're a filthy traitor and go turn coat. It adds a fictional narrative to a game about a real war, like American Marines defending Iwo Jima from a massive Japanese counter attack, or Russians once again fighting in Stalingrad against Super Hitler and his army of Nazi Zombies.\nSomebody should a game about that, that sounds pretty cool, but I don't think Nazi Zombies™ would catch on.\n\nShould you play Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad: Rising Storm: Flags of our Fathers: Gods and Generals: The Reckoning: Army of the Dead: Escape from LA: The Simpsons Movie?\nI give it two thumbs up, It's a familiar formula while feeling completely different. It will turn off the more casual video game players, but who needs them anyway? This game is for manly men, like me, just me really.\n\nI give it 2 Vietnam war flash backs, out of 2. The plastic nubs on the end of shoe laces are called aglets. Their true purpose is sinister.\n\nOh yeah, and I got one of those Curator things now.\nI update it from time to time, and when I do I usually regret updating it, but here you go.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation","November 8, 2014","true","38.1"," 940 of 997 people (94%) found this review helpful 680 people found this review funny","94","940","997","680","23"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigmajor/recommended/35450/","gigmajor","Hérétique","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigmajor/","708 products in account","You spend the majority of your time sitting in a disgusting ditch filled with the shattered corpses of your fallen comrades, as well as those still unfortunate to be "alive", if you can even use that term to describe what is left of those wretches. As you crawl through soggy trenches, you can hear the shouts of orders being given and soldiers being slain, either blown to torn meat by mortar explosions or cut in half from machine gun fire. You are not a man, you are a frightened rabbit that dashes from cover to cover, whispering wishes of survival for but a few more seconds while pieces of concrete are chipped away around you by enemy sharp shooters. In the worst of times, you are a worm that crawls in the mud, lest a rifleman spots your shape in the distance. There is no salvation from a tank. Death can come from nowhere at all.\n\nStay away fom windows.\n\nAlso, you can't drop more than five feet without breaking a leg. It's fine though, since your small pack of two bandages offers you a second chance at life. Try not too die to quickly, and remember to check your magazine. You can also modify your sights and give out commands. There are a variety of classes to choose from. Choose wisely, and don't be afraid to loot corpses; they don't need anything anymore anyway.\n\nStay away from windows.\n\nThere is also a morale system, where you slowly lose your mind if you are under a barrage of enemy rounds, or if you see an ally get half of their face blown off and fall to the ground screaming in agony for a good minute or so before bleeding out. The result is blurred and discolored sight. I think I got this when I saw a guy get his legs shot off and watched him crawl about an inch away from cover before getting taken out by a sniper.\n\nStay away from windows.\n\nIn all seriousness, this game has a great deal of work put into detail and animations, but there remain some optimization issues. They're not bad, and a someone with an excellent PC might never even notice them.\n\nRising Storm and Red Orchestra 2 have different dynamics, although the mechanics are exactly the same, if that makes any sense.\n\nIf there is one thing I have to ABSOLUTELY give this game credit for, is that it has a personality. A very grim personality, but it's better than the typical "♥♥♥♥ yeah" jingoism many games go for.\n\nThere is nothing more satisfying than watching an enemy tank blow to bits.\n\nThe singleplayer is good practice, but the AI is really ditzy. The soldiers do not show a lot of initiative and tanks commanders seem to forget that tanks can't climb walls.\n\nAlso, about the window thing: I was waiting for my squad to move up and about seven of them decided march right in front of a window in a factory. A machine gunner across the chasm opened up on them and killed them all. It was really unpleasant to watch them panic and stumble and run into each other while being shot to pieces.","November 25, 2013","true","19.8"," 878 of 933 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","878","933","3","28"

Our crash-course, self-led tutorial basically consisted of my friend driving in circles because he could hardly see anything out of the driver's slit; me not being able to shoot the gun properly because the tank was constantly moving, resulting in tank shells being fired haphazardly around; and the machine gunner, who knew what he was doing, yelling at us and calling us incompetent idiots. I proceeded to accidentally pop my head out through the tank's top, only to instantaneously be shot. My dead body slumped back into the tank cockpit and awkardly jostled there as everything in the tank was suddenly painted with my blood. I can imagine Russian soldiers peeping out of their foxholes, only to comically spectate a German tank spin around, firing randomly and carelessly.\n\nLater in the siege, our commander called in artillery on friendly positions and we lost.\n\nI think they actually kill employees to record the game's death screams. Red Orchestra 2 can easily be named 'PTSD Simulator 1942.'\n\nSeriously, though. This game is great. Easily one of the best World War II shooters I've ever played. Shots kill you instantly (If you're lucky enough to survive a bullet, you usually just sit in sadness as you listen to your character scream or cry to death as they bleed out), the carnage feels authentic and the atmosphere is truly war-like. The developers really harped on realism, and I can say they nicely achieved it.\n\nThat's not to mention the soundtrack is proud and patriotic, while at the same time solemn and depressing.\n\nThe only problems I can think of is the game are its graphics-intensive nature, so you need a decent computer to run it, and the game is so structured around teamwork that an incompetent team can really rain on your gameplay experience (Or boost it, depending on the scenario).","April 4, 2015","true","23.5"," 223 of 230 people (97%) found this review helpful 154 people found this review funny","97","223","230","154","1"

Heinrich took some shrapnel in his arm, but he'll be alright. He got sent home. Progress is fast. We're pushing out the Bolsheviks at a large rate. We're at the gates of Stalingrad.\n\nDay 4 - We've pushed past the defenses. Casualties were high... Johann didn't make it. Neither did Albert. Johann got shot by one of their sharpshooters. None of us were able to get to him. He bled to death... Albert got killed by a grenade. At least his death was quicker and more merciful.\n\nDay 5 - Got a letter from my mother back home. Heinrich is recovering well, but will not be returning. The shrapnel severed ligaments in his arm. The men are glad to hear that he doesn't have to come back. This place is really going to hell very quickly...\n\nDay 13 12:00 - We were ordered to take a train station yesterday. Close quarters fight. Very nasty. Albrecht got his skull crushed by a Soviet using his rifle as a club. Saw another boy, no older than 19, gutted with one of their spike bayonets. He lied there on the floor crying for his mother as his intestines were spilling out.\n\n....what are we even doing here?\n\nDay 13 17:21 - Soviet counter-attack. Three more of the original squad died today in an artillery bombardment. Two died from more close quarters brawls. We repelled the attack... but at too high of a cost, in my opinion. I would suggest that we destroy the tracks at multiple points and abandon the area... it holds no real tactical value anyway. Operative word being "would." I'd rather not get shot by "Herr General" for "cowardice, defeatism, and insubordination."\n\nDay 21 - Replacements finally arrived. Is it just me, or are they accepting them younger?

It is a beautiful perspective that can put you first person inside of a tank when an explosion hits, and you look around to find your commander missing. You later discover that your commanding officer's leg is now sitting in your lap, and realize the task that you must now complete while down a man. You may be traveling through the trenches only to have your buddy get his head ripped apart by a sniper round, while the lower body of your team's sniper flies right past you. Sure there are some glitches and bugs, but this game is truly different from any other fps in that you feel as if you're actually in the action, losing your friends to snipers and grenades.\n\n\n"When your squad falls around you, it's up to you to hold that position until reinforcements arrive. It doesn't matter how many times you've been hit, what percentage of your friend's body is intact, or how many men are trying to kill you. It's when you see dwindling numbers on your team's resupply that you realize how many men have died for you, and so you better do them proud. But when the count reaches zero, it's time to make your final stand."\n-Lt. Woofel, Squad Leader One, Red Army\n\nStability 6/10\nGraphics 8/10\nGameplay 9/10\nImmersion 10/10\nRealism 10/10\nReinforcements remaining 0/800\n\nFor anyone who wants to read a story about a valient battle and sacrifice, keep going. I'm just going to rant on about how much fun I've had with this game.\n\nOur Russian army had decided to take the Bridges of Druzhnia (I think thats spelled right) against an overwhelmeng German force. The initial assault on A and B lasted nearly fourteen minutes and cost us nearly 150 reinforcements. Further attacks up past D and E cost us an additional hundred. Fueled by our losses, my Squad headed the assault on G, when the roar of The Buzzsaw was heard from the upstairs window. Rushing forward, we made it to the wall but at the cost of six good men. I sent my men on a dual flank before tossing a grenade through the upstairs window, watching as the LMG fell from the window followed by a grey-sleeved arm. Our Commander linked up with our group and commended us for our actions, before pushing us onward. The success of our assault with minimal casualties earned us a feared reputation and a simple, yet accurate nickname: Alpha Squad.\n\nAt this time, we quickly rushed our assault forward and knocked out the next positions with ease, until we came to the final bridge, section N. Fifteen minutes remained on the clock, and only a hundred of our reinforcements were still alive. We recieved an order from our commanding officer to halt, and recieved the most motivational speech of all time, as we prepared to fight against all odds. Once all of our teams were strategically placed, we recieved the final order to charge the position from three sides.\n\nThe following events took place over approximately ninety seconds:\n\nOur original plan failed catastrophically. Our initial force was obliterated within seconds by the enemy artillery and machine guns. Two unnamed members of Alpha Squad plus myself and our MG moved underneath the bridge to hit with a surprise attack so that our engineer could take out the tank traps. The enemy fire was too intense however, so our engineer only had time to deploy the charges before a Buzzsaw across the river cut him down. During this time, our sniper and commander were to be located on our side of the bridge, laying down cover fire, but they were no match for the German beast and were forced to get into cover. The other four members of my squad were not so lucky, as they had just seen the flash before it ripped them to pieces.\n\nWhile the suppressing group was pinned and taking heavy fire, the Germans brought their Antitank rifles out to take down our T34. However, my smoke grenade had impaired their ability to properly aim, and so fortunatley most of the shots missed the tank. However, the sniper was hit by one of these stray rounds - his body was only partially recovered. I felt tremendous guilt over the loss of a friend, but continued to push onward.\n\nOur CO got right up in the action, using the tank as moving cover while he laid down fire with his PPSH. When that was empty, he simply tossed it to the side and pulled out his revolver. After being hit and bandaged three times; a shot to the right arm, one in the leg and another in the stomach; he was on the verge of dying. In his love for the mother country, he pulled out a grenade and rushed forward, taking two more Germans with him.\n\nOur MG gunner used the distraction to set his position and took out seven Germans, including their Commanding Officer before a grenade landed just behind him. The explosion took off both of his legs and killed him outright, along with the other two soldiers that were coming up behind us. The blast also crippled my left arm, and in a fit of rage over my dying comrades, I didn't bother to bandage it. Being the final surviving member of the most elite fighters on the Eastern Front, I rushed forward with my PPSH, fully loaded with 71 rounds. It was my job to make sure that the tank made it to the final position, regardless of the cost. While firing at the exposed Germans, a sniper caught me in the chest with a single shot, which I immediatly knew would be fatal. The screen slowly faded to black, but my final breaths would not go silently. I died with my finger still squeezing the trigger, finishing off two more jackboots that tried to stop our desperate assault. Our sacrifice was minimal compared to the 800 Russians that were lost in the assault, but it had allowed enough time for our final remaining men to capture the position and win the game.\n\nIn memory of:\nYour Local Soviet - Commander of the Red Army - Grenade Sacrifice\nWoofel - Commander of Squad One "Alpha Squad" - Sniper round to the chest\njpstorf - Alpha Squad MG - Enemy Grenade\nthewayneman - Alpha Squad Engineer - "The Buzzsaw"\nFatheadPanda126 - Alpha Squad Sniper - Stray AT round\nSix Unnamed Soldiers of Alpha Squad - Enemy Grenade, "The Buzzsaw"\n800 Brave Red Army Soldiers\n\n(Obviously this is a dramatization, but this is basically how I felt during the entire game)\n\nMore dramatic quotes about Alpha Squad:\n\n"Although the Red Army was pushed back to the top floor of the grain elevator with only twenty men remaining against the two hundred Germans, we would fight to the death to hold our positions.

This XXX-guy got 145 kills on the same map  ? - Cheater !!!!!\nSome 50 hours later i improved my KD Ratio from 1:24 to 1:11, i got 45 kills on the map, I started to know some useful spots, but unfortunately i was not the only one to know them and this XXX-guy cheater still keeps on killing me.\nI got  45 kills, i am the Greatest, but ♥♥♥♥,  he is still on his 145 kills, i will have to improve myself.\n200 hours played, maybe the XXX-guy was not cheating as i just got 147 kills on the map and killed him 8 times this round, haha campernoob :-D\nI add him to my friendslist and he accepts, now we can do more damage together because teamplay is the key in this game.\nThis game is not about the kills, is about the ability to play as a team, to move to the capzone, to work together to defeat the enemy and kills are just a way to get to the objective of defeating the enemy.\nSure it's a hardcore game where you have to use cover and not just rush with your 69,99 special edition super gold extra armor and kill everyone with your 59,99 special thermal 10x optics supershotgun rocketlauncher.\nIf you are looking for such a game, don't buy this one.\nBut if you like challenges (like dying permanently the first 20 hours without ragequiting the game), if you like realistic firefights (1shoot kill, slow reload times, heavy MG fire, suppression, tactics) this game is for you.\nThe community is (except a few) great and very helpfully and most of people who have passed the 100 hours limit stay on this game for thousands of hours.\nAnd Triwire is still updating the game with new maps or adding new weapons or vehicles (still tank fight is very limited in ths game, 95% infantry)","January 27, 2015","true","676.7"," 179 of 187 people (96%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","96","179","187","45","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/irateearwig/recommended/35450/","irateearwig","Irate Earwig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/irateearwig/","162 products in account","Red Orchestra 2 is a brilliant multiplayer team-based fps that made me remember why I love the genre. Based on the Battle of Stalingrad at the Eastern Front of WW2, the game is remarkable in it's attention to detail and authenticity.\n\nThe weapon handling/mechanics feel great, as do the ballistics. This coupled with the realistic level of damage players receive, makes for a highly rewarding combat system. The feeling of successfully rooting out a Sniper or MG with one well-placed shot, and freeing up your team's advance is incredible.\n\nThis is a game in which teamwork is paramount, the attacking team must capture and sometimes destroy objectives to advance to victory. This is facilitated (in theory) by the Commander and Squad Leaders, who each have an extremely important role to play.\n\nThe Commander has access to radios located in various spots around the map. From these, he can call recon planes to check enemy movement, force respawns and call artillery strikes which can turn the momentum of a game completely.\n\nA good Commander is a necessity, as he will stategize on the fly, give the Squad Leaders and their teams objectives to complete and decimate enemy reinforcements with artillery.\n\nThe Squad Leaders need to know their stuff, as they posses the means to mark artillery targets in the form of binoculars and also serve as a mobile spawn point. Above all else the Squad Leaders job is to mark artillery targets for the Commander when asked, and to stay alive close to the objective. This allows for a constant stream of attackers to keep the pressure on the enemy, before he becomes entrenched.\n\nThere are 12 different squad roles in RO2, depending on the map being played and whether there is a tank present. The most common roles are Rifleman, Elite Rifleman, Assault, Elite Assault, Marksman, Machine Gunner, Squad Leader and Commander.\n\nOn maps with a tank there will also be roles related to tank operation and destruction. Each of these classes have a specific role to play, most of which is pretty self-explanatory. When a team is working together cohesively with a competent Commander and good Squad Leaders, it is one of the most intense and enjoyable games I have ever played.\n\nRO2 is a game that takes a lot of time and effort to learn, and to a new player it can seem very overwhelming and difficult. If you are new to RO2, my best advice would be to role-play as a soldier in WW2. If you were in that situation, would you run across a street covered by an MG or into an artillery strike? If you treat your life as valuable, use cover, check your approach and move as a team you are much more likely to succeed.\n\nThis game definitely had a terrible launch, and suffers from some clunky mechanics and strange glitches (being stuck in between crouch and prone is a personal fav). While some of these issues will be enough to turn some people off, those that persevere will find a unique, rewarding and immensely satisfying game. With the constant stream of awesome community-made maps and the addition of Rising Storm, I couldn't recommend it more highly.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/C9mpGlZVMlE","January 7, 2014","true","215.8"," 182 of 207 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","182","207","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gulielmustheternal/recommended/35450/","gulielmustheternal","GulielmusTheEternal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gulielmustheternal/","71 products in account","This game, is an absolutely amazing game. It is set in and around Stalingrad, where the Germans and the Russians face off for victory. It is also set in and around the South-East Asian-Pacific region, where the Japanese and the Americans face off for victory. It is brutally realistic and gritty. A bullet from most weapons to the torso will kill you most of the time, same to the kneck or head. To the arms or legs most of the time it will wound you. Even if you are not killed after being wounded, if the wound is anywhere other than your limbs, you must patch yourself fast or you will bleed out, just like in reality. If it is in your limbs you may or may not bleed out, sometimes you have to judge if its better to run to cover and then heal, or heal on the spot and hope you don't get shot again. Or maybe you don't need to heal at all and you can save your bandages for worse wounds. The weapons have realistic recoil, and clear advantages and disadvantages for all situations. The Germans favor medium to long range fighting, the Russians medium to short range. The Germans and Russians are both perfectly capable of attacking and defending, but the Germans have an edge when it comes to attacking due to having longer ranged weapons, the only assault rifle in the world at the time, and machine guns with very high rates of fire that are very good for pinning the enemy down. The Russians have an edge on defense due to being good at letting the enemy come to them and grinding them down in close quarters fighting, along with the superior PPSH 41 sub machine gun, and superior mosin nagant bolt action rifle with its amazing accuracy that can blow the enemy away at close range even with sloppy aiming. Basically, some weapons for one side are superior to the other's equivalent. The audio in this game is stunning and extremely intense, much better than other shooters. This game is also extremely reliant on team work, no one-man armies allowed. If one team is communicating and working together, and the other is not, then the team that is working together will crush the other one. If both are doing what they are supposed to be doing then you get incredibly intense matches.\n\nThe Rising Storm side of the game is pretty different from the Stalingrad part, for example Asymmetric warfare plays a huge role. The Japanese cannot face off against the Americans head on in open areas, the Americans just have too much fire power. The Japanese need to utilize the environment to keep mobility over the enemy and to take cover, jungle fighting is where they excell. All of the American riflemen have semi-automatic rifles, something neither the Japanese, nor the Germans or Russians get to have for their riflemen, and riflemen make up the bulk of the team. All of the other American classes have gear with superior raw damage and rates of fire to that of the Japanese, but what the Japanese excell at is their ferocity, combined with ingenious things such as creating frag grenade booby traps, knowing when to keep their distance so as to pick the enemy off from long range with their more accurate and longer range bolt action rifles, their knee mortars, and banzai charging in a small area in a big spearhead with smoke grenades and mortar/artillery/naval barrage support. The Japanese are definitely more geared towards attacking so as to hit the Americans on their terms and to overwhelm them in massed attacks, whereas the Americans, due to their superior raw fire power, are best on defense because they can dig in and if the Japanese run around in open areas they can mow them down like German machine guns on D-Day (Saving private Ryan style)\n\nAnd speaking of D-Day, there is currently a 1944-1945 US vs German mod in development with testing events every few days, which will be like a fan made expansion which will bring the game up to 3 different theaters.\n\nAnd on top of that a World War I mod is in the early stages of development with both western and eastern front gameplay.\n\nThere are no hackers whatso ever, there are some modded maps that are optional to play on, and the vast majority of the player base are cool people, who don't mess around, are not casual, and who play to win, all of which creates an extremely intense gaming experiance.\n\nThis game is one of the best games I have ever played, and I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone.\nIt's way better than what Call of Duty and Battlefield have turned into.","March 21, 2015","true","700.9"," 96 of 103 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","96","103","6","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWalkingClock/recommended/35450/","AWalkingClock","A Walking Clock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AWalkingClock/","319 products in account","Prologue: NO I IN TEAM.\n\nSome of the best moments I've ever had playing video games came during the era of Battlefield 2 + 2142. For me, the introduction of Commanders and Squad Leaders - with points granted for following orders - was something entirely unique. Working in tandem with a bunch of strangers, usually without the use of a mic, with the single goal of victory in mind, generated a greater sense of accomplishment through victory than the pursuit of a positive kill / death ratio. Unfortunately, the playing community on these games has dwindled, while the likes of Call of Duty, with its multi-platinum sales, has dictated the way in which EA has demanded DICE produce further editions of the series. Truly there was a gap in the market, with the only alternative fps that would cater for me being Counter Strike; which in itself was an entirly different animal. There may have been alternatives I didn't know about, namely the first Red Orchesta, but this was a game that never came onto my radar.\n\nFast forward a few years as the numbers dwindled on the 2142 servers, forcing me to find an alternative. After some minor research, I syumbled upon Red Orchestra 2, and what can I say, it ticked every box including ones I didn't realise existed or even needed ticking. If Battlefield 2 / 2142 encouraged team-play, RO2 demanded it; always will a well disciplined team, of average players, armed with an intelligent Commander reign victorious over a team of brilliant individualists. Of course, the game does give perks for team work, such as extra points for assist kills and defending cap zones etc. but lacking these bonuses, team-work would still be the back-bone of this game as the player-base knowingly understand it is the only way defeat can be avoided, even if it doesn't necessarily guarantee success, as the opposition will more than likely fight fire with fire.\n\nGeneral Pros and Cons:\n\nPROS:\n#More mature player-base - having kids flame out on VoIP is an extreme rarity.\n\n#Campaign mode - a more involved an enlongated way to sew map victories together, as each team vies to hold each territory by succesfully attacking and defending on the campaign map.\n\n#Map Design - Sure the player limit is capped at 64 & the maps are usually quite large - Bridges of Druzinha springs to mind - but the fact only one or two objectives are ever in play means the action is condensed into one section of the map. While player respawns act as single waves coming from a relatively sizable distance away. The pace of a packed server is quite remarkable, with each contol point always within 1 good attack from falling.\n\n#Vehicles - Despite a couple of 'tank only' maps (which are avoided like the plague by the community) the maps only ever have one tank per side; one tank for the attacking team - to add some balance - or none at all. This keeps the infantry as the most relevant forces on the map, which should be the case in a FPS; while keeping a wild card in the pot at all times if not dealt with appropriatly.\n\n#Team Balance - Both the Germans and the Russians have their strong and weak points. The Assault class is probably the most varried between the two armies, so I will talk about the differences a little. The PPS SMG for the Russians is unparalleled in close quarters and can take out entire squads with a rapid firing of bullets; however, when engaging anything over 50 meters it quickly becomes far less useful than the German Mp40. While, the Germans have access to the mk42b (arguably the games best all-rounder) for experienced Elite Assault troops. Like I said with pretty much every other class, the difference in guns in negligable. This minor differences means that certain maps are delibaretly avoided or chosen in Campaign mode, as it may bring out the best in a particular weapon - namely the over-powering of the PPS in the level Appartments.\nFurthermore, each team can only have certain amounts of each player type, meaning that more than half of the battleground consists of regular rifleman armed with a bolt action non-scoped rifle - amplifyig the importance of knowing how to play your class.\n\n#Fair leveling system - Most the upgrades awarded for leveling up provide major upgrades for extremely situational circumstances; bigger magazines for an smg or a bayonette for a rifle. This means that a lvl1 private entering the game for the first time doesn't have to be out-gunned while he builds up a feel and understanding of the game, while it also provides an incentive for experienced players to level all the available classes.\nThe only exception really comes with the sniper classes, who can swap out their bolt-action rifles for semi-auto rifles afer leveling up enough - although if it takes you multiple shots as a sniper, you're doing it wrong - or indeed the German Elite Assault class, who can unlock the games only Assault Rifle the MK42b - but on the flip side the Russians will have unlocked the drum magazine for their pps at this stage, which can inflict unimaginable carnage in certain circumstances.\n\n#Steam Workshop - Addons provided by the community for free, what's not to like?\n\nCONS:\n#Realistic damage - a positive in my eyes, but I know people have complained about the inability to fire back at an aggressor. Nine times out of ten, spotting the enemy before they spot you means they will be the one filled with bullets. A good knowledge of the map layout aswell as ensuring the team has secured the flanks is of paramount importance.\n\n#No weapon points for leaving a round - Annoyingly, if you leave a game prior to the end of a round, any of the points that you would have gathered for leveling up your weapons will be lost. Not too big of an issue you would think, but maps like Bridges of Druzihna have a one hour time limit, so you could lose 45 mins of good progress because real-life kicks in.\n\n#Steep learning curve - Unlike some games which have beginner only servers, RO2 will not hold your hand at all, meaning that learning the intricacies of the game can be a grind which leaves your character in the grave more times than you would have liked.\nThe fact each team only has a set number of 'premium' classes also means that if it is clear you do not know how to play one of these roles, you'll be a considerable liability for your team. The only way of getting comfortable with a role is either through the games atrocious single-player campaign, or by spending time on a server populated solely by bots (there are many), just so your learning experience doesn't hinder the fun of others.\n\n#Auto balance - Some matches can be incredibly one sided, due to team-work over VoIP or better use of Commander or Squad Leaders, and while the game does have an auto-balance feature it rarely pans out that it gets the switches correct.\n\nIt is a delight to see that Tripwire Interactive didn't cave into the pressure that was created by the rise of the modern console twitch-based shooter, ala Call of Duty. This game is a gem, that may not appeal to everyody, but certainly fills a gaping hole in the market that was brought on by a barrage of sub-par fps games. Indeed since its release there have been a few more gems that cater to a similar audience, none more so than the RO2 add-on Rising Storm, which is based on the Pacific Theater of WW2. It keeps much of the same gameplay mechanics, while injecting it with a completely different pace through level-design and weapon variation; meaning it offers enough of a change to make it worth the investment while keeping enough of the original so you know you'll like it if you liked RO2. Also, check out Insurgency for similar mechanics on a smaller scale.\n\nThis is by someway a marked improvement from the games which I had craved, as the team-work aspect is necessary for success; you are more likely to find team driven players on any random server here than during the golden-years of Battlefield.","October 14, 2014","true","335.8"," 75 of 79 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","75","79","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG3/recommended/35450/","NG3","Rotten Ribbs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NG3/","87 products in account","The following review is for Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm. (both included when buying Rising Storm)\n\nRed Orchestra 2 and its stand-alone expansion Rising Storm are World War II military First-person shooters with an emphasis on solid gameplay mechanics and gritty authenticity. While the two differ in gameplay, both are grounded in realism without being marred by unnecessary clunkiness. Both were developed by Tripwire Interactive, the studio that is probably best known for Killing Floor and the original Red Orchestra game. Much like Killing Floor, these games shine most in the way that they feature what are quite possibly the best shooting mechanics that you will find in any video game.\n\nThese games are by no means "dead" as some doom-and-gloom internet posters would have you beleive. Despite featuring a complex set of controls and being fairly unforgiving about deaths in multiplayer, the games do a great job of expressing that the multiplayer expirience is hard but fair. Perceptivness, tactical forsight, and team communication are always heavily rewarding for players willing to go the extra mile.\n\nMuch of the early criticism for Red Orchestra 2 by popular review sources and Metacritic mainly focus on the game's rough state at launch rather than the game you will be playing today. RO2 and RS have been greatly improved with the help of official patches and updates and even moreso with the help of the player community that is the backbone of the series.\n\nRising Storm offers a new and different expirience to that of Red Orchestra 2. While still featuring the original game's brutality and satisfying gun mechanics, rising storm features more asymetrical gameplay that is more rooted in fast-paced action than the base game. This stand-alone expansion is great for both veterans looking for something fun and different as well as new players that felt intimidated by the heavily punishing nature of RO2's multiplayer. Upon purchasing Rising Storm players will recieve a copy of Red Orchestra 2 if they do not already own it. Red Orchestra 2 owners will be able to play a limited version of Rising Storm and will also recieve a discount when buying the expansion.\n\nThese games are great for anyone looking for a First-Person shooter with solid gameplay mechanics. Red Orchestra 2 and Rising storm offer a great experience that rivals and even surpasses those offered by AAA FPS titles.*\n\n\n*The games are to be appreciated on their own merits rather than to be used to boost one's own ego for not being part of the Call of Duty or Battlefield audience.","December 21, 2013","true","606.3"," 56 of 67 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","56","67","0","2"

There is also a standalone game called Rising Storm that features the American attacks against the Japanese after Pearl Harbor. The game doesn't have a real storyline, but the setting feels very grounded in history and there are plenty of real life locations, as well as actual guns and vehicles from the era.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game uses Unreal Engine 3. There are your usual texture pop-ins and small performance hiccups, even though there aren't as many as usual. The game olds up fairly well and the decaying cities of Russia are well varied and full of little details that suck you into the experience.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe game features a variety of modes, including Territory (where you conquer different places on a map), Firefight (team deathmatch), and a Multiplayer Campaign (which is basically Territory played on multiple levels and stages). The levels are all very well balanced, and both sides feel equally as powerful. The game lacks a crosshair and an ammo count: while it is pretty weird at first, you slowly start seeing that it's the best way to get sucked into the game.\nThere are multiple classes to choose from, each one with its set of items and weapons to use on the battlefield, but in the end the game rewards the most skilled players, and there isn't a weapon more powerful than another: they are all balanced to suite each player to their favourite play style without making them too overpowered. The Squad Leaders work as spawn points, while the Commander has the ability to force respawn and to select sections of the territory to launch an artillery attack or bombardments.\nI have never felt more paranoid in a game than when playing RO2: whenever you are getting shot at, you lose focus, your vision gets blurry, and you start losing the ability to hear. When crawling through the battlefield with a bunch of comrades, seeing one of the suddenly become a ragdoll fills you with fear of knowing that a sniper is probably loading the next bullet to send to your brain. This are just some of the amazing experiences I've had in this game that in my opinion shows how brutal and unheroic war is: people die, people scream, and in the end each side loses a ton of good soldiers.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game features bullet drops and realistic damage: shooting at someone's leg will make him limp, shooting at his lungs will make him grasp for air for a couple of seconds without collapsing... When I started replaying the game for this review, I remembered how unforgiving it is for new players. But if you give it enough time, you will get better at handling weapons and calculating the difference bullet drops as well as the best tactics to win on both sides. It becomes a very rewarding game.\n\nSOUNDThe sound is phenomenal, with realistic weapon effects, cheesy but fun voice acting and powerful explosions. The soundtrack is also very underrated, and it homages classic themes from movies like Saving Private Ryan.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThe game is constantly being updated by the developers, and the community is pretty great too: many maps and modes can be downloaded from the Workshop to change the game's formula up. There are also over 140 Steam achievements that will keep you hooked for a long time.\n\nOverall, Red Orchestra 2 is one of my favourite multiplayer games of all time, as well as a great war game that requires a bit of tactics and good skills. Everyone who enjoys online games and first person shooters as well as more skills than luck will have a blast playing this hard at first but hugely satisfying game.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 9.5\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 9.5\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 9\nFRUSTRATION: 7.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","November 6, 2015","true","45.9"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","40","46","2","0"

I downloaded the essentials and got into it.\nI did the tutorial and went into my first match. Wanting to become the ultimate camper, I went Russian Marksman, armed with nothing but a PU Mosin-Nagant and a revolver that can't do anything after 5 m.\n\nAlong with my comrades, I softened up the German defences, and my comrades and I pulled off a daring charge and took the bridge. We got to the other side, but were pinned down by an MG nest set up on a lumber pile and were forced to take cover with what we could find. I quickly ran into the forest, attempting to flank our main obstacle. The bristling fire of the MG-34 stood out from the sounds of the other weapons incessantly being discharged at both sides. Non-stop, this cutting sound of the MG-34 and the dying screams of my comrades made me even more determined to kill this machinegunner. I managed to get into point blank range. I wanted to humiliate him and go down in history as that guy who melee'd that dude who killed 20 people. He saw me.\n\nHe turned to me, ready to empty what ammo he had left in my tan-coloured clothes and Soviet body. He was about to fire... and a click was heard. He didn't have any more ammo. He didn't even attempt to take out his pistol. He looked at me, and I shot him. I distinctly remember his body jittering. A pool of blood assembled around him, and the jittering stopped. Then I bolted my weapon, and carried on.\n\nWelcome to Red Orchestra 2: PTSD Edition.\n\nThe game itself, a multiplayer-based WW2 tactical shooter is based around the Eastern Front of WW2, particularly the Battle of Stalingrad. Picking up the game, you will be thrown into  the most realistic depiction of war since the original Medal of Honor. You want a gun? Here you go. Now go and take that objective, soldier! The game throws you into the mud without any other expectations other than victory and woe to the vanquished. You are to fight! You are to kill! You are to die! You are to wait 20 seconds just to be mindlessly thrown into this slow-paced, massive battle of up to 64 players and you will enjoy it! A learning curve is prevalent in the game, as it isn't a run of the mill FPS. A couple hours in the singleplayer, or on a bot practice match should be enough to get you used to the odd way the game handles.\n\nThe graphics are very pretty and rather easy to run, which is sad when you think of it because the folks over at Tripwire wanted you to have as traumatizing experience as humanly possible.\n\n10/10 would have PTSD again","February 28, 2015","true","95.5"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","90","27","30","10","0"

Have you always wondered what it felt like to have your skin melt off your bones as a stream of fire roasts your body? Do you wish to feel the satisfaction of hitting a running target - 300 meters away - right in the head? Have you always wanted to hold a katana in your hands and charge with your team at an unsuspecting American battalion?\nWell look no further, because this game answers your call!\n\nRising storm is a very realistic multiplayer fps, with battles up to 64 people. The game is set in World war II, in the Pacific theatre, involving the United states and the Japanese. Battles are extremely intense, and teamwork and tactics play as a key contributor in winning battles. Most battles in rising storm involve the opposing team starting off at one end of the map and capturing or destorying key points, trying to advance forward, while you hold them back and defend them or vice versa. Teams are normally fixed in these scenarios (meaning one team is always going to be the attacker and the other defender).  The balancing in this game is very different from those in other games. Asymmetrical is the term. The Japanese, while having inferior weapons, have much more higher supression resistance and higher morale Aka balls made of titanum or some ♥♥♥♥, compared to the Americans, who have frequent panic attacks. Sly little booby traps can be layed by the Japanese, also and you can get all of your mates to do a banzai charge (good times). However what the Americans DO have is the bigger guns, more load, heavy firepower and Macca's meaning they can use their superior technology to their advantage.\n\nMoving onto maps - Their designed almost perfectly. The maps are large and spacious without having loads of empty space and everything is placed in the right spot without being obvious. Every map is played differently too, for example 'Hanto' which is a dense jungle type area makes it very difficult for the Americans to spot the heavily camouflaged Japanese. Another map called Iwo Jima has an uphill slant with many concealed bunkers to defend from, which can ridden with booby traps. All in all the maps in this game is what balances the teams out the most.\n\nRising storm has some really decent graphics. The gun models are astounding and realistic, and textures for character models are very good, too. Environments look gritty and worn out without being too dark and unrealistic. Overall its actually very, very decent. Audio in this game is great as well. It really does add suspense and fully immerses. No silly background sound effects, everything is being produced real time. The music is suprisingly very well done, and doesnt get in the way or break the immersion of a battle.\n\nThe game may be very, very difficult to get used to for most people. Controls, character movement and coordination may feel clunky for some people as the weapon is not fixed to the center of the screen and the character gains speed instead of instantly moving. Many beginners will also find it difficult to tell the difference between their own fellow team members and the enemy and will shoot without confirming. It takes a while to get to know how each map works out and what the objectives are. In the end though, once you do get used to it you'll be satisfied.\n\nLastly, communication is key in this game. Although a team may be able to capture a point or even win the round without communicating, it will most likely be very difficult as people will be scattered, unsure of when to attack and generally go off and do their own thing. So whoop out your mic and help out the team or if not, atleast take the time to learn which button you press to chat. If you're looking for a more casual experience, use a general role instead of a special class.\n\n\nYou get 2 games for the  price of 19 bucks (USD), which is Rising storm and Red orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad bundled together. I probably shouldnt tell you about the download size.

I couldn't distinguish friends from enemies, I just can't aim fire and run at the same time. Run into an enemy face to face  when you turn a corner? Good luck getting that shot in while your mind just blanks out.\n\nMy first ever thought when playing the game was "Why is everyone running?".  Where are they going? It was just utter confusion.\n\nBut after a few hours, I was hooked. I've learned to flank the enemy. Fire a rifle when it counts. And minimize shooting at my own team mates.  But all that pales in comparison to the experience. You get to feel the confusion a battle brings, the paranoia, and the panic when you find out your commander just ordered an artillery attack on the very place you are standing on and running back to safer ground while your teammates mistake you for an attacking enemy.\n\nIt's just spastic. One time, I accidentally shot a teammate while he was about to throw a grenade. Needless to say, everyone in the room died.\n\nYes, I am that kind of a noob.\n\nThat said, the community is  great. I mean, better than others if I may say. I would like to describe it, for a lack of a better word, more mature. I guess because the game demands a lot more patience and understanding than a standard run and gun.\n\nIt's not for everybody. CS players would find this a bit taxing. And you do have to invest a bit of time to understand the mechanics. But for overall gameplay and enjoyment, for me at least,  this one is on the top of my list.\n\nAnd yeah, my teammates forgave me for that grenade drop.","May 4, 2014","true","71.2"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","22","25","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/imzoma/recommended/35450/","imzoma","Zoma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/imzoma/","110 products in account","Red Orchestra 2 is the best murder simulator I've ever played. It's not the best first-person shooter or multiplayer game, or even the best team-based multiplayer game. It's certainly not the best World War II game, and its singleplayer is the worst I've played in years. But in the killing, and in the being killed, RO2 is a terrifying and satisfying experience.\n\nYou're a soldier in either Germany's or USSR's army. You've got your back against the wall in a room with one door, two windows and three walls, and you're peeking around a corner into the exposed core of a half-destroyed building. Every room could conceal an enemy soldier, and you've died a hundred times already, always from that one angle you didn't check.\n\nLooking down through the rubble, you see an enemy soldier break from behind a wall. You aim and fire in a single motion. You've shot him and now he's dead. It's exactly like a million other games, but it feels nothing like any other game. It's the little things that make the difference, such as the sound of your own breathing when you lifted the rifle to your face, and the way it bobbed slightly in your hands. It's in the mark on your enemy's chest where the bullet hit, and the way his blood spritzed from his back, marking that bullet's exit. It's in the way he fell, forced by some terrible weight. Sometimes, but not this time, it would be the way he clutches his stomach, yelling in Russian, or the way he fires his machinegun madly during his last few seconds of life.\n\nAt some point, the developers of Red Orchestra 2 realised that if the primary interaction in your game is killing, then you should probably make the killing feel incredible. It's this attention to detail that turns an otherwise ordinary game, a slightly more realistic Battlefield, into something great, with Soviets fighting Nazis across mother Russia.\n\nWhile the weapons feel remarkable, the classes that carry them are familiar. There's the Assault class, with a sub-machinegun; the Marksman, with a sniper rifle; the Rifleman and Elite Rifleman; and a few others. The few inventive classes, such as Squad Leaders and Commanders, do little to change the flow of battle. Both roles have valuable abilities, but several people follows orders on public servers. My favorite is the Squad Leader.\n\nEven tanks don't add much to the experience. They require a whole different set of skills to use well, and have lovingly detailed interiors, but they are an easily ignored nuisance on the few maps that actually include them. On any server I've ever joined, the one tank-only map is the moment in the war when everyone disappears to write letters home to their mothers.\n\nIt's creeping through the ruined buildings of Pavlov's House, one of the best maps, and jumping every time you see a piece of paper float through the air. It's listening to the footsteps echoing through the building, and freezing as you hear creaking on the stairs. It's the time I rounded a corner to come face to face with a Nazi holding a grenade above his head, bayoneted him in the stomach, and then dived down some stairs to escape the blast. It's the thrill of sprinting across an open field, enemy machinegun fire whizzing all around you.\n\nDeath in RO2 is so sudden and violent that you're constantly on edge, an experience that's exacerbated by all the little pieces of information the game is keeping from you.\n\nFirstly, at a distance there's no easy, instant way to tell if a soldier is on your side. The uniforms are distinct, but not the fluorescent green cycling jackets you need on a smoky battlefield. If you're close to someone, looking at them, and they're on your side, their name will appear, but often you don't have that kind of time.\n\nSecondly, there's no instant kill confirmation. You'll be fighting across the ruined tenements on the wonderful Pavlov's House map, and you'll spot a head in a window across the street. From the shape of the helmet, you'll infer that it's an enemy and fire. The head will disappear from view. Are they dead? Did you miss? Are they wounded and bandaging themselves? Is it safe to move on? You can only hope. Wherever it can, RO2 makes murky what other games want to be clear. There's no ammo display on the HUD; you have to check the barrel for a rough estimate, or count your own shots. Realism mode, which is activated on roughly half of the servers currently running, removes certainty altogether by taking out friendly names, kill confirmations and the radar. It doesn't make a huge difference, but I had more fun in non-realism mode.\n\nLastly, the heart-munching adrenaline you feel in front of your PC is mirrored in the soldier you're controlling. When you're stood at a window and bullets start to chip against the frame, all the colour drains from the screen, the world blurs, and your aim becomes worse than a drunk man. You need to get out of there to catch your breath.","March 10, 2015","true","30.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","1"

Soon a wall of flame engulfed the lone assualt troop at the top of the rubble, who was the only other man defending the entrance.

They were all helplessely burned to a crisp before his eyes just as he had finished reloading.

Red Orchestra 2 is a fickle monster. On the one hand, the innovative gameplay and close attention to realism and detail give this release tons of potential. Unfortunately, the amount old-fashioned quirks coupled with the most clueless AI I've seen in a while takes away a lot from what this game has to offer.If you strip the game's uninspired visuals and interface and manage to come past its bugs and glitches, Red Orchestra 2 takes no prisoners with its realistic mechanics and physics. It is a game for a hardcore PC audience who thrive on this type of games with its relatively slow-paced tempo yet high intensity.An immensely ambitious game, and in some ways, it's even a groundbreaking one. However, its focus on realism will turn off fans of arcade shooters. If you think both Battlefield and Call of Duty are too exaggerated and unrealistic, and feel Counter-Strike is too soft, Red Orchestra 2 might be the game for you. It doesn't appeal to me, though.","April 24, 2014","true","2.7"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","31","46","0","2"

Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad (Rising Storm too btw) captures this very same feeling to the perfection. Forget about running on the field and firing two machine guns akimbo like Rambo. You're a soldier, russian or german, american or japanese. The fight will always seem unfair and it is: get over it. Then how can you win and enjoy you may ask? Keep your head down, take cover, watch out for your teammates, follow your commander's orders, go for the objectives: be a soldier. The slightest misstep can kill you and your teammates. And if you win the battle, always remember that you would never have made it without your team, your squad leader and your commander.\n\nFootmen win wars, but don't get credit:\n\nMore often then you'd want, you will have the role of a lousy footman, a bolt action rifle and 2 grenades.

(✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FigureofOptimism/","336 products in account","Today I will be reviewing a video game called Red Orchestra 2. The game was developed by Treyarch (The same people responsible for such classics as : The Great Gatsby, A Clockwork Orange and Super Mario Brothers) and published by Ubisoft.\n\nLet's talk a bit about the game :\nThe game takes place in a post apocalyptic Paris in the year 2250. When the game begins, you can see society rebuilding itself all around you. Society has been split into 2 sides : The neo-nazis and the capitalists. The neo-nazis are a group led by Adolf Hitler's brain which was recovered by the Illuminati from the very same bunker where Hitler commited suicide. The second group is led by Rndrew Ayan. He is a curious Lovecraft inspired repairman, whose seeking to bring Paris back to it's former glory through any means necessary. The game offers you two ways to play, join the nazis in their quest to take over Paris for the Führer or join the capitalists to restore things to the way they were. The story is amazing. One minute I found myself laughing at the obscure situations that the capitalist soldiers found themselves in, the next I was crying when they lost the Eiffel tower because Sgt. Johnson (Who is a key character in the Capitalist campaign) wanted to send a telegram to his wife back in Austria who was missing him dearly.\n\nLet's talk about the game's mechanics next :\nThe game is presented in a 2D Bird's Eye perspective, at first I thought this was odd, however it becomes apparent that this was the directors vision and the game is perfect as is. One of they key mechanics of the game is the point'n'click-esque interface, featuring options such as : "Insult", "Batter", "Shoot" and "Heil". Characters in the game react to your every move, from simply moving around to doing key story changing events such as demolishing the Eiffel tower ( which is entirely optional ). The game blends the 2D, Run and gun, Romance, Adventure and Puzzle game elements within it seamlessly to create a unique experience the likes of which will probably never be bested.\n\nMove over Call of Duty Ghosts, Medal of Honor Warfighter and Battlefield 4. There's a new king in town and his name is Red Orchestra 2.\n\n10/10","December 2, 2013","true","9.8"," 45 of 72 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","45","72","2","9"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/recommended/35450/","preludebot","PreludeBot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/preludebot/","197 products in account","I've never played a tactical team play game that grants the flexibility, the complexity, and the amount of realism that Red Orchestra 2 brings. I can't think of any parallel that comes close. That alone should say a lot if you're looking to buy the game. In short, it's worth every dollar even at regular price, but for any game, I still say wait for the sale. This game hits sale price a lot.\n\nNow, I'm not saying this game is perfect. It has a few negatives which I'll cover but take the negatives with a grain of salt. The positives within this game far outweigh the negatives.\n\nI'll start with the negatives, the integrated "Cover system" is broken in some ways. It doesn't entirely keep you in cover. I find, players who use the Cover system easier to kill behind cover. This is because, the animation your character goes into when using integrated covering leaves your character's head and back exposed to fire at modest angles. And by modest, I mean an enemy won't have to move much to kill you in the integrated cover system. I turned my auto-cover button off by unbinding the key associated with it under Game Options. If I want to use cover, I do it myself without the integrated system.\n\nThat's honestly the only negative I give this game. The rest is good news in terms of how much I enjoyed this game for challenge and reward. You'll find after several hours or several dozen hours that this game has very extensive experience system. Guns gather experience, classes gather experience, and your character level gathers experience. The experience system is not just a number, higher levels grants suppression resistances, stamina buffs, and accuracy buffs. These buffs become quite helpful at higher levels. Guns that gather experience will gain tiers, each gun has a maximum level of 50 and there are 3 tiers associated with it. Each gun gets tier 1 by default, tier 2 is unlocked at level 25 and tier 3 is unlocked at level 50. Depending on what gun you have, tier 2 and tier 3 will have unlocked attachments for the gun like long-range sights and bayonets or extended magazines. This system is very grindy however, since there are so many guns to level. If you're a completionist like me, getting every gun to level 50 will take a very long time.\n\nThere are a wide variety of historical guns for all four nations. Each gun has better uses than others, it's up to the user to decide which gun you like most. Majority of players will say PPSH-41 is the weapon of choice, while others will counter that the MG42 and Mkb 42 are better. It's a constant daily argument. I personally like all the guns, even the bolt action rifles. In a full 64-player game, I was able to get MVP using only a rifleman class with a bolt action rifle. It depends on how well you want to perform.\n\nThere are vehicles, there are medium tanks, light tanks and troop transports. Medium tanks and light tanks get their own classes and are effective but not over-powered. An experienced tank driver can cause a lot of headache, but in contrast, an experienced anti-tank gunner can take out a tank with a single well placed shot at the tank's ammo rack.\n\nBeing Commander is a lot of fun but also actually requires a lot of hands-on command skills. Commander's job is basically to sit at the radio and call in artillery or recon. Commander can also force-respawn players waiting to respawn. Giving orders is important, not only are you telling your team where to go. Players within the area of your order get +1 points for each kill and capturing objectives as a result of your order. Additionally, AI actually follow Commander orders. Sending 30 or so AI into a single base is quite funny.\n\nThe AI is not the smartest nor the worst... It's difficult to describe the AI, they're amazing and terrible at the same time. Sometimes you can stand in front of an AI and it won't shoot you or it will miss you a dozen times. And on the other hand, AI are known to do 180 no-scope headshots. It's up to you to decide on this one.\n\nIt's almost nearly impossible to notice for new players so I will point it out now. There is bullet drop. But bullet drop is not noticeable until you are about 200m away from your target. But that is rare, majority of the time you will be shooting within 170m on average and a lot of close quarters right down to melee combat. In all my hours of playing this game, I have only had to change my sight range to 200m for only one kill.\n\nPros:Wide variety of maps and gamemodes. (Best gamemode imo is Campaign)\nLarge selection of weapons.\nExtensive experience system that rewards at new levels.\nA lot of active communities and it's easy to find a full 64-man server. (I find full servers daily as of this review.)\nRealistic combat. (Realism-mode adds to this and it's the only mode I play. It's kind of this game's 'hardcore mode.')\nTanks and transports are not OP.\nUser-friendly command system.\nArtillery adds zest to an already pleasant experience.\nWorkshop is available for custom maps and mods.\nSingle-player AI battles in Workshop. (I still prefer playing against players.)Cons:Can be unforgiving for new players. You will die a lot.\nBroken "Cover System."\nTanks are easy to get stuck.Neutral:Mkb 42 and MG42 gunshot sound effects are too loud.

This review might not be perfect or complete. But these are my thoughts about the game and yeah...here we go.\n\nAs you might have guessed from the game's title, this fps takes place during WW2. There are two parts of it: vanilla RO2 on the european eastern front, where you fight as either Germany or the Soviet Union(goodies: tanks/vehicles, OOORAAAH!), and the pacific theatre of war expansion Rising Storm (goodies: flamethrowers/katanas, Baaanzaaaii!).\n\nBeware though: as RO2 is primarily a multiplayer title, the AI in both SP and MP is rather...sub optimal. It sucks.\n\nTherefore, instead of buying Heroes of Stalingrad for the SP content like a friggin ♥♥♥♥♥ (like me...), I HIGHLY recommend buying the Rsising Storm expansion, as it also happens to have ALL Heroes of Stalingrad MP maps so...yeah. No brainer :)\n\nBut now! Enough with the theoretical nonsense and onto the ACTION! Huuza!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=251945579\nRO2 imo fills a very interesting niche between games like CoD (fast paced, very arcady FPS) and games like Arma 3 (veeery slow paced, big focus on realismn).\nKeep in mind: I realise there are more games out there than just these two, I only picked them as represantatives of two very different game design philosophies.\nSo RO2 might be the perfect game for people who find CoD to be too much of the arcady bull**** it is (please excuse my Frensh here, but I really fu***** hate CoD) and Arma 3 to be too much...well, just too much. RO2 is still fast paced...you rarely ever have to walk more then 30 seconds to come within enemy contact, but one bullet can still drop you.\nOther features for example are a suppresion system which makes your aim go all over the place if somebody shoots you a lot as well as weapon unlocks/improvements for all classes/weapons.\n\nBut what is it really all about? Well, there are several different game modes of which the most popular is "Territory". Ever played a round Battlefield Rush mode? Yeah, it's pretty much like that. Capture one Point (sometimes 2 or even 3 at the same time) after another and win the map! But keep an eye on both tickets and time!\nBoth are limited, so the attacker needs to hurry! And the defender has to play it smart, otherwise the defending team might end up stalling the attack but ultimately running out of tickets(=lives/respawns), which creates a very interesting dynamic.\n\nI believe there are some other modes as well, but truth be told...I have never played anything else in over 400h RO2.\nThere are also two different types of servers: campaing or rotation. On a campaing server the victorious team gets to choose if it wants to attack or defend and which territory / map to attack. On a rotation server...well...there is a fixed map rotation :D\nIf you still want to know about those modes\n--> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Red+Orchestra+2+Game+Modes\n\nGermany and Russia are fairly well balanced. Some might say the Russians have the upper hand in CQC, but that's not really the case. At least in my opinion. There is no real imbalance.\nHowever, some people keep saying that the fight between USA and Japan is soo unfair because US=OP. And on first glance it does seem that the US have better weapons, higher firepower etc. Example: the US rifleman gets a M1 Garand. That's a semi automatic rifle. The Japanese Rifleman however, only gets to play with either the Arisaka Type 99 or the Type 38, both are BOLT ACTION RIFLES. I could go into details of stoping power, range, accuracy yadda yadda. There are guides for this if you are really interested in stats like this(remember the 1 Bullet=Death rule?^^) . To sorta balance things out, most maps are designed for the US to be the attackers, so the Japanese have the advantage of being in the defense.\nI still recommend for new players to start as the US(maybe even on a campaign server) because their weapons are far more forgiving. Trust me.\n\nA quick guide on what makes the Japanese so uber awesome was made by WilliamTheTard-san:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=218695252\nThank you, Will! When you follow his advice you "will"(get it? :D ) end up like this:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=250631809\nKicking ♥♥♥ and chewing sushi.yummy...\n\nOnce you are ingame you will notice that there is a class system. The classes are ranging from the ordinary rifleman to extremly deadly flamethrowers.(oh, and tanks in stalingrad^^) There is a slot limit though with the majority of soldiers being said riflemen, so better be quick to grab that lovely MP40/Thompson!\nThere is also a squad system and a team leader, but I won't go into any details here. Suffice to say: While squadleaders are mobile spawn points for their squads and therefore are IMMENSELY important in both offense and defense, the teamleader can call in recon planes (that shows enemy locations on the map even if it's not pin point accuracy) and can drop big fu***** artillery strikes on those poor souls of the enemy team who happen to find themselfes under an arty marker.\nBoth SL (=squadleader) and TL (....exactly! Teamleader) get to choose from a lot of shiny weapons too. They are NOT however for storming the damn beaches of Iwo Jima on ur own, but for protecting urself from single enemy soldiers who want to kill you! SL and TL are very important for a team's success and a match's outcome is often not determined by individual skill, but by the coordination between TL and SLs.\nOh, they also get smoke grenades(1 for SLs, 2 for TL) to screen the own team's advance.\n\nFor the ordinary grunt, RO2 playes a lot like any other FPS. The controls are fluid and intuitive (WASD...), the cover system is total garbage though...don't you dare to use it. Once you get used to the increase of range (you'll find yourself shooting at guys 150m+ in the distance a LOT) and to the fact that you die every minute or so ;) there is really nothing to prevent you from having a BLAST. Except maybe teamkills...which DO happen a lot. Because, well...you fight over large distances, you have an itchy trigger finger and you DROP PEOPLE WITH ONE SHOT^^. But it's part of the game, it happens and it kinda is part of the fun too.\nHere is a little tip that will safe you A LOT of frustration: Allies (Russians, Americans) sprint with their weapons in front of their chest. In BOTH hands. Axis (Germans, Japanese) sprint with their weapons in their right hands only!\n\nOh, did I mention RO2 has an ingame voice chat which people actually use to talk tactics and don't abuse the sh*t out of and try to be the most annoying little f**** there are?(except on Russian servers...I mean, I don't speak Russian but I recognise recordings of speeches/parades on the Red Square when I here 'em^^)  Yeah, the RO2 community is pretty awesome.\n\nIf you are still with me after this DAMN wall of text and you survived my horrible English, there is really nothing that should prevent you from buying this game.\nLike right now.\nI mean it...it's awesome :)\nIn case you want to see some ingame scenes first I picked a completly random LP from YT ( seriously...idk this guy), where you can see a defense on IWO JIMA on the Japanese side.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TPWR9qyM2E\n\nEDIT: He seems to be playing on an action server. Danger indicators, crosshair (only iron sights on realism) and "killed from location" are usually not in the game when you play RO2 these days.\nMy final verdict: 9/10\n\nWith that said, I wish you a lovely day.\nMuch Fun. So skillz.","April 18, 2014","true","141.2"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zogthedoomed/recommended/35450/","zogthedoomed","ZogTheDoomed_UK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zogthedoomed/","31 products in account","So I'll avoid another review and instead offer advice for noobs where they're likely to read it.\n\nThe community is generally welcoming but providing you follow two easy rules.\n\n1. Do NOT take the Team Leader position.\n2. Do NOT take a Squad Leader position.\n\nOK, 4 rules.\n\n3. Do NOT play this like COD.\n4. Shout out that you're new and ask for advice. Many of us like to show off our experience so will gladly help when asked.\n\nRed Orchestra is a team game, played over a number of battles in a campaign (usually). A TEAM game. As an example, if you're a points ♥♥♥♥♥, the top of the leader board is the person with the most TEAM points. NOT highest number of kills. Team points can win games.\n\nThe issue with those two roles, TL and SL, is they have to be played properly if the team is to win. And TL, and preferably SL's, need a microphone and experience.\n\nSo thats it. Do not got TL or SL  until you have a lot of experience OR .. you're willing to tell the team you are new and want advice. Then listen and follow.\n\nAlso be aware of the role you pick or are allocated.\n\nMG's usually move to the flanks and provide cross covering fire. Keeping the enemies heads low. Accuracy and kills is actually less important than scaring the enemy. Make them keep their heads down. When you get low on Ammo shout out using your command keys .. ask for ammo and riflemen should bring it to you.\n\nSnipers .. your job is to take out enemy MG's and Squad Leaders. Anyone else is just going to give your position away for little benefit.\n\nTanks ... always operate best with a crew who communicate with microphones. Use the 6 key to swap between shell types. AP for armour, HE for everything else. Remember that you have 2 mgs. One in the hull, one parrallel with the main gun. commander, stay inside the tank. You are an easy target.  Driver, hatch closed.\n\nSL's, including Tank SL. You have 5 jobs. Do them and your team might win.\n1. Stay alive. DO NOT DIE. DO NOT BE A HERO. If you want points, do your job. You can get to the top of the leader board without firing a round.\n2. Mark artillery targets. If attacking, locate it just past a cap, preventing the enemy from entering. If defending, in a position in the cap furthest away from you .. ie where they enter the cap.  There are many variations of this on the different maps. Learn them. Always be thinking ahead to the next cap point and try to get your marks in early so your TL isn't waiting. You get team points for any enemy killed by artillery.\n3. You are a mobile spawn point for your squad. Get close to the cap and stay down. Stay alive. Your squad can spawn next to you rather than all the way back at the previous spawn. this enable syou to quickly cap and advance.\n4. Smoke.  You start with one smoke and can pick a second at the nearest ammo point. Use it to keep your squad alive. Position it to alllow them to get into caps safely. Not too far away so as to be of little use. You are their surrogate father. Look after them. Keep them safe. Its possible to use smoke in defence but it has to be done VERY carefully so as not to block your line of fire or benefit the enemy.\n5. Talk to your squad. (Press T to find out who they are, Press I to chat to just them). Encourage them, instruct them. Tell them where to expect arty, when you're popping smoke etc. Organise them so you can mount a strong attack.\n\nTL .. you need to be talking to your team constantly. Letting us know when and where arty will drop. Which area to attack and when NOT to attack.\nYou need to call in recon at the appropriate time, instructing your SL's to check their maps and provide new updated marks if required. You HAVE TO STAY next to the radio while the recon plane is up other wise enemies are not shown on th emap.\nIf you need to support an attack in a certain way then tell you SL's where you want their marks. Keep a constant eye on the chat and relay any important infor to the team (thats why you need a microphone).\n\nAnti Tankers .. clue is in the name. You keep the team safe from tanks. If you don't do your job and instead decide to go sniping, your team will get slaughtered. DESTROY TANKS.\n\nEngineers ..  you destroy tanks and tank barricades. When attacking you make a path for YOUR tank with the satchel. Blow fortifications to cripple defenders or alow ingress. When defending you destroy enemy tanks but your're also tasked with defending baricades etc. from enemy engineers.  It's your job to STOP them from being blown up.\n\nAssault .. as it says .. when attacking your are the main thrust of the attack.\n\nAuto Riflemen .. you are essentially an assault with greater range.\n\nRiflemen .. You provide cover for the assault squads .. forcing the enemy to hide.  You then follow the assault into the cap and help consolidate. You then hold and defend the cap while the assaulters move onto the next cap, again providing them with cover and preparing to move on again once the assaulters have nearly secured the cap.\nYou can also resupply MG's. Walk, run or crawl up to them and press USE. This is an essential job since if an MG has to run back for ammo they're both at isk and leaving you without vital support.\n\nAlways use transports when provided. They allow you to follow up an attack much faster and to concentrate forces where needed. Therefor, never drive off in a transport on your own. Always wait until its mostly full.\n\nEnemy recon planes can be shot down. Russian is a bi-plane, German mono. It loses them team points and recon info.\n\nTeam Kills, TK's, happen. they just do. If you TK, say sorry. If you're TK'd and the person says sorry, type np  (no problem), the TK will be forgiven, the person won't be kicked and your team will get a point .. because you were nice. Always forgive, np, TK's by arty .. it's usually your fault.\n\nI could waffle for hours but I'll leave it at that.  It's a fantastic game once you get into it and understand how to play it to it's best.","March 30","true","864.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","2"

They took objective A, B, and C so quickly that our fellow soliders began to panic. My Honor Rank is 73 and a squad leader for Squad Two. I ordered my men to fall back to Objective G, the outskirts of Druzhina, and command them to fortify the position. Squad One fought valiantly against the Russians on Objective D, but most of them were wiped out. The dense forest that cover Objective D and E favor the Russians than our German forces. The Bolsheviks were clever to use smoke grenades to advance their position while our men fired wildly into the thick, white smoke. What are they shooting at? Who knows.\n\nAs Objective E was spammed with Russians, the commander order the squad leaders, including me, to send in artillery coordinates. Unfortunately, there were too many artillery requests sent to the commander. The first coordinate is at the Russians on Objective E, the second coordinate is pointed directly at the Russian T-34, and the third coordinate was sent in close to Objective G. I was the one who sent in the third coordinate. I debated with my commander that the third coordinate is the best because the Russians would most likely be sending 2/3 of their forces to take G. The commander didn't listen and called the artillery at the first coordinate. As the artillery roars the sky and slams into the ground, the Russians were clever to run away from Objective E. Some of them died while the rest who were at Objective E rush to Objective G in a frontal assault. The machine gunner in my squad, whose Honor Rank is 58, fired his MG-34 in a control burst, but was killed by a sniper from 148 meters. I watch the machine gunner got shot and his body slump into the fragile, wooden floor. I was traumatized by this and order my men to not be exposed by the window. The rest of my squad consist of newer members, ranging the Honor Rank from 12 - 36 didn't listen to my command. The second squad member (Honor Rank - 26) was killed by the same sniper.\n\nTwo squad members killed and the Russians are swarming in front of the sandbags near Objective G...and I have to make a choice. I ordered my squad to suppress fire at the Russians while waiting for additional reinforcements to come and defend Objective G. Unfortunately, the Bolsheviks pulled a hard, right flank at Objective F, wiping out Squad Three in under 20 seconds. Even though my squad was able to pluck a few kills around Objective G, the Russians purposely made this frontal assault as a distraction so that their comrades can take Objective F. Knowing that Objective G would be overrun from the right side, I ordered my lower ranking members to retreat back to the apartments in Objective I. Strangely, there were signs of courage and fury in my men's eyes. One of the squad members (Honor Rank - 21, Anti-Tank class) demanded me to let him risk his own life as the T-34 rushes to the main road that leads to Druzhina. I refused in his request and ordered him to tactically withdraw, but he didn't listen. Before I was about to demand an order to him, he pulls out the Hafthohlladung anti-tank grenade and runs directly in front of the T-34. He starts to scream and was about to swing the grenade, but was mowed down in a hail of machine gun fire from the Russians. However, I heard an explosion and I took a slight peak in the window. The T-34's main gun was pointing in front of me and the last I said to my men is: Run! This is Red Orchestra 2.\n\n------------------------------Review----------------------------\nRed Orchestra 2 is the ultimate first-person tactical shooter that advocate very strong team coodination and communication, complex cover system, and each life (or ticket) is precious. When playing as the Russian, German, American, or Japanese, each solider fight just to survive. There will be instances in the game that discourage reckless assaults or exposure to the enemy. You will learn the game by experience and not repeating the same mistakes twice. There are weapons, class, and character rankings that encourages replay value. The best experience you will get in Red Orchestra 2 is playing on a full server. You will hear the best team coordination, the best varieties of newer and veteran players, and the greatest responsibility for your own life and theirs. Red Orchestra 2 does not shy away from the actuality of war as you will hear meeps, horrific groans, and the development of post-traumatic stress disorder. There is no "I" in war; there is brother and comrade. Red Orchestra 2 is simply, the best tactical first-person shooter to ever develop.","November 28, 2014","true","130.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","1"

In my opinion, it's my most favorite fps up to date. I rate it above Battlefield 4 and CoD 4 and put it next to BF:BC2. The only thing that they need to do now is come out with a Red Orchestra game for Vietnam with vehicles and everything and my life would be complete. The combat in this is spot on and much more dynamic and responsive than other FPS games I've played. Unlike BF4, you can actually play at 150 ping on a server and have no lag. I've had no problems with hit detection at all. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this game a 9.7. The only thing it's missing is more vehicle accessible maps and airplane combat. That would make this a full WWII experience. I'll probably play this game more than I have played other FPS's. It's definitely worth picking up for 20 dollars.

I had so much fun with this game. community, gameplay, atmosphere, musics, soldier responds. They were all great. I played most FPS games on PC and consoles, and I can assure you this one is the best. Red Orchestra is the true first-person shooter that people deserve, not those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ casual FPS games which I'm not gonna name them and you already know what kind of games I'm talking about.\nThe stupid thing is I went and wasted my time on those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nonsense FPS games. But I'll never make that mistake again, never.\nThe reason I recommend Red Orchestra is obvious, this is the most hardcore realistic FPS game that ever made, every class and role on this game has a reason, a commander can lead his/her team to success, a squad leader can make it possible to capture/defend an objective with smoke and squad spawn, a machine gunner can support his team with suppress fire, a sniper can bang enemy machine gunner, a assault soldier can go forward with his SMG and clear a room of riflemen. And the last and most important class which I spent 100 hours on is riflemen. They are the most effective soldiers in battlefield. They are the one who captures and defends from objectives.\nRed Orhestra is the game that devs made with love, and we can see it in the game. I do 100% recommend this game to anyone is looking for a hardcore and realistic FPS game.\nAnd my last word is, I wish more people get attracted to this game.","December 16, 2015","true","168.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

TL;DR: Fought so hard we switched campaigns.\n\n2)      The Germans were invading one of our cities, so I led my squad in the defense.

It is, by far, my favourite shooter, because of its stunning grahpics, amazing visual effects, and great audio. It also stays true to the historical events of WW2, and is set around 1941, during Operation Barbarossa, with Soviet Soldiers clashing with the German invaders. The game also features vehical combat, which is a nice touch. There is a large ammount of weapons in the game, too, which are, for the most part, well-balanced. The majority of the maps in the game are quite vast and open, save for a few close-quarters combat maps. Red Orchestra 2 is all about tactics. The Team Leader is a key asset to every team, as he can call in artillery strikes and recon planes. Squad Leaders are important because they are a mobile spawn point for any player of the team. Riflemen and submachine gunners are the main fighting force for either side. Marksmen usually hide in bushes like the cykas they are and pick off enemies from a distance. And engineers can stop a tank in its tracks. But every class plays a key role in leading their team to victory.\n\nIn summary, Red Orchestra 2 is a phenomenal game with a few minor flaws that are made up for by the amazing gameplay, visuals, audio effects, and realism. It's a great game, and anyone who hasn't played it should give it a try.\n\nPS, if you're a rookie player, be sure to have a keen eye, or you'll get shot by some unnatural force that you cannot see.\n\nPS again, Soviets have the best rifle in the game and Germans have the best SMG.","May 1","true","77.8"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Getting shot gets you killed (or disabled which is the same as killed in game terms) most of the time, depending on the weapon you get shot with: higher caliber weapons drop you with more certainty while pistols require more accuracy. Getting shot in the head or the heart (yes, the game lets you know where you were hit) kills anyone instantly. If you get lucky enough to survive a shot, you must spend a few seconds bandaging the wound or you will bleed out and die (yeah, not very realistic but very entertaining and exciting gamewise!). Also, sometimes you survive being shot for the few moments it takes you to bleed out from a serious wound that you cannot bandage: your screen starts to go black and you can no longer move, aim, reload or switch weapons. You can empty your current weapon in the general direction of the enemy sometimes getting lucky enough to hit them. Heroic effort, that! Nothing can save you from dying in this state, however.\n\nThe game simulates suppression by turning the screen gradually black and white while a loud thumping of your own heart can be heard. This indicates your soldier panicking in the midst of an artillery barrage (which causes the most suppression in the shortest amount of time), getting shot at (bullets hitting near you gradually make you panic) and finally fellow soldiers getting hit and dying near you. In game terms, you aim is lowered by the additional weapon sway and the screen effects make it harder (not impossible, just more difficult) to aim accurately.\n\nThe two sides (US and Imperial Japanese) are balanced in a way that - despite their numerous differences - offer a different experience in gameplay. Both sides have a set of limited roles ranging from the single team leader, several squad leaders, machine gunners, assault troops, snipers and an indefinite amount of riflemen up to the team size of 32 players. In addition the US get flamethrowers, and engineers carrying trench guns, while the Imperial Japanese have 'Knee-mortar' -soldiers.\n\nAlso the technology of the time is - to my knowledge - displayed accurately: the US soldiers are equipped with semi-automatic weapons (M1) most of the time while the Imperial japanese troops have to make do with their bolt action rifles (Type 38, Type 99). In some maps, like Guadalcanal, the US troops have bolt-action rifles (Springfield) as well since the M1-Garands had not yet been delivered to them (as is historically accurate). All in all, the US have more firepower at their disposal at any given time.\n\nIn return, the Imperial Japanese troops have bayonets from the beginning (which the US soldiers lack until upgraded) and they can banzai charge - resulting in higher suppression resistance - causing suppression in the enemy the more soldiers are joined in the charge - and the ability to withstand more hits than usual (headshots and shots through the heart kill instantly, as normally). The US troops suffer from suppression more easily than the Imperial Japanese troops. Japanese officers also get katanas, which are a cool way of disposing opponents.\n\nIn terms of weaponry, the Imperial Japanese soldiers can use their grenades as booby traps: 2 can be in place at the most by a single soldier at any given time. If you plant a third, the first one disappears. Yeah, again not very realistic but it balances the game. The booby traps can be seen plainly if placed on an open terrain with no vegetation and they can be detonated by shots, grenades or artillery fire. US soldiers walking over or very near one detonate it and most often die instantly while the Imperial Japanese soldiers can walk over them without triggering them. An US soldeir can, however shoot at a booby trap to detonate it in the face of any enemy soldiers (there's actually an achievement for this!).  The knee-mortar (as inaccurately named by US troops of the time; some poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s actually tried firing it from their knee, often  breaking their thighbone as a result) is basically a grenade launcher which must be setup prior firing. It can be deadly in accurate hands but is often a cause of accidental team kills among new players trying it, don't get discouraged if this happens and remember to apologize for team kills! A knee-mortar soldier gets 5 grenades to shoot at respawn, which can be replenished once at a single supply point like any other ammunition.\n\nThe flamethrower that the US  have, is a weapon feared by many Imperial Japanese players. A mere touch of its flames will kill you almost instantly and the flames fill a bunker quickly and completely leaving nothing alive inside. In contrast, the fuel runs out rather quickly, the range is limited,  and the US soldier carrying it is perhaps the most targeted soldier among enemy troops.\n\nBoth sides' team leaders must coordinate with their squad leaders to bring down artillery fire on, or near the enemy. This mostly acts as an area denial behind capture points so that the defending or attacking players are denied access to secure it. Soldiers finding themselves inside a barrage must get out of there quickly or get killed by the blasts: the game mechanic of artillery kills anyone inside the area over time. If you're very lucky, you can survive for a few seconds to run into safety.\n\nThe game has a honor system with ranks starting from 0 (new players) and ending in 100 - the highest rank available. The honor rank is account based and it is shown on a 'kill list' rotating on the upper right corner of the display (who killed who, how and where the shot it if a vulnerable spot) whenever you die or kill an opponent. You never know where the shot came from (unless you actually saw it your field of vision) as the camera locks instanly as you are killed so you can not look around to spot the enemy while dead.\n\nThe individual roles on a side (rifleman, machinegunner, squad leader etc.) get experience (team points) points based on performance in battle: staying near you squad leader or team leader grants you extra team points whenever you kill someone or help capture an objective (which in itself grants several points). Also extra points are awarded for killing someone FROM the object zone and even more if the TARGET was in the object zone as well. Normally, you get 2 ream points from a kill and -2 for a team kill.\n\nA team kill can be forgiven by a player by saying 'np' in the public chat (the 'np' is not shown in actual chat) which removes the penalty from the player who caused it. It is generally polite to apologize for team kills and forgive them if the player causing it apologized. Sometimes you can guess with almost certainty that a team kill was an accident. Sometimes you just make the mistake of running into an area where someone just said they'd throw a grenade at or the team leader announced that the artillery barrage would strike in: in these cases you should own your mistake and 'np' immediately, especially in the case of team leader's artillery barrage which could result in numerous team kill penalties quickly. If you get enough team kills, whether accidental or not, you get kicked from the match and can't rejoin until the map changes.\n\nRespawns in the game are periodic (a rotation of 16 seconds, I think) simulating waves of reinforcements arriving. The team leader has a limited ability (with a cooldown period) to instantly respawn all dead players. Both teams have a set number of tickets which dwindle as players keep dying. If the tickets reach zero, spawn protection is disabled and no more respawns can take place. Maps are also time limited and failure by the attacking team to capture an objective will eventually result in a lockdown period of 3 minutes during which they must capture the point or lose despite the time left on the map's time counter.","February 23, 2015","true","187.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This is one of the few shooters I have in my library that does not feel like an arcade experience.  Here are the following reasons I keep coming back to this game: suppressing fire and artillery cause your character to panic, affecting your aim and movement.  There are not countless weapons and upgrades to choose from; weapons are limited to squad availability, which forces teams to work together unlike other modern shooters.  You are easily killed, which forces you to move and attack carefully.  Finally, and most importantly, this game is hard...VERY hard.  It takes a while to get used to the play style and to properly explore the importance of the different squad roles.  This is one of those games where the first time you play it you will get killed very quickly and very often, not because there's some level 99 player with all of the weapons and upgrades unlocked kicking everyone's ♥♥♥, but because you haven't learned how to properly play the game.  This game is gritty, brutal, realistic, maddening, and a hell of a good time.","November 25, 2013","true","68.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

It mainly revolves around the bitter street fighting in the streets of Stalingrad and contrasts it with the openess of the surrounding steppes. RO2 scratches a multiplayer itch that no other competitive multiplayer game can quite get. It mixes small unit tactics and teamwork with high intensity and very authentic gunplay. The man who runs and guns in this is the man who gets shot first. Along with the authentic gameplay comes a steep learning curve. To those who tough it out RO2 is a multiplayer favorite and is an undeniably excellent game. Starting off with the core gameplay mechanics, RO2 attempts to; and arguably suceeds at; creating a tactical and authentic multiplayer experience that forces players to confer with their team in, at least a basic manner. The team with better communication generally comes out on top. Communication is especially crucial to the commander, who can call in off-map suppourts such as recon and artillery suppourt. These suppourts rely on coordiantes supplied by squad leaders and the platoon commander, thusly making teamwork a nessesity to win. Classes also play an improtant role. Given that M4 carbines are not the norm in World War 2, every weapon is more specialized. Riflemen are your typical grunts equipped with a bolt action rifle. These rifles are incredibly lethal and accurate making the rifleman key to providing suppourt to the other classes. Maachine gunners shut down kill zones and provide an alley for others to advance. Squad leaders assist the commander in providing coordinates and can use somke to conceal movement. Assaults get down and dirty in the ternches and go head on with the enemy with a sub machine guns. AT riflemen and Engineers provide a way to counter enemy armour at long and short range respectivley. These classes create a dynamic of cooperation between teammates, not one class dominates the battle. Gunplay is deliberate and lethal, One shot from any weapon has the potential to kill freind or foe. This gunplay makes short range combat flurried and confusing, while having long range engagments become a test of finesse and awareness. all of this gameplay is nicley wrapped in an atmospheric and compelling presentation. You crawl in dirty trenches to avoid rifle fire and artillery, knowing one well placed shot will end your life. The soundtrack potrays the mood of the battle, spurring you to action or spiraling into self loathing for losing to your opponent. Soldiers around you vocalize showing distain for their sub-human enemies, cowering in fear after coming under fire or writhing in pain while bleeding out after taking a round to the chest. The only real complaints regarding RO2 are it's steep learning curve, useless single player and some map glitches. The learning curve may turn some people off though once you get past it, RO2 is an experience that no other FPS can offer.","November 26, 2013","true","303.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"HOLD THE POINT!" Our commander yells in chat as we continue to fight a losing battle, hoping to at least dwindle their numbers so they can't push through to other towns. I'm here with my bolt action, taking ineffective shots at the growing number of Axis soldiers moving into the point. My character curses his gun as he hides in cover to reload.\n\nA teammate walks past me as I'm reloading, gun down, holding his stomach, and my character starts fumbling the magazine as I see him bleed to death. I peek from cover and take out a soldier. "I'll never get these faces out of my head" is my character's last spoken words before the Axis take their victory.\n\n\nYou are infeebled as a player, and forced to rethink your strategy.

Not all roles are available for all game types.\n- Several gametypes (objective based or just shooting) and three rulesets (realism, classical and action). Action is the casual mode (crosshair, reduced damage, run and shoot pace) and realism is the "real mode" (one shot kills, bleeding damage, no crosshair, no ammo counter). Classical is similar to realism, but without zoom on iron sights and bleeding out. But I can comment on the classical mode only from what I've read on the forums, as it seems that classical mode servers are dead.\n- Very detailed and interesting maps, offering different approaches to engage the combat.\n- Cover system, grenade cooking and blind firing makes the gameplay options more variable\n- Even if you are not a very good player, you have your chances to excel. This game is not punishing for inexperienced players, as, for example, Insurgency or Counter-Strike. However, the skills still matter and the more you learn, the better you become.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Limited number of active players (1000-1500) and usable servers\n- Annoying bot behaviour (circling on the spot, blocking the sight for team members, not adjusting to the team)\n- Unadjusted respawns - spawning in front of enemies or behind the enemy line is common\n- It feels rather chaotic. Although the large number of players + bots allow to score many kills and accelerates the gameplay, the team members do not coordinate their actions very well.\n- Some maps offer exploits for sniping and its noticeable that some players prefer certain maps for that reason during map voting\n- Rather clumsy transitions between entering cover, exiting cover, crouching and proning\n- Quite a few glitches (seeing through objects/players; getting stuck until you press ESC, problems with proning or taking cover, not being able to use chat, etc.)\n\nThis game is rather complicated and it has a rather steap learning curve, but from the four multiplayer shooters that I've recently played (CS:GO, Insurgency, America's Army: Proving Grounds and this one), Rising Storm feels the most balanced. It's like a middle ground between "casual shooters" and "hardcore shooters" and I like it that way.\n\nIt suits well enough both for weekend action and hardcore skill building.\n\nMy overall rating: 7/10.","January 17","true","10.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

You run around, a shot cracks in the distance, and you fall over dead, often not even knowing where the shot came from.\n\nRed Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm are terrifyingly realistic. Players must account for bullet drop and taking cover is a must. Playing this game "CoD style", or running around the map shooting things, is a surefire way to kill yourself.\n\nThe cover system is well implemented. Once in cover, a player can peek and fire, then duck back into hiding. Staying exposed for an extended period of time will draw the attention of a sniper you will be picked off from a distance. However, even when behind cover, there is always the fear of a stray grenade bouncing over to your location, or an artillery strike raining down over your position. You are almost never safe.\n\nThe sound design in particular is superb, completely immersing you into the WWII battlefield. The crackle of gunshots, the screeching of artillery, your screaming comrades, and the shock of explosions all contribute to a pretty frightening war game.\n\nThe game also has a relatively small but active multiplayer community. There are always some servers that have a few people. The rest of the spots are populated by bots. These AI are relatively decent. They do know to take cover and can usually shoot to some degree of accuracy.\n\nGameplay itself is usually objective-based, encouraging players to play for their team rather than themselves. Killing enemies from or in an objective will earn a player more points, further discouraging people from playing "CoD style" and putting emphasis on teamwork.\n\nOverall, this game is not for the faint of heart, but people wanting a break from annually-photocopied generic FPS games will appreciate Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm.\n\nRating: PTSD/10","February 6","true","5.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

You check the number of bullets by feeling the weight of the magazine, or by pulling back the bolt of a rifle to count the bullets inside (done by holding the reload button). Even then, you won't know the exact number. It'll tell you if it's empty/near-empty/half-full/more than half/full.\n-Suppression is a thing. If there's too much gunfire around you, your screen will turn black and white. Your character will start shaking, and you can't steady your aim down your iron sights.\n-Bullet drop is a thing. When aiming down your sights, you can compensate for bullet drop by adjusting your view down the iron sights (done by scrolling up/down with the mouse scroll). The further a target, the more you'll have to lower your sights to get an accurate shot.\n-There's a cover system. I don't use it much, but it's still there. You can also lean left/right.\n-Roles are limited so as to prevent the Battlefield problem. Depending on the number of players, there can only be 1-2 snipers, 1-4 machinegunners, 1-2 elite assaults, 1-5 squad leaders, etc.\n-There is a commander role. The commander is responsible for calling in aerial recon (to reveal enemy locations), force respawning (to support a large push against a capture point), and various types of artillery. Artillery coordinates must be requested from squad leaders, which further illustrates the team aspect of this game.","November 26, 2013","true","66.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Granted customization isnt entirely great you have a few different weapons for each class and unlock the weapons for the other factions as you level each class (as well as stat improvement and attachments) but outside of that there is'nt anything. The combat and graphics make up for that by leaps and bounds.\nThe combat is very immersive and gets your blood pumping in intense situations. Storming a house/trench system, trying to defend and keep enemies out from your position, heart pumping close quarters combat not knowing who is around the corner or in the next room, the statisfaction you get when you pick some one off from over 100 meters away, how effective teamwork is and the impact it will make on how a round goes while trying to secure objectives or coordinate atry strikes.\nNow the game can get very annoying and frustrating when your team is utter crap (like in every other game) since you can get locked down in the same spot and not be able to move or get any where without dying or your enemy just steam rolls through objectives. It is also a little difficult to tell the teams apart sometime but if you know the uniforms of the different nations its not bad. If you're new probably going to team kill often and really ♥♥♥♥ people off but its a learning curve.\nThe community is normally very helpful but also can be a little bit of eliteist sometimes. Its real easy to become a die hard fan of this game once you start getting decent and familarized with the game. So dont let some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s scare you off for TKing or not going for the right objective.\n\nTL;DR\n\n+great immersive combat/gameplay and graphics\n+a lot of realism and historicly accurate weapons/battles\n+huge battles and maps as well as small ones\n+chain of command from commanders to squad leaders with differing perks\n\n-very frustrating at first vs vet players\n-possible elitists getting angry at you for being new\n-low customization","September 28, 2015","true","573.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"

I know the whole world has been eagerly waiting my next review. Don't worry you can stop holding your breath now it's here!\n\nThe graphics are alot better than they appear in the trailer let it be noted. Although it automatically sets them to lowest setting for graphics so to first timers It will look like a rubbish graphical experience. But if you change them in options it is perfect. I can run on second highest out of about 8 options of graphics settings and still have some of the highest ping I have ever seen (My PC is not the best for gaming, I will say that much ;)\n\nRed Orchestra 2 (including Rising Storm) Is probably the most realistic combat simulator since Arma 2, And 5 times the fun.\nFor the first 5 hours you will find it damn near impossible to do anything right, Unless you are an MLG pro like me (add me on club penguin at [BlazeItMichael]_Xxx_B*tchesOnMyD*ck_Xxxv). Although it is definitley worth sticking with, as after the nooby period you will become Adept (Much Like Skyrim) And be able to run, duck, survive and pull off some pretty amazing if not entertaining as hell kills. Especially as a Japanese banzia charger. To clarify there are vehicles (Not as many as Heroes and Generals but still enough.) There aren't ships or planes as I suspect that would almost ruin the game. You have enough weapons to start with and all of them are useful for different playstyles. Going rambo with a flamethrower was my initial favourite.... Until I realised my whole team was Laughing at me :(\nThe game no matter what PC you have runs smoother than a very smooth and shiny rock (I didnt want to talk about Baby's bottoms because the NSA could be listening!) and the lowest I have seen my Ping being 80 no matter what server I'm on. Aswell the servers are up 24/7 and there is a constant dedicated fanbase of players online and with a perfect 32 a side on most servers there is no shortage of people to play with. There are also mod/community map and weapon and vehicle and texture supports including a workshop page.\n\nI haven't had the game long. But I am now enjoying it and find it hard to put it down for five minutes. The time it took to write this review was torture enough without being able to snipe some soviet pigs!\n\nThere are 4 factions available Russia vs Germany and Japan vs US although more may be added through mods/updates.\nAnd when you become a pro you will have the best time ever pulling off headshots from 300 meters with a rusty 70 year old soviet revolver.\n\nWow steam... The fact that you even dare to ask me wether I want to recommend this game or not is shocking....\n\nP.S Has all the gore and laughs of Chivalry (Yes including a bit of teamkilling.) But runs ten times smoother and don't have to put up with as many hackers.","September 5, 2015","true","43.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","9","12","5","0"

This game has everything from COD-small sized maps with intense papasha slaughter (apartments) to maps featuring more "line" combat (pavlovs house, mamayev, winterwald) where the teams battle for those several meters, losing hundreds of soldiers just to get shelled by the enemy arty & have your point lost again by the defending forces, making you feel (atleast a tiny bit) how dreadfull, disgusting and annoying trench warfare/line warfare can be (hint: FLANKING). It even goes so far to very open & large maps such as mamayev kurgan, bridges of druzhina (if u don't keep your head down, you'll lose you head trust me) or barashka.\n\nBasically, for this price & if you're looking for a more realistic shooter where i've seen amazing pistol-aimed killshots from over 100 meter (which is pretty damn hard to get) to getting shot by pretty much any weapon means death, no "healthbar", i'd say buy this & buy the digital deluxe. It's only still 18 euro's/dollars (cheap compared to the next puked out COD for 60 + DLC - btw this game has FREE DLC) and you'll get the amazing AVT-40 & MkB42(z) (which is basically the prototype for the mp44) which give you quite the punch for your buck.\n\n10/10 by far, they really need to make maps as big as they got on battlefield with this game! (preferably with player controlled aircraft & MORE tanks, infantry vehicles etc...) then i'd just nerdgasm.\n\nPS: it also features class-based & squad-based gameplay with MG teams, snipers, assault teams, common rifleman, squad leaders and the team leader aswell in some cases a driveable tank (which has a hughe realistic feel to it hence u either pop your head out the tank making sweet shots for MG teams or snipers, or you look through the tiny peepholes in your tank, where a good AT soldier can shoot you through the peep hole or blow your tank up shooting at it's ammo racks under the top track a little bit to the left - resulting in a nice BANG "look at this ivan, it's christmas fireworks!

Gameplay is very brutal for new comers, it has realistic gameplay and RO2 also has bullet drop which is a very nice feature!\n\nRO2 is a huge game and it has a very hard learning curve, thats why many people buy it on sale then abandon when they die zillion of times without shooting down a couple of enemies...\n\nIn RO2 you see people crawl, sneak, hide, run, cry, taunt, swear, and explode just in front of your eyes.\n\nAll the chaos, artillaries and explosions makes you feel like youre really in the battlefield, not to mention the fear of facing a tank especially when the turret turns to your direction, I just ♥♥♥♥ my pants when that happens and pray the gunner didnt notice me!\n\nYeah I love RO2 because its a badass game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatZelousGuy/recommended/35450/","ThatZelousGuy","Zelousmarine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatZelousGuy/","55 products in account","UNBELIEVABLE.\n\nRising Storm/Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad is the sequel/expansion spinnoff to the original Red Orchestra.\nThe game is a World War 2 First Person Shooter designed to be multiplayer only, with a singleplayer "campaign" against bots.\nIf this sounds boring, it's only because this has been done SOOOO many times before.\nSo what makes this game stand out from the masses?\n2 main things:\n1) The painstakingly historical accuracy\n2) FUN\n\nRed Orchestra, while somewhat obscure, has always been reccognised by those who know about it for it's historicaly accurate portrayal of World War 2. Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm continues this tradition to the (somewhat) extreame.\nThis is no Call of Duty, and this is no Battlefield. The only thing "Battlefieldly" in this is the hellhole of chaos that happens on the maps. While it doesn't have the Blockbuster-like fun of World At War, and without the characters and story of Brothers In Arms, Red Orchestra 2 is more of an interesting history discussion than a movie or book. If you are someone who enjoys history discussions, then you will like this a LOT.\n\n\n\nRed Orchestra 2 is set in 1940-1942 on the Eastern Front, and portrays historical battles in it's multiplayer matches, where you play the grunts and soldiers sent into the meat grinder for the Russian/German war machine.\nDon't worry: it's not like it's going to be a documentary with someone from the History channel commenting on your every action: it's more of a WW2 Simulator, and not one of the bad ones.\n\n\nLet's get into the meat of what it has to offer: While there is the "Normal" style of play, which is very much like Call of Duty, the MAJORITY (94%) of the players are playing on the "Realism" mode (The way is was ment to, and should be, played)\nThe game uses a minimalist HUD, with UI only popping up when neccisary.\n\nSeeing as this is so close to real life, there is no Health bar: You die in a SINGLE BULLET, to the head, chest, and groin. If hit in the arms and legs; you either use a bandage (which takes time to put on, and can only be done twice) or you bleed out to death as the screen goes dark, and everything goes quiet.\n\nThe weapons are awesome. In "Realism" there is not crosshair, meaning you have to use ironsights, and blind fire is about as effective as harsh language. All weapons have accurate recoil, modeling, sound effects, damage (Rifles kill in 1 shot anywhere, machine guns are similary powerful)and animation. Like how you not only have to reload machineguns; you have to change the barrel if they overheat. Or how you can toggle the Scope or Ironsights on a sniper weapon. Or how you can't ironsight a machinegun unless they are mounted on cover.\n\nThere are various classes in each team, each with different weapons and ablities, so how many weapons you have depends on your choice. Ultimatley you can carry a maximum of 2 primary weapons, 2 pistols, 2 grenades of 2 types (Smoke or Frag), and (depending on class) binoculars. You can't have every weapon in each class, so you have to find them on dead bodies.\n\nThe Movemnt is nothing short of amazing: you can sprint forever, but your soldier tires out after a few seconds, so your walking speed is faster then sprinting. You can stand, croutch, go prone, and lean. Your movement depends on your weapon that you are holding, so you don't feel, like in Halfe-Life, that you are a floating orb zooming around everywhere; instead you feel like a human snotling, lugging around a heavy firearm. The game also has a First Person Cover System, where you can latch onto walls. floors, and in trenches. You can blind fire around cover, or use Ironsights to peak out, but it makes you visable and you probably will get shot. Sounds like ARMA, but plays a lot differently.\n\nThe battlefield is a scary place, full of mines, barbwire, trenches, buildings, and corners for enemies to hide in. Smoke, dirt, and body parts fly up in the air, as a commander calls in an artillery strike from a radio. With this comes problems however, because the environments are ususally the same colour as the players, so it is VERY dificult to tell apart the Grey team from the Slightly Orangey-Brown team. Friendly fire is always on, so you will be seeing frequent use of "sorry" in the chats.\n\nWhile the game is realistic, it also means you won't be killing many people. The game wants you to make a last stand against an enemy and preform a heroic sacrifice, like the real heroes of the war, but it doesn't realise that 90% of the time, you will be behind a wall/box/cover, crying for your momy, while you soil your pants.\n\nAnd finally: TANKS. Not the normal tanks: FIRST PERSON TANKS.\nAll the tanks have a first person modeled interior, with the commander, gunner, driver, loader, and radio operator, all cramped inside this steel beast, with interactable pistol-ports, and parascopes all present. As you see the loader refill your tank gun with either High Explosive or Armour Piercing rounds, you feel like Steel Batalion, and that you are really driving around a sluggish piece of metal with death able to come in an eyeblink.\n\nA very immersive and impressive experience then. Red Orchestra 2 might not be the same for veterans and purists of the original, but to newcomers, Red Orchestra 2 is a very profesional game with a high skill level and a ton of fun to play. and for $20USD, you are getting 300+ hours of experience (while I haven't reached that far myself)\n\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum there is Rising Strom; the standalone expansion to Red Orchestra 2, and a damn good one at that.\nThis time it's the Pacific front, with Uncle Sam going against Tojo in a head-on turkey shoot, with the Yanks and the Japs in the firing line (Americans VS Japanese)\n\nThe gameplay is basically the same as Red Orchestra 2's, with the only changes being American/Jap weapons, No tanks (sad face :( ) and MUCh less of asymetrical gameplay. The American side is VASTLY overpowered with Thompsons and Flamethrowers, and can steamroll the Japs, sometimes.\nSOMETIMES.\nThe Japs are more specialised, and they are able to plant booby traps-\nand they have Swords.\nYes you weeabo nitwits: THEY HAVE KATANAS, and they can do morale sapping BANZAI!! charges against the Yanks.\nWhile not that effective, it is AWESOME when it pays off.\nRising Strom is also much easier than Red Orchestra 2 for newcomers, and it isn't as... "grimdark" as the Eastern Front\n\nBut Rising Storm is a VERY good EXPANSION PACK (not DLC) and you are getting an entire full game for half the price.\n\n\n\nTo conclude: Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 is a VERY intense and fun game, that sinks it's teeth into you, and never lets you go, if you let it. If you ever wanted to play a game that REALLY simulates World War 2 the RIGHT way, then you have found the Holy Grail.\n\nEasily a 4.5/5\n\n[And as a side note: one of the mods for this game: "Heroes of the West" simulates the Western Front with the Americans against the Germans. It's still in progress, so it's not ready yet. but deffinatley something to look forward to if you get this game]\n\n[Also: the best server for the game is Merrill's Marauders Pacifiic/Stalingrad campaign.

From the frozen battlefields of the eastern Front to the tropical vistas of the Pacific, RS/RO creates an immersive environment where every step and every shot are important. With a serious emphasis on teamwork, this shooter requires people to think before they act. This is no "lone wolf" type game. You may start feeling like a child who's lost its mother, but with time and experience, you may get to be an efficient killing machine. The only downside in this game must be the painful grinding for weapons. Though they are not dramatic COD like unlocks, they are quite difficult to get. The satisfying feeling of landing a head shot with a bolt action rifle on  a moving target 90 meters away will fuel many into losing themselves for hours in this game.\n","January 16, 2015","true","105.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Red Orchestra 2 is the best JRPG I have ever played. It has many aspects of Western RPG's like The Elder Scrolls. For instance, WASD are the keys that you use to move around, just like in Skyrim. Although this game is based in a fictional world, it feels very real almost like this game was based on a true story. This is the perfect game for anyone that was a fan of Katamari. The gameplay is very similar in some ways. This is basically the video game version of the movie Casablanca which is why it is so good. My only complaint about this game is the graphics. The visuals look too good and I always get 60 frames which is too much for me. I prefer a buttery smooth 17-30 frames a second and at HD resolutions of 792p but no higher than that. 1080p is useless as the human eye can distinguish anything above 792p. Anyway, Red Orchestra 2 is the best MOBA on the market and I highly recommend it to anyone that liked Sleeping Dogs.","April 6, 2014","true","92.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","6","7","7","2"

The guns feel great and anything that fires more than 1 bullet per minute is very hard to control. The command and class system is great.

U play either a german or a russian soldier in WW2. There are 3 gamemodes: 1st territory where the attackin team has to capture all of the enemys capzones; 2nd countdown where u have to capture more capzones during a given time then the enemy or 3rd firefight where you have to kill as many enemys as possible.\nIf u are a fan of CoD or CS u probable wont like the game cuz its a bit slower and the grafic isnt so amazing as in other games. The realy good thing of the game is the atmosphere: the soldiers speak in their mothertongue, scream for help if their under fire or comment the battle. The second in my eyes good thing is the realism. here ur very often dead after one shot and if not ur health doesnt regenerate instead u have to dress ur wound before u bleed to death. the weapons are realistic too: the recoil is bigger as in other games and u have to aim carefully. hipfire should be only used when ur skilled enaugh. U also can upgrad weapons and soldierclasses (like rifleman or engineer) to get awards like bayonet for some weapons or more or bigger mags. there is a level system too wich goes from 10 to 99. After reaching 80 u can play the classes u skilled enaugh as a hero wich brings a lot of advantages (like resisting barrages longer (ur sight becomes grey if ure under barrages for longer then a few moments)). the maps are mostly very big but there are some small ones too if u like that more. if u should have played liked RO1 too u should love this game too (but I heard that a few RO1 fans dont like that game). its more dynamic and much faster. the last thing i want to tell u guys is that there is the addon Rising Storm wich plays in the Pacific theatre (USA against Japan) and brings new weapons and new features (Flamethrower/Banzaicharge) to the game. Another addon ("In Country:Vietnam") will be released in 2014. the only thing i dont like at the game are the bots. they re cannon fodder for disttances above 50 m (and waste reinforcements like this), quickscope u witch the second shot on under 50 m and are very dangerous in melee o.O\nAll in all it just a great game and if u just have a bit of money ull have allot of multiplayer fun witch a lot of adrenalinkicks :D If u have any questions towards the game just messge me :D\nhope u buy it all and cya in the game :D","December 18, 2013","true","422.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

I would recommend. I generally play TE-Realism (territory-realism) so cannot speak for much else, so I will focus on what I know.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Disclaimer-I wrote this the day the Troop Transport and etc. patch came out so I cannot talk for the new game mode nor have I encountered how the transports affected the gameplay (though I doubt this will change my review at all).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Now onwards:\n\nFirst off, I would not recomend this game for a drop-in drop-out team-deathmatch style play. The real beauty in this game lies in it's tactical layout that is fully fleshed in the territory game mode, which has a chain of command from Lt. to Sgt. to Riflemen(or whatever you are playing as) with players taking each role as able. Platoon to squad to individual in other words.\n\nIn order to succeed in this game, teamwork is one-hundred percent essential. If you want to be an mg, you are going to need someone to give you ammo when you run dry and to protect your six. If you want to be a sniper, you have to pay attention to what your team is calling out, and to prioritize the correct targets (do you hit the enemy sniper, team leader, or engineer?).\n\nRealism mode is exactly how it sounds. bullet pen. and deviation happens, getting shot in the leg slows you down, and if you don't patch your wounds you will bleed out and die (if you aren't killed outright already). AT rifles can't penetrate the SLOPED front armor, and the ppsh is a *ahem* on the recoil aspect.\n\nOnly three complaints: sometimes people join a match only to mess with others (via chat, TKs, etc.) This is not that big a problem, and if such a person arrives it is an easy procss to kick said individual. Secondly, the roles can be taken very quickly and sometimes matches are just bad (usually for the russians because the russians seem to never have good teamwork). With some patience and perseverence this can be over-come however. Finally, and my main complaint, people often drop out of matches when they are over. While this is not a bad thing per se, usually if a team gets absolutely wiped during a match almost invariably 50% of the team throws out some form of pessimistic "this team sucks/what noobs/I hate my team" and quits the server. Invariably this only furthers the disparity in the teams, as one side slowly accrues vets who are have a lot of experience that day on the server working together while the other is constantly rotating new people who have base teamwork.\n\nThese problems are entirely player-based and as such are no fault on the game itself, and I 100% recomend this to whoever reads this.\n\nIt CAN be said that this game is extremely hard, both in the beginning and later on. I was there, dying sixty times a match, never getting a kill, etc. At level 60+ now I can honestly say, it is just experience. Like in a real war the greenies do poorly at first, so it is here. Just keep trying, find good people to play with, and learn from the vets and you should do fine. It IS a hard game, and it IS worth the trials you might face every once in a while.\n\nEDIT: Troop Transports and whatnot did not affect the game in any negative way at all. While sometimes people cheese them and block doors to objectives, or use the mg as a mounted gun this only adds more to the realism of the game: people build barricades to defend themselves, and more mgs seems like a great idea. Plus, you can throw grenades over the transports. Both teams get transports if transports are on a map. While I do believe the Soviet is faster, the germans have a better gun and can carry more (i believe). All in all, still a most excellent game.","January 20, 2014","true","905.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/recommended/35450/","kony4","kony","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/","707 products in account","This is probably the best multiplayer shooter up to date.\n\nThe game is semi-realistic, which means it tries to be both realistic and fast at the same time. A single bullet means death if it hits head, heart or lungs (in case of lungs it's not an immediate death though as you can still shoot while dying), but a bullet to less vital parts of a body will only cause a wound. A bullet shot into enemy's weapon will effectively disarm him. Granades are very deadly as they should be, which is important to mention, because in many games their effectiveness is downplayed. Wounded legs will slow you down, wounded arms will negatively affect your accuracy.\n\nThe game is very fast as there are "tickets" that let players respawn until they run out, hence there usually isn't too much turtling and the game heavily discourages such tactics anyway due to maps, use of artillery and so on. Many maps allow multiple tactics as they usually allow two (sometimes even more) points to attack for a team, hence the defenders need to spread out, and attackers can decide where to focus on pushing the enemy forces.\n\nThe game provides multiple classes to choose from, but the better and more important ones are limited, and interestingly not every player is equal - some get better weapons, some get worse, but also some are leaders, while others are cannon fodder. But it is fun regardless of what class you are playing (although you might have your favourite one). The game isn't about being the best in the team, it's about helping the team. It is very encouraged by the game's mechanics and affects the game in a very significant way, hence why the game doesn't play like another random multiplayer shooter #241221. It's unique in its own way. I definitely recommend it to everyone who enjoy multiplayer action games, regardless if they prefer realism or arcade, as this game is somewhere in-between (albeit inclines more towards realism than arcade). The only negative things I can say about this game is that albeit its realism, bullets do not penetrate objects (which is a serious flaw), and the fact that unlike previous games by Tripwire RO2 doesn't support anything besides Windows operating system.","April 6","true","121.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/recommended/35450/","InnerConflict","InnerConflict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/","291 products in account","Why I love this game? Because in order to use a weapon effectively you need to learn how a weapon acts. You need to learn how a weapon reacts like the PPS or PPSH 41 before you start to  hate it because you hit nothing . You also have bots most of the time on the servers, if there are no players. The bots play smart. They storm, rush, defend or aren´t able to react because of artillery or suppression. The bots are excellently executed in their programming and you can have a very intense fight even with just those, a very own regulated fight! The battles in this game are always intense and require player actions. You smoke the front of an MG Nest so the enemy players or bots have their field of sight cut off, you then can storm the objectives, push the enemy back or control the battlefield by being the commander, suqad leader or just any regular class or call in artillery to cut off reinforcements. Players teamwork with each other as they are intrigued in getting the win is a often happening thing. This game has so much detailed work in it, so much precise teamwork and fighting like in no other game on the market. Red Orchestra 2 is a masterpiece of combat and battlefield simulation. The wonky, at first, yet easy to understand controls are FANTASIC. The gun combat being perfectly tuned. The balancing and the strategic elements are a mash up of skill and realism. Just 1 hour of combat equals 10 hrs of any other games wannabe strategic finesse. I might play 250 hrs Call of Duty, but it won´t come near 1 hr of Red Orchestra immersion. This game is a pinnacle and mastery of its genre. Get it! Play it! Feel the battlefield and the combat! It´s more than just video game programming! It´s fun no matter the circumstance even with AI, even with amateurs! I played and felt so into it that I wanted to truly get rid of the enemy! I wanted to win! I wanted to let the enemy feel the pain of defeat! I take my Thompson, SVT, C96, MKB, G41, PPSH 41, no matter what and storm the building, I take down 3 guys and continue! Every second being the last I think. Yet i survive! ADDICTION.\n\nThere was a time when the crickets were loud and the sun was hot, but without the rivers of blood. My homecountry was invaded, our push failed. The bolshevik danger coming close, the nazi propaganda all just lies. My name is Frank Eisenherz, I was born and raised in times when my fellow Germans were in bad mind and the country in ruins. They enlisted me without my approval, like most of my friends at that time. We had to, we also wanted victory for previous shame and defeat. Regain what was lost with strength and brutality. What fools we were singing under the iron cross for the swastika fascist scum. Several nightskies ago I clenched strong to my MKB42 prototype, a weapon ahead its time. Many red died by my hand. I wake up with the worst of nightmares, insomnia and a decayed mind. After defending bridges and storming apartements, fighting the russians frequently, I realized that we lost the war a long time ago. No matter the intensity of my fights, the realism of war hitting me or the horror of death screaming in front of you, you always come back to the battlefield. The names of the brave men that fought right beside you popping up inside your head. Foxholes getting creamed, soldiers losing limbs, screams of agony and tears so heavy they could crush a tiger I. If you want to survive this war, better take your gun and don´t be afraid to charge, don´t be afraid to be too patient. It will save your life.\n\nOnce you entered this world, you can´t return. 10/10","December 27, 2015","true","60.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","5","6","4","2"

Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm are unique games that include a single player that is great, but not at the same level as its multiplayer.\n\nIn multi-player You can play as several diffrent roles, a few being: Commander, Squad Leader, Rifleman, etc., and all of these roles play a unique part in building a strong team. There is 1 Commander per team and this person's job is to manage and try to set up strategies that his whole team can agree on and execute with together, fire artilery, and other such things. Squad Leaders can act as moible spawn points for squad members, give commander marks to fire artilery on, use smoke grenades, and other things. Rifleman are the most common role, as the majority of the server's players will be rifleman. You have a bolt action rifle (as Americans in Rising Storm, it is possible you get the M1-Grand instead) and your job is to take the objective points and be supportive and coopertive of what your other team members ask you to do.\n\nWith game servers that can cap at 64 players, massive maps that can take 10 minutes to run across, one of the best atmospheres ever to be designed, great balance with roles and teams, a great community that works together as a team, and with the toping of higher-end graphics, Red Orchestra 2 and Rising Storm can easily be one of my favorite games and easily my favorite FPS.","December 31, 2013","true","236.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's really based more on knowledge than raw skill. You don't need to have good twitch reflexes (though they can help) to be a good player. You need to know how the maps work, where your team needs you most, when to move, and how to not die. Generally one side attacks and one side defends. It is crucial to coordinate with your team, especially while attacking. There definitely seems to be a strong correlation between how many knowledgeable guys on your team are using microphones and how often your team wins. If somebody says "Everybody needs to bonzai charge the cap zone NOW!" you'll be surprised how quickly 20 or so Japanese soldiers are screaming into the smoke straight into the cap. You don't need to use a mic yourself, but you'd be wise to listen at least some of the time to your teammates advice (don't worry about the crazy guy that is screaming nonsense at his computer).\n\nOverall it's a very fun game but has it's problems. Single player is pretty much non-existent if you care about that, the movement feels a little clunky and can be awkward when a player interacts with the level geometry. They unnecessarily split up the game into "action" and "realism" modes when it's obvious this game caters to the realism audience. It lacks some polish, but it's not a $60 huge budget game so that's to be expected. There could be more maps and more vehicles, especially the latter which have been neglected since the first RO.\n\nAll in all, a good game at a good price.","March 20, 2014","true","79.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I was killing Russian after Russian, with Das Deutschlandlied blaring in the background. A Russian peeks his head out of the trench in front of me, and stares me down. I stare at him back, and he ducks. I toss my Stick of Germany Glory, or what you like the call a 'grenade' in the trench, and he pops back out and shoots me. I lie there, dying, but a smile on my face. I look at him one last time, and utter my last words, "All hail Deutschland." He blows up, body in the air, and I lie there in glory of the battlefield.\n\nEDIT: Might as well make this a real review.\nSo first off, I got this game since a couple of my friends played this so I thought "Why not, let's see why     they love this so much." This is no regular, main stream WWII game just like Call of Duty. If you're looking for a game like that, just walk away man. Just walk away. Red Orchestra 2 features a game mode, popular by the community, called Territory/Realism. It's basically a campaign between the Axis (Nazis) and Allies (Red Army/Russians) where you fight for territories across Russia into Stalingrad, hence the name, Heroes of Stalingrad. The realism part is self explanitory. Bullet drop, one shot kills (with bolt action rifles), etc. I always play this mode whenever I'm on, although, a lot of good servers for Terrioty/Realism are full, it's worth finding a good match. This also includes Rising Storm, which is basically the same thing except it's in the Pacific, where it's Japanese vs United States. Offering new maps, it also gives a larger variety of weapons. The United States are given the flamethrower (or as I prefer to call it by its origional German name, fammenwafer). I don't really need to explain that, do I? The Japanese Squad Leaders and Team Leaders spawn with a katana. That's right, a ♥♥♥♥ing katana. With that, they could 'bonzai', which is charging the enemy head on, katana out and ready to kill some dishonerabu Americans (just a joke... don't get butthurt) and now has pretty much became the official Japanese tactic against Americans.\n\nTL;DR ---  In all honesty, I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. If you want a challenging, realistic WWII game, this is for you.\n\n11/10, would serve the Third Reich again.","March 23, 2015","true","18.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","9","14","8","0"

I haven't enjoyed playing a game this much in a long time.\n\nYou can play as a Commander class which can call in recon planes, mortor bombardment, arty etc. You can be a squad leader which allows your squad to spawn on you and you can mark areas of the map for the commander to call in a bombardment. Or you can be a soldier, choose your "class", rifleman, assault, sniper, machine gunner etc. There are a good amount of weapons, the maps are large but easy to learn and they are open enough to using flanking tactics.\n\nRising Storm as amazing. Here is just one tiny part on one map during one match that took place:\nI was playing as the Allies and we were fighting fiercly to take an enemy position that was heavily fortified. As we approached our Squad Leader marked the position and told the Team Leader over comms it was marked. The Team Leader confirmed, calling in a recon plane and dropped arty. Everyone took cover as we watched explosions landing just ahead. Round after round hit, dirt flying up in the air.\n\nOur next wave of reinforcements had arrived and were crossing the river to meet us on the far bank closest to the enemy. All of a sudden we hear "Arty has been cancelled, push forward" and with that everyone got off their bellies and charged into the trenches, bayonets ready, itchy triggy fingers awaiting the huge onslaught, expecting heavy losses.. and.. and... nothing. There were no enemies. None. Where were they? We quickly moved throughout the fortified position, taking positions facing outwards for any glimpse of our opponent. After taking a nice spot behind some sandbags that were stacked up with a good view hole to see into the jungle, I took a knee thinking what they could be planning.\n\nI hear movement in the jungle, then I hear screaming.. "Booonzaiiiii" I take aim and start firing. There are so many, rifles pointed our way, bayonets fixed and they are charging right at us screaming. I pop off a few rounds and take down two of them when I see an officer with a sword leading the charge. I Line up my rifle to take him out, and I die. They had surrounded us and a few of them broke through on my right flank, rushing through the trenches swords swinging and bayonets stabbing everything in their way.\n\nI respawned and the battle continued. With moments like this happening all the time, I don't know how this game isn't more widely talked about. Incredible experience that everyone should try.","October 10, 2014","true","110.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

After all of this times spent on WWII gaming (as it is a historical interest of mine as well) I had lost a bit of my interest. Red Orchestra, however, reinvigorated my passions by delivering a realistic and unique shooter. Although the single player campaign is fun to play, most gamers will find the most fun in the multiplayer. The game blends class-based skills and teamwork on detailed maps that will bring you as close as you would want to be to the Eastern Front. Sometimes you will experience weapon jams, suppressing fire, fatigue, and non-lethal wounds that you cannot simply walk away from. For example, if you are hit in the leg while sprinting from cover, you will slow down or even stop, simulating something that most franchises cannot. I will end the review with some simple advice: If you are looking for another Call of Duty, don't look here.

The combat is so much better than most other FPS games I have played. I have been craving a game that allows you to blind fire since I played Killswitch on the PS2 . And this game allows you do just that! you can throw grenades around corners without exposing yourself either. Machineguns overheat and if you continue to fire the barrel warps and you have no choice but to change it. Commanders can use binoculars to spot and call in Recon which flies over head and shows where the enemy is but only on the map and the commander has access to Mortars, Artillery and Rocket Barrage to wreck havok on the battlefield.\n\n\nThe suppression system is very well made  shoot some bullets at an enemy and his aim will be too shaken to aim back and then you can deliver the final blow. Now that is realism! The lack of vehicles for a game thats been out this long is the only thing I really hate about this game at this point. I wish they would make more, but I have heard that they are not making more as they are working on a Vietnam game can anyone confirm this as I really wanted to see a Tiger in this new Ro2.\n\nThe bullet drop works well but there are few maps where you can use anything more than 400m\nI have only been able to use the Bullet Drop to effect on several maps. I can only really vouch for the Axis as I have only played for the Axis on the Eastern front and Allies for the Pacific Campaign. To the Pros and Cons\n\nPros\nTHIS IS A TEAM GAME\n- Blind fire System that acutally works.\n- If you don't use teamwork you will fail!\n- Tank Battles are awesome.\n- Leveling system is great.\n- Mulitple game modes\n- Working Bullet physics\n- You can yell Most Dishonorabr in Rising stormand everyone will start yelling similar things and laugh with you USUALLY\n- You can Nut shot people with bullets. (you can tell when you see a cracked acorn icon for a kill message)\n\nCons\n-Japanese get a knee mortar that can get really annoying after you get killed multiple times.\n-Finding servers with ping near you is a MUST if you are to get a kill as you must aim in front of someone to compensate for the high ping if you are to kill anything if you do join a high ping server.\n-The grind gets really old after a while.\n-2 types of tanks for each side in the Eastern Front side and a 1 transport.

It caught my eye on the Steam Store when it was on sale. I have always had a facination with WWII and this game looked perfect. I could imagine myself as a Russian running into a room with my PPSH and unloading the entire clip into a whole squad of Germans. Or as a German Sniper laying on the edge of the map picking off unsuspecting Russians with my Kar98 (Scoped). But what peaked my intrests the most was the Pacific Theater never before had I seen a game where the devs acually were devoted to making a game as realistic as it is and before the EA,Orgin fanboys say it, yes it is more realistic that Battlefield. All the weapons are pieces of their time, and most of the attachments are legit too, and the classes the same (*sigh* exept the flamer). The battles are amazing, teamwork is a must and a good team leader can change the tides of any battle, and if all of your team is cooperating\nyou will completely wipe the other team, although battles can last upwards of 30 minutes each (which is my biggest complaint) they are almost always satisfing and when you lose you can almost always say.

You get a vague feeling of really being on the eastern front / pacific theater. You will need both your eyes and ears when playing this game. What is even better is that the game is like a living museum in some way. Weapons sound different, depending on their kind and even their distance. After a bunch of games, you might be able to hear if there are enemies or friendlies shooting near you. Then there are the amazingly detailed tanks and buildings. Some maps can look familiar if you've seen some Stalingrad documentaries.\n\nThere is a steep difficulty curve. You can't just go Rambo on everyone.

A LOT. However, thats some of the fun as you learn to master covering from fire and tactics. I've got to say, after playing this game thus far, no other FPS I've ever played other than those of the ARMA franchise has come even close in terms of scale, realism, and strict reliance of teamwork. Yes, it might be a much slower paced shooter than your generic run and gun game, but the slower pace only helps to reinforce the realism of how war isn't all about just shooting the bad guys, but about tactics and teamwork. Without strong teamwork, you will almost always lose. The guns are all balanced and realistic with an interesting distance adjuster, and the way that the class system works, you always end up with a balanced team instead of a team filled with only snipers and machine gunners. The gunplay is fantastic, and the fact that there is a cover system, something sorely lacking in most modern military FPS's, was just icing on the cake for me. If you are even remotely interested in a historic military game or one based more on tactics than trigger fingers, then this is the game for you.","April 29, 2014","true","14.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

And let me tell you this, our team had just defended Burma and was on the attack, we would lose no matter what but the Commander (A 25 year old American who was pretty cool.) ordered us to grab our swords and ready our bayonets. And so we did, what occured was this:\n\nWe banzai charged on the map Hanto at the near start and owned the allies at the trenches. After doing so the Commander was happy but since I was the squad leader I spoke into the voice chat "We're going to lose this, so instead of a single heroic stand at the very start let's make the heroic stand at their shoe tips!" And then the Banzai charge began again untill we made it past the other objectives, to D, and then killed around 5 of them brutally with another charge.\n\nAfter this we ran out of reinforcements because of the multiple failed banzai charges on D so with the commander and I being the only ones left we hugged each other while holding grenades, ran into their base and blew up in the face of their commander and lost the game. This, this is why I recommend this damn beautiful game.\n\nThough the American side gets boring the Japanese side will probably boost your morale and probably racism but whatever, and you will fight to the end. With excellent mechanics of Red Orchestra 2 there are no flaws, get this game now.","June 21, 2015","true","208.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","5","7","3","0"

Shogun 2 got me interested in the Japanese and i started having a look at its history. By early 2014 i was all the way into the Imperial Japan era and i wanted to play a game based around then. Now there really arent many games set in the pacific which is a shame since its such a interesting era and theatre of war but i managed to stumble across a game called Red Orchestra 2/Rising Storm. Now when i played this i was blown away....Not only did it not spam you with DLC it gave me both expansions for free! it was realisitic! proper bullet times and factors for each gun! each gun made in perfect detail with all its flaws and advantages as in real life, never has firing a type 38 arisaka or a kar98k been so entertaining in a game for me. even after playing all the maps hundreds of times it never gets old because the community is so fun.\n\nThe team work is like no other. this isnt battlefield where everyone runs off doing their own thing people work together in this to achieve victory its simply amazing!. The native voice acting for the Germans Russians (American voices are pretty bad though) and Japanese is simply outstanding the japanese even have a Kansai dialect for added detail, its absolutely insane the gun play is awesome the push and shove of battle feels real. even when you see a flash 200m away and half a second later your dead does it not fail to impress. the realisim is done perfectly in time with the fun.\n\nMost of the few Pacific War games are rather historically innacurate without mods. But rising storm Nails everything prefectly (except for the SNLF having later date uniforms when they should have green but a mutator fixed this as well as being put on some servers) This Game to me is more immersive then a movie like saving private ryan its, i literally get excited to just jump on and play every time. I have even put 100 hours into the Steam Offline mode wih bots it never fails to entertain me.\n\nSo people coming here looking for a reason to buy i guarantee you Rising Storm will not disapoint you if you want something realisitic and historically accurate. and for the fun its just so worth it.\n\nMUTATORS/MODS I RECCOMEND TO IMPROVE EXPERIANCE.\nBeta SNLF: This changes the Khaki SNLF skins to the correct for timeframe Green Naval Uniforms. this is literally the only gripe i have in the realisim department so i reccomend this if you want to see the Japanese Marines in the correct garb (the previous is also correct but like late 1945 not 1943)\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626136687\nfor server operaters use this version: or if you are a user you can request your server admin puts this on the server\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/beta-snlf/downloads/beta-snlf-v104-21616-client (alternate offline play version)\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/beta-snlf/downloads/beta-snlf-v104-21616-server\n\n(server version for server operators)\n\nPACIFIC ARMOUR: Tanks dont appear in RS unless you have this mod. mainly for offline play but there is a server operator option.

Performance issues, balancing issues and all sorts of problems you can get from rushed launch. Tropwire took there sweet time to fix most of the lingering issues, but now I am saying with full confidence that this is one of the better FPS on PC. The whole experince is unique and shooting feels way more different then the likes of COD or BFs.\n\nThough community is small, but all of them are dedicated which results in faboulus gaming sessions. It has a slight learning curve and game dosent explain well the fundamentals. You need to learn it through Youtube are spending few hours in the game messing around. Basically it plays more like the RUSH mode from Battlefield series.\n\nSP and COOP portion of the game is as good as non existent. Game is regularly updated with new maps. Even a new DLC was given for free with slight restrictions. All in all I am a highly satisfied with the efforts of DEVS to improve the game.\n\nIf you like FPS games with a slight learning curve and teamplay then this game is ideal for you.","November 25, 2013","true","45.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If you're looking for a single player experience, look elsewhere.  That being said, this game is amazing.  RO2 is a modern looking, realistic WW2 FPS.  Though it started out with more than a few bugs, it has been updated and polished quite nicely over the years.  Before I get into details, I'll also include that you will get to experience both the Eastern front as well as the island battles of the Pacific Theatre, easily one of the most unique features about this game.\n\nGameplay is quite fluid.  Moving around the map, crouching, sprinting, all feel quite good and realistic.  Sounds, weapons, chatter, maps, and skins all create an immersive atmosphere.  The horrors of war will be on full display the minute you step into a populated server and you're going to love every second of it.\n\nThough the learning curve of RO2 is moderate to high for most, which I personally love, this is ultimately a game of realism.    You will most certainly die from one well placed shot, but you can also do alot of damage with one placed shot yourself.  Though, one man can do quite a bit of damage to the enemy if he knows what he's doing, this game stresses teamwork tactics and sticking close to your squad mates.  Getting into cap zones, and picking guys off from there is the name of the game.  Working with your teammates and coordination is key.  You won't find much in regards to Rambo'ing around the map as it simply won't work unless your an experienced veteran.\n\nEasily one of the more realistic WW2 shooters out currently.  I've played this game since launch, and over the last few years, the game has made great strides towards being very, very good.  With the most recent update, which included the release of the MG42, battles on the Eastern front feel about ten times more intense.  Worth every penny, would buy again.","September 30, 2014","true","128.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

It is still an immersive, exhilarating experience.\n\nThe Russian uniforms are slightly more brown than grey. The German uniforms are slightly more grey than brown. They both bleed red explosively when you shoot them. They both fall suddenly with similar gurgled screams.\n\nNo other game has made me feel sorry for the people I kill, whether friendly or enemy.\n\nIf you like fast paced, run and gun shooters with plenty of explosions, don't get this game.\n\nIf you like waiting around, watching the same patch of landscape for a few minutes, changing position, repeating these steps, hiding from artillery, and then screaming through the most intense 10 second firefight of your life, get this game.\n\nIf you like quick respawns and CoD style self healing, don't get this game.\n\nIf you like having to bandage your wounds (if you manage to survive a bullet wound, a rare occurrence), or having to wait for your guy to calm down after a salvo flies past his head and reduces your comrade to mush before you can see properly again, get this game.\n\nIf you like hearing men cry for their mothers as they bleed to death beside you, get this game.\n\n\nThere's ballistic drop. There's an ammo counter that only keeps track of magazines. Your MG will overheat. You will be killed from 150m away without knowing how. You will feel tense whilst playing this game.

But I don't think it's down to noob team members. Being in an objective zone is always brown trousers time. It takes courage to go in.\n\nI mostly play the Red Orchestra maps, because both sides have bolt action rifles and there's a lot more urban warfare. To me it feels grittier.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the Rising Storm maps.\n\nIt's just that playing as America, any amount of Japanese charging is terrifying, especially when you thought they were part of the bushes.\n\nAnd playing as Japan... well, even I was screaming as I watched my hands melt in front of my eyes, cursing the flamethrower and every member of his family, past, present and future.","November 11, 2014","true","37.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Where do I even begin?\n\nIf I run from cover to cover, I get shredded by machinegun fire. If I peek my head to get a clear field of view, a sniper somewhere hears angels chanting and pierces my brains, splattering the wall behind me.\n\nThis game is hard, nerve-wracking, and not for the faint of heart or anyone who is used to 1337 720ºNoscopesnipah kills.\nThis game encourages camping.\nThis game is like a severe parent punishing your every mistake.\nThis game is absolutely, bloody good. Get it if you can. Play it if you have the time. I know I only clocked around 20 hours on it, but I would play the hell out of it if I could.\n\nSo, let us get serious.\n\nHardcore shooter with cover mechanics. Somewhat glitchy, too, but I don't find it unplayable by any means. Servers are typically 32 vs 32, with bots usually filling any slots left (which gives both teams an impressive amount of cannon fodder), so you know the battles are going to be big.\nWeapons lack variety, which is to be expected considering it aims to be a realistic, historically-accurate game. And, bear with me here, said weapons are unbalanced. Remember COD 2? A semi-auto rifle will never, or hardly ever, one-hit kill, which is understandable for gameplay reasons. Cue Red Orchestra's Elite Rifleman class, armed with a semi-auto rifle: it has the same power as the humble breech-loading basic rifles, but is semi-auto and holds more ammo. Then again, it's limited to, say, 3 per team. Same happens with the LMG, with astonishing firepower, or the SMGs, which can make mincemeat of anything at close to medium ranges.\n\nHowever, this not only means that there are, naturally, players better equipped. Those same players have responsibilities: take a marksman rifle and go lone wolf scoring random kills? Wrong. Use it to clear the way for a capture point, to find the machine gunner who is tearing your team apart. Squad leader? Stay alive to allow respawning on you, make judicious use of your smoke grenades. So on and so on. Teamplay is king. Armies win wars.\n\nThe cover system works well. You can sprint crouched. Grenades can be gently dropped instead of having to throw them at the ceiling hoping they stay in the damned room. Gunplay is smooth, graphics are really good, sound and effects immersive as it gets. What more is there to ask for?\n\nAh, yes. Satisfaction. The satisfaction of out-aiming an enemy 120 metres away. Looking at the top right corner, those seconds lying in wait, thinking "Did I get him?". Then you see it. You hit him spot on, you got the kill. You may get pistol-whipped to death a second after, but getting a kill in Red Orchestra is as satisfying as it gets in a shooter.\n\nOf course, there are shortcomings. Optimization is poor. Some glitches can get a bit annoying. As I said, weapon variety is low and you may get relegated to basic Rifleman for rounds on end. You will get frustrated. The game is punishingly hard. But in the end, this is a top-notch shooter. Go get it. Go get 'em.","January 7, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game takes place during Operation Barbarossa around the time the Germans started losing the battle of Stalingrad. You are a soldier, neither sides matter to you, only that you take land from the enemy, and kill the enemy. If you're not doing either of those, you'll probably be shot by your Squad Leader or even Commanding Officer. This game pretty much has a knack for historical accuracy as there aren't rarely used weapons, nor are there outlandish maps, all of the maps are based off of actual locations and battles that took place in the war, the community is alive and well and making more maps for the game. As well as immersion mods to add to the depression you may get when playing alone. This game absolutely captures the experience of WWII, it may not be a complete simulator, but it's very immersive, you feel as if you need to live, your character will cry, your character will bleed, your character will curse the enemy, your character is you, (Not really.) The immersion factor of the game is absolutely what I love most, the fact that you can really feel like you're living in a trench for ten minutes, and then an artillery shell lands in that trench ending your poor, insignificant life is just something very poetic about this game. There aren't many words to describe it, but this truly is an art piece. Red Orchestra was a good title for this wonderful game.\n\nI rate it 10/10, not a joke either.","June 10, 2013","true","314.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Nothing special. 90% of populated server run realism, so no hud so if you're new you're screwed, and everyone has most guns fully leveled or w/e and most servers limit classes so you're usually stuck in as a rifleman. It reminds me of COD 2 because the rifle play is good (but stuck as rifleman for map after map, isn't that fun after a while) and that game was fun, but its slow loading (UE3 isn't this slow but this game loads slow even on a nice rig) and limited servers makes it really hard to get into.\n\nI'd still buy it as its really one of the few that is a decent FPS now-a-days but I come from Arma, CoD, BF, CS, etc FPS's so if you havent played RO1 or dont like realism/hc all the time its probably not a great fit unless you want some challenge.\n\n7/10\n\n","January 16, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

RS and RO2 is one of the best and unique gaming experiences out there.  Especially, if you are sick of the soft, call of duty, battlefieldish type of games. This game is more realistic and teamwork orriented than the average AAA, fps on the market.  It takes some time but not a lot to get decent at it, but once you do understand the games core conspects you will enjoy yourself.\nThe value of Rising Storm is immense, if you buy just RS, you will also get the RO2 mp for free as well and considering it goes on sale fore $5 that's alot of entertainment to be had for the money.   Overall and unique, fun and cheap game, if you but a little effort in to learning how to play; then you will be reward with tons of fun.","July 15, 2014","true","456.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The weapons looked like   games I'd purchased   several years ago.  The boot camp wasn't challenging at all and each weapon station didn't give you enough time to get a feel for the various weapons available in the game.  (The first boot camp I ever played  via the first  Medal of Honor  was better); however on starting the campain proper I was really pleased to find this was  a very well made game.  It's not  Call of Duty, but   there was somthing about the game mechanics that drew me in.  Weapons are   fairly basic, my favorite being the sniper rifle.\n\nIf you love run and gun games this isn't for you.  You  need to  use cover sensibly as often as possible or you'll keep dying.  When you die you  take over one of your squad mates (in singleplayer).  It was well worth  the full price I paid for it.\n\nLooking forwards to some community based mods for this game.","March 7, 2012","true","67.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like World War 2 themed PVP first person shooter simulations, this is a good game to get.  This game is slightly less realistic than the original Red Orchestra, but the graphics and the gameplay is whole lot better.  The single player is WW2 combat like the original Call of Duty and Medal of Honor games.  Comes with a separate Singleplayer campaign game.\n\nYou can play as infantry or tanker only.  The tank combat here is better than the original Red Orchestra, because the tank crew bots listen to your detailed comands that you can give, and you have more viewports to use.  The tanks models looks limited to the Panzer 4 and T-34 in the few original tank using maps.  As Commander, you can issue useful commands to your teammates.\n\nServer Maps can have AI bots filling out the team roster.  You can command the bots squads to take objectives, defend objectives, or go to locations but not give artillery targets.  The bots are slightly more smarter, and have better shooting skills but still no substitute for real players.\n\nRO2 multiplayer servers are German vs Russian maps.  With the Rising Storm DLC you have access to Japan vs American maps, (Using the Flamethrower is fun).  Has great multiplayer maps and a single person campaign.  A lot of multiplayer servers have bots filling in for real players.\n\nThe single player campaigns are German vs Russian or Russian vs German, it is a separate game bundled with your purchase.  The single player game is sort of buggy and cheats.  You can also use console comands in the single player game to complete the achievements there.\n\nHas Steam Achievements with badge trading cards. Has Steam Workshop with modding community making new maps using the included Level Editor.\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJE70ZhdvE8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vNzUrc4w_c\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEExgqiKtl8\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Orchestra_2:_Heroes_of_Stalingrad\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad\n\nhttp://www.gamespot.com/reviews/red-orchestra-2-heroes-of-stalingrad-review/1900-6341622/\n\nhttp://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/27/red-orchestra-2-rising-storm-review","February 20","true","35.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

For example, the map "Bridges of Druzhina" is probably 3 kilometers long but only .5 wide. Same with Red October Factory and Spartanovka. More "square" maps should have been implemented!\n-Too much coordination between team members needed to enjoy the game. It's pretty common to have one team stomping on the other because a new player has taken the commander slot and refuses to give it up. Same with the squad leaders who are supposed to be mobile spawn points but you always have people getting their heads blown off.\n\n7.5/10\nCould have been better, but it's a WWII shooter and I'm a massive fan of that genre so I can let it slide.","December 13, 2015","true","320.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

No fanboyism - it's actually the best the genre has to offer (ArmA 2 is more of a milsim and PlanetSide 2 is a F2P MMO, so they don't count). Epic. And buckets of it. If you search for a game that's both fun, challange and greatly mixes realistic, slower engagements with "twitch shooters", that's your game. Depending on the server you choose, you can play more like WW2 CoD or Day Of Defeat (arcade mode), or more like... well, ArmA? (Realism and Classic modes).

I asked mike to make a run to the commander. He only made it 10 feet before he was shot. we threw nades then i popped smoke and we ran to the red cross station we didn't hold out for long we fell back to the next point i only had 2 mags left.

A truly great game.\n\nPros:\n+ Good game mechanics (squads, objectives, team tickets (lives), artillery support, etc.)\n+ Death in 1 or 2 shots\n+ Accurate weapons usage\n+ Tactical reloading does not magically result in full magazines\n+ Chambered rounds are taken into account\n+ Ability to roughly check how many rounds are left in a mag (more than half full, etc.)\n+ Weapon resting (including sideways along window frames, walls, poles, or wherever)\n+ Breathing rate directly (synchronized) affects vertical weapon movement\n+ Suppression/morale system\n+ Well-designed, fairly large maps\n+ Accurate hitboxes\n+ Bullet drop, not sure how accurate it is though\n+ Some tanks and APCs\n+ Ability to manually bolt, increases gun feeling, and allows to keep looking through scope\n+ Only scope area zooms in, not the entire screen\n+ Can switch to iron sights on some scoped rifles\n+ Can swap hot barrel for MG\n+ Can disable focusing zoom, and if you choose to keep zooming enabled, it is very minimal\n+ On some servers, friendly player names are only shown at very close ranges\n+ Can choose to manually reload when empty\n+ Can change firing mode\n+ Nice, actually recorded, gun sounds\n\nCons:\n- Recoil isn't quite right\n- Unrealistic sounds of bullets passing by (fake swoosh sounds or, less commonly, extremely quiet "cracks". The suppression system helps alleviate this con, though).\n- Punkbuster (but many servers now run VAC instead, so you don't need to have PB installed)\n-Would be much better with positional voice chat","March 27","true","177.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This claim is far from unjustified. This game is super-immersive ( Even more so when using the Immersion Overhaul Simulator - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/IOMMODplayers ). Realistic graphics, along with good ballistics, suppression affects and an amazing atmosphere of constant danger give this game an edge over other WWII games of the genre.\n\nNo biased Point of View is another big tick for me. No more evil Germans or unbalanced mechanics that impact how the Germans play. This is a big step forward and a great way of seeing how the front was ACTUALLY LIKE. No more of the lies made up about the Germans by the victors.\n\nGameplay strives to be as realistic as possible, while also catering to beginners. Most weapons take one shot to kill, but are balanced by accuracy and weapon sway, etc. Tank gameplay is extremely impressive with full internal views and great combat elements.\n\nThe AI are not easy to say the least. They are only slightly less competent than a human player. There are also always servers with lots of bots to practice with.\n\nCons:\n- Flamethrowers...\n- Banned From Session\n\nFlamethrowers on this game are fairly unbalaced - and only one nation, the US, gets them. They can be taken out from range, but will take down several people before dying. Not the biggest issue, but definitely something to look out for.\n\nThere is a possibility that you will be banned from a server for the rest of a session (battle) for having high ping. There is no proper way of fixing this, just join servers with good connection unless you want to take your chances on other servers.\n\n*P.S: I play on Oceania ( servers and setups may vary )","April 1","true","31.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

The intensity and detail of the game, from the weapons, uniforms/equipment etc, more than make up for the lack of large maps and variety of vehicles that Ostfront had. RO2 itself is a pleasure to play and in my experience has a very mature community. It's always fun to jump into. Once on a good server, the combat and communication between team mates make for an intense, exhilirating and/or frustrating (Depending on who's winning) scenario. I recommend this game for anynone who likes gritty and unforgiving WWII shooters where no ammo counter or crosshair is present (Unless you play action mode), the realism mode is where this game stands out. The free aim system is a big plus, and the detail is excellent right down to the animations and weapon models, which even have adjustable iron sights. The implementation of recoil, and the suppression system work very well to reduce the effectiveness of a pinned sniper and spray and prayer types.\n\n9.5/10 - Great Game, especially when you have a squad of friends on the go.","January 2, 2014","true","622.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The Japanese get the have Katanas and the Americans get the have flamethrowers which is a pretty fun boost from Red Orchestra 2.\n\nThe graphics are a bit outdated, maybe similar to Call of Duty: World at War, but it is still better than that game. Also, if you have a screen resolution of 1360 x 768 like myself, you'll have to play the game in a windowed mode because of the screen resolution being stretched etc.\n\nThe modes are also really good because you can go to 'Realism Mode' which is like 1 bullet death, so it's realistic.

This game doesn't go as far as the ARMA series in terms of realism, but instead does it perfectly, combining realism and fun. Ontop of the exellent stature the game has, the community is amazing, where people actually play the game for it's realism instead of "run and gunning it". What makes this game different, is that you have to take cover. No other game will you find people actually taking cover, because of the realistic bullet dammage. For crying out loud, you even get PTSD and shake when you're under fire for too long. There is unrealistic game modes, but the game's main focus is realism.\n\nDid I mention free maps and guns dlc from the devs every year... This is my all time favorite multiplayer game.

Know what is on the mind of a WW2 frontline soldier/officer/commander on the German/Russian side? Well, here's your chance. the most realistic WW2 FPS game you can find is here, not your regular fps where you can get what you want, here, you will get what they give you, for instance, do you think the germans made enough mp-40 submachineguns for ALL their soldiers? NO! only officers could have them, so you my friend, is probably gonna get a kar98 bolt action rifle. THE REAL MAN'S RIFLE, to see if you are as skilled as a german soldier. Think of it as a real life challenge: most players have rifles that require skill to shoot, some have submachineguns, some have lightmachineguns and just a few have sniper rifles, so running may be a good idea, togheter with hiding on cover, but keep in mind that you are not alone and team tactics are the welcome, togheter with officers using microphones to tell you the strategy.

This claim is far from unjustified. This game is super-immersive ( Even more so when using the Immersion Overhaul Simulator - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/IOMMODplayers ). Realistic graphics, along with good ballistics, suppression affects and an amazing atmosphere of constant danger give this game an edge over other WWII games of the genre.\n\nNo biased Point of View is another big tick for me. No more evil Germans or unbalanced mechanics that impact how the Germans play. This is a big step forward and a great way of seeing how the front was ACTUALLY LIKE. No more of the lies made up about the Germans by the victors.\n\nGameplay strives to be as realistic as possible, while also catering to beginners. Most weapons take one shot to kill, but are balanced by accuracy and weapon sway, etc. Tank gameplay is extremely impressive with full internal views and great combat elements.\n\nThe AI are not easy to say the least. They are only slightly less competent than a human player. There are also always servers with lots of bots to practice with.\n\nCons:\n- Flamethrowers...\n- Banned From Session\n\nFlamethrowers on this game are fairly unbalaced - and only one nation, the US, gets them. They can be taken out from range, but will take down several people before dying. Not the biggest issue, but definitely something to look out for.\n\nThere is a possibility that you will be banned from a server for the rest of a session (battle) for having high ping. There is no proper way of fixing this, just join servers with good connection unless you want to take your chances on other servers.\n\n*P.S: I play on Oceania ( servers and setups may vary )","April 1","true","31.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

If you want a relistic game go and buy ArmA 3 - A3 has an upcoming WWII mod - or Squad.\nRising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 offers you a variety of tactics, weapons, roles and maps.I could just write two sentences saying this game is good, but no, I'm not lazy.\nI've been playing Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad since it's release, it was a mistake to sell this Steam account with the game two years ago.\nThe game features two fronts: Easter Front - Germany and the Soviet Union\nPacific Front - Empire of Japan and the United States\nWestern Front - Germany and the United States (Heroes of the West mod)\nThe game features basic infantry- and armored warfare - armored warfare only avaiable on the Eastern Front.\nMultiple roles, including Squad Leader and Platoon Commander.\nWhy do I love the game? Great community\nHuge variety in weapons\nDetailed tanks, immersive tank combat\nLeading roles are great to play if you know how to play them.\nThree types of voice chat - Global/All, Team and SquadI only recommend Red Orchestra 2, I don't recommend Rising Storm, it's nowhere close to being enjoyable, the game only features two maps, where the japanese camouflage is effective - Hanto and Guadalcanal. The other maps simply too open to give the japs any benefit, Rising Storm is incredibly asymmetrical and unenjoyable for the japanese players.\nI'm not a big fan of spoiling the content of game in the reviews, just go ahead and buy this game, you won't regret it, unless you want a realistic WWII game.","February 9","true","683.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/axlevice/recommended/35450/","axlevice","Axle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/axlevice/","319 products in account","DayZ indoctrinated me to the realistic shooters out there. Red Orchestra 2, while not as robust as the ArmA series, has nailed so many aspects of the gritty, unprejudiced realities of war that these soldiers had gone through. Machine guns prey on on potentially dozens of enemies if caught unaware. The sheer imbalance of close quarters and the impractibility of being in the open for even short amounts of time prove how fragile your life is. Squad tactics become important and smoke grenades, explosives, and covering fire become essential when taking objectives. Artillery can wipe out nearly all the members of a team in just once strike and seeminly good cover can prove fatal when a stray bullet pierces your helmet. When one life is so meaningless you cherish it for some reason, nobody wants to be the one to cross the machine gun nest's field of vision, or the sniper that is watching for your slightest mistake. Your life becomes valuable despite it seemingly not being so. Your participation in capturing objectives can make or break a game, however. Teamwork and leadership wins the majority of games through good squad leaders and a good team leader. Red Orchestra 2 is a realism shooter for the hardcore, but is accessible to anyone just looking for an intense, but good time.\n\nIts not perfect. Certain angles with the prone system are abused, but this is very, very rare. Sometimes the cover system in the game messes with your ability to bandage yourself (they share a key) and you die a needless death. This is slightly less rare, but it doesn't happen often. Also against players the cover system is rarely worth it. Exiting cover in the system to shoot is often a sure way to die quickly as you expose an awful lot of your body while doing so. Melee combat is often not perfect and for some reason servers that display 50 ping in the browser sometimes gives everyone 200 ping in game. These are all very minor, however, and do not affect the game much. Its certainly less annoying than certain things in Call of Duty, Battlefield, and ArmA. Counter Strike Source (or GO) is much more polished but that is a very different game so I wouldn't compare the two.\n\nRising Storm, the standalone expansion (you dont need the base game to play) is like a whole new game. The large, open areas and bombed out ruins of the Eastern Front are replaced with the dense jungle of the Pacific Isles and despite some similar sized maps, the battles are closer and even more intense. It becomes even more brutal despite the absence of tanks as it becomes very clear, very quickly, the Japanese forces are at a disadvantage. The force multiplier the Allies rely on are provided by larger machine gun belts, semi-automatic rifles, powerful sub-machine guns and support weapons, and flamethrowers that can take out entire squads with a bursting swath of fiery death. This forces Japanese to abuse their mechanics of knee-mortars and banzai charges or overwhelmingly lose any given match. Often, banzai charges make the difference between a win and a loss in a match and melee combat is a much more common occurance than in RO2:HoS, further amplifying the brutality of the close quarters, unfair, Pacific Front.\n\nTogether you have two amazing takes on war that doesn't feed on its own ridiculousness or cheesy one-off matches of quick entertainment. The campaign system gives some meaning to playing on your favorite servers with your favorite communities and following the lead of a good squad leader (while contributing) is a sure way to make some fast friends. The community is very mature as kids tend to avoid the difficult learning curve of the game but once you get into it, learn the maps, the guns, and the basics of realism, it will really grow on you. Listen to the veterans and you'll stay alive.","November 25, 2013","true","151.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A great multiplayer system, hosting is simple and joining is simpler than it was in the first game, maps support up to 64 players total, allowing for 32 players on each side playing as either the Axis or Allied forces.\n\nOverall, this game gets a score of 8/10 due to a somewhat flonky controll system and the occational framerate and bug issues. Some aspects in the game should've been more polished such as the cover mechanics and bullet damage.

Bandages are scarce.\n-Good cover system, similar to Call of Juarez's allowing you to aim where you wish over or around cover. I don't use it too much honestly.\n-Suppression system: If you keep fire on an enemy position (even just firing over them, not necessarily hitting them) they will not be able to move or fire back.\n-Slightly annoying-to-use squad/command system, which is neglected by players a lot unfortunately\n-Very good acoustics(?) on the weapons. As you move to or from a source of gunfire you can hear the change in sound. At a distance of a few hundred metres it sounds as though it could just be ambient (non-player controlled) noise recorded at a shooting range, which is nice.\n-Great voice acting, unfortunately there are only two different voices per team. That isn't much of a problem anyway, they don't get stale.\n-Decent music, although it's only ambient.\n-Extremely good tank gameplay, especially if you're coordinating with a friend(s). I haven't used the Soviet T-34s, but there are 4 positions in the Panzer IV which can either be operated all by one person, or as a group with other players. There's only one tank-only map I've played so far, which I thought there should be more of.\n-Lastly, due to a combination of a few previously mentioned things (acoustics, music, gameplay, voice-acting), the environment is one of the things I like most aside from gameplay. On most maps it's very gloomy and dark, with massive barrages of artillery and dog-fights overhead. This combined with the dreary layout of the map (abandoned buildings, train-lines, trenches, etc.), ambient music and constant gunshots makes Stalingrad feel like Stalingrad.\n-Rising Storm is mediocre, not many people playing it in Australia either.\n\nNot a whole lot of negatives to the game, movement and some other actions can feel a bit clunky at times. There is a losing bias to the Axis I've noticed recently, I have a win/loss ratio of 0.08 (~80 wins, ~900 losses), yet a kill/death ratio of 1.1 (not implying that's a good ratio, just that it's not terribly [game-losingly] bad). I'm not sure whether this is due to the Axis being inherently underpowered, or veteran players always choosing to play as the Allies. I'd therefore recommend sticking to the Allies if you're new.","June 23, 2014","true","138.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

Quite the learning curve I find but once you get the hang of it, this can be one awesome game. Gravity has effect on the bullets, but you can adjust sights to compensate for distance, you can rest your rifle against a window sill or door ledge to stable your firearm for accuracy, controls inside the tanks are in view, and there's effects for when you're under suppressive fire. You can also level up classes and firearms to become more efficient. Not terribly unlike real life, after all you can condition yourself to have better stamina, get more in tune with the firearms you own, and you can also get attachments/modifications for some. Hoping that in Red Orchestra 3, they incorporate the possibility of jams. In real life however, if you maintain your firearms, malfunctions will be few and far between. No gun is 100% reliable, though. Not even AKs or Glocks.\n\n\nJune 23, 2014 - Since an update they made in April, I have been unable to play the game, and many others have also been unable to join servers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flash9130/recommended/35450/","Flash9130","Flash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Flash9130/","226 products in account","So, after playing the multiplayer of both Rising Storm & Red Orchestra 2 for about 170+ hours and reaching max level on Rising Storm while also reaching a decently high level on Red Orchestra 2, I can say that this game is excellent.\n\nThe game is extremely unforgiving, you often die in pretty much 1 or 2 hits. If you are hit anywhere but your limbs, you'll probably die instantly. The only times you really have a chance to survive is if a bullet hits your arm or leg. If you somehow don't die instantly and you're wounded, you can use one of the 2 bandages you are given every spawn to patch yourself up. If you do not bandage up in time, you might bleed out depending on where you got shot. It is very important to move carefully by going from cover to cover and checking your corners.\n\nI really like the fact that there's a max player limit per class, for example, there are only allowed to be a set amount of "Assault class" players, same goes for machine gunner, marksman, squad leader etc... The only class that is really never full is rifleman. Which makes sense, obviously.\n\nIt feels extremely satisfying to fire a round into someone, the enemies often drops quite realistically which makes for an immersive experience, the suppression is also done just right in my opinion. It fits the game perfectly. It really starts to mess with your aim when you're supressed, your aim will be completely thrown off if you are suppressed by full auto fire of an MG.\n\nThe game requires a great amount of teamwork, if you want to succeed you are going to have to work together with your squad leaders and your commander. It is very important for squad leaders to stay alive as they serve as spawn points for other players within their squad. Squad leaders also have to mark locations for artillery, and they are also equipped with smoke grenades which are good for helping your team push up. The commander has the most important role in the team, he or she must give orders to the other squad leaders and fireteams and is also capable of calling in artillery on the locations marked by the squad leaders.  Communication is very important in this game, if you have an important role at least.\n\nThe graphics are also pretty good for a 2011 game, it runs on Unreal Engine 3 and the art style overall is fairly appealing. The gun models look great and the first person animations are nicely done. Texture work is mostly good, models look really nice, effects (like smoke, fire) look very good, too.\n\nI must warn you though, this game has an insanely big learning curve. If you are not used to these types of games I can almost guarantee you it'll be very difficult for you to do well. It took me quite some time to get good at the game.\n\nFramerate wise, it varies. Some maps are better optimized than others, though overall performance does seem good.\n\nAll in all, if you want a fairly realistic and unforgiving world war 2 shooter, then this is for you.\n\nOh and one more thing, don't play the singleplayer campaign. Just don't.","October 5, 2014","true","365.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very realistic and challenging gameplay with no room for silly mistakes. Player can take a role of one of few different infantry classes (like rifleman, team leader, sniper, tank hunter etc. ) and also can be a part of a tank crew. German Panzer IV and soviet T-34 are very good addition in the game and both are very well modelled and detailed. Weapons behaviour is very realistic and weapon ballistics/accurace is also well executed.\nRising Storm will take the player to the Pacific Ocean theatre of WW2.\nUS Army and Imperial Army are extremely well done. Using US superior firepower to take stategic locations in places like Iwo Jima or Saipan is a great experience.\nIn my opinion the thing that makes this game so great is definitely the Japanesse Imperial Army. They do not posses such good equipment as US forces, but they rely on their unmatched feriocity and fanatical determination to fight to the last man. Booby traps, ambushes and other treacherous tactics are in common use. Watching an entire squad rushing into enemy position with swords/bayonets/grenades and fanatical screams is something that could not be forgot - Banzai Charge is an unique gameplay mechanic of the Imperial Army.","July 15, 2013","true","19.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This game captures the feeling of the era. The game does, however, have a steep learning curve, and is very unforgiving to new players.

Quite the learning curve I find but once you get the hang of it, this can be one awesome game. Gravity has effect on the bullets, but you can adjust sights to compensate for distance, you can rest your rifle against a window sill or door ledge to stable your firearm for accuracy, controls inside the tanks are in view, and there's effects for when you're under suppressive fire. You can also level up classes and firearms to become more efficient. Not terribly unlike real life, after all you can condition yourself to have better stamina, get more in tune with the firearms you own, and you can also get attachments/modifications for some. Hoping that in Red Orchestra 3, they incorporate the possibility of jams. In real life however, if you maintain your firearms, malfunctions will be few and far between. No gun is 100% reliable, though. Not even AKs or Glocks.\n\n\nJune 23, 2014 - Since an update they made in April, I have been unable to play the game, and many others have also been unable to join servers. Do not waste your money on RO2 or RS until it starts working again, it will only give you headaches.\n\nNov 24, 2014 - The issue seems to have been resolved, the game is running well again.

Yes.\nNow let's see why.\n\nCommunity: Mature  - you won't see any twelve year olds running about depicting their sexual fantasies with either of your parents.\nHelpful - i really can't remember a single game related question they refused to answer\nActive - EU servers are usually full\nI'll give the community a strong 10/10.\n\nGameplay: Now this one is more tricky.\nThe mechanics are not always at their brightest, especially when vaulting over obstacles, but there are a lot of good stuff to make up for that. My favourite is the scare-o-meter suppression, which pretty much forces you to stay in cover, when you would order your soldier from your comfy seat to stand up and take a chance at killing your shooter. Also, folks tend to criticise the hitbox system in the game, but don't buy that. The hitboxes are fine.\nTalking about hitting targets, it must be said that tank combat is quite engaging, as it requires at gunners and tank gunners to aim for weakspots (engine, crew member, etc), and not just any random part of the hulking metal deathmachines.\nAlso, your soldier does his best to put his weapon against anything to improve accuracy, which is pretty cool (e.g. against trees, if you can lean in close enough).\n\nGameplay-mechanics: 8/10\n\nNow a bit more about the "player" part of the gameplay. The game has a few game modes, but folks play territory most of the time, which is the good old capture the zone and hold it stuff (either as double conquest, or attack/defense), so if you are a tdm/dm type of guy, you'll have very limited fun here. Let me repeat, game on most servers is about taking and holding objectives. The game also features a chain of command, with one platoon commander, and a number of squad leaders, the latters providing extra spawn points, marking artillery targets, carrying smoke grenades, etc, whereas the platoon commander is in task of managing the assault with aerial recons, artillery fire, coordinating the squads. You may say that's basic stuff nowadays, but the thing is, RO 2 community takes this stuff very seriously, and on the most popular servers, you'll only find the veteran players filling these roles, giving the real magic of the game.\n\nGameplay-player stuff: 9/10 (folks can be unforgiving with unskilled players taking vital roles, I know I am. Note: unskilled player taking vital role is not considered a newby in need of help, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ruining at the very least his squad's game, maybe that of his whole team.)\n\nFinally, let's discuss the graphics.\nIt's not your late 2015- early 2016 game, but it does a really good job, although my old r7 tends to have some glitches from time to time with the colours, but there's a "one alt-tab solution" for that (in my case, can't speak for others).\n\nAs I'm not that eager to ♥♥♥♥ my pants about graphics, and I might by a bit biased when talking about RO 2, i rate it 9/10.\n\nThat's all. It's a 9/10 for me, and that comes with a recommendation.\n\nEdit: A few additional notes: The roles are available in limited number, so there's a good chance for players with older computers to get stuck as basic infantry. That's not so bad, as those with better weapons will do the heavy lifting, and, as a newby, you would most likely only get shot by those who know the map as the back of their hand, no matter what weapon you have. Later on, when you get to know the game, you'll easily stay alive long enough to fetch some decent weapon if you really want to. Still, by then you will not feel the undenyable urge to do so, as the game is not about kills, but teamwork.\nAlso the game features a levelling system, but it's nothing overpowered, it only unlocks a few new weapons and equipment, and makes you slightly more adept in combat (e.g. less prone to suppression, although don't expect to go rambo on an mg because of it).","January 10","true","651.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

When a few shots was all it took for you to have to start all over again, unlike games like CoD, where you can take three times as many bullets as you would in real life? Tripwire Interactive renembers, and as such, made a brutal but fair shooter. Red Orchestra 2.\n\nIf you can get over the steep learning curve and how brutal this game is, you'll enjoy it. I recommend you read a guide on Steam and start playing on Action mode with a few people; going through the tutorial will also help.\n\nSimply put, this game is set in WW2 and it is an FPS (Duh). You are pitched in battles with Axis Germans against Allied Russians (Or Americans against Japanese, if your playing Rising Storm). It's a team based shooter with different classes and highly realistic weapons. (Tired of high powered rifles to not kill with one hit, meaning automatic rifles always come out on top? Well, not in this game!)\n\nThe great thing is, Tripwire Interactive constantly pumps out free DLC with maps, weapons etc. And, they also listen to the community! (The main reason why I love TI) The game is constantly being improved, so if you do find a bug, simply report it to TI and it should be fixed pretty soon. If you enjoy shooters or World War 2 games, this is for you.\n\nGood points:\n-Great Gameplay\n-Realistic Functions+Gameplay\n-Pretty good graphics+Textures\n-Great Community\n-Responsive developers\n\nBad Points:\n-Steepe learning curve\n-It's difficult (Which is good for some, like me)\n\nFinal Verdict:\n9/10\n\nGameplay is great and realistic, graphics pretty good. Overall, great game. Highly recommended for fans of shooters and for ones who want to re-live the horror and brutality of World War Two.","November 25, 2013","true","112.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

So why are you wasting my time reading my review, and not downloading it! On a more serious note the game is a WW2 simulator utilising the Unreal Engine for brilliant graphics and decent FPS. There is a role in the game for everyone eg. Machine Gunner, Assault, Marksman and even Tanks for you to use (and abuse... perhaps... not really recommended). It is team based and action packed, in no other game can you experience something so close to the reality of the brutal house to house room to room fighting in 1942 Stalingrad (with funny German accents as a bonus). As it is free, there is really no reason for you not to give it a go and install it! (Ignore the singleplayer btw its pretty laggy (unless of course it is your duty to unlock every single achievement, in which case go for it!)) In conclusion this is a hardcore WW2 sim with realistic environments and brilliant teamwork!

Then there is class ranking; the more you play a particular class, the class will gain ranks (there are three class ranks). Each rank in a particular class may give you a new weapon, but will make the character look more 'battle hardened'. Then there is weapon ranking, at level 0 your weapon will have no attachments, no perks and will be completely stock in terms of upgrades. When you reach level 25 just by playing with it, you may(or may not) gain an attachement for your weapon e.g. a bayonet. Also your weapon handling will increase, which means your reload, bolting action and ADS will be faster. Your weapon will also get a more 'looked after finish ' to it. Upon reaching level 50 you may get an attachement, you handling will increase again and you weapon will  have a shiny polished finish.\n\nI have taken my time to explain the ranking system as many people have asked me about it ingame.\n\nRealism mode for multiplayer seems to be very popular, unlike the classic mode. Realism is the 'hardcore' mode of the game. It is by far the best mode and obviously the more realistic. Bullet damage is increased and there is no aiming dead-zone (as you pivot the direction the bullet will go isn't locked to the center of the screen, if you don't understand you will when you play it). As for servers go they are all very stable, with barely any dedicated Tripwire servers there will always be a server for you. There are usually about 5 or six servers up at any one moment.\n\nCAMPAIGN:\n\nIt has a good campaign which is a good length, split into two parts, the Russian campaign and the German Campaign.\nI have one problem though; the campaign missions are styled like the multiplayer missions, you will need to capture areas just like you do in the multiplayer and you will play on exactly the same maps and instead of live players you play with AI.\nI must commend Tripwire for including this as not many modern games are styled in this way, but it just fails to keep you playing, with no interesting plot I feel the game is weakened by the campaign.\n\n\nRISING STORM:\n\nThe Rising Storm standalone game/DLC features the RO2 multiplayer but set in the pacific with the Japanese and the Americans. I feel that Rising Storm is a much more refined game and stamps out most of the bugs seen in RO2 multiplayer. RS does not have a campaign.\n\nCampaign = 6/10\nRO2 Multiplayer = 8.5/10\nRising Storm = 9.5/10\n\nNOTE!::: IF YOU WANT THE RED ORCHESTRA 2 MULTIPLAYER, BUY RISING STORM, BOTH MULTIPLAYERS ARE PART OF THE RISING STORM DLC. IF YOU WANT THE RO2 CAMPAIGN JUST BUY THE BASE GAME. I DON'T THINK YOU GET RO2 MULTIPLAYER WITH RO2 ANYMORE.","October 8, 2014","true","218.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Another time you will be pinned down by heavy fire in a foxhole with your friends just trying to desperately return fire. The sound design in this game is phenomenal, every bullet and gun has a brutal impact. The recoil is hefty and honest. The ragdolls are immersive especially the death screams and the way the bodies just lean against things just adds to the complete WW2 experience. Seriously addicting game.

A different, more cereberal style than CoD's mindless run-and-gun.  Teamwork matters. Classes are limited and serve distinct roles; vanilla riflemen are equally valued to LMGers and SMG assault troops.  I've never seen a game where players mimic real-world tactics - i.e. even on pub servers cover each other and 'leapfrog' towards the objectives; player pause to allow allies to toss a grenade in the window (instead of leaping in after it, getting tked, and punishing). Even the damage system makes sense - instead of a magically refilling 'health bar'; if hit in a non-vital area, you have a few seconds to take cover and bandage yourself, or you die. A torso or headshot is 1-shot death from any rifle-calibre weapon. Put CoD aside and give this a try.","December 19, 2011","true","45.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But it has some rather annoying quirks about it. ( like all games)\n\nQuirks\n\n-Not many people play RO2 so there is limited servers and even more limited that play custom maps with players. ( the game is not dead!)\n-Almost always it seems the Germans win because most vet players pick Axis every time stacking teams.\n-The suppression effect is a little exagerated in the game. IE; Aiming down sights and incoming enemy fire will cause the    rifle to jerk around uncontrollably.\n- The russians all have brand new very BRIGHT uniforms which the Germans can easily target at range, and even in dark windows.\n- unlike the Original RO, RO2 has very limited tank combat. Only a hand full of combined arms maps and one main tank orientated map.\n- Most popular servers will most certainly pick the following maps. Bridges, Grain elevator, Appartments, ect Over and over again.\n- Spawning is VERY annoying, usually spawning so far behind from the objective it takes forever to renforce your team. and usually a 24 second respawn wave.\n\n\nThe good stuff.\n\n- Excellent detail, weapons loading fireing and tank detail is outstanding.\n- Combat is very fun and as challenging as you want it to be.\n- Ballistics are pretty accurate although I find 200m sight adjustments works best at 100m.\n- Losts to level up on and it doesn't level up too quickly.\n- The maps are very well done and have a great atmosphere. ( dark, cold full of death)\n- sounds are also pretty good however the recently added MG42 could have had a bit more time spent on the sound.\n- the controls are not overwhelming like some simulation games and RO2 is not overly difficult to play. also has a training mode and single player level mode.\n- Graphics are excellent usuing the Unreal engine.\n\n\nI would reccomend RO2, it is very fun and addicitng. The quicks mentioned are not ment to discourage and you will easily forget about them once you try the game. A lot of them have to do with servers.","December 23, 2014","true","170.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That being under fire from a barrage of enemy guns or machine guns, you can feel sucked into the moment. Especially when you have teamwork. It can also get exciting when that happens as well.\n\nAction, is ok if you are starting out, BUT do not keep playing action. Guns do damage like you are shooting people with body armor, like the game wanted to be COD\n\nRealism, where the game is at for sure. It's so satisfying to kill someone in this game. To cut them down with a machine gun is just... mmmmmm. Realism gives the guns power to them, making them feel like an actual gun. I've played COD, and well I still don't feel sucked in to it. Unlike RO2.\n\nIf you want to play this game for the "realism" aspect and teamwork, you have come to the right place. Even in action mode it's still not a run and gun. Just guns shoot like ♥♥♥♥.\n\nPart 2:\n\nNow. It's been a while since the release of it, I understand when people were "butthurt" over the dumbdown of the game to COD levels, However they at least didn't go that far... Thank god for atmosphere. I know how awesome RO1/DH is, they are both amazing. I would so play it if... Anyone else did. :/  While it is nice and amazing to see the insides of tanks, it is actually mostly useless when you can see the stats of your tank on your hud. So that right there is kinda ruined. I'd sooner see more vehicles put in then 1 or 2 fully completed ones put in. However since they decided to model insides they have to keep consistency... Yay... :l\n\nMG42/MKB is talked to death about, to me honestly, MG42 is mostly useless with the ammo count it gets unless your team isn't pooper scoopers and feeds you ammo up your ♥♥♥, and MKB I've found to be similar to MP40 in damage, but can get a scope and accuracy is better. While yes, it is possible to hip fire MG42... You can still do it with MG34 guys, I guess it's mostly because of the ROF people rather not try it as its done in bursts.\n\nOverall, yes, it's "dumb down" from RO1, but doesn't go that far as people have said. There is a lot of stuff still here in the game that is worth playing, that one of them is the atmosphere. Still wished they added more vehicles instead of trying to model insides of everyone... Squandering it with the hud. Anyways come play for the teamwork and atmosphere it's really worth it for that.\n\nRating for me as is, is a 7/10. It just has that great of atmosphere, even if you are playing a fairy spawn mother SL. When teamwork clicks in, yum, could be a 8/10.\n\n\nExtras for those curious:\n\nI am currently level 82.\nLevel 50 MG42\nLevel 50 MG34\nLevel 50 MKB\nLevel 50 G41\nLevel 50 MP40\nLevel 50 PPSH\nLevel 50 PPS\nLevel 50 Kar\nLevel 50 Mosin rifle\n\nHero SL/MG/EA/Rifleman","July 2, 2012","true","160.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You feel like cannon fodder and so you should, you're only a cog in the battle. The teamwork element is there, although often under-utilised. It's brutal, it's frightening and it's refreshing. For the price, you can't really go wrong against some of the other cookie cutter FPS experiences released these days.","January 16, 2015","true","45.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
