"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OctoHat/recommended/396640/","OctoHat","Octopus Tophat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OctoHat/","51 products in account","Towerclimb is the best game I've ever played. That's what I still think after playing it for more than 2 years. I've never played a game as challenging and rewarding as towerclimb. When I first starting playing, I thought I'd never beat chapter 1, but when I finally did, I was ecstatic. I thought I was a pro, who has conquered towerclimb and all the challenges it has to offer. Then the centurial trials appeared. 100 floors of pure insanity... I knew I'd never beat it. "That's just for fun, right? People aren't actually expected to beat this." Hundreds of deaths and hundreds of hours later, I finally reached floor 101. I beat the trials. It was the most amazing gaming experience I've ever had. Being on floor 90 and knowing that I can lose it all with one tiny misstep is the most scary feeling I've experienced in any game. Not even a game like dead space could keep me continuously on-edge like that.\n\nTowerclimb is an emotional rollercoaster that can bring you intense feelings of fear, frustration, happiness, excitement, etc., and the music is a big part of that. The music fits the atmosphere and scenarios perfectly. In the plant-controlled observatory, the music feels as if it's alive, and creeping up on you. In the cold, icey ruins, you can hear just how frigid it is, and you can almost feel the pain from the cold air brushing against you. In the volcanic heart, you can feel the magma boiling beneath your feet, ready to burst any minute. The industrial segmentation plant makes you feel like you're surrounded by technology and traps that are prepared to kill you whenever you get near. Giant worm fights are backed with intense music that really make you feel helpless. But once you defeat it, you are rewarded with absolute silence to contemplate the victory you have earned.\n\nDiscovery is another big point of towerclimb. The game starts with no tutorial, and at first I thought it was a simple game, but I soon started to uncover the layers of complexity by just... playing. I didn't need to look at a wiki or anything like that. Some items took me a long time to find a use for them. I used to think the golden greaves were useless because they made me so fast that it was impossible to control. But eventually, after getting used them, I realized they are the most useful item in the game.\n\nWhen I first found the ♥♥♥♥♥bane, and the game told me a quest has started, I knew I was going on an adventure, in real life. Anytime I wasn't playing towerclimb, I'd try to think about what the next step could be so I could try it out when I got home. For months, I didn't know what to do, until I discovered you can use the ♥♥♥♥♥bane to kill a giant worm to get the next sword in the quest. Then use that sword to get another sword. And finally get the last one, the Ascender. Keep in mind, at this point I already thought I had known everything that was in this game. Now here's 3 new items. I started getting more handy with their own individual uses, and eventually brought the ascender to the 101st floor to fully complete the quest.\n\n2 years later, I still have one more quest to complete, and I try at least once a week to beat it. My experience with towerclimb still hasn't ended...","September 22, 2015","true","28.9"," 114 of 134 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","114","134","11","8"

Great game then, and now it's even better. Very challenging, lots of secrets and discovery, and there's nothing quite like it. TowerClimb is easily one of the best of its genre, and a must have if you're into roguelike platformers such as Spelunky. I usually don't speak in superlatives like this, but this is truly a platforming masterpiece.\n\nEDIT: The game got a HUGE accessibility update. Full tutorial, control tweaking and options, an easy mode, and even some additional content. If you were worried about the brutal difficulty and barrier to entry, it's been way lessened.

Many men dreampt to reach the top... Today, I am one of them.\n\nTowerclimb is a phenomenal platformer with a handful of roguelike qualities, such as random level generation and permanent death. To reach even the end of the first chapter requires skill, dedication, patience, and let's face it: A huge helping of luck. Because you -will- ♥♥♥♥ up. You -will- make a mistake. That mistake will most likely be your end!\n\nBut that's okay! You start with one revive potion! And not everything is out to get you! Almost everything, maybe even 99% of everything, but not completely everything! You'll start out with several supplies, like jump potions and potions that blow up blocks, and one that teleports you within a short range. You can replenish these potions by collecting Golden berries, usually placed in a precarious location, and trade them tower inhabitants such as the Witch. You can also give items to a guy who will craft stuff for you, but he'll charge you for new items that he makes and sometimes he'll give you junk.\n\nIt's so hard to review this game without spoilers, because a lot of the fun comes with exploring the world of the towers and discovering very subtle hints as to the lore of the world. As well, discovering new items, creatures to fight, and traps to overcome can be extremely rewarding from a standpoint of "Am I skilled enough to do this?". The atmosphere is simply as beautiful as it is deadly, which is to say very. I simply can't praise this game enough, and recommend it to everyone who appreciates difficult, yet rewarding challenges.\n\nThe levels change after every 3 to 4 stages, and each has it's own unique theme. Each level has many variations to it that are possible, as well, both in design and gameplay.  It is extremely rare to have an unfairly generated level, and even those can be overcome by conserving and using your supplies at the right times. You will have to manage how many potions you have left, and you'll have to carefully consider climbing routes. Maybe instead of blowing up that block stopping you from climbing up the side of the tower, you can long jump across a gap and find a way. Maybe instead of teleporting in the Ruins, you can find a gust of wind to make you soar to the next platform. It makes you think about the safest route, and it makes you pit risk against reward. Sure, you could go for that treasure chest past the lava pit, right behind that pulsating, hatching beetle egg. But at what cost? Will the reward be worth it, or will it be just another gold berry? Well, maybe I can safely explode a wasp nest instead and get one from there. Or maybe I'll climb the side wall as far as possible and avoid that nonsense altogether, finding an alternative route. Maybe a rat will fall on my head and explode me. Maybe ???? will happen!\n\nThis game has come SO FAR since the Alpha 5 years ago, and even far from the Beta. I am super proud of Davio and Quazi for releasing this game, a game that deserves far more attention and adoration than it is receiving at the time of this writing. So, I'll leave you with this. If you love a difficult and rewarding challenge and won't run away, if you can laugh at yourself when you die, if you can accept that you will make mistakes and will learn from them for next time, if you love discovery and mystery, if you love chunky pixel art and amazing music, this game might be for you. Just two last things, eh kid? If you fall, you di... I mean you lose. And if you see your character go "?", climb quickly! Beat cheeks out of there! I can tell you that from experience...\n\n10/10 would be forcibly cremated again!","September 24, 2015","true","73.8"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","23","24","4","0"

I wasn’t sure if I should pick it up or not for what it is.\nI do love plattformers. I do love the roguelike genre so I figured I can’t do wrong.\nYup I was right. The game’s incredibly fun. I can honestly see myself playing it whenever I just want to take my mind off of things.\n\nStoryThere’s no real story as far as I know.\nAll that I know is that you’re one weak human with an iron will and one goal: to reach the top of the tower.\n\nGameplayKeyboard or Controller. Pick your poison. I’ve tried both and I’m just more comfortable with a controller as of now but that might change.\nThe controls are rather simple. You’re able to walk or run, jump and climb walls.\nIn order to climb up or down you have to cling to it first. That my friends is crucial. That means that you have to press the key/stick against the wall, hold the jump button and hold it while climbing either up or down. As soon as you let go or if you’re not paying enough attention to it you let go and, in most cases, fall to your death. Thankfully there’s an option called invert climb. Basically you don’t have to hold the jump button in order to cling to a wall just press your key/stick against the well.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=591178339\nThe same goes for running. You can choose between holding a set key/button in order to run or if you run by default.\nLet’s talk about jumping. There are two forms of jumps. Jumps while running and while you’re standing still. While running you’ll jump further and while standing you’ll jump higher. So you’ll see you’ll have to make some precise jumps if you don’t want to take a bath in some h a w t lava.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=591177508\nNow onto the potions. You start off with four kind of potions.\nThree blues, three reds, one green and one revive potion.\nThe blue ones allow you to perform one double jump. The red ones allow you kill enemies and to break blocks. More importantly if you throw such a potion down while jumping it’ll give you small boost which you can use to get higher or further. The last one is a revive potion which will revive you once most of the times. I say most of the times but it depends how you die. If you fall down in lava for example that’s it. If you try to impale yourself on some spikes it’ll revive you.\n\nNext stop: items.\nThere are different kind of items. So far I’ve found a sword, a boomerang, crates and so on. I’m pretty sure there’s a ton I haven’t found yet. To make it short: You’ll use most of the items to give you a boost in mid air. So it’s best to experiment what the items do and how you can use and abuse them. The witch sells you some items if you have enough berries for her potion of youth. Or whatever she uses those for.\n\nBerries! No need to drool we won’t be eating those.\nSo far I’ve seen three different kind of berries. Blue, red and yellow.\nThe blue and red ones work the same as the potions. Yellow on the other hand speeds you up while climbing which is pretty neat.\nThen there are golden berries. Those are pretty much the currency in the game and with those you can buy various things from the witch as I said earlier like the potions which you’ll really need if you want to reach the top.\n\nLevel design is next up.\nDepending on the RNG, and how far you come, you’ll find yourself in different kind of levels.\nI’ve had the pleasure to get a lava stage three times in a row. Basically lava will slowly rise and fill up the level so you’re under some pressure to find and reach the exit. The music isn’t any help to not stress you out.\nAnother level I’ve successfully died in I had to control some kind of balloons and maneuver one through a bunch of razor sharp fans.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=592024535\nMy favorite one so far is the water level. Basically you’re able to swim through the stage which is a nice change. You just have to watch out so that no worms or fishes try to eat your face. Fun times.\n\nThat’s pretty much it as of now. There might be a lot more but that’s all I’ve seen as of now.\n\nVisualsDeactivate depixelize. Please do me that favor even if you hate pixels. The game looks so much better without that option. The game looks gorgeous. It maybe could be a bit more defined here and there and might be a bit rough around the edges but overall I’m more than pleased with the looks of it. The combination of the look, controls and the music … For some reason I enjoy every death.\n\nAudioThe music in the game’s just good.\nIt gives you a sense of mystery while playing, is relaxing in some instances and then it pressures you whenever you’re trying to not bath in some lava.\nI especially like the sound effects of the enemies My favorite sound must the hound even though it looks like a dog(e).\n\nWhat else can I say?The Tower wants you dead. Keep that in mind. Not to mention the RNG can be a real pain in the ♥♥♥ but we’re all used to it by now. Well I know that I am and that I don’t mind so called unfair RNG.\nTowerClimb is a really fun game that you can play every now and then either in short bursts or for the whole day. It’s challenging but at the same time rewarding. Just making it to the exit of a level is pure joy … just to find out that the tower decided that you’re not worthy of him and gets you killed in one way or another.\nOverall it's a lot of fun.","January 3","true","1.9"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","25","28","4","0"

I love procedurally generated games, especially platformers, and this game offers a challenge unlike most others. It's never unfair, as all of my deaths were my own fault, so it avoids being too frustrating or annoying. What it IS, is satisfying. REALLY satisfying. Getting past just the first room/area was a challenge, and it felt GREAT getting past it.\n\nThat's not even the first level, just the first ROOM in the first level, and they're always different. One level had rising lava for no real reason, one other had dogs on every ledge, one was full of wasps, and yet I always had a great time. The graphics are both retro and modern (thanks to amazing lighting effects) and charming as hell, and the music is great. I love roguelikes and I play a lot of them, but I think this is one that will stick with me for a very, very long time.","November 30, 2015","true","2.1"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","5"

I've played a lot of platformers. Super Mario games are great, but they're always relatively easy to blow through with little difficulty, and a lot of other games just always mess up small details that makes it not quite that game I'm looking for. Then along comes TowerClimb, and everything is about as close to perfect as it can get.\n\nGraphics:\nI know there are a lot of games out there that have pixel art, but let's be honest here, they don't always do it well, and that's why they don't always look good. Davioware and Quazi really nailed the detail on their game in this category. The amount of detail put into everything is exquisite, and it really makes for some nice eye candy.\n\nFor some reason there's an option for depixelizing the game that is on by default, and I highly suggest turning that off, as the smoothness to me just doesn't look as good in my opinion. Some may like it I suppose, and that's why the option is there.\n\nMusic/sound:\nThis soundtrack is incredible. Once you hit chapter 2, the music hits this level of epic that just blew me away. At times I wanted to just put the controller down and just jam out to the music. Chapter 1's music is awesome as well, but it feels like it's just one level below the second chapter.\n\nThe sounds of the game are incredibly satisfying. Whether I'm slicing into a beetle, killing a dog, or dying for the 50th time, every sound is fitting, enjoyable, and adds that nice little touch to an overall great experience. All of it just feels like it was well thought out and well composed. Top notch here!\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is interesting, deep, and definitely makes one think despite how simple it appears. You are a climber, and you are climbing a tower that many have tried to climb before. You may fail, but you may succeed. Take it from there! Yet somehow there's so much more to it than that, as this tower has some history, and it alludes to it in many different forms. It is almost akin to jumping into the world of The Labyrinth.\n\nGameplay:\nTake Super Mario World. Now add climbing, extra jumps, item hopping, teleporting, and weapons, and you have the controls for this game. It feels amazing to control. The controls are extremely responsive and expect you to be too. The controls are straightforward and easy to learn (with the exception of item hopping, which I suggest learning), yet take a lot of practice to master. Even after mastering the controls, you have to learn how to deal with all the different situations you encounter in the game. since this is a roguelite, there's perma-death, which means you're dead when you die. No checkpoints. No quicksaves. No ranking system to beef you up for your next journey. You start with the clothes on your back and the determination you set out with.\n\nSeeing as how this is a roguelite, there's an expectation that this game is hard, and it is. It is incredibly hard. This game has to be learned. Rather than rote memorization, expect to know how to deal with beetles swarming you, or being dropped into a den of hounds. Or both, since there is indeed an edge of cruelty to this game. There are items to help you through all the terrors of the tower, and they can be greatly helpful to moderately helpful, ranging from gloves that help you run faster to seeds that hold explosive berries and jump berries. All these items can be stored in the inventory for later use or carried on hand ready to be used in some capacity. The items are really well thought out, and the limit on items makes one not feel too overwhelmed with useless items yet sometimes trying to figure out which items is the least useful at the time. Expect to die until you figure out how to use items wisely and be resourceful.\n\nSummary:\nPersevere and the rewards shall be bountiful, as this game really feels great to run through. Climbing up and down the towers is just a pleasure to do, and this is my personal go to game for when I want to blow off some steam. Don't expect to be good at the game to start, and don't expect to find everything quickly. This game will chop off your head, hand it to you, then make you figure out how to eat it. But when you figure out how to eat it, oh does it taste so good! It's definitely my favorite game of the year, and possibly my favorite game of all time.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n","September 23, 2015","true","396.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","2"

Towerclimb leans a bit closer towards the rouguelike side of things - rather than rely entirely on your twitch platforming skills (which WILL be tested), you're asked to plan and assemble an inventory of tools and potions to help you survive, and yes, you can find yourself backed into a corner if you didn't keep enough in reserve to plan for emergencies.\n\nThe SNES-era graphics work surprisingly well, with a lot of shader and bloom effects to flesh out the otherwise straightforward pixel look. The soundtrack especially is excellent. Lots of mysterious, dark, brooding melodies that help drive you on while helping to establish a brooding, oppressive atmosphere. The tower is not a friendly place.\n\nTowerclimb is a very long and very replayable game. A single playthrough will take you through dozens of randomly generated floors, and due to the way that hazards and traps can interact with each other (ala Spelunky), you can end up in some very chaotic situations that require quick thinking to work your way out of. You'll see a lot of death screens before you get anywhere near the end of this, but it's very satisfying every time you clear a new zone.\n\nNow, back into the tower - I've got a few new deaths to meet!","September 22, 2015","true","1.0"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","23","31","2","0"

This game is extremely difficult, but achieving your goals through resourcefulness and skilled reaction is extremely rewarding. The atmosphere of mystery will keep you driven, to find what lies at the top. These graphics are not just another spin off of the worn out pixel genre. The design is fantastic, it could not be any other way. The soundtrack also does nothing but contribute to the amazing collage of really good stuff. I like games with a certain intriguing element to them, and this one hits the nail on the head. Anybody can play, as long as they brought along some patience. If you get frustrated because you keep pressing the wrong button at the menu screen and accidentally closing it, and that just puts you off so much that you're just not in the mood to play anymore, you may need to work on yourself a little bit before you're ready for this game. People have complained that the controls are very inconvenient and don't make very much sense, trust me, they do, and you'll get the hang of it with some practice. Besides, you can rebind your buttons as much as you like in the options, until you find something that suits you. I use a keyboard rather than a controller, and I can operate with as much precision and skill as anybody. Give it a try, you won't find this game short on playtime, and these developers are worth supporting.","November 12, 2015","true","822.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","1"

Now I'm 20.\n\nTowerClimb is a very unique game. It's probably the best kept secret on steam right now actually. It never holds your hand, and every foot gained is a foot earned.\n\nIt's more of a personal thing with me though. Everytime I play I experience something different. Something exciting. Something heartbreaking. You learn about life with every decision you make. You get better and climb higher.\n\nI've read many reviews and heard from many people that this game's controls are too difficult. They've added default controls for xbox controllers and you have a tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know, But there's always so much more to discover. I think if the controls are what hold you back, what doesn't in your life?\n\n\nDeath snapshots are a great way to casually laugh off your failures as well. They snap a photo right as you die and you can look through all your photos and see how you messed up. Or You can just make fun of Henry for being killed by a tumblin' stumblin' rat.\n\nTowerclimb is more of an experience than a game.

Even though it has a few rough edges as far as controller support is a bit dodgy and screen resolutions need work, it gets a total thumbs-up from me.\n\nIf you like Spelunky, you will certainly like this. In my opinion, it takes all the best parts of Spelunky and scraps the rest - namely the ghost that rushes you through every level. Plus it supports up to four player local co-op.\n\nPros:\n+Great pixel graphics, and overall ambience. I mean the mood and sounds are just really well done.\n+No hand holding what-so-ever, and knowledge is certainly rewarded.\n+Really addicting - 'just one more run' kind of thing.\n+It is not super fast gameplay - you take your time, generally, and solve levels like a puzzle and manage your resources.\n+There is alot of game here. There are 2 chapters, and after you complete chapter 1 (20 floors), you can always start at chapter 2. From what I read, completing chapter 1 is many, many hours of invested gameplay.\n\nCons:\n-Controller support needs some work. XBox360 wireless works, but often needs to be rebound and the digital pad does not work right.\n-Graphics options are bad - it needs to make use of the whole screen better.\n-Price seems high, but its worth it\n\nI am in love with this title.

Not because of a heavy reliance on story or art, but because the mechanics of the game and every new thing introduced are just that interesting. Each area you see will kill you in new and interesting ways, and there is just something novel about being utterly destroyed time and time again knowing that you could have done better. This game accomplishes that. Thoroughly. Like, seriously, did you have to make it so that the ledge cling mechanic locks you there specifically when it is inconvenient?\nPlaying towerclimb is like being in a relationship, you'll be up countless nights playing with it. You'll spend countless hours at your job thinking, "I KNOW I can get to the third base area", and you'll spend countless more hours wondering how to do so. You love it yet you want to strangle it.

You achieve this mainly through platforming. There are climbing mechanics, your character can climb on walls and ceilings to get to where they need to go.\n\nThere are a ton of items you can use to survive and climb higher. These items add a very light RPG element to the game and different players will have different preferred methods for survivng the terrible tower.\n\nThe art design look great.

The idea of the game and its unique art style immediately caught my attention. I had been familiar with rogue-likes and different platformers; the original Spelunky is one of my favorite games and I saw a lot of similar aspects in TowerClimb.\n\nI finally made the jump to purchase the game in April of 2015 while the game was still in beta and began playing it religiously. I got a good deal of my own friends into it and they themselves enjoyed the challenge posed by simply Chapter 1. The gameplay feels fluid and reminds me of the classic platformers I grew up loving. Since then, the game has only improved and expanded. It is amazing to look back and see that so many years of work and dedication were put into the making of this game and the same work and dedication that comes from the community.\n\nI am proud to have been a part of TowerClimb in my own little way and hope that it can entertain you just like it has for me.\n\nIf I had to summarize what I enjoy about the game, the major points would be a great soundtrack and the mental challenge it gives. At the beginning of a run, you can take it slowly and space out every jump, but as the game gets more hectic and fast-paced, you really feel your mind kicking into overdrive just to make the precise movements and grabs you need to survive. TowerClimb properly has proposed a puzzle that players feel a desire to solve. Learning piece by piece lets you truly experience the game, but an active community and veterans from half a decade ago are available to help out a novice player.\n\nI would reccomend this game to all my friends and everyone who likes a frustrating challenge that reaps a fulfilling reward.","November 23, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

It will take probably 30 min to reach the checkpoint and 1.5 hours to beat the game starting from this checkpoint. Total game length is approximately 2 hours.\nNo Save & Exit feature\nIt has permadeath\nPixel Graphics\nThis is not a rogue-like game but has rogue-like elements, you should buy this game mainly because you like platformers. I Don't recommend buying it if you are looking for a rogue-like game.\nControls: Scroll down to the Controls & Physics section for the reason why.\nGame description and my experience\nIn this platformer your goal is to reach the top of the tower. This will be mainly achieved by climbing the side of blocks and wall of the tower. There are 46 floors (excluding many secret floors). The theme of the floors change every 3 floors, like 3 snow covered floors after 3 lava maps etc. The floors are littered with blocks, enemies, items, chests, obstacles and sometimes a witch which will sell you potions and lifes or a crafter which will craft items if you hand over multiple items and a small fee for crafting (check out the wiki for item combinations). Resources help you overcome the tower and on some floors it is a requisite. So gathering resources is an important element in the game. Items can change your character's properties like raising run and climbing speed.\n\nOn normal difficulty you will carry one extra life which can be refilled at the witch for a few golden berries, which are spread throughout the floors. The layout of the floors is randomized thanks to procedural generation and keeps the replayability high, creating unique situations and is the major reason why I think this the most replayable platformer I have encountered. This also makes sure the game involves a lot of skill and takes away being good at the game by memorizing the level unlike many other platformers. You will die a lot in this game not because the game is unfair but more like the slightest misstep often result in death.You need to train yourself to become better and reach higher floors. Persistency is key here. It took me 15 hours to reach the checkpoint and finished the game exactly at the 100 hour mark for a game with a length of 2 hours while I'm familiar with difficult platformers.\n\nThis game is about improving your runs which will probably happen with baby steps. The game can play with your mental state for example, when you are closing in at the end and aware that every small misstep means that you throw away all your progress can make an ordinary jump look like an extreme hurdle, it suddenly becomes a scary thing. The process up until the moment you die is fun but never frustrating and can be tense. The reason is because this game is fair, there are no cheap shots. If you die it always is due to your own fault. Once you get the hang of the controls and being familiar at what the tower is throwing at you the experience changes from a slight tense to a relaxing one where mastering the game feels almost zen-like.\n\nReaching higher floors feel rewarding especially clearing the game similar as what Dark Souls does. Level design is not only diverse for its graphical appearance but also for its playstyle. Some floors require fast or slow climbing, avoiding certain enemies, let you use more resources or force you to use certain objects. You are not simply playing the game but rather experience it. Conquering the tower feels like completing an epic journey.\n\nControls & Physics\nThe first thing you will notice when starting out is the, what you will think of, weird control layout. There are multiple functions assigned to a button. For example jump and attack shares the same button, so you cannot attack without jumping. This is done because there will be moments where you have to do a combination of different actions within a short timeframe like jumping, catching an item, store this item, dodging an enemy, Scroll through your inventory to take a different weapon and attack the same enemy. It doesn't work if you are playing twister on your controller when using one button for every action. The control scheme does make sense, although this doesn't seem obvious when you first start out, keep this in mind. This point is repeatedly brought forward in negative reviews, people don't seem to understand.\n\nThe most common things I don't like in general with platform games are lag between controls and the actual movement of the character, the feel if as characters are walking on ice especially when turning around or floaty physics. There are no such things in towerclimb, the controls are responsive, tight and the physics are spot on. You may struggle with the controls due to the layout and it takes a while before getting used to as described above. Another important factor to me is the flow of the gameplay, which is fine in this game, you are always on the move.\n\nSmall sidenote: Using the left trigger while holding the right one and vice versa on a xbox 360 controller doesn't work. Using them simultaneous is impossible. You can solve it by using the cheap software called Controller Companion on steam. Even if you don't buy this game I highly recommend that piece of software.\n\nGraphics, Sound & Music\nThe graphics of this game are minimalistic. You can argue that it is a step back from modern gaming but in the end it comes down whether you like the pixel style. I like the pixel style and also see it more as an art style. Despite the minimalistic approach there is a lot attention to detail. When it comes down to sounds there is great diversity although simple. Every item has its own sound when executing an attack, throwing or picking it up. Enemies have different sounds for movement, patrolling, attacking, being attacked etc. A strong point of this game is its great soundtrack. The musics fits the game very well, from ambient eerie sounds, mysterious tunes to dance music. It has characteristic tracks with great diversity. It really helps setting the mood on a floor.\n\nFinal Word\nI played a lot of platform games in my life from old school titles like the Mario, Crash Bandicoot and Donkey Kong Country series to modern platformers like N+ and Super Meat Boy, but I have to say this is the best platformer I have played. DKC2 was my favorite one for almost 20 years up till the moment I played towerclimb. It is also the most difficult, replayable and addictive one, a true classic in my book and ridiculously overlooked. A prime example of an indie gem lost in a sea of titles on steam. Or like a reviewer mentioned ''It's probably the best kept secret on steam right now actually''. Worth every penny. One thing that can make this game even better is a level editor, including level sharing via steam workshop.

I wasn't sure if I was going to like it at first. Seem very brutal with only 1 extra life (2 with easy mode). However as I watched others play it I knew I had to get this game.\n\nIt's intense.\n\nOnce you know how the control works it becomes an incredible journey. You are a man/woman. You want to climb the tower. You are weak but you are resourceful. You never felt so impowered and powerless at the same time. You feel the clinging to the rock as if your life depends on it. There is jumps that you will question because you won't be sure if the distance is close enough to make it. You will be put in situations that may force you to use an item because it's the differnce between life and death. Often death will come A lot. The controls are tight, the music fits perfectly, and I like the art (pixelated, not the weird filter seen in the trailer).\n\nIt's a good game. Strongly recommend it if you enjoy Spelunky or other roguelike/lite games.\n\nLast, there is a log of all the deaths you encounter with a kill screenshot for each one. It's really cool to see your progress on an interactive graph. If you ever feel discouraged playing this game, take a look at the graph and you can see yourself get better as you play. I still die on lower floors but it makes me want to climb higher.\n\nEDIT: After completing the first section of the game I was pleasantly surprised at the additional content that is available. This game, in theory, has a ton of replay value. There is a challenging game mode aside from the main story that takes everything you learn from the main game and mismatches it all. The result is a 'hard mode' that will really push your skills beyond the limits.

I bought it two years ago after seeing KY from Vinesauce stream it on Twitch, and now that it's completed, I can't recommend it enough. It's challenging, but every mistake you make is your fault. It will take a few runs to get a hold on the controls, but they're easy to master. The spritework is bright, colorful, and detailed, but never gets in your way. The random level generation always keeps you on your toes. There's never a dull moment.","September 27, 2015","true","0.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/396640/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","307 products in account","TowerClimb is a procedurally generated platformer adventure game with roguelike elements. You play as one of many who seek to climb to the top of an ancient stone tower. The path is wrought with many obstacles, including enormous creatures, traps, and supernatural events. Along the way, you'll encounter strange characters and find useful tools to aid you on your journey. As you progress, you'll uncover a hidden lore and various side-quests in order to unlock the mysteries of the towers.\n\nSimilar to games like Spelunky and Just Get Through, the game is split into randomized levels, each with different themes and variations to keep things challenging. Unlike Spelunky, however, the game is slower-paced and is much more methodical. You can't just breeze through with a Teleporter (not to knock its difficult skill ceiling). Ascending the tower is a careful process. Not all paths will get you to the exit, so planning and patience is a necessity. Because of this, the game expects the player to have skill, mastery, and knowledge of the game's finer mechanics as one mistake can cost you the whole run. Also, there are multiple environmental mechanisms that need to be mastered in order to traverse the game's later levels, similar to Donkey Kong Country or Super Mario. In true roguelike fashion, death means an immediate game over -- there are no checkpoints or saves (though revival potions can be bought from vendors).\n\nThe platforming mechanics of TowerClimb are unique. Climbing is simple but important: it allows you to save yourself from falling to your death, and you can even climb across ceilings and the bottoms of platforms. Jumping is interesting in this game as you start with a single limited leap. However, items like potions or special berries can allow you to jump multiple times in succession. Even finer skills of the game allow you to throw items downward to give yourself a boost when there's no other solution. Destructive items double as weapons against enemies and erasers to change the generated terrain. There's other items that modify your abilities, but they aren't necessarily needed in order to succeed. Everything about TowerClimb's gameplay shows a great deal of polish, which is remarkable considering the small development team of two.\n\nMy favorite thing about the game is its atmosphere. I'm reminded of Risk of Rain, where your avatar is only a few pixels tall, and everything else is incredibly vast. It adds this great sense of mystery and wonder to the game. Even from the beginning, as you enter the tower, you face a looming ominous portal bathing you in an intense violet light. On the ground floor, it's apparent that the path ahead won't be easy, even on the first level. Giant rats and hounds look truly monstrous in comparison to you, and the creatures only get creepier as you climb higher. Environmental hazards can be just as deadly. Just about anything can happen in this tower: from lava bursting out of the ground to entire levels filled with water. Compared to how gigantic everything is, you can't help but feel a sense of humility. Exploring the tower can make you feel almost insignificant, and you're reminded of just how fragile you are when braving the many dangers that surround you.\n\nAesthetically, the game is done in a pixelated art style. It uses low-resolution graphics infused with hardware accelerated lighting effects and rendering capabilities, and gameplay runs at 60 FPS. You can choose to play the game with its raw pixel art or with a blended filter that somehow manages to look even more retro. However, the soundtrack really steals the show. The game features more than 80 dark and foreboding tracks. It reminds me of RPGs from the 90's on consoles like the SNES or the Sega Genesis. It definitely makes your quest feel epic, and I can't imagine playing this game while listening to something else.\n\nAs much as I love this game, it definitely isn't perfect. The game doesn't have a tutorial, so players might have a hard time mastering the basics in just a couple of runs. It's a pretty difficult game that will offer challenges to players of all skill levels. It feels awkward to play the game with just a keyboard, so I would definitely recommend using a gamepad. Graphically, I know there are lots of players out there who are tired of the pixelated art that's found in many other indie games. Sometimes, items and hazards aren't easily recognizable and can cause some frustrating ends to runs. However, the development team is incredibly dedicated and is open-minded to suggestions and ways to improve the game.\n\nTowerClimb serves as a testament to how amazing indie games can be. It started as a humble demo on GameJolt and was Greenlit on Steam in 2012. It's taken Davioware and Quazi 6 whole years to develop and polish the game. They didn't put it on Kickstarter or crowdfund the game. Just by playing it, you can feel how much love and labor was invested into this project. $15.00 may feel like a little steep of a price for this game, but I feel that they've definitely earned it after creating such an artistic masterpiece. This game is a great little reminder of how much beauty and depth can be found in unassuming simple things.\n\nTL; DR: For fans of platformers, roguelikes, and good games.","September 22, 2015","true","16.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The main reason i recommend the game is because of the one thing it has that most ither games you see don't: it involves skill much more than RNG, although that doesn't stop any one who has really bad luck, such as myself, who constantly dies from RNGeesus not responding. The game is everything you want from a platformer, and more: mainly so, it's not predictable, you can play through the game for the 100th time and still have a hard time with even the first couple levels. This is also one of the few platformers that is an actual challenge (excluding the "unfair" games, but they are just trolls), as in everything you see on your screen likely will one-shot you before you get a full idea of how to not get one-shotted.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/396640/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","There's a certain look and feel that Super Nintendo games had that gets me like no other games do. It's hard to put my finger on exactly, but I think it was a combination of soft-edged sprites and synth woodwind soundtrack that gave a lot of titles a deep, otherworldly feel. TowerClimb somehow manages to evoke that same sense of depth and wonder while relentlessly murdering me again and again in the most delightful ways.\n\nPart of the unique feel of TowerClimb comes from the mysterious, parable-like setup for the game. There are immense stone towers, people keep trying to climb them, and no one knows what's at the top. You control a never-ending series of unfortunates who challenge the tower, mantling up through floor after deadly floor. It plays a lot like a reverse Spelunky, with your character able to run, jump, scale walls, and crawl along ceilings in search of the exit high above. In place of treasure are tools like crates and springs, and golden berries that can be traded for potions that let you double-jump, break blocks, and teleport.\n\nThere's a lot to discover in the tower, and the pixellated graphics make experimentation essential to figuring out what you're encountering. Enemies may get the best of you the first time you meet them, in part because they can be very unpredictable, but mainly because you might not know what they are at first. You'll run into all manner of plants and animals, NPCs, chests, shortcuts, and more among the randomly-generated floors. Navigating is always challenging given some of the layouts, but your control over your character is very precise and allows for masterful moves once you fully grok the mantling.\n\nIt's hard and you're going to die a ton, but TowerClimb makes it look so good you'll hardly mind. The graphics remind me very much of the old SNES Lemmings port, with chunky detail and silky-smooth animations and bizarre, impossible terrains. Sound design is also excellent, with some very detailed effects and a soundtrack reminiscent of ancient titles like Soul Blazer and Super Metroid in parts. The unexpected nostalgia rush definitely colors my view but make no mistake, TowerClimb is a tight, challenging roguelike platformer with plenty of wonders to offer.","December 27, 2015","true","1.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Together with spelunky, this was a procedurally generated platformer with roguelike elements before it was cool (it's been in development for that long).\n\nDon't expect Spelunky though. Towerclimb is slower, grittier and even more difficult. You have to be even more careful and it's more about evasion than killing stuff. It's fun cause it's difficult and you die a lot. There are several general level themes in the first part of the game (standard caves, jungle, lava caverns...) and special levels (rising lava, water levels, levels where you fly on giant flying plant ballons and more/weirder). And once you finish that, which will take closer to tens of hours, there's chapter two that has more specific (some could say gimmicky, imo a good thing in a game like this) and even more difficult levels, where the gameplay is a bit different.\n\nThe graphics was pixel art before it was cool. It's pretty nice and features some cool shader effects, but I understand people who have enough of that. Also the music is excellent.\n\nTowerclimb has local coop and it is even more fun (and a bit easier, since, unlike spelunky, it's not that easy to harm each other.

Earthy, low-resolution pixel art combined with pretty lighting effects oozes atmosphere. Tight, responsive controls. Lots of level variety, fully destructable environments. Sometimes it makes you think slow and carefully, working your way through environmental puzzles while trying to conserve resources. Other times it will push you to your limit, forcing you to work you way up the tower as fast as humanly possible. 6-player local cooperative (fantastic). Supports split-screen or same-screen, but I have yet to test that feature.\n\nThe Bad Technically primitive. Screen stretching not implemented well, so playing without a black border seems like a no-go (for now). Head-scratching interface choices (Shift-Esc to exit to main menu?), and analog controls that desperately need a dead-zone adjustment. One slip could kill you, you don't want it to be the fault of your controller. The control scheme itself could benefit from few more buttons, as you often find yourself playing twister with your fingers to pull items out, keep them in hand, and use them with care.\n\nThe End Highly recommended for fans of the Rogue-lite genre, specifically fans of Spelunky. This is Spelunky in reverse, but more cerebral, and more suspenseful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Treppix/recommended/396640/","Treppix","Tippex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Treppix/","162 products in account","||| My experience with the game:\n\nOne of the best roguelites I've played to date. I entered into the beta long before this game had a steam release, and being inexperienced with difficult platformers at the time, I was unable to make any real progress through the first chapter (the only 'finished' part of the game at that point). The game managed to keep me going despite my failures, as each death felt fair to me and reminded me that I just needed to get better. Eventually I put the game down, not out of frustration, but out of anticipation for its full release and the day I'd be able to come back with a little more skill. When I heard this game got a steam release, I was beyond excited. While waiting for my steam key from the devs, I dived into the game once more to prepare myself for the new hazards the game would throw at me. After many losses, I finally did it. I beat chapter 1 and finished the beta. I was dumb and thought that meant I had a pretty good handle on how to play the game.\n\nThen I got my full copy and got to play Chapter 2. It makes Chapter 1 look like a big tutorial.\n\nMy god, the game is so much harder on Chpt. 2. You have to plan every movement you make and know how to move quickly yet carefully. Every new area I reached made me extatic. It was such a rewarding experience to triumph over a stage that looked unbeatable before. As long as I've played this game (probably quadruple my time on steam) I have not beat this game as of the time I write this review, but I've gotten very close. And I won't stop until I do.\n\n||| Opinion of the game:\n\nThis game is a ton of fun and a fantastic example of a platformer roguelike. As it stands right now, it's got a ton of content, challenge, and replayability. With many items to find and manage and a new crafting system, there's a lot of incentive to explore the stage a bit and maybe even risk your hide to open that chest that lava is about to overtake. Even for those who beat Chpt. 1 + 2 (Considered the story), there's the centurial trials, 100 floors of mixed and matched biomes and enemies to provide an extreme challenge for those who are looking for it. This being said, the game DID and STILL DOES have some issues that need to be ironed out. The options menu, while previously non-existent, is still a little lacking. It provides basic resolution options & fullscreen, splitscreen toggle for multiplayer, a fast scaling toggle, toggles for shaders and an ugly (IMO) filter that's on by default, as well as a controls menu. I can't find any sort of options for audio, which is fairly annoying considering how simple it would probably be to add them. It's still not a huge deal given you can just use your audio mixer.\n\nThe controls are also something to get used to. A lot of people will prefer controller to keyboard with how many binds the keyboard demands you use (and most of the time, very quickly) but until the most recent patch, the d-pad on the controller didn't really work with the game. That's been fixed, though. Still, be aware that the controls will probably be harsh to you for a short while, but they're far from unusable.\n\nThe visuals are going to probably turn a lot of people off of playing the game, and I wouldn't say that's entirely unfair. Most of the pixel art is extremely low res, your character being about 30 pixels total. Some people are going to find the graphics pretty appealing for low-res pixel art, it's really all down to your preferences. The shaders and particle visuals are pretty as well.\n\nThe game is extremely difficult, but the game is very much fair and does a good job of making you feel like everything that went wrong with your climb was your fault or preventable. RNG not playing a huge factor means your experience and skill that you develop while playing will stick with you and are the main factor in deciding the distance you climb. RNG only really comes into play when you reach chapter 2. The Segmentation plant and Volt Caves can be significantly tougher if the stage layout decides to be a ♥♥♥♥.\n\n||| Conclusion:\n\nA tough as nails but surprisingly fair and rewarding platformer that expects you to plan & execute your moves carefully.\nIt's a bit rough around the edges when it comes to the options menu and the controls, but the few issues that exist are being ironed out. I also forgot to mention the sweet ambient soundtrack. Highly recommended if you're into roguelites/platformers.\n","November 1, 2015","true","57.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","2"

It will make you want to throw your controller across the room and then desperately reassemble it to keep playing more. It's atmosphere and music are big highlights alongside the tense gameplay."\n\nLong form - This game is recommended for persistant, dedicated, patient players. It is *very* old school tough and it does NOT cater to people who are looking for a game with all the (cough) "features" of modern rogue-lites like constant saves, several lives,  and character building mechanics that make successive runs easier; this game gives you none of that. This is 80's-90's tough, at least when you are starting out. Then you play more, get a bit farther, learn what things to watch out for, learn how far you jump and the way you can move in the air. You begin to understand how the monsters and traps work. Then, gradually you can get to floor 8, then 10, then 19 and finally you beat chapter 1. And when you do reach the top for your first time your heart, I gauruntee you this, will feel like it is about to explode with a mix of anxiety, fear, and joy. Then your baloon ride up puts you into chapter 2. You can relax a bit at this point because you can now access chapter 2 content without having to beat the tower again. Which BTW...\n\n**Acessing chapter 2 is done by picking-up the "2" to the right of the Tower Entrance and bringing it to the portal during the new game scene. The skull, if brought to the portal, activates Centurion Trials.**\n\nOn the negative, a downside faced by new players is that It has *very* nuanced and subtle mechanics and "tricks" that are not laid out clearly. Almost none of these tricks are required for beating the first chapter but knowing them and using them well makes the climb to the top significantly safer.","October 2, 2015","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Draxbonai/recommended/396640/","Draxbonai","Liquid Morality","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Draxbonai/","174 products in account","TowerClimb is an action platformer that changes every time you die. The controls are solid, and at first glance, seem extremely simple. However, with enough experimentation and practice, you'll slowly realize a whole spectrum of mobility options available to you. With each technique you learn, new paths to traverse the difficult terrain will unfold before your eyes.\n\nAlthough most of the story is inferred, this is a game rich with music, ambiance and theme. The slow ardous task of climbing could have made for a very dull game, but each floor offers out new and exciting challenges to overcome. Throw in some different random events and variations, and you'll be thankful for just an extra second to plan your next move.\n\nThe core themes of this game are mastery and discovery. Each set of three floors you surpass will lead you to a new "zone" which will have a different visual theme. Watch the trailer if you want to see some of those in more detail. In addition to the mechanics that must be mastered to progress through each zone, each zone has a sort of philosophical theme that you must master as a person, as well. For example, some zones test your ability to plan ahead, whereas others will test your ability to think quickly.\n\nOne thing to note is that this is a very difficult and punishing game. Normally, sessions only take less than 30 minutes. By my first 30, I had died probably 25 times. However, as you learn, you will blow through the early stages very quickly. Reaching the first and only checkpoint takes about a 30 minute session, once you've mastered the controls and concepts.\n\nCurrently, there is no way to save any progress inside of the Tower. Once you unlock the checkpoint, that's it. People have suggested a save/quit feature, and we may see it in a future patch.\n\nRegardless of whether another checkpoint is added or save/quit gets added, I still fully reccommend this title. There is so much to enjoy and there are tons of unlockables that take quite a bit of effort to achieve.\n\nEasily one of the best features is the local co-op; this game is a blast if you have some friends around to play it with.\n\nIf you've read this much of my review and you're on the fence about making the purchase, just buy it. This is one of my absolutely favorite video games ever made, and I know I've been talking about it non-stop for the past three years.","September 27, 2015","true","29.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Im serious! That's literally all this game is about! The experience whilst climbing the tower however is unbelievably satisfying and I have to admit i never though i'd see myself replaying this game again.\n\nThe game is kept extremely simple. Simple controls, simple UI (I think all there is is that menu on the left that displays your current inventory, items etc) simple shop/npc system (All ive seen so far is some guy asking for stuff and a witch selling you potions/items) and simple goal (Get to the top). In fact, there really is no reason to look at a wiki or guide for this game since everything is so simple to figure out (Or that could just be me).\n\nI think one thing the game does very well is making everything your own doing. I dont know how to put it. If you fall to your death/get mauled by a dog/burn in lava/ dismembered by a trap/ punctured by spikes and all sorts of other things, its entirely your fault. In retrospect, it is a really does feel like an achievement when you actually do make it out past a level without dying. Very little is left to chances and alot of it is to do with skill. That's something i found enjoyable.\n\nIn terms of content however, im not exactly sure. Im not one to look into wikis and guides cause in my extreme minority opinion, looking at a guide or wiki destroys a very large part of playing the game (Figuring out stuff!). With that said, ive only seen very few items variety, 2 special level events (Lava and a worm thing), about 4 to 5 different map biome/layout/type, 2 NPCs and 1 special door (Path of exiles shortcut). I dont know if this was planned to make the game remain as simple as possible or not but it's very likely that im still missing out on a ton of content such as secrets and future levels (I believe I've only made it up until 2.5k feet).\n\nI guess the best way to make a comparison for this game is to say it's upward spelunky with less content and more tears more skill. Either ways, im pretty sure this game is worth the 30RM/10$ i paid for it. At least im pretty darn sure it's better spent on them then SOME other games...","November 29, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

Now, 3 and half years later, and with 400 deaths to learn from, I can safely say it's been one of my favorite roguelikes since.\n\nIt's got many things in its favor: the danger is everywhere, but you get plenty of ways to deal with it; the controls are smooth and fast; the different areas are all quite distinct, but also predictable enough that you should be able to learn how to face them. Perhaps the only problem is that, due to the randomized platforms, you might eventually find yourself in an "unwinnable" situation if you wasted all your jumping potions. But even that shouldn't happen once you manage your resources well.\n\nThe music and visuals are also well crafted, and the design is pretty cute.

I originally bought the beta and I've been playing it for a little over one year and I'm still not bored of it.\n\nTrying to set my bias aside, here are some pros and cons about TowerClimb:\nPros:\n- Replayability: TowerClimb has probably the most replay value I've seen compared to most dungeon crawlers, rogue-likes and similar games. Every time you play you get different events, you discover to new areas and you die in a variety of fantastic different ways (105 different deaths to be exact).\n- Aesthetic: There are a lot of pixel-art oriented games out there, especially in the genre of platforming, however TowerClimb does it quite well above and beyond the rest. Using a blend of visual effects and pixel-art you get a wonderfully crafted world with complete consistency.\n\nCons:\n- Controls: While TowerClimb is great, I am curently at a stand-still with the controls. Even after mapping the controls to a controller--GCN controller in my case--I am still not quite happy with them. Over all you've got probably 12 different keys needed to play, for example: 3 for potions, 3 for inventory, 4 to move(possibly 5 if you re-map jump) along with the run key and item-store key. So the controls can be a bit of a mess a first, but they are re-configurable with up to 25 different profiles, so there isn't too much of a problem once you've finally settled in.\n\nMy overall score is 9/10. Controls aside, TowerClimb is too fantastic to pass up.","September 26, 2015","true","33.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play a pixel man (or rather, series of ill-fated pixel men) attempting to ascend a 100-floor tower. Of course, where gravity would generally work in your favour in Spelunky, climbing UP a maze of deathtraps makes for a fairly different experience.\n\nIt's an excruciatingly hardcore game. It's permadeath, and where Spelunky gave you a health system, roughly everything in TowerClimb will eviscerate, bifurcate, detonate, devour, or melt you upon contact, whereby you had better still have a revival potion on you if you want to continue. Apparently the game is divided into chapters, but I've never made it past the first one. I get the feeling I haven't made it even halfway through the first one. That being said, the random levels make for good replay factor and the hazards change up pretty regularly as you progress. Just don't expect it to be as forgiving as Spelunky.\n\nOnly real complaint is lack of a pause function, you only get to take a breather between floors.","October 11, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The amount of love and hard work added to this game is astonishing. The gameplay mechanics are very detailed when climbing through  the procedurally generated towers. The coolest example is when you get a blast berry (bomb essentially) you throw it at some spikes on the ground they literally break into 5 shards you can use as a throwable weapon. Also, the enemies are quite interesting anf bursting with personality when facing them. Although the pixel art can be somewhat overdone nowadays it does have it's own style and flair with it's interesting colors. And I cannot forget when climbing these mountains you literally have this sense of urgency to NOT look down.. I literally felt like I was on top of a mountain and was about to fall off of it and funny how it's just a simple 2D game. This game is truly a masterpiece and needs more love than it currently deserves. Only thing I ask for is daily runs or something this is a very addicting game and probably better than Spelunky in some ways.

Towerclimb forces you to use fast reflexes while travelling a quite perlious tower. There are enemies that you encounter, with loads of creative or straightforward ways of killing. Tons of secrets, and more ways to die than I would have thougth possible. The core of this game is the most polished piece of work I've ever seen.

Dripping with otherworldly atmosphere, aided largely by an awesome low-fi soundtrack. Puzzle platforming at its finest (and deadliest). That's how I'd describe this unique little (huge!) game, but that wouldn't even come close to doing it justice.\n\nAs you might've read from other reviews, the controls take a while to get used to. You might call it the first big challenge of the game. Thankfully, you can map them however you'd like, and after a few deaths you'll begin to develop a particular instinct for it. I play on keyboard, so I can't speak to the issues people are experiencing with gamepads-- but I can say that on keyboard, the only barrier to mastery is your own skill. One of the first lessons you'll teach yourself is when best to hold the run button. The answer, unless you're very skilled, is rarely "always". Taking your time, planning your route and using all items to your advantage is the key to success.\n\nOnce you've mastered the controls, the real challenge awaits: 100 floors, no saves. That's Chapter 1, anyway. Each floor is themed to a particular 'biome', and each biome contains its own set of enemies and challenges. Scattered around the levels are various items you can use or store for later, such as jump berries or crates. The levels being largely destructable, sometimes you must use your collected arsenal to jump larger gaps, blast a path through the terrain, or kill enemies that stand between you and the exit. On top of this, special 'events' may trigger upon entering a new level. I won't spoil them, but suffice it to say you'll never quite know what to expect on the next floor!\n\nA quick word on the graphics: What you're seeing in the screenshots is NOT how the game can look at its best! By default, for some inexplicable reason, there is a filter called 'de-pixelize' being applied. If you want the best experience, immediately toggle the 'de-pixel' setting OFF in the graphics options! I don't know quite what they were thinking when they added this, as it wasn't in the beta, but I think it makes everything look like a bad SNES emulator. The sprites were designed and work best as pixel art; the player character and various enemies you'll encounter have very minimalist sprites, but the de-pixel setting blends and smooths their edges in a way that looks quite ghastly to me. Maybe this opinion is a product of playing the beta for so long without this option, but I don't think so. I don't like the filtered look on my SNES games, and I don't like it here. It somehow manages to reduce the details, turning crisp graphics into wet goop. Don't use it, you won't miss it.\n\nIn summary:\n*Challenging and rewarding gameplay\n*Beautifully rendered (as long as you switch de-pixelize off)\n*Incredible, moody soundtrack and effects\n*Difficult to master, and may prove frustrating for more casual players, or those who struggle with platforming\n*Best suited for keyboard play, but gamepad support is currently being improved based on feedback\n\n\nFor how long it has the potential to keep you engrossed, TowerClimb is well worth the price, and I was satisfied with my purchase even before it came to Steam and received a ton of new content!","September 26, 2015","true","20.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I lost my beta key from ages back and emailed him on the off-chance that he still had it, and he got right back to me with the info and a new steam key. Give this a look if you like challenging, fun games.","October 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Wow, really? I didn't know having a main character being slower than the average cripple with mental disabilities and NO EQUIPMENT WHATSOEVER made a game epic. Now, I get that roguelikes are somewhat based around the idea of "Huh, what's this do? *BOOM* *Insert cussing here* You're supposed to learn from death.  But really, when the UNSKIPPABLE tutorial which takes about 20 minutes to complete AFTER you know what to do starts for the 5th time and you've done nothing but charge into the first level and die, and you've wasted 9/10ths of your time on the tutorial and spent two hours with no progress whatsoever, you'll probably not be very happy. It's supposed to be hard, but when I'd rather beat super meat boy, IWBTG, or Cat mario (take your pick) BLINDFOLDED then finish the 5th level in a game more than 40 levels long, you're not doing it right. This game is worse than sonic boom or sonic 06, and that's saying something.","May 28","false","0.3"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","10","2","6"

In the inventory you have to press CTRL to switch items per example. The tutorial then asks to place a crate, but items are automatically thrown away when you release the button, so you have to hold the button or the item will be thrown. To place the crate on the ground, you have to throw it upwards, which is a strange solution but alright. Then I get a weapon and I am supposed to attack with it by sprinting and jumping at the same time (???) It just all feels so wrong, the hotkeys chosen, the way they need to be executed, so much feels wrong, im sorry. I rather watch someone play it than play it myself.\n\nAlso why does the 30seconds intro play every time ?\nEdit: You can close the intro with pressing "X"\n\n@Devs, you really need to rework this control system, its a total mess and breaks all conventions of what people know about controlling a platformer. Its strange, complicated, unintuitive and makes me want to stop the game before ending the tutorial. Keys are somewhat rebindable but these are mostly that can not be fixed by changing keys.\n\nTowerclimb does simple things wrong that Mario did right 20 years ago.\n\nLet me know when/if it is reworked and im changing the review no problem, but I currently can't have fun with it.","March 23","false","0.5"," 1 of 19 people (5%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","5","1","19","2","23"

The game doesn't start in full screen.  At certain points ESC will exit the game rather than the context you're in (like a menu).  Worst of all, the control scheme is arcane and confused despite decades of great examples to draw on.\n\nThe market for games is incredibly saturated at this point and you can find free flash games that do everything right, so I find it difficult to recommend a game (even an interesting one) when it lamely leaves barriers to entry that, for $10 - $15, could easily and should have been eliminated.","March 6","false","0.2"," 2 of 22 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","2","22","2","5"

There is no character progression (as far as I observed), no overall growth or goals (aside an album of death types to complete), and once you understand the basic jumping patterns, it all feels awkwardly sterile and repetitive.\n\nAs a secondary complaint, the pixel-style graphics, while charming, are a bit muddy and have a fairly limited color palette, leaving a number of enemies and objects very difficult to tell apart.\n\nThe music, however, is truly excellent.","September 26, 2015","false","1.3"," 15 of 60 people (25%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","25","15","60","4","2"
