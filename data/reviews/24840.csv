Medal of Honor: Airborne is the last great game in the series. Being dropped into the battle with free will to explore and edit your own load out is an awesome feature. One of my favourite things is the cover/peak system. when aiming down sight you can move your mouse to peak around corners/over obstacles, its a great feature. This game has ages greatly, it still has decent graphics for a game made in 2007. The only bad this is the campaign length and population of multiplayer servers, but mods for A.I bots in multiplayer games are available to download.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirrian/recommended/24840/","zirrian","[StuG Lyfe] Zirrian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirrian/","701 products in account","Please bear in mind that this review will be about the singleplayer, and the singleplayer only. I haven't played the multi, and does not plan to do so. Why? I'm an SP man, that's why. So, let's begin.\n\nIf you've played the original MoH series, it could get really different. Instead of a more realistic game, you get Band of Brothers: The Shooter. And I love every single minute of it. You get six rather short missions that you can complete in about 5 hours (or in my case, 7, because I'm a terrible aim), and each mission lets you refight one airborne operation of the war. The first two takes place in Italy, and it quickly grabs your attention if you let it do so. Fast paced action with loud guns, and more enemies that you can count. The more you kill, the better your weapons will be. For every kill, your weapon gets experience, and when it "levels up", you get an upgrade for it. Like grenade launcher for the M1 Garand, better scope for the Springfield, dual mag for the Stg44, and so forth. Maybe not entirely accurate, but certainly gives you a feel of progression.\n\nTry to stick with a weapon if you like it, tho. Some weapons appear only in early game (like the Kar98k and the Mp40), sor maybe it's wiser to use something that will be present a bit more frequent to let you get ammo for it. I recommend the pistol, because it doesn't require you to get additional ammo for it - you have infinite bullets. And that's cool, because on lvl 3, it's a really powerful weapon in short to middle range firefights. But the rest repends on your gamestyle. You can level up grenades too. Spam Gammon grenades for supernazis, and you can bear quite an amount of them to help you get baddies out fo the way.\n\nThe cons? Well, they are present. It's not much a historical game, rather than a historical based shooter. The Kar98k was used throughoutly the war, as well as the Mp40 - and believe it or not, not every men had an Stg44, and there wasn't any (or rather - that much) super nazis who could shoot the 15kg (possibly more) MG42 from the hip. And it's a bit frustrating when you go back to a place after they shot you, and it's swarming with enemies. Oh, before I forget - spawning. If you die, you'll make another jump where you can choose where to deploy. Rather neat function, that contains some interesting elements as there are skill jumps on each level, like land on the balcony or the catwalk.\n\nOverall, a good game. Really short, so I'd recommend getting it on a sale or if you are really don't have much else to spend you hard earned money on. If you want a bit more realistic FPS that have the Airborne in it, try Brothers in Arms - especially Hell's Highway, but it's just my personal preference.","March 15, 2014","true","7.1"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","51","56","0","0"

With the WWII Spam of the early 2000's, you would think they would die out. With the release of Medal of Honor: Airborne WWII Is back and has a few different changes. Should it be a good pickup? Or just another game that's late of the WWII Spam?\n\nStory/Design: Airborne invites players to fly and dive into the skies of multiple famous battles as Boyd Travers. Not much about the guy, but hey, none really did with the other WWII games. With select battles from other MoH titles like Market Garden, and of course Normandy. (Since every WWII game needed a reference to the battle of Normandy.) There isn't too much story to it, just going to objective to objective and accomplish them. They range from taking out a group of targets to go and blow up some artillery guns to help your other airborne comrades. The game is decent looking, a medium rig could run it but it looks quite nice on a great rig. With it being released in 2007, even some of the other games had a few better sounds. The firearm shot sounds don't ruin the game, but with others at the time it could be a bit better. With the story, there isn't much to it. Objective here, and objective there but luckily you're doing objectives during more famous battles that are usually well done and you can choose how you go to each of the objectives instead of a linear path, which is a spectacular change from go here, cut scene and follow the linear AI path.\n\nGameplay/Mechanics: No more running and gunning or running out and blasting each brain-dead AI in the face to reach the next objective. MoH Airborne takes things to a new level with some great changes added to the WWII FPS standards. As you dive out of the plane at each start point and choose where you would like to land, it is all up to you. Either landing in safe zones with your team or directly in enemy sights; the enemy AI is brutal and ruthless, able to hit you from rather large distances, and can seem a bit cheap at times; but it's much better than having brain-dead AI who just sit there until you shoot their face. Of course with the AI being so brutal and checkpoints usually not showing up until you finally clear an objective; this can lead to starting from the plane over and over and over again. It's fine the first few times, but after the 6th time of doing the same thing you'll want to just rage quit. The game is more slowly paced than a few other FPS's. Aiming down the sights will stop your character from walking around and instead be able to duck, lean, and raise your character instead of just walking around. This is a better choice so you can take it more slowly since the AI will be on your trail the whole time. Shooting hundreds of Nazi's and common soldiers will with the same gun will lead to a level up system to it, causing the game to slow-motion for a few seconds and to tell you what you unlocked for the following gun. Whether it be extended mag, reduced recoil, or better fire rate this can help you choose what gun firearm you love to use most and is a welcome addition to the standard FPS. The game can offer replay ability for the ones who want everything unlocked, such as landing in certain spots while parachuting. For the gameplay, the AI is brutal and the checkpoints can be rather annoyingly placed. The gunplay is fun and great to control with a great gun level up type system.\n\nOverall this is one of the best WWII games I have played, with smarter AI and a few different takes on a few things; although not being a completely perfect FPS experience, it's definitely a step in the right direction for a WWII game.\n8/10 Excellent WWII FPS","June 18, 2013","true","6.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

At any moment you have multiple missions to do based on the real events of Airborne battles in WWII leading to a magnificent Flaktower at the end.\n\nIt is not perfect..

It's essentially the same formula you see in most WW2 shooters, but instead of having linear levels, each mission is a reasonably large map with multiple objectives that you can take on in any order. The game drops you into the map by airplane, and you can parachute to wherever you want to start (there are designated green smoke "safe zones" where the enemies don't spawn, but you're generally free to experiment with landing wherever you think would give you the best advantage). You can find a decent amount of standard WW2 guns throughout the levels, and each of them has 3 levels of upgrade attachments that you unlock after getting a certain amount of kills with each one.\n\nWith that being said, there's a reason it's only my second favorite. For one thing, the game is really short - it only has 6 missions, which each last somewhere close to an hour each. They're largely unconnected, and for the most part the other soldiers are all just a bunch of faces, with no real narrative or characters to give more purpose to the nazi killing like you might be used to in other shooters in the genre. The game's AI is also pretty severely lacking, and tend to navigate the levels in a way that hints that they weren't really ready to make a game where you aren't on a set path. It's not usually noticeable for the enemies that are spawned into the game when you first begin a mission, but for freshly spawned enemies and allies it can be pretty bad.\n\nOverall I'd still recommend it, if only because it's so old now that it's only $10, which in my opinion is worth it for a game as fun as this even as short as it is. But if $10 for 6 hours isn't enough for you, it might be better to wait for a sale. Either way, I'd recommend it if you like WW2 games.","May 18, 2015","true","12.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

While there's definitely some good entertainment value here, the campaign is short, and the multiplayer isn't incredibly deep. Still, it's a good game overall and the best game in the franchise in some time.\n\nMedal of Honor: Airborne takes a different approach to World War II shooters. Instead of starting players out in each linear level on a path where there's no variation, EA LA decided to let us choose where to start each mission by throwing us out of a plane. Once floating in the air, it's a matter of steering the parachute to the best location to start the fight. Where the best location is depends on how you want to play the game, a mechanic that certainly is useful if you want a challenge or find that it's more fun to start out in a certain place on a map. It also provides an opportunity to drop into a new location if the previous one was a little too difficult or even complete one of the five different skill drops (drops in very specific areas).","July 15, 2014","true","9.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

I believe this was fixed because on my new PC I got a popup to set up game settings, similar to Rust and The Forest, and I've had no issues, but I can't 100% confirm you won't get this issue. If you do get it there is a few simple fixes relating to your .exe and setting up custom launch options and it's just a simple google search.\n\nPros\n-Gunplay is smooth.\n-Characters are realistic and have some decent dialogue when you're fighting, even if a little repetitive outside cutscenes.\n-Ability to choose different routes when assaulting your various objectives, with different routes through houses, tunnels, and even going up and through rooftops. You also have the option to land anywhere in your mission, which can give you either the extra edge, or you land in a terrible spot either with no movement or completely surrounded by Germans.\n-Entertaining story taking you through various parts of the European Theatre, with some small fictionalized enemies and events to fight through and against.\n-Ability to upgrade weapons through kills. Want a thompson with a drum mag? 3rd unlock. Want a trench shotgun with a bayonet? I can't remember which upgrade but you'll get it. Want that special dual magazine loading MP40 giving you a total mag count of 64 rounds? Yep, 3rd unlock and it's awesome.\n-A small multiplayer following averaging from around 4-12 players on 1 or 2 servers. Really friendly community, and expect to see the same guys on different servers. They're all really nice and fun to play with, and they're always welcome new players.\n-Graphics hold up even in 2015, especially on High settings. The game still looks beautiful.\n\nCons\n-Possiblity of motion sickness or vertigo due to the verticality of the maps and cover system. This game can make you feel ill or give you headaches after a while if you're not careful.\n-Lack of movement with cover system. Not neccesarilly a true "con" since the cover system is WASD based, but it can sometimes be a little awkward.\n-AI can sometimes be too easy, even on Expert, enemies generally go towards MG positions despite taking fire, and don't run from cover often, allowing you to rush them and hipfire. Then again, this game is from 2007, so it's to be expected, it just makes the game a little boring at times.\n\nOverall I give the game a 9/10. For $10 you'll get a pretty fun ride, pretty good multiplayer, just be careful that you don't get sick or hurt your eyes, and that you may plow through the AI at times.","March 2, 2015","true","20.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

This generation has seen its rise, and I do believe that before the end, it will also witness the genre's fall.  Already, we're seeing outcry against the restrictive linearity and setpiece-heavy design that are MMSs bread and butter.  We saw something similar happen with WWII shooters.  They gained popularity near the beginning of last generation, and eventually fell out of favor near the beginning of the current generation.  Medal of Honor: Airborne was one of the last ones to be released, and it struggled to win over audiences who were weary of its familiar setting and scenarios.  The fact that Call of Duty 4 came out a few months later certainly didn't help.  So basically, it didn't take people long to forget about the game.  However, this isn't 2007.  We've had some time to stew in the MMS scene, and WWII is starting to look less horribly overwrought and more whimsically nostalgic.  And if you look past its well-worn setting, Airborne is quite a fun shooter that manages to set itself apart from the pack with a variety of interesting features.\n\nRead more[videogamepotpourri.blogspot.com]","January 6, 2014","true","23.4"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","0"

Another thing I kinda find neat, is the firing, the accuracy >> I find it's very challenging to land shots, I feel it's more simular to firing a real automatic weapon in real life, as compared to like Call of Duty where 90% of your rounds are dead on.  Love the soundtrack, the music in the game is great and really adds to the feel of the game.\n\nParachuting was bogus, however >> I found it incredibly hard to land properly, and not get a 'botched' landing.....ah well, it still let me play even though I face planted on every jump, lol!!\n\nI bought this for $10, not on sale.

The ability to land wherever you want on the map is a large part of the fun but it also is a decent game in general. Getting headshots with rifles and other guns feels rewarding as well as mowing through Nazis with assault weapons. The MG42 adds some realism and you'll know when the enemy has it as well as learn to fear it if you don't take it out immediately. I'd recommend playing this game on the medium difficulty setting first so you can unlock all the weapon upgrades and learn the safe areas of the game as well as get used to the cover system first. It's a fun game and most of the time when you die you get to parachute in again but there are some glitchy enemies that you'll see firing at your teammates then a quarter of a second later will instantly turn to face you, it's not too often but it can be frustrating on your first playthough. On one level the enemy snipers may fire through walls so be careful as you move up and your teammates don't help too much in that same tank factory level but as long as you use the right weapons in the right situations you'll usually be fine. The best guns are: shotgun, STG44 (you can take the scope off when you unlock it), Gewehr, Garand (and unzoom this gun), and the Springfield but the upgraded Thompson, Bar, and K98K, etc. are enjoyable to use as well. The whole premise of the game is you can land wherever you want and I've avoided whole trench lines and seen some potential landing spots right at the objectives where as other times its fun to land on rooftops with the Springfield Sniper. The campaign is short but play thorugh it more then once and try different tactics, it will be worth your time. If you have a new copy of PHYS X it may not work with game so download it from here, it's the legacy version, no uninstall needed.

The game paints itself as a serious game revolving around paratroopers in WW2. However, the game itself is hilarious if not unintentionally comedic. I only recommend this game as there is no neutral option and I picked it up cheap on a sale.\n\nThe game started off well, the First level you fight the Italians. This is pretty cool because in every WW2 game they are always overlooked, but they are only around for half the level then here come the Germans. Using the iron sights allows you to lean or look over cover via the movement keys, which is something not seen a lot in shooters.\n\nThe AI in this game is horrible. Your teammates are paper and will run directly into fire. I haven't seen an ally stay alive for longer than 30 seconds. The enemy loves to melee and they will run directly at you just to melee you. When they use cover the animation is so rough it's like they are teleporting from looking over the cover vs peeking around the cover. Sometimes when you shoot a soldier his body will ragdoll as if you shot him with a cannon, they really get some incredible air time. A lot of times the enemy doesn't follow the same rules as the guns you use. Many times the enemy will shoot through cover or in the case of a sniper they will fire it like it's a fully automatic rifle when the rifle is bolt action.

The operations,in which I was dropped form the airplanes,were not as astonishing as I had expected.The singleplayer mode is kinda boring for a man of 2014. I've seen the same scenarios in COD series before,so I was not excited by this aspect.But on the other hand,the gameplay is unique,different from COD engine and many other games.Shortly speaking,if you played this game the year it was published,you would totally be excited by the innovation...\n\nMultiplayer\n...but then,I met with the multiplayer mode.Frankly speaking,I thought it would be a typical multiplayer where you have to eleminate all the targets and get the higher score on the table(Then be proud of yourself at the time you go to bed and think about to beat your K/D ratio record the next day).

My first imperssions were like: "- OMG,am I playing the extincted game or what?", "- Where are all the people?" or "- This should be really bad multiplayer because of the few buddies playin it?!" etc.\nYes,there are not thousands,hundreds or even tens of people on this servers,but about 40-50. The servers where everybody know and respect each other. I made new friends regarding to this awesome game. We are speaking,joking,having a lot of fun every evening in TS and I complain about a single thing - I would have bought it before.\nConclusion\nIf you are a man of war,\nIf you are a great fun of WWII games,\nIf you like WWII featured multiplayers,\nor if you just want to make new friends and don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the game[/b]\n\nMedal of Honor: Airborne is for you!","September 24, 2014","true","95.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There's also an interesting AI system used with the enemies called Affordance AI. Which causes them to move around and take cover in a fun and engaging way.\n\nMost of the guns feel great especialy the sniper rifles with some cool lensing effects on the scopes. There's not much of a story but there's a couple of shocking moments that make up for this especialy towards the end. I also liked the way the missions are introduced and I think the developers made some good design choices to encourage immersion.\n\nI played casualy through all the missions in about 9 hours and unlocked around a third of the extra content and weapon upgrades. The last two levels are particularly good and where the game really comes into it's own.\n\nThere's some replay value here too with all the unlockable stuff. There's also a multiplayer mode which I didn't try. However I read online that a group called War Lions has kept this mode alive.\n\nThe game runs in 1080p at a solid 60FPS for me, on a GTX 980 with Windows 10. I read that some people have needed to install legacy Physx drivers to get it to work, I didnt have this problem.\n\nThe graphics still look pretty good and can be ehanched to look even better with SweetFx. The game is unfortunately fairly blurry though when moving around. However motion blur can be disabled by editing the .ini files which helps this a lot. The FOV can also be increased in the same way.\n\nSo with a few tweaks the game runs pretty good for me, certainly enough to enjoy the experience. It can still be a bit blurry but it's definitely worth playing regardless. At the time it was released in late 2007, the developers seemed to be genuinely trying something different and for the most part it works. It reminds me of Wolfenstein (2009) I even got a bit of a supernatural vibe off one of the Nazi enemies during the later missions. I had a lot of fun with this one and I highly recommend it.","December 29, 2015","true","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebutler93/recommended/24840/","thebutler93","Bahama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebutler93/","134 products in account","I grew up playing Call of Duty (2003) , United Offensive (2004), and Call of Duty 2 (2005). I recently bought the original Medal of Honor (1999), Allied Assault (2002), and this game (2007) to see what I was missing out on, and to compare them to Call of Duty's franchise, game-to-game based on release year. Medal of Honor has no comparison due to it's release year so I'll leave it be, but Allied Assault is ♥♥♥♥ compared to Call of Duty and United Offensive. However, I think Airborne beats Call of Duty 2 as far as the gameplay, controls, and story go. The medal awards like a strip clip for a Mauser are interesting and give the player something to strive for. The leaning is like Wolfenstein: The New Order (2014). While you're aiming down the sights (ADS), you can use WASD to lean left, right, up, and down. Hold Shift and you're able to walk around while ADS. The controls feel intuitive and the graphics hold up against Call of Duty 2.","February 15","true","0.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But it can also be a lot of fun.\nIt took me 12 hours to beat the game and then go back and get all the weapon upgrades for every weapon and the grenades.\n\nAI Issues\nThe enemy AI is extremely dumb and very spastic, they will hunker down against an object and keep repositioning themselves so they become impossible to shoot sometimes and they can straight up teleport because of the AI's cover system. They move around so much even when un-alerted, they give us sufferers of ADHD a bad name. They can shoot you through walls and the tiniest cracks in them and other objects. They never miss a grenade throw and some single enemies can chuck EIGHT grenades at you in a split second. They've thrown grenades through tiny cracks in the walls that are impossible for the grenades to fit through and yet they still manage to go through.\nYour teammates are just useless cannon fodder but amusingly they'll sometimes band together and run at the enemies and all of them melee a single enemy at once running this devilishy satisfying fist train on them and insta kill the enemy sending their body FLYING. The enemies do this too, even to you, they'll come around a corner while you're reloading and ONLY ever do it while you're reloading and run the train on you and instantly kill you. Your teammates WILL ALWAYS get in your way and probably get you killed, they can softly push you around and block your ironsight peeking and they'll do it all the time. They'll run through you and in front of you and sometimes they follow where you're aiming and do nothing but follow your crosshair to be shot, like no joke, seriously. The enemy AI are also aim-botting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. No matter what weapon they're using, they'll shoot you from a far distance and get a headshot and take %50 of your health. And other times, they're super dumb and miss every shot, but most of the  time they land every shot even if they're gun is aiming at the ground and they're running the other way. Their bullets can apparently eject out of their barrel at a sharp 90 degree angle and they can blindfire around any object and ALWAYS hit you. It's never missed me once, even when I'm behind cover. And a common problem, you'll enter a new area before there's any cover and you'll be shot by every enemy there at the same time instantly killing you. Your teammates will almost always cause the RPG enemies to hit you, they'll run across the battlefield and the RPG enemy fires at them and it completely misses them and hits you even if you're behind cover even when the RPG enemy has no clue where you are, thanks to your useless cannon fodder buddies. I died more times because of this than any other means of death in this game. It happens with the tanks too. I've walked through a door my buddy ran through only to be hit in the face by a tank shell and insta-killed.\nEnemies also have infinite clips and randomly reload even if they don't need to and RPG guys? They can fire as many rockets as they want without reloading and then all of a sudden they decide to reload the rocket launcher only to fire it at you again before they've even dropped the rocket in the launcher, and they can be facing the other way and then just turn around and fire instantly exactly where you're standing, all enemies do this though so it's to be expected, even snipers that can one shot kill you like this as well. And mind you, this entire time, I'm playing on NORMAL, not HARD. I tried hard and it's almost exactly the same, but their weapons do more damage, that's the only difference, you can be shot twice by an MP40 and die but it can take a whole clip from a Thompson to down a single enemy. And even in normal mode, most enemies can take more bullets to their face than you can but a grenade at 20ft away or rocket of the same distance is insta death to them but not you if you have full health.\nYour buddies will also almost always fail their grenade throws and it bounces back right on top of you which can damage you. Your grenades also kill your buddies, so if you throw one, your buddy will 99% of the time try to play fetch with you and be blown clear across the sky where he is truly part of the Airborne now.\n\nBugs\nThis game has no option to adjust FOV and I had to adjust it using the fixes provided on PCGWiki. It's a normal problem with UE3 games and you need to adjust the FOV every time you start a new level, with the fix you just hit Page Down to make the FOV accurate. Also, get rid of the sprint effects if you don't want to get motion sickness.\nYou can get stuck in the map, especially on stair cases or closed quarters, normally you can just crouch, jump or sprint out of it but sometimes you need to kill yourself.\nParachute landings are borked? My landings always range from terrible to perfect and the drop points are kind of dumb, they're really hard to even see because of the super restricted camera angle while parachuting and you need to apparently play a level five times just to get each secret drop location and they're not highlighted once you find them on foot either even though it tells you "Secret Drop Discovered!" and sometimes they don't even work or are really wonky, I've landed the exact same way on multiple secret drops and it's a 50% chance I'll succeed in the exact same method.\nGame uses some kind of mouse smoothing that causes your crosshair to move over objects instead of directly on them. And for the love of GOD, do yourself a favor and turn off the motion blur. There are also bugs with the DOF in this game too, it takes FOREVER for it to accurately adjust to where you're looking and sometimes if an object near you is close to your crosshair it won't adjust at all, your teammates can cause this to happen too if they're inside you.\n\nConclusion\nBut despite all that? I really like this game. It pisses me off, but the gunplay, graphics, audio, controls and especially the ragdoll system all make up for it for me. It's an incredibly short game, only ten missions that you can beat in twenty minutes each. But for some reason, I really liked this game. I've played all the Medal of Honor games and even though this game feels like it's missing polish and feels rushed, I enjoyed it for some reason. It feels like a good productive time waster that doesn't require hundreds of hours to beat or collect everything. I feel the length was perfect.","April 13","true","12.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Medal of Honor Airborne is a very immerisve first person shooter, the ambient sound and overall feel are excellent, and the shooting mechanics are very fun and easy to get use to. The story and map design is also a plus, the unique idea behind paratrooping into battle is nice, but not exemplified enough. Another drawback is the poor AI, allies in this game are essientally useless, you will notice that you are literally killing everyone, and doing most of the workload, and the enemies are always darting around and sticking their heads out in the open, also, this game doesn't have much replayability, after you beat the game, there is little reason to pick it back up and play it, the other difficulties don't expand on the game much.\n\nIn the end, this game is a steal for the price, it is a great game in the Medal of Honor series and one of my favorite WWII FPS in recent memory.","March 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lonethefox/recommended/24840/","Lonethefox","Raccoon King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lonethefox/","222 products in account","Not your traditional MoH, but still a great game nonetheless. What sets Airborne apart from previous MoH games is that you are not a single agent sneaking behind enemy lines; instead, you are a paratrooper dropping into a large scale battle. The “one man army” feeling is nonetheless preserved, for better or worse. Fellow NPC paratroopers accompany you throughout each mission, though their combat effectiveness is questionable. They neither help nor hinder you very much in gameplay, though they at least provide cinematic backdrop for sense of a larger scale ground battle.\n\nPerhaps the biggest difference between Airborne and past MoH games is its nonlinearity. At the beginning of each level you (as the title might suggest) jump out of an airplane and land on the battlefield. During this jump you can steer your character towards anywhere you want to land (to an extent). Upon landing you are tasked with completing a number of objectives which are spread throughout the map. You may carry out these objectives in any order you please before a new area is unlocked through which you will complete the finale to the mission. This is a far cry to previous games of the series and in some ways it is therefore lacking. There are much less cinematic moments in Airborne that the series has been known for (like running across a family having dinner in Frontline), and entire missions take place in relatively the same battleground. In this vein, the game is somewhat disappointing. However, this it makes up in replayability. The singleplayer campaign clocks in around 5 hours long on normal (which is a bit short), however the freedom to start missions (almost) wherever you want and complete objectives in any order you want allows for exta hours of gameplay in comparison to MoH’s generally more scripted level design. In addition, there are various unlockables and collectibles such as weapon upgrades (unlocked by killing enemies) and “skill drops” (marked places on the map where you can land).\n\nIf collectibles aren’t something you’re particularly into, the gameplay itself is a blast. Each weapon is punchy and satisfying to use. At the start of a each mission you can choose your own loadout, allowing for multiple playstyles. Want to land on a rooftop and pick off your enemies with a sniper rifle? You can do that. Want to run and gun through the streets with a thompson? You can do that too. To that end, the game allows you to choose your own pace. You can race through the mission if you please, completing objectives as quickly as possible, or you can simply take your time, picking off enemies one by one. In gameplay, Airborne truly does feel a lot like a MoH game, yet more open to different playstyles. One unique feature in Airborne is a Ravenshield-esque leaning system. Whilst aiming down the sights you can press the WASD keys to lean your character to and fro in different directions. Unfortunately, whilst doing this, you cannot move from where you are standing (unless you hold shift as I later found out). It is by no means a bad feature, but its implementation is strange and makes movement in the game awkward sometimes. The game would certainly benefit from the ability to toggle this feature but alas, there is none.\n\nAirborne offers a new experience for MoH veterans, perhaps not one they may have hoped for, but a fun one nonetheless. Hardcore fans may have trouble accepting Airborne as a true MoH game, and maybe it isn’t, but it is by no means worth passing up.","February 8","true","8.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

In this one, each scenario is designed not as a going-from-point-A-to-point-B linear thing but as a very big "square", where you fall from the sky (and choose where to fall) and team-work your way out of each situation and objective with your AI team-mates. There´s always more than one way of flanking a certain situation, there´s always more than one objective you can choose to go to (or fall into) The game is specially fun if played in the hardest level of difficulty, where you really feel the need to "supress" and you get supressed most of the time (you even get routed away if you want to survive when you see those nazis outnumber your guys and charge against you, those are funny moments)\n\nThis one is an ""old"" game now, by modern super-graphic standards, but it aged very very well, and  if you want a single player experience that "feels" a lot like a multiplayer with lots of moments of script, right now is selling at 2,5 dollars, it´s really a bargain and it´s worth it.","March 9, 2014","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It set out to be a WW2 shooter and does a pretty good job at that while also having some pretty interesting things here and there. You can either take that recomandation or read the rest of the review for more detail. I think one of the most interesting things about this game is the way you start a level, intead of the level just starting you jump out of plane with a parachute and descend to where you want to land. It's got solid shooting and you upgrade you guns by getting headshots. Now this means your guns start out not that great usuall have a ton of recoil but if you shoot in bursts and aim for the head you will be fine. Now this game has some flaws as well, I think the biggest one are the length of the game (which is about 4 hours) and the simulatory of all the levels. You have the same objective of every level and that is to blow a certain thing up with charges.

I had this for my Xbox around when It was first released, I loved it at the time. I decided one day to go and look for it, no luck. "Screw It!" I said, and then I bought it on Steam. I still remembered a lot of it, but It still was so damn good, I think maybe even better playing it again on the PC. Like all Medal of Honor games (No, I'm not including the new ones that EA ripped out of their ♥♥♥) they have such great soundtracks. Airborne had a fantastic soundtrack and had some songs from the originals, which is damn awesome. Now, the sounds in this game are the best I ever heard. Not even joking with that one, they're really awesome. Weapons are a blast to shoot and the non-linear gameplay added into a World War 2 Paratrooping game is fantastic. Awesome idea. I would be glad for EA to make a second one. No, not with modern warfare compete with crappy Call of Dudy, but actually once again World War 2. Please, can a big company make a World War 2 game again? Like the old days? Please Call of Dudy or Medal of Honor, just make one, like the classics.","March 14, 2013","true","17.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Yes, it's WWII, so don't expect a hyper-complicated story, groundbreaking visual design, or creative weaponry.  But, the shooting mechanics are good, the weapon upgrade system encourages you to experiment with different weapons, the AI is competent, and the respawn system of parachuting in as well as the nonlinear mission objectives provide some nice tactical depth to an otherwise straightforward shooter.  The battles always feel big with multiple moving fronts (and new ones opening up with AI allies parachuting in), but you'll never be far from the action.","July 25, 2011","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I suppose that indicates it's not a memorable story, but at the same time nothing terrible comes to mind. Hence, it must have been alright.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Extremely short game, takes around 7-8 hours to finish.\n- Very linear, no replayability, restricted exploration.\n\nOverall Score: 7/10\n\nMedal of Honour: Airborne is a really enjoyable First Person Shooter. However, it's quite short so you don't get much bang for your buck, unless you buy it incredibly cheap on sale like I did. Therefore, I recommend it at under $2.50 (believe it or not, you can get it for that price if you look around).","December 15, 2014","true","7.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","7"

You can land on a roof and shoot your way down, or land behind the enemy and flank them.\n\nAnd that’s about where the good ends.\n\nThe weapons have a neat level-up mechanic. The more you use a certain weapon, you will earn attachments for it, and make it better. Unfortunately, at the beginning of the game when you don’t have any proficiencies, the weapons are incredibly difficult to use. I remember having a rifle, looking down the sights at an enemy’s chest, and emptying entire magazines without a single hit. The inaccuracy of the weapons in this game can make it very frustrating.\n\nThe enemies scale, and get more difficult as you progress. That’s good. The highest level enemies, though, are laughable and unrealistic. Also, after five legitimate missions, the sixth and final mission feels like a giant spoof of the entire game.\n\nLastly, the game’s big gimmick is parachuting to any place on the battlefield. I never once learned how to land correctly. The instructions were not very clear, and after failing all three times in the tutorial, I was approved and sent off to war. I played every mission, and made countless landings, and botched every single one. I was upset that I couldn’t do it, but even more upset that I couldn’t LEARN to do it.\n\nThis game was a novelty when I was looking for something I hadn’t played before, but it’s not something I’ll ever go back to with fond memories.","November 3, 2014","false","5.8"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

There isn't much to the game in terms of story, and usually you'd expect more from the gameplay. But then the very clunky control scheme is what pretty much ruins the experience. You can't move at all while aiming, which can get really annoying and disadvantageous. I'm not saying you should be able to move as quickly and as freely as usual, but at least you should be able to inch around a bit to get a better position, angle, or whatever. And this probably wouldn't have been as frustrating if the muzzle-loading process of some of the rifles weren't so terribly long. And yes, I'm playing on Hard mode. Simply switching to a lower difficulty still doesn't cut it.\n\nAnother sort of nitpick I have with this game is that when you shoot at an enemy, there is very little if at all any realistic signs on the target if it's been hit. It could be anything, be it a moan, blood splatter or at least falling back a bit due to the impact of the bullet, or whatever. But here you only know you've hit an enemy when they die, apparently. This just makes no sense because ... seriously no human can endure getting shot without a wince and still keep shooting until they're down. That's just ridiculous.\n\nNot a very good FPS overall to me personally. I don't know much about this genre, but certainly there are things that the Call of Duty series has been doing way better than this game even since its first installment.","March 4, 2014","false","1.0"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","1"

Unfortunately the implementation is pretty lacklustre and the maps end up feeling a bit like playing a multiplayer game with bots.\n\nThe missions aren't terribly interesting as you typically just run from waypoint to waypoint planting det charges on various things. There is no real overall story and your squadmates are just anonymous generic soldiers...if the story gave any of them names I certainly didn't notice.\n\nThe game is also painfully short, my playthrough was padded by sections where I'd get briefly lost working out exactly how to get to the next objective.\n\nThat all said, the combat can be entertaining thanks to solid shooter mechanics.

Yeah, I've played for mere minutes, but there's a reason for that. First off, upon my first start up of the game, I was waiting ever so patiently for it to install all the useless stuff, only for it to tell me that my graphics card is not supported. Now, because I have an Intel HD 4200, I can understand why this wouldn't work. Obviously, I wasn't gonna call it a day there. I looked around, searched the forums, the Googles, and found something called PhysX Legacy. Several places said installing this would make it work. Did that, no difference.\n\nI then found someone saying to just rename the setup .exe in the games files, and upon doing that, the game actually started up.\n\nAnd now, to the actual game itself.\n\nBecause the setup was renamed, the game kinda ignored all the graphical stuff, and does not allow me to mess with the graphics settings. When playing a cutscene, most, if not all the characters are simply black silhouettes. I was watching as one of them was showing me my objective in a town in Italy, which just turned out to be a blank wall. So, if you end up like I did where your card is not suppoted, you can't do much about the cutscenes.\n\nNow, the gameplay. The first mission, and probably every single other mission, starts out with you jumping out of a plane. You parachute into the town, your objective to take out AA and artillery guns. Now, this is just my opinion, but I didn't like the fact that it didn't matter what order I completed my objectives. I found myself running through the empty streets, from one side of the town to the other, all of a sudden running into some firefight close to the objective. I've played Allied Assault, European Assault, Rising Sun, Vanguard, and the missions were all linear and not really picky. I think that's how it should have been with Airborne. The idea of choosing how to do the mission is cool, but something about the topic and the way it was executed just makes me think that it's not as good as it could be. In Vanguard, you did the same thing, jump, land, and one by one finish your job. In Airborne, you jump, and you can finish the mission as you please.\n\nThe shooting is a bit odd to me, but that's probably because I'm used to shooting without iron sights, like in the old MoHs. You can sprint, the health bar is different than just about every other MoH, giving you 4 bars that can regenerate with either health packs or just over time, so long as the bar is not empty. In Vanguard, it worked like CoD, get shot, wait a few, its like nothing happened. In the older ones, you had 100 health, and could only get more if you picked up bottles, medkits, etc.\n\nI do not reccomend because the game is simply too much of a pain in the ♥♥♥ to get up and running, and if you have the problem I had, you will not be able to toy around with the graphic settings. Hell, there isn't even an option to do so, other than brightness and whatnot. The multiplayer is also a major disappointment, as there is only 10 or less people playing. Allied Assault has more players than this game, and that's a game from 2002. If you're concerned about the story of it, it's World War 2. Not your forte? Go back to your futuristic bolonga. Medal of Honor Airborne was probably amazing in its day, but in 2014, it only causes problems and disappointment.","September 4, 2014","false","5.4"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Turns out I bought 5GB of wasted space.\n\nFor the last hour or so, I've been compounded by an "unsupported video card error" which is apparently very common. I found a work around whist digging through forums, using the trick "dxlevel81" at the end of the exe. targetline, which will allow the game to open and run, although you get to view it at a glorious 1024x768. The graphical settings are in a separate exe. this is inaccessible due to ”unsupported video card error” so no changing how it looks.\n\nThe GPU I’m running is the Nvidia GTX675MX, which is more than powerful enough, but of course that isn’t the issue. Long story short don’t buy this unless you’re running an OS before windows 7 and a graphics card before or shortly after 2007, even then you might still encounter issues.

I also feel cheated and betrayed, both by developers and people who wrote positive reviews about this... monstrosity. I'll try to be brief - combat doesn't work. This game has hands down the most awkward and non-functional aiming and movement controls I've ever seen. Imagine trying to play Call of duty wannabe with DayZ controls and you'll get portion of what you'll experience. I've tried to get used to it. Cannot be done. No amount of sensitivity tweaking has helped the feeling as if I was playing with gamepad, only I was still holding my mouse. That's how inprecise and awkward aiming and movement in general feels. There is also leaning system, and it's useless. It's not that the leaning system is a terrible idea, but it's executed horribly. Wolfenstein: New World Order actually uses that feature well, but here, it's just infuriating. While running, or even moving, your screen jumps up and down, which will make you sick and always completely disorient you. Seriously, I've never seen this - a game where every movement results in confusion. They got every. Single. Damn. Thing. Wrong.\n\nIt doesn't even matter that all the singleplayer maps feel like playing a long, tired team deadmatch with bots, that they're completely uninspired and that enemies are absolute morons that run and jump around like rabbits, but become quite dangerous because of their perfect aim and sudden spawn. Fundamentals are completely broken and with that, even if the game had the most amazing campaign I've ever seen, it wouldn't save it, because playing it just isn't any fun. There is nothing in this game that would keep anyone who was some sense of decency to come back. I will recommend almost any other FPS over this, just play the previous Medal of Honor, hell, original Call of Duty, even though it hasn't aged well, is still a good, satisfying game - get that over this and enjoy your time. Airborne was first truly miserable Medal of honor game and the less people remember it, the better.","September 4, 2014","false","1.6"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","9","25","0","0"

I love the concept and all of that however the game just doesn't fall through I don't know if its the terrible cover system compared to a game from 2004. The story I had no attachment to so I have decided to give up for now but the real problem with the game is how it feels like a arcade game thats trying to br realistic or at least thats how I felt.\n\nI like the idea of it being free roam and being able to land in secret places in the map however if you just find were these locations are then all you have to do is jump and you get the award. here are many glitches like this in wich once I shot a enemy three times in the head and to my knowing it is not physically possible for a man to be hit it the head by a sniper rifle shot and continue to keep on killing other soldiers.\n\nAgain I loved the idea of this game but had it been done by a studio without a time limit to push out their game I think it would of been a much better game. Although the Call of Duty franchise has no substance anymore it would of been better had it been done by a Call of Duty studio when they did games not just about killing a generic terrorist every year or maybe by the team from Ubisoft who made brothers in arms then maybe it would be a game worth spending more then £2.00 on like I did.\n\nIn conclusion I would never recogmend this game to someone.

Extremely dated graphics for 2007 with broken physics and A.I. Terrible, just not fun at all. Nothing like the original (even ignoring the graphics).

Maybe it runs fine with a Radeon, I wouldn't know.

I had one mission to go and I figured I might as well finish it before posting my thoughts on it.  It turns out the game's last mssion was effectively unplayable for me.  The rest of the game was just fine.  The last mission was a glitchy, stuttery parade of pain and frustration.  I gave up and uninstalled the game with extreme prejudice.\n\nThe game is like a generational bridge between the old Playstation 2 Medal of Honor games and the more modern Call of Duty games.  If you have never played a Medal of Honor game before, you will probably be saying to yourself "COD does this so much better" as you play.  And it is largely true.  But those of you who have played Medal of Honor since the series started will find some nostalgic fun factor here.\n\nThe game also introduces a unique element to the series; verticality.  I don't mean wall-running or double-jumping like modern shooters.  But landing on the battlefield via parachute means you can go land anywhere.  On roofs, scaffolding, etc.  and you can also leap or climb to places that was not possible in the classic MoH games.  Enemies can be placed in high places as well and this adds a subtle new twist on the series.\n\nEA took a bold but awkward direction with this game.  They invested time and money into new (for the time) rag-doll physics technology.  Most of the time it's pretty impressive.  Most of the time.  Enemies you kill may stiffen and then fall backwards, or they may lose all motor control and slump over.  When I compare this to the death animations in Call of Duty: World At War, I like this better (most of the time).  Yeah, COD:WaW has dismemberment and more blood, but in this game they have a better sense of weight.\n\nBut then there are the other times...  Times when the rag doll simulation isn't so natural.  Maybe 5% of the time it just looks weird.  And then there is that 1% of the time where it just gets SILLY!  Bodies will pop five feet in the air, or shake violently.  One time I saw the enemies gun got stuck in a wall and the corpse's hand would not let go of it.  Other times a dead enemy's body part will get stuck on... nothing.  It will hang from the air.  It can get pretty ridiculous and you will get a chuckle now and then.  Sometimes the derpy physics will even effect YOU.  And you don't have to be dead for it to happen.  I was walking along and I was suddenly tossed 15 feet to one side like I was hit by an invisible car.\n\nLike all of the classic Medal of Honor games the enemies seem to get more durable as the game progresses.  On the last mission I was using my sniper rifle almost exclusively because the other weapons seemed to do very little.  Some enemies required more than one hit with the sniper rifle.\n\nThe game starts pretty slow but it gets pretty fun in the middle.  Operation Market Garden was quite fun.\n\nBut the game went completely crapular for me on the last mission.  Wildly uneven and stuttery frame rates, graphical and audio glitches constantly.  Controlling the player was difficult and laggy with each stutter.  When things started moving again I would find I had completely oversteered or walked farther than I intended.  I use a 6-core i7 and a GTX960.  There is no reason a game of this age should suddenly act like this.  The crazy level of difficulty on the final mission combined with the glitch fest was too much for me.  I tried for several hours to complete the final mission but just gave up and uninstalled the game after it had depleted my very last drop of resolve.\n\nThe game is quite fun in the middle.  But I can not recommend it.  2 or 3 fun missions is not enough to warrant a purchase.  Esp. if it decides to break down on you for the last mission.  Maybe get it if it is dramatically discounted in price.","May 22","false","10.9"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","2","12","0","2"

Because the game is just okay.\nThe start was pretty impressive, even though it is an "old" game, the graphics still looks good. Furing my first jump out of the airplane, I was pretty impressed, it's an atmopshere! But it could not exists the whole game. It as tense, especialy the last jump was spectacular, as your airplane was hit by AA guns, and was breaking apart. Well done. The weapons feel good, recoil is there, but the irons ights do not work. I tried to use them, the sight was pointing at the enym, but I fired an entire magazine without hitting? What is that supposed to be? After this "dissapointment", I was using the crosshair most of the time. and I mostly hit. There is also a pretty nice upgrade system in the game. The mroe kills you get on a weapon, the more expirience you get, and you unlock some more or less usefull upgrades. But it can go very fast, but looking back how short the game was, it is well balanced. It would be nice if I could detach the upgrades, because if you upgraded a weapon completly, it gets to easy, double-64 round amgazine for the MP40, 50 round magazinges for the Thompson, it is just spray and pray. Another fact that I dissliked, is that most of the weapons get scopes. I don't want to have a scope on my G43, or STG44. It is not usefull. And there is no option to detach it. Speaking of weapons, every weapon got it's own stats, damage, fire rate, recoil etc. If you look at the stats you might think: Hmmm, this does pretty good damage. Nope: The further you get, the more bullets the enemy can withstand. This is laughable, enemies can kill you with a few hits, but they can survive up to two magazines. The Nazi Storm Elite is just ridicolous.\n\nThe first mission was good, well balanced, the enemy dies as fast as you. It also felt good.\nSecond mission, not bad.\nThe third mission was average, but the fourth and the fith and the sixth are just ridicolous.\nI was so mad during the fith mission, because the enemy, can kill you with a few shots but you can't shoot back if you hang in your chute. I was killed so often by respawning snipers. This is another thing, enemies will respwan if you die and you have to chute to the battlefield. The Checkpoint system is also pretty bad.\nThe fourth mission was also significant. The escalation curve is pretty high, the first time you meet the Panzerschreck troops, you will swear and curse. Because they can knock you out with 2 hits, but you can't see them because they are in cover and well camouflaged. The enemy AI can also shoot through smoke walls, smoke you can'T look through but they can. The Jumps are another thing, I was able to complete, ONE good jump, you will always fall on your face, if you jump. This costs time. And can cause your life. Despite that, I enjoyed the game.\nI forgot to mention the wayfinding system. It does not work. You will get lost very often.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that you can complete during a weekend, buy it, 10 Euros is it worth.\n\nedit: THis si getting worse and worse. Enemy AI is either incredibly stupid, or incredibly good. Sometimes they shoot you through walls, or clone troopers, spawn in each other that they run you over in a wall of flesh.\n\n6/10","December 1, 2014","false","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The landscapes are quite believable, well designed and the graphics stand the test of time. And there are Nazi's aplenty to plough through which always helps. There's some nice touches such as the weapons "upgrades", and of course the fact that you can land yourself literally anywhere on the map.\nThere's a couple of minor negatives. I've found myself landing in an awkward spots which has resulted in plummeting to my death rather than being climb over the fence in front of me, but apart from that its still a great game. That and reloading has to run through the whole sequence. So whilst I'm being machine gunned in the face, I have to finish loading the clip into the gun and loading a round into the chamber.

Sadly the multiplayer is kind of dead so you don't see as much action but when you do it's a pretty good time.\n\nHope this review was good enough for some people and help them if they want to buy it or not.","January 3, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/oddmutation/recommended/24840/","oddmutation","Mei Mutant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/oddmutation/","3312 products in account","Medal of Honor: Airborne is a tragic gem. Simultaneously the culmination of EA’s original Medal of Honor franchise, and the moment when gamers had enough of the wretchedly overdone setting. We were sick of it all: The European landscape, the same inadequate weapons, the bombastic orchestrated music that blared as you shot the same enemy types over and over (and the enemy types were: the guy who shot at you with a machine gun, and the guy who shot at you with a rifle.)\n\nThere use to be a time when that got us excited. When we were fresh off of Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers and being able to witness something like Omaha Beach was a incredible, petrifying experience, even if the rest of the game was your standard first person shooter. But as we were most exposed, it quickly became white noise to us, as Medal of Honor’s developer 2015 studios split up to become “Infinity Ward” and make it’s competing brand “Call of Duty”. The genre was looking somewhat crowded before (with Wolfenstein, and Battlefield becoming popular franchises), but then every year we were bombarded by more and more World War 2 titles. From 2004 to 2007, we had six Medal of Honor games and eight Call of Duties. Not to mention other properties joining the fray with Band of Brothers, Red Orchestra, Day of Defeat, World War 2 Combat, World War II: Online, Combat Elite, Sniper Elite, etc. I’m getting a little nauseous just thinking about it.\n\nSo it’s 2007, the idea of a World War 2 game has been explored, interpreted, and beaten into the ground so much that a screenshot of a new game with the setting sends viewers into a narcoleptic deep sleep (or in World at War’s case, unbridled rage.) EA looks upon it’s bruised, wheezing Medal of Honor license and a single tear rolls down John Riccitiello’s face as he remembers the glory days of the series. What began as a Goldeneye clone became a front runner to one of the most popular and celebrated sub-genres in our history of gaming. But in 2007 it was a dying giant, it’s extinction inevitable as Call of Duty: Modern Warfare approaches it, and EA Los Angeles knows. With one last gasp of air, Medal of Honor: Airborne was created. The giant dies, the fad is dead, and nobody cared.\n\nBut now it’s 2012, we’re no longer constantly exposed to European beaches, Panzer tanks, and young Americans yelling at you to go somewhere. Nobody dares to make another WW2 game, as they’re a profit black hole these days. Modern war has replaced it, but for now we have an opportunity. The white noise that we chose to ignore is now gone, and I can, and am able, to go return to World War 2 without fatigue.\n\nMedal of Honor: Airborne is a weird thing to go back to. After playing so many modern first person shooters, after playing so many games that featured steroid induced bad boys with the personality of tweens, fighting faceless enemies in some truly disgusting ways that we’ve now become immune too. I felt something I haven’t felt in a while. Honor.\n\nRight at the start, even when the game introduces you to the tutorial. There’s this feeling of hope, pride, and optimism. And in Airborne it is executed so well, that even when you’re told as you’re parachuting:\n\n"Steer in for clearings. Look for green smoke. Do you know why we look for green smoke?"\n\n*Cuts back to the aircraft, as you make another jump*\n\n"Because it’s proper procedure!"\n\nI felt like I wanted to thrust my fist in the air. It’s a tutorial, I wasn’t being told a speech on how awesome our special little group is (don’t worry, they still do), they’re merely giving me directions on how to operate my parachute correctly. But it made me feel like a hero, who was ready to embark on some epic journey. And when you are eventually told that your airborne group is special, you kind of believe it. If it was 2007 I would’ve rolled my eyes at this entire sequence, numb to the Patriotism and Spielbergism of it all. Except it’s now 2012, my tolerance has lowered, and I’m playing a game that’s trying to outdo every WW2 game that came before it. My body isn’t ready for this.\n\nThe game itself stands up quite well. If anything it’s the “yin” to the modern shooter’s “yang.” Every mission starts with a classy quote, and then a slice of the quote becoming the title of the mission (like Infinite Mischief), followed by a jump out of an airplane into some god forsaken battlefield, and giving you the freedom to go anywhere and complete most objectives at your own pace. Luckily this is one of the few games that doesn’t sacrifice the quality of a focused experience for freedom. It’s a testament to good level design when a open world can feel like a focused experience regardless of what path you take and how you take it. It will from time to time still funnel you to various locations that demand you to witness how exciting it looks, but what’s important is that you don’t feel guided. You’re able to become more immersed with the game, those exciting “cinematic” experiences occurring from your own actions. When I managed to flank a squad of Germans, grab a turret behind them, and used it to shred apart the rest of their group while they were distracted by my own squad, I had a huge grin of satisfaction. It felt like something from a actual movie, except I pulled it off myself by my own actions and not through some scripted sequence. It’s the kind of stuff that makes me agree with David Jaffe’s ideas of “Player Authored Stories.”\n\nThere’s also some surprisingly fresh elements to it. EA Los Angeles needed to keep players interested with using the same old WW2 weapons again, so they threw in an upgrade system. Using the same gun repeatedly gains experience, unlocking new attachments for it as you upgrade. It’s an effective way to breathe new life into these old weapons. Instead of rolling my eyes at the STG-44, I was excited to see what it would become when I maximized it (it became a dual clip assault rifle with a acog scope, bad ♥♥♥.) It seems similar to Call of Duty’s ever exhausting multiplayer persistence systems (despite the game releasing before COD:MW), but it’s refreshing to see it in a single player game. There’s also “stunt” locations you’ll find in each mission, where you’ll discover more challenging areas to land in or on, rewarding you with.. Well, I don’t know really. It may be one of the weirdest afterthoughts I’ve seen in a mainstream game. “I’ll go kill Hitler, right before I land on top of this busted water tower.”\n\nEA Los Angeles tried to fix the problem of repetitive enemy types that stay the same. There’s ten tiers of Nazis. With the first six or so being your standard soldiers, with each higher rank having increased health and hardware. Their behavior is sometimes impressive, with my favorite being the snipers that hold out their knives to blind your vision and distract you while another sniper tries to pick you off. Why the hell don’t I see that more? Modern shooters have figured out every way to cleverly kill someone, and they never think of having the AI use it on you. It gets blatantly “gamey” when they introduce the final tier: a gas-masked juggernaut who stormed right out of Wolfenstein, shooting a heavy machine gun from the hip and can take three rifle grenades to the face before he dies. It’s okay though, by the time he shows up it’s near the end. And oh boy, the final level, titled “Flying Through Hail”, is one of my favorite final levels to ever grace a shooter. It’s the culmination of every mechanic in the game, coming together in an area that is as unique as it’s frighteningly beautiful.\n\nSo there it came. This hidden gem, a final cry of attention from the now dead sub-genre. Gamers assumed the worse in it, another careless WW2 shooter pumped out by EA.\n\n8/10","February 25, 2015","true","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love this game. the this game made in 2007 has better graphics than COD advanced warfare and i love the weapon upgrading mechanic.weapons upgrade with the more kills you get,so if you favor one weapon it will get upgraded most, however you can only upgrade weapons 3 times. the fact that you get to chose where you start is great and this game has a less linear feel than most other FPS's nowadays. the movement in this game is much more realistic and i like that. i also like that there are 10 different enimies to face. now for the bad stuff.\n\nthe game is really short, but the replayabilty saves it for me. the later enimies you face are way to OP even on casual difficulty. the last missions map is confusing especially the parts where you have to meet up with your team and i was searching for them for hourse (ok it was closer to 30 minutes.) the nemies have a sort of scripted feel sometimes running right past you to get to cover when they should be shooting you.\n\nother than that i love this game and i highly recomend it.","February 19, 2015","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And I kinda liked it. I thought all the time:"If I only had a mouse and a keyboard!". Saw the game on STEAM for 2,49 € and I did not hesitate one second. I played the game through in 6 hours. Playing this game for 5 mintes or less, I noticed one huge issue: It's one of the worst FPS console ports ever! Aiming feels broken and the sensivity is permanently the same and high as Wiz Khalifa, even though you change the sensivity in the options menu. It really goes down, but not while ADS. After getting used to it, you notice another huge issue: You aim perfectly at a soldier, but you don't hit him (You have a red cross as a hit indicator). There is no satisfaction in killing enemies at all.\n\nThe only "fun" you have in this game is to skill your weapons. Get enough kills with every weapon and you gut upgrades. It's 3 upgrades each weapon. There are 11 weapons that ypu can equip, 2 rocket launchers which you can find in 3 of 5 missions. And the MG42 which you can only use as a mounted MG. You will encounter elite enemies carrying MG42s, but you can't carry one.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you're a big fan of FPS games, then pass this one.\nIf you're a bigfan of the Medal of Honor series, than pass this one and Medal of Honor (modern shooter).\nIf you're a fan of World War 2 games, shooters included, than pass this one.\nFor the sake of God and your wallet, pass this one!","September 4, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead it killed it so hard that it needed a reboot that also didn't live up to expectation. It only takes a few hours of playing to see the faults.\n\nFirst off, the concept is not bad on paper. At the start of each mission, you get to jump out of a plane, and land where you want. Again, great on paper, but the reality of it is that there are very few places you can actually safely land without becoming a bullet sponge. It also gets real ♥♥♥♥ing annoying that you have to do this over and over each time you die.\n\nThe next problem is the lean/cover system. The idea is again, good on paper. Whilst aiming down sights, you can lean or go prone using the movement keys, or move slowly by holding the sprint key. The problem is that this doesn't work under stress. I'm use to being able to move whilst in iron sights, and I am use to using other buttons for lean. There is a reason this has not been used again.\n\nEA obviously saw Crysis and thought it would be a good idea and put it into a WWII game, therefore it has a 'non-linear' level form. This doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing fit with the theme. These are well-planned military operations. People go certain places and do certain jobs in a certain order. You don't just run around willy-nilly doing whatever objective seems like it would be the funnest.\n\nAI is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Allies constantly rush towards Nazis and die quickly. They also have a habit of getting in the way of you when you are trying to ♥♥♥♥ing shoot someone. The enemies themselves constantly leave cover.\n\nThe difficulty comes from a few parts of this game. First of all, health drops are barely around. THIS IS A HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM. It really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks dying after playing for 10 minutes, because there are no ♥♥♥♥ing health kits available. It's not hard to add a few health kits. It's simple level design.\n\nYou also can die really quickly. MG 42s tear you apart before you can blink. Enemies can bum rush you and melee you to death. I've had enemies do this to me, whilst surviving automatic gunfire. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Apart from that, damage does seem fairly balanced. Now I understand an MG 42 would tear you apart in real life, but this isn't ARMA, and it's sure as hell annoying having to go back to a checkpoint when you are just rapidly killed by an MG 42 nest that you either couldn't kill in time, or didn't see.\n\nThe weapon-upgrade system is pretty meh. I don't understand some of the upgrades. For example, the shotgun gets a bayonet, but why not instead the M1 Garand? It makes more sense as the shotgun is designed for close quarters. IT'S A SHOTGUN FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE! The M1 however is better at long range, and it would make sense that if an enemy catches you off guard that you may have to stick them.\n\nStory is non-existent. There is no reason to care about your fellow soldiers. They're just cannon fodder. Just go mission to mission shooting that and blowing up this. I honestly couldn't care less by the second mission.\n\nHere's an idea, how about make it you're the squad leader, and during mission planning, you choose where to drop. Maybe one drop gets you closer to the enemy, but is very risky, or one takes you to close to good high ground where you can pick off some Germans. This would give merit to the whole 'jumping out of a plane' gimmick, and allowed for a more interesting game.\n\nHaving played Allied Assault, I can easily say its a much better game, despite being much older. Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway was also based around paratroopers, but did everything much better (except you don't get to jump out of a plane).\n\n8/10 Major Fret's would send this game to the gas chamber.\n","September 5, 2014","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead it killed it so hard that it needed a reboot that also didn't live up to expectation. It only takes a few hours of playing to see the faults.\n\nFirst off, the concept is not bad on paper. At the start of each mission, you get to jump out of a plane, and land where you want. Again, great on paper, but the reality of it is that there are very few places you can actually safely land without becoming a bullet sponge. It also gets real ♥♥♥♥ing annoying that you have to do this over and over each time you die.\n\nThe next problem is the lean/cover system. The idea is again, good on paper. Whilst aiming down sights, you can lean or go prone using the movement keys, or move slowly by holding the sprint key. The problem is that this doesn't work under stress. I'm use to being able to move whilst in iron sights, and I am use to using other buttons for lean. There is a reason this has not been used again.\n\nEA obviously saw Crysis and thought it would be a good idea and put it into a WWII game, therefore it has a 'non-linear' level form. This doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing fit with the theme. These are well-planned military operations. People go certain places and do certain jobs in a certain order. You don't just run around willy-nilly doing whatever objective seems like it would be the funnest.\n\nAI is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. Allies constantly rush towards Nazis and die quickly. They also have a habit of getting in the way of you when you are trying to ♥♥♥♥ing shoot someone. The enemies themselves constantly leave cover.\n\nThe difficulty comes from a few parts of this game. First of all, health drops are barely around. THIS IS A HUGE ♥♥♥♥ING PROBLEM. It really ♥♥♥♥ing sucks dying after playing for 10 minutes, because there are no ♥♥♥♥ing health kits available. It's not hard to add a few health kits. It's simple level design.\n\nYou also can die really quickly. MG 42s tear you apart before you can blink. Enemies can bum rush you and melee you to death. I've had enemies do this to me, whilst surviving automatic gunfire. It's complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Apart from that, damage does seem fairly balanced. Now I understand an MG 42 would tear you apart in real life, but this isn't ARMA, and it's sure as hell annoying having to go back to a checkpoint when you are just rapidly killed by an MG 42 nest that you either couldn't kill in time, or didn't see.\n\nThe weapon-upgrade system is pretty meh. I don't understand some of the upgrades. For example, the shotgun gets a bayonet, but why not instead the M1 Garand? It makes more sense as the shotgun is designed for close quarters. IT'S A SHOTGUN FOR ♥♥♥♥S SAKE! The M1 however is better at long range, and it would make sense that if an enemy catches you off guard that you may have to stick them.\n\nStory is non-existent. There is no reason to care about your fellow soldiers. They're just cannon fodder. Just go mission to mission shooting that and blowing up this. I honestly couldn't care less by the second mission.\n\nHere's an idea, how about make it you're the squad leader, and during mission planning, you choose where to drop. Maybe one drop gets you closer to the enemy, but is very risky, or one takes you to close to good high ground where you can pick off some Germans. This would give merit to the whole 'jumping out of a plane' gimmick, and allowed for a more interesting game.\n\nHaving played Allied Assault, I can easily say its a much better game, despite being much older. Brothers in Arms: Hell's Highway was also based around paratroopers, but did everything much better (except you don't get to jump out of a plane).\n\n8/10 Major Fret's would send this game to the gas chamber.\n","September 5, 2014","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It can give you a real strategic advantage or totally screw you over.\n\nThe weapons are pretty well balanced, with you recieving better guns as you progress through the game. As you use a weapon you can level it up, which adds attachments to said weapon that largely improves it.\n\nNow the enemies...\nMedal of Honor: Airborne has a system where the enemies get tougher as you near the end of the game. Now this would seem like a great idea, if it wasn't for the fact that the tougher enemies get equipped with 1 shot kill weapons such as sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and mg42s.

Got it on sale for $2 dollars.\n\nOnly an hour in and i love it.\n\n\nThe Positives:\nThe graphics are slightly outdated but are still impressive for 2007. The combat is probably the best i've ever played in an FPS. It's immersive and weapon feedback is rather responsive. Crouching system and aiming is pretty authenic. Has lots of realistic aspects too, loved the enemy response times too, lots of cover and fire situations (can get old, but really build up the intensity.) Also loved the soundtrack.\nIt's so amazing how the single-player can be so good.\n\nThe Negatives: The save system is pisspoor, don't really favour the checkpoint system either.\nMissions are way too hard, literally took 54 minutes for me to complete the first one.\nI had to look online to just launch the game (on Windows 8) and multiplayer doesn't work for me, but otherwise it's awesome.\n\nOverall:The game is great. Can't describe it with wording. One of the undderrated gems of the FPS Genre.  Buy it, it's worth even the full price. P.S: Only an hour into the Single-Player and adore it.

Now, the game feels a bit rushed, you can't move and aim like in most FPS games but logically you shouldn't move and aim in the first place. This FPS also adds a lean feature while you aim wich can get you that pesky kill while still in cover. You can also choose which objectives to hit first, nothing pre-determined like in most FPS games. The campaign is a rather short where if counting the tutorial,it is seven missions long, which kills replayability and for an old game with little to no multiplayer, it's a major hit to it. Even though it's an old game, there was a server on the multiplayer I saw with a whopping (and I say that since it's no where nea a new game) fifteen players.

I've played on the highest (Expert) and each mission took me ~ 90-120 minutes (with the exception of the last one which required a LOT of tries) due to slower approach.\n\nI haven't played multi-player yet (and probably never will) so I can't review that part of the game.\n\nThings I liked:\n- Non-linear approach which allows me to land almost anywhere and choose the way I want to beat the given part - this is definitely a unique selling point of the game.\n- Wide selection of weapons and their upgrades. Each weapon has 3 upgrade which gradually unlock after given number of kills.\n- Enemy A.I. which utilizes cover and even though the enemies don't respawn, they're able to create a very tight defense which can provide very long gunfights.\n- Cover system which makes the Expert difficulty challenging, but still fair.\n- Springfield rifle; the best in-game weapon, hands down.\n\nThings I disliked:\n- Unbalanced difficulty in case of otherwise fantastic last level. Groups of MG-42 wielding elite soldiers which can take you down in a second, combined with sparse checkpoints can be quite frustrating.\n- Severe lack of physics. Soldiers are the only in-game entities which are affected by a physics system, which is quite flawed. Some soldiers get thrown back by 5 meters when hit by a bullet. Some others fly 20 meters up when hit by a grenade. Fortunately, these hilarious events are not that common.\n- Weird hitboxes. Some soldiers can survive 2 headshots while others die immediately when hit in their foot.\n- Censorship. I hate Nazis as much as the next guy, but replacing the swastika by a different symbol (regular symmetric cross) is not the right solution, especially in case of a game which takes place during an important part of history. The same with almost no blood - it makes a war game more fun to play which doesn't feel.... right.\n\nNonetheless, I enjoyed the game and will probably play it again some time in the future - and I'd recommend you to do the same.","March 17, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game start ssupers erious but then just dives into cliches and becomes so absurd that there is no way you won't enjoy it. This is not your Brothers in Arms but a bit watered down Wolfenstein. If you want to play one of the last big WW2 FPS's then buy this ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSeriously, make more of this ♥♥♥♥.","March 22, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Got it on sale for $2 dollars.\n\nOnly an hour in and i love it.\n\n\nThe Positives:\nThe graphics are slightly outdated but are still impressive for 2007. The combat is probably the best i've ever played in an FPS. It's immersive and weapon feedback is rather responsive. Crouching system and aiming is pretty authenic. Has lots of realistic aspects too, loved the enemy response times too, lots of cover and fire situations (can get old, but really build up the intensity.) Also loved the soundtrack.\nIt's so amazing how the single-player can be so good.\n\nThe Negatives: The save system is pisspoor, don't really favour the checkpoint system either.\nMissions are way too hard, literally took 54 minutes for me to complete the first one.\nI had to look online to just launch the game (on Windows 8) and multiplayer doesn't work for me, but otherwise it's awesome.\n\nOverall:The game is great. Can't describe it with wording. One of the undderrated gems of the FPS Genre.  Buy it, it's worth even the full price. P.S: Only an hour into the Single-Player and adore it.

Now, the game feels a bit rushed, you can't move and aim like in most FPS games but logically you shouldn't move and aim in the first place. This FPS also adds a lean feature while you aim wich can get you that pesky kill while still in cover. You can also choose which objectives to hit first, nothing pre-determined like in most FPS games. The campaign is a rather short where if counting the tutorial,it is seven missions long, which kills replayability and for an old game with little to no multiplayer, it's a major hit to it. Even though it's an old game, there was a server on the multiplayer I saw with a whopping (and I say that since it's no where nea a new game) fifteen players.

Medal of Honor Airbourne's gameplay is fine but sometimes the enemies can shoot you with the least bit of their heads sticking out of cover with 1337 accuracy, so it's pretty frustrating when that happens because you don't know where the f**k you're getting hit from. The parachute mechanic is really cool with the Airbourne theme and is a cool new addition to the genre.

You need a "legacy" Physx driver just to get the game working, and I kept losing missions because my player would get stuck in walls.  Half the time I'm being jerked around, rubber banded all over the place, and enemies keep appearing unless you cross those invisible lines.  1st review was clouded by those rose colored glasses.  Game doesn't hold up and just feels like an expansion for the older games with more crappy in-game achievements thrown in as an afterthought.\n\nTried and true, MoH delivers once again.  Been a big fan since the first game, and if you like those you'll like this.  The mission objectives are more dynamic which makes you feel like you have more freedom than what most rail shooters offer.  The graphics hold up to present day which is really surprising, still looking better than a lot of console shooters.  This go-around, you get to level your experience with your weapons and doing so unlocks little upgrades which is neat, sort of like the perks in CoD.  Haven't tried MP yet, but I've never been a big fan of MP shooters anyway.  Ironsights are neat, and being able to swap weapons with fallen enemies is nice, too.  One thing I really like is each time you unlock a new tier of Marksmanship with a weapon it goes into extreme slo-mo, still firing on the enemy, which is really satisfying for some reason.  I haven't figured out if the enemies keep respawing until you cross an invisible line ala CoD (something I ♥♥♥♥ing despise) but it doesn't feel like it.

When Steven Spielberg created the first Medal of Honor on the PS1 in 1999, he didn't know that it would change the world of FPS games. Airborne is a really great game, possibly the best in the franchise, and if not a very deserving runner up. The gameplay concept of letting you choose where you want to begin and how you want to complete the objectives is awsome. And if you played the first MoH game or read the story in the game manual, you will notice that in Airborne you play as one of the soldiers in Patterson's regiment mentioned in the MoH 1 story. Overall the game is amazing, a few more missions could've been added, but the multiplayer makes up for the short campaign. For those of you who get the video card error, I found a fix on youtube.

It presents fictional battles during WWII that nevertheless play off of the main storyline. You take the place of an American paratrooper, who works to eliminate the Nazis. Airborne presents a useful upgrading system, where you can improve several weapons based on the number of kills you receive for each. The controls are familiar, but present some new functions that work like a charm, once you get used to them. I did see some small blood puffs, but took a keen eye to place them. The graphics for this game are fairly good, doing a very good job of using the environment and lighting to generate an atmosphere that, along with the soundtrack, fit Airborne like a glove. As for the gameplay itself, I want to say this--Casual is Casual, Normal is Normal, Veteran is Veteran. I highly suggest getting used to the game before advancing to higher levels. The enemies are also class-based--they certainly get tougher later in the game. This is perfectly exemplified by the deadly Nazi Storm Elite trooper, who wears a bulletproof vest, a gas mask, and walks calmly along while carrying a mini-gun. I will never encounter anything scarier in a game than walking around a corner to find myself face-to-face with this horror. All in all, Airborne is a good game, and is definitely worth buying","June 28, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played on the highest (Expert) and each mission took me ~ 90-120 minutes (with the exception of the last one which required a LOT of tries) due to slower approach.\n\nI haven't played multi-player yet (and probably never will) so I can't review that part of the game.\n\nThings I liked:\n- Non-linear approach which allows me to land almost anywhere and choose the way I want to beat the given part - this is definitely a unique selling point of the game.\n- Wide selection of weapons and their upgrades. Each weapon has 3 upgrade which gradually unlock after given number of kills.\n- Enemy A.I. which utilizes cover and even though the enemies don't respawn, they're able to create a very tight defense which can provide very long gunfights.\n- Cover system which makes the Expert difficulty challenging, but still fair.\n- Springfield rifle; the best in-game weapon, hands down.\n\nThings I disliked:\n- Unbalanced difficulty in case of otherwise fantastic last level. Groups of MG-42 wielding elite soldiers which can take you down in a second, combined with sparse checkpoints can be quite frustrating.\n- Severe lack of physics. Soldiers are the only in-game entities which are affected by a physics system, which is quite flawed. Some soldiers get thrown back by 5 meters when hit by a bullet. Some others fly 20 meters up when hit by a grenade. Fortunately, these hilarious events are not that common.\n- Weird hitboxes. Some soldiers can survive 2 headshots while others die immediately when hit in their foot.\n- Censorship. I hate Nazis as much as the next guy, but replacing the swastika by a different symbol (regular symmetric cross) is not the right solution, especially in case of a game which takes place during an important part of history. The same with almost no blood - it makes a war game more fun to play which doesn't feel.... right.\n\nNonetheless, I enjoyed the game and will probably play it again some time in the future - and I'd recommend you to do the same.","March 17, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only time you really got a familiar and frendly sense from your teammates was at the start of each mission where you begin by jumping out of the plane.  Jumping from the plane into the maps each level was great, plus the non linear design made it so you could jump into any part of the map.

It felt a little confused when it came out and it still does today.\n\nThe unique feature of being able to drop anywhere in the map is fun, if i a little limited seeing as map sizes aren't that big. It also limits the story to combat missions where the airborne dropped so you miss out on quite a lot of famous 82nd action.\n\nCombat wise there is a weapon upgrade system which is nice, if not historically accurate. That pretty much sums up the whole game really. It feels more like playing Indianna Jones Airborne (right down to something about the music) rather than a shooter. Enemies can be bullet sponges, guns feel a little weak and the enemy variety and missions towards the end of the game rove into fantasy territory.\n\nIf you haven't played through it and you are looking for a half way decent shooter with a hook, a slightly different take on a familiar setting or you are just bored then it's worth playing. Don't come expecting much and you will be happy.\n\np.s. this is my third play through I fire it up once every 2 years or so just to remember it.\n\n6.75/10\n\np.p.s This score would be in the 7's if it weren't for the fact that the game is very short (yes it has a little replayability but not much)","May 11, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There aren't many weapons; the ones included do mostly feel unique but none feel particularly satisfying. Furthermore, the simplification of ammunition ensures you'll never run out of ammo, and so will never need to switch weapons; this makes loadouts far less interesting and less meaningful and causes the game feel more arcadey. The weapon upgrade system was another of odd arcadey design, I didn't appreciate its implementation. The campaign was terribly short, and the story unfortunately forgettable. The "open world" levels were interestingly designed though relatively small. Mission objectives, while they could be completed in any order, were too often simple and similar which made most missions feel repetitive. Parachuting into the game was really cool and fun, shame the idea wasn't capitalized upon, the small maps and inconsequential mission objectives made drop zones of little importance. The game isn't terrible, its just too short, arcadey, and forgettable for me to recommend.","May 26, 2015","false","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not here, no siree bob. the enemies will swarm you, elites will pulverize you and there are snipers outside, along with halftracks and MG42s.\n\ndo i recommend this game? maybe. if you want a hard game to while away 6 hours then by all means get this. the upgrade system works real well and briefly slows down time so you can get a few extra shots off while the upgrade installs but everyone else should steer clear.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eyec0n11/recommended/24840/","Eyec0n11","Pessimistic Page","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Eyec0n11/","154 products in account","Having rented this game back on the xbox around the time it came out, I had fond memories of a slightly above average WW2 shooter with some great levels. Unfortunately, it seems that nostalgia clouded my recollection of this game.  While not terrible, it is certainly no more than an average WW2 shooter.  Question is, is it worth $10?\n\nIf you have an itch to replay the highly oversaturated WW2 genre of the 2000's, then I would say this game is worth the ten bucks.  If you are just looking for a fun shooter, save your money for one of the million better FPS games out there.\n\nThe hook for this game that attempts to seperate it from other WW2 shooters is that you are a paratrooper.  This is reflected in the the level design through the gameplay mechanic of you begining  the levels by jumping out of a plane and steering where you want to start.  It's an intresting (if a bit shallow) gameplay mechanic that lends to some fun replay value for a few levels.  For example, do you land on streets with your allies, or behind enemy lines in the thick of things? Landing on roofs, towers, and german soldiers before ambushing them is probably the best part of this game.\n\nAs for the shooting itself, its pretty sub par.  Often the bullets will miss their targets for no reason, even when aiming directly at enemies. I understand that the sub machines guns should have a shorter range then rifles, but its just way too short to be taken seriously.  While long range shooting can be more effective, it takes way too long to pick off enemies from a distance, leading to tedious games of whack a mole while germans run around taking multiple shots to the head.  Close range combat is much more fun, but due to the sloopy shooting mechanics its quite dangerous.  In later levels, where the enemies become quite tough, its just not an option you can rely on, and you'll be back to tedious cover shooting.  Another thing to note concerning the shooting and weaponry is that allied weapons become pretty obsolete in the long run.  Since you are  a paratrooper and are dropping into enemy territory, there are not many american weapons laying around.  Since you burn ammo fast due to crappy shooting, you'll often rely on german weapons (which in my opinion are better anyways).  Since you use them more, your weapons will "level up" and upgrade faster, which flat out makes them objectively better.  You can even select them from the drop load out, so there is really no purpose for allied weapons.\n\nThe AI in this game is attrocious.  On your side, your allies are completely useless, standing around and shooting at walls.  The most notable thing they do is step in front of you when you are priming grenades and zooming through scopes, and they are SKILLED at diving in front of your rockets.  As for the enemy AI, it ranges from dead as a doorknob to spawn of hitler.  The AI will often charge you with no sense of self preservation, with sometimes multiple nazi officers running in front of a firing squad to try and melee you.  It also seems that the nazis were researching into psychic powers, as if you aim at an enemy they will literally instantly know where you are and that you are aiming at them.  I cannot count how many times I went to flank an enemy or snuck up on one from a distance only to have them make miracle dodges or just turn around and snipe me.  The AI also only guns for you, which is very annoying.  Simply put, the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nAs for the levels themselves, they range from tedious to imaginative.  There are only six levels in the game, and with multiplayer being dead this is all you have to play with.  I would say two of the levels are great, two are average, one is sub par, and one is ♥♥♥♥.  The last level in particular is the most memorable, and encompases the best that the game has to offer.\n\nAs for the technical side of things, this game is clearly a console port slapped onto PC.  The controls are fine, but the engine doesnt take advantage of the PC and the draw distance is pretty short, which is very noticeable when dropping.  Also, there is WAY TOO MUCH motion blur in this game.  It really can hurt your eyes if you have a larger montior.\n\nBefore rounding out this review, I should mention there are quite a few MURRIKA moments in this game, complete with wailing trumpets and dripping patriotisim.  Its pretty stupid sometimes, and the story is completely forgetable.  It's actually nonexistent, now that I think about it.  There are no real characters and there is no real plot to follow.  Its just shooting things in WW2.\n\nSO, in the end, I would recomend this game ONLY if you really want to play a simple WW2 shooter that isn't Call of Duty. At $10 it's not a rip off, but its not really a deal either.","April 16, 2014","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/residentevilman35/recommended/24840/","residentevilman35","Immortal Asshole","http://steamcommunity.com/id/residentevilman35/","93 products in account","MOH has always been an outstanding series in the FPS genre.  Until, of course, their recent and final release known as Warfighter.  Airborne puts you in a position of the 82nd Airborne division.  Just like Vanguard, you push up through Sicily and into France to clear the way for Operation Overlord; also known as D-Day.\n\nFor a game that released almost seven years ago, its still amazing.  Yeah the controls are a little wacky, especially with the ADS when it comes to completely stopping.  After getting use to the controls, its fun and easy.\n\nWhat I always liked about the MOH series, is that as you progress through the campaign, the missions get harder no matter the difficulty.  The campaign is a good 5-6 hours depending on how much time you take.  Every time you die, the game respawns you back in the plane.  Now, that does sound bad, but it isn't actually, since you get to parachute back down to whatever objectives that was not finished.  I think it was the right step to take when developing this game.\n\nDue to its 32-bit limitations (if pc is 64-bit) it will break in the setup menu.  Just accept everything and start it from there.  The game would keep crashing if you do not proceed.\n\nEverything else that's in the game, I would rather for you to figure it out and expierence yourself.  Ima give this game an 8.9/10 just due to the 32-bit limitations.","June 25, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When Steven Spielberg created the first Medal of Honor on the PS1 in 1999, he didn't know that it would change the world of FPS games. Airborne is a really great game, possibly the best in the franchise, and if not a very deserving runner up. The gameplay concept of letting you choose where you want to begin and how you want to complete the objectives is awsome. And if you played the first MoH game or read the story in the game manual, you will notice that in Airborne you play as one of the soldiers in Patterson's regiment mentioned in the MoH 1 story. Overall the game is amazing, a few more missions could've been added, but the multiplayer makes up for the short campaign. For those of you who get the video card error, I found a fix on youtube. I will post the link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH8OKlOmNpQ. But this game is worth your 10 dollars and you not be disappointed.

This was the best Medal of Honor EA has ever made! They should go back to these gold olds and scrap the CODish Medal of honors. This really brought me back. Put this game in your library today! Just some help though. If you have a laptop or desktop that has dedicated graphics make sure that you go to control panel and run this game with high performace card. There is a setup application also you will need to do the same with that. I had a problem also with blacked out characters on the screen. Make sure to set the games resolution to the same as your desktop in the setup app. That fixed that problem for me. I loved this game. It is a little short. I beat in a couple of hours.","March 13","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You constantly respond when you die, which is good, because you will do crazy stuff to advance, and often die often. The missions are long, when and heavy in combat. The enemy constantly respond when they die, thus you have to move to advance and stop these respond for a little while. And lastly don't play the hero, when alone, because you will be overwhelmed and easily killed. Its a good game, but for the easiest setting is like overkill.","March 20","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very simple.\n\nIt was a great game for its time, but I really do just hate the accuracy of the guns. For example, even if you shoot straight at an enemy's head, with your ironsights, you may or may not get a headshot. I don't know why it does that, but it is really annoying and ruins the experience. It's fine if there is a lot of recoil to the guns or the bullets have a certain effect that you have to adjust to, but no, with this game, even if you think you are dead on, you will miss half your shots by some random calculation, especially if you are trying to go for headshot medals.\n\nThe other problem wrong with the mouse controls is that the ironsights sensitivity is much quicker than the hipfire sensitivity on all the guns. Normally it would be the other way around, where ironsights would slow down to help with your accuracy, but no, with this game everything is backwards in regards to mouse controls.\n\nAnyway, I will recommend this game as most people who pick this up will probably not have good mouse control awareness and therefore will probably enjoy the difficulty of picking off the enemies, and of course, all the history about the Airborne.","January 18","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nhmarine/recommended/24840/","nhmarine","PewPewSkittles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nhmarine/","127 products in account","This game is terrible. The multiplayer is broken, and the campaign's infuriating lack of tactics, one-track combat, the weapon's terrible accuracy, repetitiveness, not to mention the scope fog that is simply ridiculous when it remains unfocused despite having a line of sight to a distant target, are all unparalelled by the game's single most idiotic feature: the glitches. Weapons disappear in your hands, the sound files for firing a weapon and music suddenly deactivate, resulting in silent shots that make you wonder "did I fire, or am I still pulling back the bolt on this Springfield?" or "Where is the enemy fire coming from? I can't hear the attacker at all," and the inconsistency of accuracy for all weapons but the sniper rifles make this game superb. Superbly terrible.\nIt's good features are that it has a dynamic AI, an alluring unlock system, and an engaging feeling of envolvement in the second World War, as do all Medal of Honor games, but the glitches and the idiocy of many of the game's features make it nearly unplayable. It is not at all worth the price, for you will get nothing but frustration from the campaign and boredom from the multiplayer.","February 21, 2013","false","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
