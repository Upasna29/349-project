The game centers around voice/text commands to your robot 'minions' to indirectly solve puzzles, using specially designed software to understand and respond to what you say.   It's definitely a fun reminder of the classic text-command adventure games where half the amusement was trying out words to see what works (flashback to fond childhood memories of typing in 'pick nose' to either gain a lockpicking level or instantly die from spearing your brain). With Bot Colony, you can skip the keyboard and speak directly to the robots to make things happen!\n\nThe voice command system is a neat idea, and  I would have loved to see it fleshed out into a fully finished game.  Unfortunately, in this early build there are still issues with a rather laggy interface and a few bugs cropping up here and there, all of which greatly slow down gameplay. Ideally these issues would have been fixed down the line to smooth out the experience, but it looks like development on the game is pretty much ending due to budget issues.\n\nDespite the unresolved flaws in its 'Early Access' state, Bot Colony is still worthy of support for providing a unique experience, and one that could certainly help expand the gaming genre.  After toying around for a while, I can certainly see how in a few years, voice-commands might be a new standard for adventure games like this.  If you get a chance, try it out!","April 28, 2015","true","3.0"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

It aimed to be the first game where you truly interacted with the characters through holding conversations with them. But it wasn’t until this month that the potential of this system was was hinted at through an update that introduced a need to pry information out of one of the characters .\n\nThe task was to gain access to 14 recorded videos in an attempt to piece together the events of the last 48 hours in the home of a Nakagawa Robot Corp. employee. To do this required talking to Jimmy, a robot servant left in the house. And when I say talking, I actually mean talking. Either through speech recognition with a microphone or typing, Jimmy was capable of responding to questions posed in naturally flowing English.\n\nThis certainly makes a refreshing change to only selecting from predefined dialogue options. And had the potential of revolutionizing interaction with game characters. Unfortunately, Bot Colony will cease to be playable in mid March. The result of not enough units being sold to cover the cost of running the server that processes the speech input, let alone paying for further development.\n\nThere was a lot of promise in Bot Colony, and anyone interested in seeing that should check the store page on Steam. While no longer purchasable, one of the videos does cover the story as it would have unfolded. It is a shame that Bot Colony slipped under the radar, a likely victim of Steam’s increasing release schedule and lack of promotion. Had it done well it could have been a hit. When the game shuts down, I’m going to miss my conversations with Jimmy.","February 10, 2015","true","6.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

So far, playing it is more of a struggle than entertainment...\n\nI am aware that Bot Colony is an Early Access Game, but still, this build is not playable by far. I'm afraid i wouldn't even be wrong if i would say that there is literally almost nothing in Bot Colony that works as it should... Let's start with the game's motto: "The Game You Speak With". This is the main reason why anybody would pay attention to it, but unfortunately in the end the player will find out that this is actually "The Game Which Doesn't Understand You". That's it. I've said it. Natural language understanding is just not ready to be implemented in a game. It wil get you right about one time out of ten. Other then that you'll get replies like "I don't know what you mean".\n\nLeaving Natural language understanding aside, the game is also full of bugs and glitches. Most players will give up on Bot Colony during the tutorial. It took me about 15 tries and a terrible headache to do it. It was a bit funny at the beginning watching the robot do some crazy stuff, like picking up 2 chairs at once and not being able to get rid of them or make the flower vase levitate above the table, but it was becoming more and more annoying with every step i was advancing through the game. I've also lost connection to the server several times while playing getting the message "Waiting for the robots to wake up", not even mentioning the amount of times i received the reply "Let me think" after giving the robot a command, just so that after 30 second he'll come back with "I don't know what you mean".\n\nWithout any doubt it had some promising perspectives and with a lot of more work, time and money it could've moved the adventure genre to a whole new level, but i'm afraid that's all what's gonna be left of it since the developers already pulled the plug on Bot Colony and the servers will be dead on March 15, leaving the game unplayable.","March 2, 2015","false","30.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

Often you'll tell the robots to move things, and it'll turn out that that was the wrong thing to do, it's completely irreversible, and you need to start the game over. I restarted many times and eventually gave up.\n\nThe natural language understanding that was supposed to make this game so awesome seems like it's on par with text adventures from the 80s... not much beyond "VERB NOUN."\n\nIt's too bad; the concept is good, and it sounded like the story could be great as well.","August 7, 2014","false","2.4"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","25","40","0","0"

The Early Access period has surpassed a year due to financial problems stemming from a lack of sales. Without having a purchase option, one must realistically see how this might not be resolved quickly and why progress becomes halted.\n\nEven with a potentially bleak outcome, I do recommend the game as it is fairly priced for what it successfully provides. Although not always fully functional, the voice recognition is more than sufficient in offering a unqie experience not seen elsewhere in the Steam store and implemented well within the gameplay. The robots recognizing text-based commands alone is entertaining enough. The game does not solely rely on that as a selling point either, as it is also visually pleasing and contains an intriguing story (although it is likely to remain an open-ended tale). I do hope the purchase option returns but for the time being head to the discussions at the following link and learn how you can nab a Steam key for this currently removed game while also supporting the developer.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/263040/discussions/0/606068060836404191/\n\nAgain, I stress that the game is worth it at face value.

I usually do not purchase Early Access games, but I'm a total nerd for Asimov's Robot books and this game's notion of robots seems pretty reflective of Asimov's characterization of robots and their interaction with humans. I'm also a computational linguist, so the inclusion of NLU (Natural Language Understanding) had me very curious as well. NLU is complicated to achieve since meaning needs to be derived from an utterance, which sometimes means inferences must be made, but I think it works pretty well in this game, especially for the game being Early Access. I'd love to see the NLU improved and extended to other genres of games. But I think the first implementation--dealing with robots that don't always understand pragmatics--is a perfect first implementation.","June 29, 2014","true","11.6"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","20","32","0","0"

The closest thing there is at this point to virtual reality which doesn't require you to invest millions (which isn't the case for the developers).\n\nUnfortunately, the developers have limited time and resources in graphics design and smooth gameplay, which I would sympathize with as their main objective was the refinement of interactivity. As far as I am concerned this is a big leap forward in game development.\n\nSome would say that such concept is way ahead of its time, but I say "It's about time!"\n\nFrom the developers comments, this project was to be retired due to lack of sales and insane upkeep costs.

As it currently stands, the game is more of a testament to what it could be rather than anything.  Basically, the idea is that you are required to interact with robots in order to perform some rudimentary tasks like rearranging furninture.  You do this by talking to them via a microphone.\n\nUnfortunately if you don't have a good quality mic, the voice recognition suffers.  It also takes a good bit of training to get it to really recognize your voice.  This is probably more than any normal gamer is going to want to be bothered with, however if you DO persevere, it's somewhat fascinating.  The only other game that seems to have attempted this was a game on the Dreamcast called "Seaman".\n\nThis game lacks the whimsical charm of Seaman and it's a lot more serious.  You also seem to have a lot more freedom in the way you can teach the bots to interact with you.  That's right, the bots actually learn from you.  It starts out with just a few basic commands for movement, item manipulation, and other things, and when you issue a command the bot doesn't understand, you have the option to teach it how to perform the command using a series of steps from the commands he already knows.\n\nI think this could have been the real hook to this game.  The "plot" to the story would be a side-quest compared to just trying to teach your bot to do things with a series of basic commands. Still, at times I felt like I was wrestling with the bot to get it to perform an action, not because the bot had a lack of understanding but because the voice recognition was stubbornly refusing to hear a certain word.   For example, I'd say cushion, the game would hear "question".\n\nAs with most forms of voice recognition, it works best with the commands it expects to hear.  If you say "what is this" and click on something it invariably works.  If you have to be more detailed in your command, expect a word or two to be misheard.  Thankfully if you can't get it to understand at all, you can always type the command in directly.\n\nStill, if this game had a ton of people talking to it and teaching it, who knows?  It could have become Skynet...and then when Valve decided to pull the plug on it, it would unleash terminators to rearrange all our furniture.

Although you currently can't purchase the game from the Steam page, the dev is still selling Steam keys to anyone who understands that the game will probably be shut down and unplayable after this month (March).  If you don't mind this caveat, I wholeheartedly recommend that you try out this game before it's gone forever.\n\nLong Review:  I first played Bot Colony about a year ago before it was released on Steam.  At that time, the robots didn't understand enough commands to make the game interesting.  Solving puzzles was more about trying to guess which commands the robots recognized than it was about trying to deal with the robot's unique understanding of the world.\n\nFast forward a year, and I find out that not only has the game been released on Steam, but it is shutting down in a month for lack of funding!  You see, every time you ask one of the robots a question, it sends that question to some language-parsing servers to analyze and reply to your question.  Apparently the sales for Bot Colony have been so low that they could no longer afford this extra step, which would render the game unplayable as soon as the servers are shut down.\n\nI was pretty disappointed because I really wanted to try the game one more time, but luckily the dev was still selling keys to those interested.  I got the game, and the improvements over the last year were everything I had hoped for.  While the robots still rarely do what you want them to, it's no longer due to the fact that they don't recognize certain commands so much as they take everything you say literally.  For example, when I ask the robot to "pick up the cup", he asks "which one?" and then proceeds to list every cup in the house.  Or, when I tell the robot to "put the block on the dresser above the blue drawer", he balances the block precariously on the very edge of the drawer.  As a result, Bot Colony has changed from a rather boring "guess the right word" game, into a game where you really have to consider the inner logic of the robot's mind.  At its core it's an adventure game, but the language element adds a really unique puzzle element that I've never seen in another game before.\n\nOf course, the game is still an early access game, so there are a few rough edges as well.  The walk speed seems a bit too slow for me, so I was constantly running everywhere in the game.  There was also one bug that required me to restart the level (outlined below), but it was so funny that it's hard not to forgive it.\n\nAll in all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game even though it will likely be shut down next month.  As long as you understand that the gameplay is about trying to get a somewhat overly-logical robot to follow your commands you should be able to get a lot of enjoyment out of the game within the next few weeks.  Check the forums on the Steam hub if you are interested in buying one of the remaining Steam keys from the dev!\n\nAnd because I like to have my cake and eat it too, here's the joke review that I originally wanted to post:\n\nIn the very first mission of the game you must complete an objective by giving commands to your prospective boss' house robot.  I told the robot to pick up what I thought was a pepper shaker, but instead of going for the object I was looking at the robot went over to open a cupboard.  Realizing that the robot was going to pick up the wrong object, I quickly said, "Stop!" and the robot froze in mid-action with the cupboard door half-open.\n\n"Ok, now go back"\n\n...\n\n"Go backwards"\n\n...\n\n"Turn left"\n\n...\n\n"Go"\n\n...\n\n"Continue moving"\n\n...\n\n"I just froze you, didn't I?"\n\n...\n\n10/10 Would crash a multi-millionaire's robot butler again.","March 5, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Each robots have their own memories and experiences. This particularity give you multiples way to finish a “mission” and helps to increase the length of the game :)\n\nSadly the server used by the game will soon be shut down because they didn’t sell enough copy, hopefully they will find a solution.\n\nIf you manage to grab a copy play it and spread the words this will help North Side and show to others studio that games like this one have a potential.\n\nTo conclude, the game is fun to play and it's really rewarding when the robots understand you :D","March 21, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Not a peep? Experiencing detachment and regret...}\n\n\nOkay, I'll give this a shot. In no particular order:\n\nPost-buy reaction: I don't regret picking up Bot Colony while it was on special.\n\nFirst Impressions: Bot Colony provided me and my girlfiend with a solid 2 hours of entertainment and goofy times. That first experience alone was worth the purchase. I think the off sale price is a little high TBH. We had a good time messing around with Jimmy and the house in the first episode. It's really quite unique as a game idea.\n\nReviewer Profile: I'm a shooter player, action game player, and RPG player. I was drawn to this game by the Early Access section and the sale price, and the visuals and videos sold me. I love the idea of an experimental island that people live on, but it's mostly run by robots of a big robotics firm.\n\nStability: This game is in alpha, hence the Early Access. You can get a sense for where the polish and tweaking will go. My game downloaded, installed, and booted up well on Windows 8, 64-bit. One of the negative reviews is a guy who couldn't run the game on his 32-bit Windows. 64-bit is listed in the specs. My frame rate was solid, and the game looks pretty good (stylised art, not hyper-real). I had a crash to desktop when loading a level.\n\nFun Factor: I think the 'fun' is in discovering how to deal with the AI. It's interesting how you can lead them down a chain of discussion sometimes. [Spoiler-ish] Jimmy has some pretty detailed information about the house and what happened in episode 1. The bots in episode 2 aren't as unique (but visually they're distinct), and the airport robots all share some neat background info about the bad guy and various organizations.\n\n- The character you start controlling in episode 2 is pretty sluggish (and the male character runs like he has a cucumber up his ♥♥♥♥), but it's manageable. The mechanics seem like they will need to be polished.\n\nYou can complete episode 2, but I think the level is missing some characters and gameplay, because if you look around there are a few areas that look like they're supposed to be used for something.\n\nOne thing I found cool and I didn't see the tutorial explain it: When you get your PDA you can open it and use Robot Info when talking to a robot to 'download' the robot's specs/model info to the PDA.\n\n- Speech Options: The first time I played Bot Colony (and had a fun, wacky session), we didn't even use the mic. We just typed our messages or questions and listened to Jimmy on speakers. I only went back much later and bothered to create a speech profile and do the training. Even then, I still like to type most of the time. Generally speaking, speech recognition still isn't quite good enough.\n\n- In any case, you can SPEAK and TYPE in the same area of the interface, at the same time, and correcting if needed.\n\n\nWeak points:\n\n- It's an alpha that gets you two early completable episodes and the third one included as pre-order (coming later).\n\n- It's a bit rough. Sometimes, the dialogue jumped between robots. I had some weird behavior with that patroller robot outside.\n\n- The UI and Hud visuals are a bit too minimal sci-fi. I suppose this is a subjective thing.\n\n- The Splinter Cell guy that you control for a bit in episode 1 is sketchy. It also feels like it's missing something outside. Maybe this is just a hopeful alpha observation, or it's only the police patroller outside.\n\n- Not enough marketing for this game before early access. I would have probably supported it earlier, just to see where it goes.\n\nBottomline: Buy it on sale if you're curious about an experimental speech-driven adventure game.","June 29, 2014","true","3.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

It's both a third and first-person adventure (different scenarios feature different perspectives depending on who or what you're controlling at the time) which makes things interesting. I've had the opportunity to try out both text and speech commands and I'm highly impressed by how responsive and easy it is to communicate in the game.  A bit of trial and error is necessary to figure out certain procedures (and indeed figure out what to do) but I found that part of the fun.  In a way, the errors and breakdown of communication are part of what makes the game more immersive.\n\nI'm also extremely pleased that the game has at least another month's lease on life and that there's the real possibility of it coming back to availability on wide release.  This is a fairly ambitious game with innovative mechanics that needs time for you to experience how rich the game world is, in addition to teaching both yourself and the game how to interpret your commands.","March 8, 2015","true","2.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
