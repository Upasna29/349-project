I only paid $2, but no updates, no achievements, literally no effort put into doing anything other than a bare bones port is just pathetic. If ever they come back to this and put some effort or new levels in, I'll change my review.","March 19","false","11.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I almost had to ask for help a few times.  Almost.\n\nI really wish they'd sync their ports, though.  The number of levels included in the Steam, iPad and Chrome ports are all over the place.  And this game is just begging for a level editor + Steam Workshop.\n\nStill, a fantastic game, especially for $5.  9/10","March 13, 2015","true","6.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, if you're a completionist (like me) this game can become rage enducing. The puzzles become more complicated as you progress through the game. And although I question it's logic at some points, it's still very fun and would recommend to anyone that's a fan of simple puzzle games like this.","June 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
