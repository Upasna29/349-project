The game clearly takes inspiration of those and even wears some of the design decisions on its sleeve. Ofcourse there is absolutely nothing wrong with that when its done well.\n\nAnd well they did!\n\nLet's look at the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n-------\n- Fun and varied gameplay\n- Great and fitting soundtrack for each individual level\n- Cute characters and simple story\n- Varied and well designed environments\n- Fairly good port from the PS2\n- Addicting to get 100%\n\nCons:\n--------\n- Framerate drops in certain areas (Early Access)\n- Sometimes questionable level design (example: certain spikes emerging out of the ground are unavoidable)\n- Most boomerangs you get throughout the game are pretty much worthless as they get overshadowed by others.\n- Sometimes janky camera which can make you miss your jump\n(i got used to it and actually didnt mind the camera in the long run)\n\nSubjective Cons:\n--------------------\n- Awkward dialogue from time to time\n- I've noticed people have been annoyed by the recurring "introduction talk" of "Maury" the bird, who is essentially your guide, much like the fairy "Navi" from "The Legend Of Zelda" who keeps on annoying you with her "listen"! While i personally wasnt irritated by it, i can see why others where. Almost every 10 meters the game comes to a halt, throws in a cutscene and "wants" you to listen to what you need to do (you can skip it though). The frequent cutscenes only happen in the first level and it does make sense to put them there but they could have went about conveying information in a different way. On the other hand you have to keep in mind that this game was initially directed towards a younger audience.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n-----------------\nIf you enjoy/enjoyed 3D platformers like Super Mario 64 (or, for the newer generation, Jack & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank etc.) then this is one you should definitley pick up. It's just as fun as i remember it to be back in the days of the PS2 and i can't recall a dull moment with it whilst playing it again on Steam!\n\nFinal verdict:\n--------------\n9.0/10\nwith the "FUN STAMP" of approval!","March 27","true","17.9"," 35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","35","35","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psn_gustaviaable/recommended/411960/","psn_gustaviaable","Gustavia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psn_gustaviaable/","246 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nNow I got really surprised when I saw the first game of one of my favorite game franchises as a child on Steam. I never played this game though since I never managed to get my hands on it when I was young but I played the second game Bush Rescue religiously and even then this game managed to make me feel super nostalgic with the Australian themed soundtrack, the sound effects I recognized from Bush Rescue and to just see Ty on my screen once again.\n\nNow there are some things you need to know before purchasing this game. Ty the Tasmanian Tiger was originally developed for the PS2 so this game is a port and since the PS2 differs a lot from todays computers and modern day consoles there are some issues plaguing the game. First, the game lacks a lot of options you expect a modern day PC game to have, there are right now at the 24th of March 2016 only three options and those are shadows, reflections and render distance. Second, the game has performance issues sadly but according to the developers that's because the game was originally locked to 30FPS and with updated graphics and unlocked framerate the game suffers from severe frame drops here and there. The option that tanks your framerate the most is the shadows so if you want 60 all the time then turn off shadows completely, but on some levels you can still have 60 with shadows on so you can also switch back and forth on the go. But all these issues is why the game is in early access, the complete game is here, I've already beaten the game but the developers need funds to upate the game so it will match modern day games with a bunch of graphics options and fixed performance so expect this game to be pretty darn great in the near future if enough people buy the game. And if this game sells well then they will port and update Ty 2 and 3 to Steam as well.\n\nThe gameplay is your standard collect-a-thon platformer with a bunch of stuff to collect like cute small imprisoned Bilbies, Opals, Golden Cogs that you use to get different types of Boomerangs, Thunder Eggs which is the items you collect to drive the story forwards, Rainbow Scales which will give you more HP if you collect them all and Picture Frames which unlocks concept art and if you collect them all you unlock a movie. There are several types of boomerangs for you to unlock and use, ice boomerangs which freezes enemies and lets you create ice blocks on water for you to walk on, explosives boomerangs that will annihilate your enemies and a boomerangs which bounces from enemy to enemy. The combat is pretty solid as well, enemies die from one to two hits and it's always fun to throw your boomerangs on the enemies while jumping around on platforms and collecting a bunch of stuff.\n\nThe story, like the gameplay is pretty simple too. You play as Ty who is a young brave Tasmanian Tiger whos parents got imprisoned by Boss Cass while they where defending the Talismans which are the MacGuffins of this story since Boss Cass wants them to take over the world and Ty and his friends wants them to restore balance and peace. You travel around from level to level collecting items like Opals and Bilbies to earn Thunder Eggs which your Koala friend Julius needs to power his Talisman finding machine so you can find the Talismans before Boss Cass does.\n\ntl;dr\nPositive:\n+Nice fluid gameplay\n+Pretty great soundtrack that matches the Australian feel of the game\n+A bunch of different weapons\n+Tons of collectibles\n+Great level design\n+Fun characters\n\nNegative:\n-Limited graphical options and performance issues as of 24/3 - 16\n-Pretty easy final boss\n-Shazza's race on the Outback Safari level\n-Game does not include Batarangs","March 23","true","16.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","21","21","4","0"

The characters were funny, it had references that I actually understood (because its Australian made, not American made), and it allowed you to explore, and do everything at your pace. Fast or slow, right or wrong; you always got there in the end.\n\nIt is a testament to the developers of game, that this game is still damn amazing to play today, and even more so, that they are porting this game to the PC.

I've completely forgotten about this series and how good it was back on the PS2 and Gamecube. This was one of my first PS2 games back then and I enjoyed every moment of this classic hidden gem of a game.\n\nBut childhood memories aside is this game still good to this day??? HELL YES IT IS!!!\n\nIf you like games such as Super Mario 64/Sunshine/Galaxy, Donkey Kong 64, Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, and Sly Cooper you will definitely enjoy this game. There is a good variety of levels to explore, meet funny characters, and find all the collectible items to progress through the story and some involve short little mini-games. You will unlock new boomerangs each having unique abilities to make you change your strategy towards enemies or obstacles. Keyboard & Mouse needs a little bit of work to make the game control well but for now I highly recommend you play with a controller-since we are use to it for this game-and some graphical glitchies seem to occur shadows around trees and draw distance for grass needs improvement cause of the insane amount of pop-in.\n\nSo Mate!

This was originally the first game I owned on PS2 and I never expected it to come on PC so replaying it is a total nostalgia blast. In addition to that, it's a very solid remaster so far with significantly improved graphics over the original, especially with artwork, shadows, grass, view distance and reflections. Some textures are HD-fied as well but there's still obviously old textures in places but it's not too distracting. Devs are really quick with patches to address performance issues and whatnot too.\n\nGameplay wise it's a very solid platformer with very varied and open ended levels with LOTS of exploring and collecting to do in each. It's a bit on the easy, chill side but that just makes it all the more fun to try to 100%. Plus it's uh....Australian to the extreme. :P Beaut of a game (you can kill me now pan).","March 24","true","5.9"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","1"

If you loved TY the Tasmanian Tiger on PS2, Xbox or, like I did, on GameCube, then you will have a wonderfully nostalgic time flinging curved sticks at Frills and seaching every nook and crannie for items while collecting even more items this time around in the form of achievements!\n\nIf you've never played TY before, but enjoy 3D platformers and are looking for some sweet collectathon action, look no further than this game to scratch that itch. There's tons of things to see and collect while exploring the beautiful Australian outback. Talk with endearing characters, fight humorous and challenging enemies, and experience a simple, fun story that sets up a great world to have even greater adventures in.\n\nIf you're playing with KBM, you will find the controls to be a great fit, utilizing a take on WASD for TY movement, rang switching and context actions, while the mouse controls the camera and offensive options. As of this review, Krome updated the swimming controls on KBM from the controller-tuned WASD for movement to a more natural mouse-based style. These new controls feel very nice and are a great step up from the older controls.\n\nThe game does have its rough and unpolished pieces as the HD process is gradually applied, but it is perfectly playable in its current form and I highly recommend this game to everyone, especially if you enjoyed and miss 3D platformers.","April 11","true","16.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

What a wonderful nostalgic feeling it is to replay my very first and favourite Playstation 2 game on PC in High Definition, such a really great port too!\n\nRunning silky smooth with no lag or errors or anything, the controls feel tighter and more responsive than ever, little tweaks have been made to make it a really great experience, the colours are bright, sharp, and the whole game looks and plays amazingly.\n\nTy, for those unaware, is a 3D action platformer, in the vein of Spyro the Dragon or Banjo Kazooie (although I always thought it would be as if Crash Bandicoot was made into a 3D open world platformer, judging by the style, enemies, location) Whilst platformers were more abundant than hydrogen back in 2002, its so fresh and awesome to see a classic platformer like this getting a facelift and being released on PC in 2016. I absolutely loved this game when it came out and having played it for an hour this evening, straight on launch, my rose tinted spectacles were not needed. The game is amazing, fun, slightly silly but genuinely exciting. Its easy enough for newcomers to platforming won't have too much of a challenge at first, but enough so that veterans will have a great time searching every huge level for every single shiny thing to collect. I really love the plinky plonky sound collecting opals makes, and just enjoying the feeling of running around on the beach in ship rex, its like liquid nostalgia is dripping through my PC.\n\nAs for other thoughts, I would be interested to see antialiasing turned on (rather than being forced by my graphics card) as when I first booted the game up, there wasn't any. Perhaps a few more options considering it is running on PC? (The game had a hard time deciding which of my multiple monitors to run on at first) it would be cool to alter a lot more in depth settings the game has to offer. I'm assuming it being early access the textures will be upgraded? Like on the boomerang start menu, it is very low textured, the same with some parts of some levels. At the moment it feels like its a 1:1 port of the PS2, lets aim to make Ty feel comfortable in 2016, yeah?\n\nThank you for bringing Ty out of retirement and back into the real world again, its been too long. I had a glint of hope supporting Ty 4 on PC would reinitialize the franchise, so glad to see it paid off!\n\n","March 21","true","2.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

If you ever enjoyed Ty on the older consoles, this is certainly something you should pick up.\n\nFirst off, as stated, 4 worlds in so far. Zero bugs found (some dodgy camera work if walking through a narrow walkway / door. But that's easily sorted by tilting the camera.\n\nJudging by the achievements, it seems as though the game is incomplete. As i have 4 maps complete, currently sat at 42% game completion. So this feels like there are only 9 available levels so far (10% per level), plus 10% for the home world. I could be wrong. But this is my observations so far.\n\nRegardless if the game is currently only half complete, if you enjoyed it 14 years ago, chances are you will enjoy it today!\n\nEDIT:Worth noting, i used an XBox controller to play the game, so i have no experience or recommendation regarding keyboard and mouse use.\n\nAlso, the game maintained a solid 60FPS throughout gameplay, however. i have a fairly powerful machine, so results could vary drastically\n\nEDIT 2:Having completed the game, i can confirm that it i was incorrect about the game being incomplete. Every level is there, i just remembered the game being a lot bigger.\n\nBugs! throughout the entire game, i only experienced 3 bugs, and only 2 of them have any effect on your gameplay/\n\nBug 1: Opals missing, found them in trees. Leaving the level and loading it back up placed the opals back where they should be. This only happened once, on the map "Lyre Lyre pants on fire"\n\nBug 2: graphical glitch in the sky on "Rex Marks the Spot". Hardly anything to cry about\n\nBug 3: The "Free Boat Battle" mission on "Rex Marks the Spot" cannot be completed, the NPC just repeats the quest line over and over instead of giving you the thunder Egg.\n\n\nHopefully these bugs will be fixed, but other than that. an awesome game, All the nostalgia. I hope older N64 and PS1 / PS2 get ported over. This has reminded me how amazing video games can be, with very little in the way of story, graphics or big budgets\n\n100% recommend!\n\nEDIT 3The 3 bugs i had encountered during gameplay have now been fixed (as well as many others that i didn't encounter.)\n\nAlso top notch work from the devs, interacting with the community on a regular basis to improve and update the game.","March 22","true","17.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

I like to think that Ty was a great role model for me when I was younger.\n\nI had nothing BUT Ty, and we hung out together all the time; even warranting further playthoughs because I had the time. No one understood why I loved Ty so much, and some people are just now hearing about him. I personally think it's rather shameful. As with a LOT of underrated games that I enjoy to the fullest, Ty was one of them. But little did I realize that he was more popular than I led myself to believe, as with how I see all these people here on Steam who do, in fact, love him. They love Krome Studios for holding onto the rights to Ty for so long, and with such little funds behind them. But later last year, they pushed out a fourth installmen to this series, and by golly, did people throw ther money at Krome. And with that money, they re-released this first indstallment, in HD.\n\nAnd again, by golly...<3\n\n\nIt's all here—the core mechanics from the original release for Gamecube, PS2, and XBOX. Every level is the same, the overworld is the same. Every thing at all is the same, but that's DEFINITELY not a bad thing, as it's what the fans loved from before, and still do, and will forever.\n\n-------\n\nFor new players, read here:\n\nThe gameplay is by NO means lackluster, while it may be simple. It really is an easy 3D platformer with its own collection of...collectibles for you to find. A lot of them are really out in plain sight, but with a lot of those that are in plain sight, you'll sometimes need to get a certain 'rang' in order to gain access to it and grab it. And all of these collectibles help you out in the main game as well. You'll see~\n\nThe game—assuming you're new—would probably last you about 5 or 6 or even 7 hours alone, and FULL completion can take you as long as you'd like it to.\n\nI won't say anything about the story, because if you're one of those who is just now learning how loved this series is, it's best to let you experience it for yourself, completely blind, if you're up for it.\n\nYes, this is Early Access right now, and there are minor—I repeat, MINOR—errors in the game. No real bugs, or anything truly game-breaking, as the game has only needed to be rewritten in every regard. And as with Early Access, you would encounter these should you purchase the game, and your interest turns to adoration (though you might not appreciate the game as much as all of us prior fans do.) But Krome is VERY responsive ALL over the place: Facebook, Twitter, in the Steam discussions... Everywhere. None of your input will be missed, whether it be helpful input from this Early Access period, or just admiration for this game and how amazing in every way it is.\n\nI agree—the price is a bit much if you're just jumping onto the bandwagon, and also assuming you have neither of the games that would give you a small discout; and even with the early access discount, too. But again, going back to how I started this off:\nUs fans will GLADLY give Krome our money in hopes that they regain financial stability to become as great as they were before, and it's just so cool that they're still here<3","March 21","true","32.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This game is not early access, it is a complete game that is being improved above and beyond what it used to be. The devs are putting out weekly updates with bug fixes, optimization, and new content. Ive encountered very few issues with this title, small graphical altrications, and a single case of a collectible floating out of my reach. After a simple exit to the hub and return, it was on the ground as intended. Overall this is a timeless title getting the love it deserves from its player base and developers.

I was so glad when I heard they were porting this game to PC and re-doing the textures. It's exactly how I remember it, except for some new great looking textures. The game itself is a fun lighthearted 3D platformer, lots to do, great level variation and fun platforming. Each level is completely different and offers some brilliant music along with interesting strange characters.There is a sense of accomplishement from collecting the little collectibles hidden in the map, you can obtain multiple new boomerangs from these collectibles. The game looks beautiful with so many colors and interesting enviroments. The voice acting is not the best, but what can you really expect from a 15 year old game with a reasonably low budget. I have noticed a few issues here and there. In the very first cutscene the audio gets really out of sync with the video towards the end of it. Sometimes the camera will just lose Ty completely, but only for a couple of seconds, this usually happens when getting out of the water. I haven't really noticed too many techincal issues other than a very few amount of frame drops, and they weren't too big either.\nI would absolutely reccomend picking this game up, and if its your first time playing it, I envy you.\nIn its current state, I would give this game a 9.5/10.

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSome kids grew up with hundreds of other mascot platformers. I, along with many others, had TY the Tasmanian Tiger as my entry into 3D platforming games.\n\nAside from my nostalgia, the game has remained competent if nothing else. Time has been generous to TY by how a once oversaturated market of 3D platformers feels refreshing nowadays by its scarcity.\n\nHowever, let's be honest about TY: You won't find anything groundbreaking if you've played plenty of Collect-A-Thons before, and if you haven't played TY since the GC days then you'll probably find a lot more problems than you would as a kid.\n\nIt's the style (both artistic and musical) are what transform the mediocrity of TY's substance into a platforming zen-like experience. Nothing brutal for challenge, yet nothing too dull to bore you. That is what might interest new players who are curious to give the game a try.\n\nSo Let's Talk\nThis game was originally released back in 2003. You can probably pick up the game on Amazon for the same price (or perhaps lower) as the PC "Early Access" version. If Early Access implementation bothers you, then you should wait for its released status.\n\nThe main difference between the console versions and the PC is the performance boost and "remastered" (not remake) visuals. Wide-screen support (no black-bar boxes), improved textures, shadows and other visual details and the 60 FPS change are what the PC port will offer.\n\nThe game right now is content complete. Aside from some optomization issues and one odd bug for a side-quest, there is nothing that will prevent you from beating the game. Krome has been upfront about why they went through Early Access, and I have zero doubts it will not be done.\n\nTY 2 and 3 will also be brought to Steam at a later date, which I have been told by a developer that those two games run on a new engine compared to TY 1. These two will be released individually, not as a bundle despite sharing the same engine.\n\nI personally think this is a harmless usage of EA as the developers are upfront, the game is "done", and there's nothing that will ruin your experience (aside from visual issues or one or two bugs).\n\nOutbacking with a Possum\nAs another Collect-A-Thon, TY derives a lot more from what worked in the past rather than innovate the genre. This works to the game's favor as it avoids forcing you to play everything.\n\nIn Ty, you explore nine levels from various locals to collect a general collectable for progress. Each level contains 8 Thundereggs--5 are level-specific objectives, one time-trial, one collect 300 Objects and collect 5 caged friends--and you'll need 17 to advanced to next area of the HUB.\n\nBecause of this system for progress, if you don't happen to like one type of side-objective you can avoid doing them so long as you collect enough in every level. (You only need to collect 5 or 6 in each stage to get by.) This is especially useful if you hate collecting 300 Opals in some of the more larger areas.\n\nAnother reward for exploration are Golden Cogs. Collect 17 of them and you'll get a non-essential boomerang to your arsenal, which tends to be combat-focused. Some of which are so stupid they're awesome (like the Kaboomerang).\n\nIf you're going for 100%, however, good luck with the same problem in other similar games for missing one Opal. You'll get a dozen hours minimum. If you go for only the Thundereggs as well as the Golden Cogs, then you'll get 7 to 10 hours worth of content.\n\nUnderutilized Potential\nI've yet to play any of the sequels, so maybe these are addressed later. Regardless, there is a lot of wasted potential in TY 1.\n\nThe biggest downside of TY is the rang-system. Similar to TY 4, the variety of rangs becomes worthless, especially for combat. However, it's the essential rangs that feel the most underdeveloped.\n\nFor example, the Freezerang can be thrown on water to create infinite platforms. This mechanic is used ONCE in the entire game. If it was an "expert" mechanic, the process takes too long to be useful. (The Zaprang is also used only once.)\n\nAnother odd mechanic is this "spirit" form. Other than making combat simplier, it has no purpose.\n\nTY could benefit from re-developing mechanics to make each rang more developed/useful in the combat and interesting level-design. But it's a game for kids, so they had to keep things simple.\n\nRating of Completion/Competence\nThis raiting is not associated with the game itself, rather of the quality of its Early Access implementation. It is a "second" ratiing to give buyers some sense of what to expect.\n\nHere is a detailed list of my scale:\n\n1 : A bug-filled mess with zero content or missing many features promised. A product far too early to put money down to support. This would also include games that get updates infrequently (or are dead).\n\n2: A game with the beginnings of ideas, yet too soon to invest any time. May have optimization problems or game-breaking bugs that will sour your experience. Check back for updates to see if things improve. (Also, games that play well but do not have all the basic features, such as promised multiplayer modes.)\n\n3: A game that is in a playable state, yet may not have all its technical issues sorted out. Features are all available--all game modes--while they may not be finalized. Games in this section are cautious recommendations to buy, so you should check the updates' history for specifics on the development.\n\n4: A game that is in a playable state, technically competent, and has enough content to be worthy of purchasing right now. Features are all accounted for and the updates for the game are frequent enough to not discourage cautious buyers.\n\n5: A game that could be considered finished. It is in the final stages of development with balancing and other last minute changes to be resolved to be fit for release.\n\nTL;DR:  If a game were to have a rating above 3, then it would be safe to invest into the product. 3 is a "cautionary" recommendation. Anything else below would be strongly inadvisible purchases to get into right now.\n\nThe point of this system is to be flexible (and considerate) to the developers as well as informative to consumers of some metric of a standard.\n\nSimple Rating: 3/5\nDetailed Rating: 11/15 or 15/20 with Productivity (71 - 75%)\nContent: 5/5\nTY is a finished game being put through performance testing. No additional content or gameplay changes are planned, so the content is what you'd expect to play on the GC/PS2/Xbox.\n\nQuality: 3/5\nOn a Steam controller or keyboard, the game plays just as finely tuned as on consoles.\n\nHowever, and what I do not recall, there are audio sync issues as well as audio balance issues when it comes to cinematics. For example, character voices will be drowned out by environmental noise (like a waterfall).\n\nCamera attached to the environment as well as UI bugs (1-ups and Kaboomerangs over water) are issues you'll come across in gameplay.\n\nOptimization: 3/5\nThanks to the texture compression, I can run TY on higher shadows and reflections. I would advise having a low draw-distance as they will create noticable dips. Should you play around with changes by diving in and out of water be sure to try it multiple times as the game has to catch up to the new settings.\n\nIt's still not perfect but it's a remarkable improvement.\n\nProductivity: (Still too soon to judge, but I'd give them a 4/5)\nIn nine days, Krome has signficantly improved the game's performance.

Jak and Daxter, Grand Theft Auto Vice City, Ty the Tasmanian Tiger, Seek & Destroy, etfc. I played many, many games in my time. But this game personally takes the cake as my all time favorite game from my childhood. Sure, it's outdated. Sure, there isn't much real plot and the gameplay isn't spectacular. But it's still an amazing game nontheless. The uniqueness of playing as a sole surviving Tasmanian Tiger throwing boomerangs in the great Down Under really stands out against games that all seem to involve one thing nowadays; guns and war. This game gives a feeling of actual meaning to your actions, if you watch and listen to the little plot there is. You are trying to save your family from the Dreamtime, where the evil Boss Cass imprisoned them. Every Thunder Egg you collect makes you feel one step closer to acquaring a talisman, which is what is absolutely necessary in the task of freeing your family. Collecting every item is not necessary to beat the game, but it does unlock a nice bonus that I will not spoil. If you're beaten the game 100% on the PS2, Gamecube, or XBOX. And for all the veteren players, there's a VERY special surprise for you after you have beaten the game 100%, too. Trust me, you will LOVE it. The Steam version comes with various new features, such as the ability to replay bosses, map your controls, camera-oriented throwing instead of in front of TY, leaderboard support for time attacks, and the special surprise I mentioned above. Since it is still in Alpha, many things can be added or removed. I personally hope there is some sort of player vs. player time attacks where you can race against each other in real time. Maybe even add in new bosses that can be taken on with two players. This game IS worth the money. I was going to buy a game I had wanted for MONTHS, but then I saw this game on Steam and I HAD to buy it. It is my childhood.\n\nTL;DR - Awesome, fun, amazing source of nostalgia, happiness, childhood memories, new features, awesome secrets\n\nThe only cons I can think of are the ocasionally wonky camera angles, and the fact that it crashes often. You can play a full level 100% through, but it will likely crash on the next one.\n\nAll in all, I rate this remaster a solid 9.8/10. The only reason it is not a 10/10 is because of the crashes. I can't wait to see the end result of this masterpiece!\n\nP.S. If you DO get it, go to Extras and check out the "HD Test", or something like that. Trust me, you will like it in one way or another.","May 17","true","12.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","3"

The game is as great as I remember it being, and then some truthfully. Although Ty the Tasmanian Tiger appears as though it is a derived collectathon clone, a la Super Mario 64 and others, it offers a firm foundation of what has already been set in stone while adding in its own flavor well enough to make things interesting. One point that the game prides itself on, is the fact that you are Australian among other things, and you love your boomerangs. Throughout the game, you will receive a plethora of interesting boomerangs to up your arsenal and they are well implemented. The game isn't too long to simply never be beaten, especially for someone with a short attention span as I beat it 100%, besides picture frames, in around ten hours of playtime, yet those hours are never squandered. The graphics look incredibly similar to the original graphics of the PS2, but the remastering of the graphics and environment  is quite clear, with lighting wrapping around the trees onto Ty among other things. Music in this game is interesting to say the least to anyone who isn't familiar, combining easy-listening with aboriginal with drum and bass depending on the level and context of the situations you find yourself in. Overall, the quality is certainly there in the very early version of this remastered port, but I can't finish without touching on the single minor issue I had. Camera positioning is vital in 3D platformers and in the original, the camera worked incredibly well. The camera in this port does as well, but it infrequently gets caught on terrain when exiting water, but that never seemed to affect my playthrough more than make me repeat a race for an Egg at most.\n\nPros:\n\n*Good stylized graphics, now with more polish and detail.\n*Great and original music\n*Interesting level design\n*Great voice acting\n*Comedically well-written\n\nMileage may vary:\n*Short, but long enough to be a ride.\n\nCons:\n*Still EA so there might be bugs (such as my camera one)\n*There's nothing else to write about this great game.\n\nWould I recommend this: Yes. I'd even buy this remaster in it's current state at twenty dollars for its quality. I hope that the sales work well to get Ty 2 and 3 on Steam as well.

First and foremost, the performance needs to be addressed. It is by no means at a solid 60FPS all the time, and I wouldn't expect it to be at this point in development. There seems to be an inconsistent V-sync cap. Sometimes when the framerate dips below 60, it will cap it to 30FPS, and other times it doesn't. Bearing in mind that this game was designed for 6th-gen consoles, it is more than playable in this state.\n\nVisually, there's some bugs here and there, some clipping textures in the HUD, some shaders gone awry (for example, the heatwaves coming from torches at the end of Walk in the Park). Some textures have been remastered and look gorgeous at a high resolution. Others still have that pixelated "Minecraft" effect to them. Shadow maps could do with being a bit sharper. Overall, the graphical quality is inconsistent, but I'm sure the devs will address this in future updates.\n\nKeyboard controls are a cumbersome mess, but I would recommend playing this game with a controller anyway. If the devs fix keyboard and mouse controls in the future then I'd be interested in trying it out, but this isn't a game that demands accuracy so it's not a big deal.\n\nSound design is a little glitchy too, just minor things I've noticed here and there. At least once, ambient background noise drowned out some dialogue. When you collect items and a jingle plays, it doesn't fade out the level music, so you just get this audible mess in your headphones. Regardless, this game's soundtrack is utterly fantastic.\n\nThe FMV cutscenes look HORRIBLE. Completely unchanged from the console days, there's just a pixelated mess all over your screen whenever one plays. In-game cutscenes are a little odd sometimes too, since the animations for the characters are 30FPS, but the world they're in is running at 60FPS.\n\nOkay, now that I've nitpicked over every little thing I've not enjoyed so far, let me just finish up by saying that this game is fantastic, a relatively unknown platformer from the sixth gen of consoles that I've been hoping for years will come to PC. It's finally happened, and for the first Early Access build, I'm really rather impressed. I'm very excited to see what this game will become as more polish is added.\n\n","March 21","true","11.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

Now, I'm not going to pretend that in it's current form it is great, parts are almost unplayable, the audio is off, but the devs at Krome Studios are clearly working on its compatability, and each time I check to see the updates on the game it is more and more optimised.\n\nMy positive rating is based on the potential for this game to be great. I know I enjoyed the story thoroughly when I was younger, and I'm sure I will still do this now. However I would advise waiting to purchase the game because in it's current format it has some issues. However I'm sure over time the flaws will be ironed out and I can enjoy the nostalgia of playing one of my favourite games remastered on the PC.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdit: Currently the game runs at a much more smooth level of FPS, and has currently added the feature allowing the game to be compatible in loading screens with the mouse. Since my initial review a large number of improvements has been continously made towards this game, so much so that I would say that the game was easily playable and enjoyable in the current state. With the improvements allowing boss battles to be replayed, I would happily encourage any fans of traditional platformer games to purchase this game!","April 5","true","5.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yotomoco/recommended/411960/","yotomoco","Yotomoco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yotomoco/","48 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is my favourite game of ALL TIME. So I know the game inside out and so can pick out a few things that are definitely different and not in a good way. Firstly with the intro sequence showing the background to the story, the audio is all out of sync. Secondly, as soon as you get into the game at Rainbow Cliffs the game runs EXTREMELY slowly, this seems to happen throughout the game so far (I've played through 2up, Ship Rex and Walk in the Park) but mostly in Rainbow Cliffs. It's not too much of a problem in the other levels however in Rainbow Cliffs when I first opened the game I almost concluded the game was unplayable. It seems to be certain areas in the other levels that trigger it to run slowly for instance, in 2up it runs slowly until you reach the first two of Cass' henchmen at the waterfall and then runs fine after that area. Another problem I encountered was the camera. If you're near a wall it will tend to "freak out" and you can't see at all what you're doing and trying to move the camera to a place where you can see is near impossible. The only way to fix it is to move TY himself away from the area that is causing the camera to stop working. Another small problem which I'm only picking up on because I love the game is that when you collect a thunder egg/golden cogg/bilby the music in the background continues to play over the tune that plays when you collect it. The audio in "Walk in the Park" is also not too great as sometimes the sound of the rain/waterfalls can be too loud to hear what any of the characters are saying.\n\nThe quality of the models and environment are beautiful and is a definite improvement from the xbox/playstation games. The controls work for the PC very well. However, I realise this is an early access to the game, I really hope that the speed that the game runs at can be fixed as it is the biggest problem and really impacts the gameplay so far.","March 22","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I know there's forums for that, but not everyone goes there. I'll edit the "review" every new update and everytime I see a problem worth mentioning\nI used two different computers to test it: a Low-medium end Laptop (AMD A8-4555M 1.6 Ghz Quad-Core APU, HD8550M + HD7200 1.5GB, 6GB RAM) and a High end PC (Intel Core i5 4670K 3.4Ghz Quad Core, MSI Radeon HD7950 3GB, 8GB 2133Mhz RAM). According to the specs, both of them should run the game just fa (unfortunately, that's not the case).\nSo here is what I found now:\n\n- Can't use mouse on the menus (mouse cursor has the "thinking" symbol and never goes away)\n- Cutscenes: All of them have poor image quality. They should be re-done\n- Cutscenes: All of them have the audio and video severely desynchronized. Most of the time, the sound is more than 20 seconds ahead of the image\n- Lack of options in the main menum and lack of graphical options\n- Terrible framerate in the laptop that makes the game unplayable, even with low graphic options. Runs at 60fps in the high end PC, but still has some slowdowns.\n- The controller gameplay have to be tuned, because it's too much sensitive. I used Xbox One controller.\n\n\nSo, right now, the game is still very raw. The graphics are better and doesn't look that bad for its age, but still has a lot be polished in here.\nIf you played Ty games in the past and are his fan, I recommend buying it, because it's cheap (the price will raise after getting out of Early Access) and you'll support the devs, who promised to bring Ty 2 and 3 aswell if this game sells nice.\nIf you never played a Ty game and you're just curious, I recommend to buy it later, because the game has a lot to evolve.

Why? The system requirements for the game are extremely high. Well, despite that, the game is running at 60FPS without problem on 3GB ram, 512MB Video, AMD Athlon processor. Its a cheap 2012 laptop. I bought it because I wanted to donate to Krome, for all the hard work they've done with Ty in the last few years. Krome actually cares about Ty and its fans, which same cannot be said about Spyro, Crash, Croc, Bubsy, Gex, the list goes on...\n\nThis release is an HD port of Ty The Tasmanian Tiger for PC. Its a really good port in many aspects; visuals, sounds, gameplay. The keyboard controls are actually very well done. The visuals look great, and the sounds are nice. Its also nice to see Krome didn't replace any voice overs! Lately many game remasters change the voice overs because the original voice actor refuses to allow their voice in the game. Well, thankfully, Ty is still the same Ty! :)\n\nI made a video about my first impressions as well:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXKPyaZbEN4\n\nYou should totally buy Ty HD! If you love the Ty Series, Krome, or even just miss classic well done and well developed platformers like Spyro, Crash, Croc, Gex, Etc, BUY THIS and support them! Right now its only 9.95. Ty 4 is only 5.99. Buy one or both to show support. This is a really good studio and they aren't doing this as a cash grab.

I even remember one of the old commercials for this game, which shown Sonic, Crash, and Spyro in full body casts in a hospital emergency room, and when Ty walks past,  saying "Boo!" pointing his boomerang, they all flatline.\n\nAs for the actual game, Performance with fullscreen is not the best for my GTX 750 Ti, but when ran windowed, I can run it very well on max settings. Otherwise, it is a very playable game for an early access port of an old PS2-era classic.","March 23","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I bought it on release to support Krome and in hopes of supporting a potential 3d Ty 5. However, the game is still good to have.

Halo: Combat Evolved, and Ty the Tasmanian Tiger. Over the years I have probably played through this game at least 10 times. The level design is some of the best I've seen. SO MUCH gameplay is squeezed into such a twisting and turning small area. Iconic and interesting characters. Variable gameplay parts and diverse environments. But by far the most influential and memorable aslepct of this game is the soundtrack. This game's soundtrack (available on Spotify) is the perfect mix of catchy tunes and level centric atomsphere that is perfect for this genre. I absolutely recommend this game to anyone and everyone.

I thought this was just me, but nope, other people have this issue as well. Bad for those who actually enjoy the cutscenes.\n-------------------------------------\n\nI still like the game even with the issues. The camera only gets annoying to me when in tight spaces and the lag I am willing to pull through at the moment. I have enjoyed the game in the moments it has not lagged and played perfectly fine.\n\nIf you are a fan of this game, get it, it has both keyboard and controller controls to fit your fancy.\nI have heard that the price WILL go up once it is out fo early-beta so there is an early warning for those with tight pockets but are a fan of the series.\n\nThe game may have FPS issues, however mine seemed to have fixed itself once I turned reflection/shadow to OFF, making the game run perfectly fine & smooth.\n\nNote: My review will change as the game updates with anything that makes it worst or better.","April 2","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For the price, it is a nice slice of my childhood back though I don't see much replay value after you collected everything.\n\nI took an extra hour to get all the photos so in total you get around 13-15 hours of gameplay for your money.\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nNow, the game is indeed in early-beta so it will have issues, here are the current ones\n\n- Not perfect camera\n- Cutscenes lag behind the actual dialouge/sound effects\n\n\nThe camera for keyboard users is bad, you use your mouse button which is not bad at first but it is slow at turning even on max sensitivity. However the devs have stated they are going to try and get the camera from TY 2 into this version.\n\nThe full-rendered cutscenes horribly lag behind what is being said, not a big issue but it should not be this way for a port, specially for this game. I thought this was just me, but nope, other people have this issue as well. Bad for those who actually enjoy the cutscenes.\n-------------------------------------\n\nI still like the game even with the issues. The camera only gets annoying to me when in tight spaces and the lag I am willing to pull through at the moment. I have enjoyed the game in the moments it has not lagged and played perfectly fine.\n\nIf you are a fan of this game, get it, it has both keyboard and controller controls to fit your fancy.\nI have heard that the price WILL go up once it is out fo early-beta so there is an early warning for those with tight pockets but are a fan of the series.\n\nThe game may have FPS issues, however mine seemed to have fixed itself once I turned reflection/shadow to OFF, making the game run perfectly fine & smooth.\n\nNote: My review will change as the game updates with anything that makes it worst or better.","April 2","true","15.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So...does the game hold up?\n\nWell...yes, actually. If you can get passe dthe game's "Australian Stereotypes: the game" You'll find a platformer that doesn't really reinvent the wheel but boy does it polish the mechanics of it's genre to a mirror shine. TY controls great, and somehow even makes water and swimming portions FUN! I know colour me shocked someone  figured it out.The level design is also pretty open, giving you a lot of options on how get around and collect all the things. The game is still fairly nice to look at even for remaster of game from the early 2000s that (As of this review) is still being worked on. From what I played TY is surpsingly smooth, well crafted platformer that Krome is clearly very proud of to try and remaster, and I'd say that pride is warranted.\n\nThe closest thing i can say to bad things is, again, the "Australian" theme is a bit of an aquired taste (though Krome is based out in Brisbane for what it's worth), the pre-rendered cutscenes look a bit murky on modern hardware (Something that for techicaly reasons can't really be helped but the in-engine stuff looks fine BTW) and for some reason the game's frame-rate is blisteringly fast which is a bit disconcretaing at first bug you get used to.\n\nIf you're nostaglic for this game, or like me really miss this style of game that has become rare in 2016 I'd recommend TY The Tasmanian Tiger. It does so many things right within it's genre I actually want to play the sequels now and hope they get remasters too.","April 14","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems Jim Sterling has made early access for this game seem a terrible thing, but the devs actually care about their game and update it regularly. Unlike some other devs, but that's not what I'm here to talk about.\n\nWhat do you get with this game? A port of the original Ty game, with multiple improvements such as shadows, 60fps, upscaled textures, improved controls, and the list will hopefully grow as the game continues to be updated (which is always a plus in my book).\n\nSince I grew up with the Ty series (bar 3 since it had a very limited release in the UK) I had to check this out once it was released, and I was not disappointed. Although this may differ from other people's accounts, my playthrough was flawless and 100 percenting this game again was a blast.\n\nI hope Ty 2 is ported as well as this game was, since it was my favourite. I recommend this to fans of the series, and maybe even fans of classic collectathons like Banjo-Kazooie and Jak and Daxter. I rate the game 8/10 - A nostalgic blast from my past.","April 14","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level design, the music, the voice acting, the overall atmosphere of this game is phenomenal.\n\nThe story of this game is a simple 3D platformer story, where ty's parents are sent to an alternate world and ty needs to rescue them by collecting 5 tallismans. Overall very simple, but this simple story allows for the gameplay to really shine as it was meant to. Imagine banjo kazooie, mixed with basic mario platforming from sunshine, combined with a unique take on fast paced ranged combat. THAT is Ty the tazmanian tiger, and its brought together really well. The rangs within the game allow for the player to challenge combat in whatever way they deem right. The game doesnt hold your hand either, and I still had challenges with obtaining some of the thunder eggs. The level design is mixed between open levels, where you can go anywhere. And linear levels, where the goal is to get thunder eggs as you go through the level. These mix really well with each other and allow the player to never get bored since all levels are unique. The water levels in general are amazing in this game, and allow for a "taste" of what an open world ty game would be like. The platforming it solid and smooth, allowing for brilliant maneuvers to be done that get the player where they want to go.\n\nNow in terms of bad things for the game, there are some glitches here and there, but thats to be expected of an early access title and it never BROKE the game so I forgot about them. In terms of story, it could have been more fleshed out, but this is a 3D platformer from the early 2000's and the gameplay makes you forget all about that. The character of Sly within the game felt kinda....eh now that I think about it. He implys certain things within his dialouge that is never actually fleshed out, which, if done correctly, could have been AMAZING. However these kinda story problems are fixed with later installments in the series such as ty 2 and ty 3, which I can say had some of the more interesting, serious stories of any 3D platformer i've played. This is ty 1 however so that can be annoying to anyone who nitpicks that stuff. Controls are being improved constantly and I've had the liberty to play this with the xbox one controller, the steam controller, and mouse and keyboard. The xbox controller is the most standard and probably the best one to use as of right now if you're not accustomed to the steam controller. IF YOU ARE however, the steam controller is the way to go as it allows precise aiming during Ty View. Keyboard and mouse is also ok, but that has some bugs that are still getting fixed.\n\nHonestly this game is worth the money JUST for the investment. Ty 2, was better than Ty 1, and I for one really want this game to succed to down the road I get 2, 3, and Ty 5. However on its own, I believe this game is an amazing title for any PC owner that wants change from their regular games, and wants to play a 3D platformer on PC.","April 10","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

An easy going platformer collectathon with an Ausi twist that still holds up against the test of time along side big titles such as Jak and Daxter, and Crash Bandicoot.

They just don't make games like this any more.\n\nLooks similar to the PS2 release with a higher resolution from what I can tell, however, you can now play at more than 30fps which is pretty great.\nFor an alpha, it runs pretty good with just some hitching and a little bit of pop-in.\nThe controls are surprisingly good with mouse and keyboard. Controls are what you would expect with a controller. However, the camera is pretty bad. Sometimes when TY is standing by a wall and you try to spin the camera it will just spaz out like crazy (at least with mouse and keyboard).\nSounds haven't been improved it seems. Although the only thing that I think needs to be cleaned up is the voices. The crunch of TY's bite and the shattering of wooden boxes sound just as good as they ever did.\nOverall I'm pleased with the game and the price is not too high. Even though it is an old game, it offers more content and fun than any of the trash the "AAA" market has barfed up recently (things really were better back then).\n\nGood work Krome, but here are some improvements you could make:\n- NATIVE 21:9 SUPPORT\n- MORE GRAPHICS OPTIONS\n- ANTI-ALIASING\n- FIX POP-IN (MOSTLY SEEN ON SPIKED WOODEN POSTS)\n- STEAM TRADING CARDS","March 22","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So many games these days promise nostalgia but fail to deliver a fun or genuine experience, but Ty delivers on almost all fronts. This is largely due to it's 2002 roots, a much different age in gaming. I grew up playing Ty (and its subsequent sequels) and still fondly remember it. When I heard that it was being ressurected, I couldn't believe it.\nThis port delivers, despite still being in Early Access. It stands up beyond nostalgia- offering a bright, fun and engrossing experience. Despite it releasing only a day or two ago, I couldn't help but play through and complete the entire game. However, the length of the game might be the title's biggest downfall; To complete the game at 100% (Which does NOT include the hidden art) it took me between 9 and 10 hours. While my playtime might have been influenced by prior knowledge, it's important to keep in mind.\nBut for the price of about $9 to $12 it delivers a worthy experience. Make sure you have a gamepad before playing and enjoy the delightfully corny Australian experience Ty delivers.\nI look forward to the ports of the two subsequent 3D Ty games, and wish the best to the developers with bringing this classic mascot platformer franchise back.\n","March 23","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember playing this back on the gamecube when it first came out and absolutely loving it. Playing through it now, I can see a few issues that I may not have noticed back when I was younger but overall this is still one of my favorite platformer games I've played. I have to say I am kind of surprised how well this game holds up, but its music, art, and gameplay all manage to still captivate me. The music especially so. Once I heard the first level's theme I was instantly transported back in time to when I first played this game. On the negative side, there are a few slow downs and audio desyncs here and there, but I would attribute that to it being an early access game. Hopefully by the time the game is fully out these issues will be fixed. As well, there are a few relics of its time that still cling to this port such as low res cutscenes and an occasionally wonky camera. As well, this game can be a bit on the easy side. Overall however, the pros vastly outweigh the minor cons that I pointed out. This is one of my favorites of the 3D Collect-a-thon subgenre and if anyone has been wanting for such a game this is absolutely one I would have no issue reccommending. With some work for optimization, I can easily see this game as an 4/5. It's not perfect by any stretch, and the challenge mostly comes from collecting everything 100%. Regardless, I have been missing these types of games for a long time now and I'm really glad to see one of my favorites coming back on PC.","March 22","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So many games these days promise nostalgia but fail to deliver a fun or genuine experience, but Ty delivers on almost all fronts. This is largely due to it's 2002 roots, a much different age in gaming. I grew up playing Ty (and its subsequent sequels) and still fondly remember it. When I heard that it was being ressurected, I couldn't believe it.\nThis port delivers, despite still being in Early Access. It stands up beyond nostalgia- offering a bright, fun and engrossing experience. Despite it releasing only a day or two ago, I couldn't help but play through and complete the entire game. However, the length of the game might be the title's biggest downfall; To complete the game at 100% (Which does NOT include the hidden art) it took me between 9 and 10 hours. While my playtime might have been influenced by prior knowledge, it's important to keep in mind.\nBut for the price of about $9 to $12 it delivers a worthy experience. Make sure you have a gamepad before playing and enjoy the delightfully corny Australian experience Ty delivers.\nI look forward to the ports of the two subsequent 3D Ty games, and wish the best to the developers with bringing this classic mascot platformer franchise back.\n","March 23","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you have played TY before, then this is definatly worth picking up. I'm not so sure for someone who had never played a game inthe series before however; this rerelease is more of a nostalgic trip down memory lane rather than trying to add more gameplay mechanics and features.\n\nOnly found two downsides to this rerelease: - You get a massive LAG spike when walking by the gumtrees on your way\nto the first 3 levels (although I beleive they've release a temparary patch\nwhile they find a perminant one. This will probably be fixed at a later date).\n\n-  I don't know if it's just for me, but during the cutscenes the audio and\nvideo becomes out of sync. The video seems to be playiong at about 25%\nthan it should be. I'm not sure there's a fix for this yet, but as it is early\naccess this will be something that'll be fixed quite quickly.\n\nSo takling into account the early access and bugs, I would definatly recommend this game to anyone who has played a TY game before as you will not be disappointed by the upgrades the rerelease has made (not to mention the nostalgia you will feel).\n\nI do not however recommend this to anyone new; I feel that you may not think that it is as great as I seem to be making it out to be, because you do not share that nostalgic connection to the series.","March 28","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lots of things that constantly hit me right in the childhood.\n\nPositives:\n-I wasnt exactly afraid that this remaster would absolutly change everything, but I'm glad that you guys drastically improved things while still maintaining the art style the game has. It was an absolute nostalgia trip!\n-Some added effects that I dont recall seeing in the previous version of the game (the PS2 version at least) caught me off guard with the lighting on boomerangs such as Frostyrang and the Zappyrang which were really good. THE WATER!!\n-Resolution was handled really well. Didnt see much texture problems occur from running the game in 1920 × 1080 which is impressive. At points I stopped to take in the scenery because it looked so awesome.\n-Small things like the sound effect for completing/ obtaining new rangs were a nice addition and change from the old jingle, but I personally feel it could be changed into something more fitting maybe.\n-Eveything is obtainable (not sure about the picture frames). Didnt find any bugs with being unable to 100% a level due to a item not spawning or being unreachable.\n-Didnt experience any crashes, even when playing over a long period of time.\n-The game ran really well with my average PC. Snow levels in particular ran very well!\n\nNegatives:\nI didnt really find anything wrong with the game that doesnt classify as a minor bugs but...\n- The mission with the bombing boat Frills in Rex Marks The Spot it bugged to the point were you might not be able to complete it since the Frills that you defeat arent registered. However when I started the race mission it fixed it but interupted the race, causing me to lose the race.\n-Some missions like the snowball turrent mission felt cluncky to use with keyboard controls. Maybe the controls could be moved over to the mouse instead?\n-Some medium frame rate drops in some areas, which are more prevalent in the rainforest levels.\n-The draw distance in some areas make surrounding areas look a bit broken.\n- The shadows in some areas flicker on and off. Specifically In Beyond The Black Stump\n-Camera control take some getting used to.\n\nOverall I would definatly reccomend this game to anyone whos played the previous game as it is a great trip down memory lane and those who are curious too, as long as your not too put off by minor bugs.","March 27","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It felt so nostalgic to play this in 2016. But I ain't gonna lie, I mainly got this in hopes that they will also add the 2nd and 3rd game to the PC. Can't wait for that happen!\n\nAnyway, about this game. It is a bit of an old game, but older games normally tend to be fun, if not more fun than games from today. The story is rather simple, and though many know the story already, I will avoid spoilers. You play, as the title says, a tasmanian tiger named Ty. Ty explores many different terrains and weather in search for thunder eggs, golden cogs, opals, his bilby friends, and most importantly, talismans.\n\nGameplay: The game offers about 4-6 hours of gameplay. You are given many different levels to explore, take what is available in each level, and progress. The difficulty of the game is rather easy, in all honesty, the most likely thing that will kill you is the stuff on water slides and fall damage. Most the bosses are rather easy to beat, but that doesn't say the bosses aren't a battle to forget.\n\nCharacters: This game does have some memorable characters with some interesting personalities. Ty himself, in my opinion, didn't seem to be the most interesting character in my mind, but I will remember him only because he was the character you played as the whole time.\n\nControls: I understand they are still working on improving the PC version of this game, but the controls at the moment are really sloppy. The camera oftenly got stuck, the sensitivity for me was pretty low, even after I turned it up, and movement, espacially around corners, felt real awkward and oftenly costed me while fighting or sliding. I have only used the keyboard and mouse. I can't say for controller.\n\nGraphics: Obviously, for an old game, this game kind of lacks textures and effects. But I will say that the lighting (for at its time of release) is really not bad. Though obviously, you should never judge a game by its graphics. 2D or 3D\n\nPrice: For 4-6 hours of gameplay, some replayability, and maybe a few memorable moments and characters. The price of 12 dollars isn't to bad. But if it ever is on sale, highly consider it.\n\nRating: For people who played this back when it first released, it will be a trip down nostalgia lane. For people who are new to the game, it will prove to be a good experiance. For a price of 12 dollars, and all that I said above, I think it is a fair 6/10\n\nMake sure to support Krome Studios to help them improve this game and hopefully get Ty The Tasmanian Tiger 2 & 3 moved to PC!","March 26","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I heard that it was being ressurected, I couldn't believe it.\nThis port delivers, despite still being in Early Access. It stands up beyond nostalgia- offering a bright, fun and engrossing experience. Despite it releasing only a day or two ago, I couldn't help but play through and complete the entire game. However, the length of the game might be the title's biggest downfall; To complete the game at 100% (Which does NOT include the hidden art) it took me between 9 and 10 hours. While my playtime might have been influenced by prior knowledge, it's important to keep in mind.\nBut for the price of about $9 to $12 it delivers a worthy experience. Make sure you have a gamepad before playing and enjoy the delightfully corny Australian experience Ty delivers.\nI look forward to the ports of the two subsequent 3D Ty games, and wish the best to the developers with bringing this classic mascot platformer franchise back.\n","March 23","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Such nostalgic. Really amazing in 1080p60! Though it felt unoptimized right now and I don't seem to able to run this in stereoscopic 3D as I have Nvidia 3D Vision setup. Could it be happening in the future? ALT+Enter needs to be fixed as well. I was also hoping for higher detail of 3D objects, but apparently that's not planned, huh? Actually, I was thinking of refine the excessive folds in several character models and that would be good enough. Anyway, this is game I've played as a kid and have liked it.

So...does the game hold up?\n\nWell...yes, actually. If you can get passe dthe game's "Australian Stereotypes: the game" You'll find a platformer that doesn't really reinvent the wheel but boy does it polish the mechanics of it's genre to a mirror shine. TY controls great, and somehow even makes water and swimming portions FUN! I know colour me shocked someone  figured it out.The level design is also pretty open, giving you a lot of options on how get around and collect all the things. The game is still fairly nice to look at even for remaster of game from the early 2000s that (As of this review) is still being worked on. From what I played TY is surpsingly smooth, well crafted platformer that Krome is clearly very proud of to try and remaster, and I'd say that pride is warranted.\n\nThe closest thing i can say to bad things is, again, the "Australian" theme is a bit of an aquired taste (though Krome is based out in Brisbane for what it's worth), the pre-rendered cutscenes look a bit murky on modern hardware (Something that for techicaly reasons can't really be helped but the in-engine stuff looks fine BTW) and for some reason the game's frame-rate is blisteringly fast which is a bit disconcretaing at first bug you get used to.\n\nIf you're nostaglic for this game, or like me really miss this style of game that has become rare in 2016 I'd recommend TY The Tasmanian Tiger. It does so many things right within it's genre I actually want to play the sequels now and hope they get remasters too.","April 14","true","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It seems Jim Sterling has made early access for this game seem a terrible thing, but the devs actually care about their game and update it regularly. Unlike some other devs, but that's not what I'm here to talk about.\n\nWhat do you get with this game? A port of the original Ty game, with multiple improvements such as shadows, 60fps, upscaled textures, improved controls, and the list will hopefully grow as the game continues to be updated (which is always a plus in my book).\n\nSince I grew up with the Ty series (bar 3 since it had a very limited release in the UK) I had to check this out once it was released, and I was not disappointed. Although this may differ from other people's accounts, my playthrough was flawless and 100 percenting this game again was a blast.\n\nI hope Ty 2 is ported as well as this game was, since it was my favourite. I recommend this to fans of the series, and maybe even fans of classic collectathons like Banjo-Kazooie and Jak and Daxter. I rate the game 8/10 - A nostalgic blast from my past.","April 14","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level design, the music, the voice acting, the overall atmosphere of this game is phenomenal.\n\nThe story of this game is a simple 3D platformer story, where ty's parents are sent to an alternate world and ty needs to rescue them by collecting 5 tallismans. Overall very simple, but this simple story allows for the gameplay to really shine as it was meant to. Imagine banjo kazooie, mixed with basic mario platforming from sunshine, combined with a unique take on fast paced ranged combat. THAT is Ty the tazmanian tiger, and its brought together really well. The rangs within the game allow for the player to challenge combat in whatever way they deem right. The game doesnt hold your hand either, and I still had challenges with obtaining some of the thunder eggs. The level design is mixed between open levels, where you can go anywhere. And linear levels, where the goal is to get thunder eggs as you go through the level. These mix really well with each other and allow the player to never get bored since all levels are unique. The water levels in general are amazing in this game, and allow for a "taste" of what an open world ty game would be like. The platforming it solid and smooth, allowing for brilliant maneuvers to be done that get the player where they want to go.\n\nNow in terms of bad things for the game, there are some glitches here and there, but thats to be expected of an early access title and it never BROKE the game so I forgot about them. In terms of story, it could have been more fleshed out, but this is a 3D platformer from the early 2000's and the gameplay makes you forget all about that. The character of Sly within the game felt kinda....eh now that I think about it. He implys certain things within his dialouge that is never actually fleshed out, which, if done correctly, could have been AMAZING. However these kinda story problems are fixed with later installments in the series such as ty 2 and ty 3, which I can say had some of the more interesting, serious stories of any 3D platformer i've played. This is ty 1 however so that can be annoying to anyone who nitpicks that stuff. Controls are being improved constantly and I've had the liberty to play this with the xbox one controller, the steam controller, and mouse and keyboard. The xbox controller is the most standard and probably the best one to use as of right now if you're not accustomed to the steam controller. IF YOU ARE however, the steam controller is the way to go as it allows precise aiming during Ty View. Keyboard and mouse is also ok, but that has some bugs that are still getting fixed.\n\nHonestly this game is worth the money JUST for the investment. Ty 2, was better than Ty 1, and I for one really want this game to succed to down the road I get 2, 3, and Ty 5. However on its own, I believe this game is an amazing title for any PC owner that wants change from their regular games, and wants to play a 3D platformer on PC.","April 10","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was hoping for the same game but really HD, it hurts to see this kind of texture in 2016!\nAlso this: "Once we have worked on the first game, we will then investigate also bringing TY2 and TY3 to Steam, as separate products.”\nThis put me off buying it, as an old game and also in alpha, I thought that it would be all the games in one.\nI would still recommend, but I would only get it for cheaper.\nIn South Africa, this game costs R130, so its not that cheap!","April 20","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It still holds up to the nostalgia and this port is a rather good one, although it's still in early access. Any complaints I've had with before are squashed and even my little brother got to play through the whole game on the pc. If you've played this before and are wondering whether or not to get it on the pc, do so.

This game is wounderful, and I applaud the developers for taking the time to move it over to steam, and I'm proud to say I did my bit in helping fund the further development of this game.

Couple of things I've noticed right off the bat are significant FPS drops just from running around in Two Up, as well as the background music not cutting out when I collect a cog or free a bilby like it did in the original release. Additionally, sometimes the dialogue is out of sync with the animations.\n\nAlso, controlling the camera is very difficult sometimes, as it feels like the accelleration is cranked way up proportionally to how I move the analog stick. I have the PS2 release with me and have compared, and it was like that in the original, but an option to adjust camera sensitivity would be nice.\n\nFinally, the mouse cursor does not dissappear when I am in-game and using the gamepad, and it appears that I cannot tab out easily.\n\nStill, these are just little things I've noticed so far, and since it is in Early Access, I figured I should chime in with those issues to make sure that they get fixed and help make this every bit as good as I remember it being!\n\nMoving on to the positives, the HD looks amazing, especially for such an older game, and the reflections are a sight to behold on the highest settings, Controls are tight and responsive, except for that little camera nitpick previously, and Ty controls beautifully. I can't wait to complete this game all over again, especially since my old PS2 copy is nearly worn out!\n\nI've not ventured past Two Up so far, so I'll be sure to edit this review with any other points of interest I come across.\n\n*EDIT* Okay, so I just finished Ship Rex, and I'm a little baffled by a few musical changes. For one, when I obtained the Zoomerang, it played an... odd, foreboding sort of jingle, as opposed to the carnival prize-ish sound of the original game. Secondly, when I raced Rex, the original music seems to have been replaced by a more vocal track. Those are the only two I have noticed, but I'm wondering why they were changed?\n\nNothing much else to note other than the horrible lag, and occasionally the camera seems to get caught on objects in the world, such as the gate in Rainbow Cliffs.","March 21","true","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The textures that are "HD" only look good from far away and are not good looking up close at all.\nThere is pretty bad aliasing all around and no options for anti-aliasing, which would be a huge help. I've got aliasing set through Nvidia Control Panel right now to fix it but it should be native to the game.\nThe FMV sequences are the original, low resolution ones from the old console versions, and look really bad. There are no subtitles over them and the audio is completely off sync from the video, making them very annoying to watch but still essential to the story. These definitely need to be redone.\nThere is no mouse support in the menus, which is a bit annoying, but certainly not mandatory. The mouse also stays on the screen in the menus even though it doesn't work in them, so when you're playing with a controller it can get a little annoying.\nIt's still Ty of course, but if you have the originals or can get them for cheaper, you are much better off playing on those systems or, if you can, Dolphin, where you'll get much better looking results most of the time.\nHere's to hoping many updates can fix all of these issues! I really like the game and will continue to play it, but can't recommend it right now in the state it's currently in.","March 23","false","2.5"," 10 of 97 people (10%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","10","10","97","0","15"

I'm not so sure if Krome Studios is gonna fix that or I need to find myself a much better External Graphics card or something. My Laptop runs at 1366 X 768 resolution.

The beloved game is just as fun as when it was first released!\n\nPROS Game runs at a solid 60 fps on my gtx 960 even with forced AA through Nvida controls.\nDetected my xbox 360 controller right away with no setup.\nUpdated graphics look nice.\nAchievements are always fun\n\nCURRENT CONS as of 22/03/16\nThe game is very solid for an early access title and this cons are very minor but here they are.\n\nNo sensitivty controls for analog sticks as far as I can find, makes camera move fast\nMouse cursor won't hide for me when playing with controller\nMinimal graphic options, but there is always Nvidia control panel to force AA or AF\nOverall, great game that runs well on PC with good fps and fast loading time. Would recomend. Ty 2 when?\n","March 21","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't get me wrong I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game. It's a terrific game. But in it's current state I just can't reccomend it. The camera is so ♥♥♥♥y on either controller or mouse and keyboard. On my setup even on low I frequently dip below 60FPS (4690k, R9 380, 12GB Ram). And being a console port, when it dips below the set FPS you can feel it. Sometimes when going underwater the camera ♥♥♥♥s up so bad I have to reset the game. In the first cutscene of the game the audio is out of sync. These are some issues out of many, I even attempted to play this on my laptop and no character models appeared. In it's current state DO NOT BUY THIS. WAIT FOR IT TO BE FIXED! I will update this review when I can wholeheartedly reccomend it. I LOVE this game, I despise this port right now.","March 22","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","13"

I will update my thoughts once the game is 100% percent complete. Thanks to the new patches the game is running a lot more smoothly now even when I turn the draw distance up to Low, Medium, or High it runs pretty damn good! :D Although my only problem is that I can't experience the game with The Real-Time Shadows and Reflections effects on my Laptop, Because the game slows down at a snails pace even when I put the settings on low so I had to turn both effects off in order to play through the game normally. I'm not so sure if Krome Studios is gonna fix that or I need to find myself a much better External Graphics card or something. My Laptop runs at 1366 X 768 resolution. But overall I love this game and I recommend it now at it's current state! (Here's to more improving!) ^^","March 22","true","25.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

The sensitivty for mouse screen panning and free look is horrid, making 100% completion nearly impossible due to some missions involving protecting someone as they do something by panning and hitting something too difficult. Fun game, but not very easily played by people without controllers. Maxed sensitivity on my mouse still has extremely slow pan and free look.\n\nEdit: All problems mentioned have been fixed so it's much more plausibe to play with a keyboard and mouse. :)","March 26","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

I've played it on Steam, still love it.\n\nYes, it's Early Access, but that's only to fund a port worthy of the Master Race. If you're opposed to Early Access because of incomplete games, don't worry, it's already a complete game content-wise.\n\nI've been a fan of Krome for a while now, and I hope they get the funding needed to finish the porting process. Hopefully the Master Race will get the rest of the Ty series onto Steam (as well as any further Krome studios games), and I wish Space Captain Steve and the rest of the development team the best of luck.","May 12","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great port that runs smooth 99% of the time (1% being standing inside a waterfall or looking straight at sunglare for example) and the graphics look really well.

However i have to say that this game is not an easy recommend, the controls are good but the game is short, i finished my playthrough in 9 hours and a lot of areas feel empty, this game is a collectathon so having empty areas is very bad. The bosses are completly forgettable and boring, the camera could do with some work but they might fix that later in development. on the positive the platforming is decent, the swimming is decent (but the water levels are badly designed) and a lot of awesome boomerangs to play with (except the zaporang that you will use once and then never again unless you are achivement hunting) the conclusion is that you should wait for a good price to pick it up its not worth it at full price but an fun enough time at half","June 6","false","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
