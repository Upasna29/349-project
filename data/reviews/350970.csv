I would say you could play it through in 1h 30m or maybe less, depending how long it takes you to figure out some of the puzzles.\n\nThe game is a very beautiful platformer with a few puzzles here and there. The game is not very hard and when you die you do spawn close by, not having to repeat to much each time.\n\nIn this game you control a little Robot who starts it's adventure near a crash site. Without giving to much away, as you progress through the alien world you find audio tapes which have recordings for you from someone who knows you, giving away pieces of a background story about you and your existence with each audio tape.\n\nThe story is light but has a bit of a "surprise" revelation to it at the end, adding a nice touch.\n\nThe game is just beautiful and colorful with an amazing looking alien world and creatures. The different environments you play through are stunning and the atmosphere and music are perfectly balanced.\n\nThe game is very short and given you can complete it in under 1.5 hours it is up to you to decide if that is worth a price tag of €9.99.\n\nThe game makes up for it in its stunning looks and the amazing experience I had playing it and I know I will play through it again.\n\nFor me it was worth it and I would definitely recommend the game.","August 24, 2015","true","9.0"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","1"

I don't think this is a 100% pass, so just check out my pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n-Nice basic graphics\n-Interesting looking world\n-Pretty simple, feels very zen\n-Music is good\n-Some puzzles that make you think\n\nCons:\n-VERY short, finished in under an hour and I wasn't rushing at all\n-$10 is too much for a game that you can finish in under an hour\n-Story was pretty weak, was hoping for a little more since the gameplay was so simple\n-Feels like a fleshed out flash game, would expect more from the number of people who worked on it as shown in the credits.\n\nIf you like to replay simple games I think this game could be worth it at maybe $5, but for me personally I will probably never touch it again and would be very dissapointed if I had actually bought it for $10. I think a longer campaign, slightly better story, and puzzles that scale in difficulty would make this game much better.\n\n(sidenote: met some of the developers of the game at PAX, they were very nice people and generous enough to hand out there game for free.)\n","November 7, 2015","false","0.9"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"

You are a robot who travels through a planet trying to find your purpose and survive the obstacles throughout the way.  I loved the art style and music. Different areas in the game are very vivid with colors and then once you go into the caves they are more darker yet still beautiful. The atmosphere almost has a curious, mysterious feeling to it too. I also noticed in each different area, new music would play.\n\nThe puzzles are fun and tricky and really make you think outside the box. The controls are very smooth as well, they did an excellent job with that. The plot was lovely, it was dispersed nicely. Throughout the game, you pick up casettes. These were left by the man who created you. He talks briefly about his journey and scientists that helped to create you.  But the game speaks for itself; it's one of those games where it's simple and there's not a lot of dialogue yet it's so intriguing.","August 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

In fact, the quickest and easiest comparison would be Limbo, which was another game that divided its attention between a moody art style and platforming action.\n\nIt may be short-lived (~60 mins: curse on you if you decide to refund it after finishing it) and a little rough around the edges here and there, but Planet of the Eyes is a game that balances just the right level of challenge with story to create a decent experience for players looking for a quick fix. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=567624555 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=571415579 Unlocked all achievements!","December 3, 2015","true","4.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The ambiance of the landscape really draws you in with it's simple, yet stunning art. The game is short but sweet, telling a small story and not much more.\n\nThe platforming itself started out very simple; however, as the game progresses so did the difficulty. Fun mechanics with and small inovations in platforming can be found throughout the game. As you can expect from any platformer there are a variety of small puzzles to complete to achieve victory.\n\nI rate the game with a 8/10 and here is a list of my Pros and Cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n-Stunning Graphics\n-Great Story\n-Fun Mechanics\n-Short and Sweet(Can be a con to some)\n-Great Music\n\nCons:\n-Very Easy(Can be a pro to some)\n-Few bugs although not game breaking\n-Repetition in game mechanics/puzzles\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to any platforming fan.

Everything in the game has been created in service of the atmosphere, which is Planet of the Eyes’ biggest strength. It’s a relaxing puzzle-platformer with a creepy edge to it with puzzles that, while not overly challenging, are generally fun to complete. It’s also a fantastic game to look at with a superb, eye-catching art style and excellent sound design. Even though the main story generally falls flat, it’s still a fairly compelling game whose expertly crafted atmosphere will suck you in and keep you playing to the very end. While Planet of the Eyes isn’t an earth shatteringly amazing game, it is a good one, and it achieves much of what it sets out to achieve.\n\nFull review:\n\nhttp://wordsaboutgames.net/2015/08/24/planet-of-the-eyes-review/","August 24, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I completed it in about an hour and a half. The story was alright, it seemed a bit stopped short for the potential it had. Also, the gameplay is very basic platforming, however a few endgame jumps seemed a bit finnicky. The graphics were very good, and the music was very zen, almost putting me into a trance like state while playing. Some people believe a game needs to give you 8-10+ hours for a $10 game. This game is not for them. If you are like me an appreciate a game that understands your time is precious and gives you just enough gamplay to not be overly repetitive and to tell whatever story it wants to tell, this is the game for you.

I cannot see, however, how anyone would take up to 5 hours to complete the game (as per the game's description). I imagine some will be able to blaze through in an hour, but that most people will take a couple of hours at most to finish it. That's fine, though. I like the fact that the developers have chosen to go for quality over quantity: a lot of games tend to outstay their welcome!\n\nThe puzzles are simple yet fun, the platforming is never a chore, and the atmosphere is second to none. The visuals are great and the audio is just as good. One or two minor complaints: sometimes the little robot had a tendency to skid a bit and the controls, while generally fine, occasionally felt less precise than I would have wanted, making jumping on small platforms a little trickier than should really be necessary.

It’s like a perfect lovechild between Limbo and OIO, another indie platformer about a robot, that unfortunately is not available on Steam. Anyway, I really struggled to find anything at fault with this game. The story is interesting, the puzzle mechanics are great and I guarantee that once you start it, you won’t be able to put it down until it’s over. Loved the minecart mechanics.\nYou can see me playing it here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e4DFuEIs5w","September 15, 2015","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You’ve crash-landed on the Planet of the Eyes in an escape pod. Discover what lies beneath through puzzle solving, exploration, and audiologs from another survivor. Turn down the lights, put on your headphones and grab your controller to experience the atmospheric journey of a lone robot in a dangerous world.\n\nPlanet of the Eyes will keep you on the edge and test your platforming skill. With quick respawns upon death and physics-based puzzles to solve, there is a mix of challenges that rewards experimentation. - Highly Recommended!","September 25, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game combines simple puzzles and platformer skill in a seemless way. Visually, this game does not dissapoint. The art style is very pleasing, and fits the over all atmosphere very well. The soundtrack is very pleasing to listen to, and does a wonderful job establishing the atmosphere. The only problem I had with the game is that is is fairly short. It took me roughly 2 hours to play, but I would imagine it would take most people around 3, I happened to have somebody watching to help with the puzzles.\n\nOverall, a great game. Well worth buying.","September 2, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it's not as involved on either the storytelling or gameplay fronts given the brevity, it does manage to tell an engaging tale within that span. The platforming mechanics are effectively used, and the puzzles, though easy, are varied and paced well such the game flows well in a single sitting playthrough.\n\nI hope this game does well for Cococucumber so that they can pursue more ambitious projects in the future!","September 3, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
