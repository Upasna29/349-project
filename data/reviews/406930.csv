The game offers you as the player the option to play one of 4 separate characters, in a number of different settings and locales, along with a couple of different game modes.\n\nThe combat in Epic Showdown is your typical 3rd person shooter: you point at what you want dead, you click the left mouse button, and then they tend to drop. Nothing too special! Instead of enemies dropping weapons however, each character comes equipped with 4 of them, all of which do something different, but they all fit the characters they are attached to. After all, you wouldn’t see the mage of the game holding out a pair of pistols, as that would just completely defeat the point of him being a spell-caster.\n\nNow, it’s a little difficult to ignore the character design in this game, and you’ll know why now, as here’s the list:\n\n•	Rotheart – An evil necromancer with a pumpkin on his head, with access to magical abilities.\n•	Mrs Groundfire – An elderly lady equipped with a minigun. Yes! A minigun!!\n•	Boris Porkov – A medieval pig warrior, whom has access to an assortment of melee weapons.\n•	Sonny “Ricochet” Banani – A monkey who just so happens to be a mobster as well, equipped with a couple of pistols, a shotgun, an SMG, as well as a Molotov to tickle that inner-arsonist\n\nEach character is equipped with their own 4 different weapons, all of which are specified for one character and one character alone. This makes for a different experience with each and every character, meaning that you will get some variety when you pick a different individual to play for yourself.\n\nThere isn’t too much variety when it comes to game modes, one of which being survival, which is a category that has wave defence and objective inside it. The gist of that being, you either play until you die, or you do the objective the game sets for you. Crypt mode is a little different, as your main task isn’t just kill things and keep yourself alive. Instead, you’re effectively thrown into a maze, which you have to somehow make your way to the end of, while many nasty creatures come to ruin your run.\n\nIn survival mode you can pick and choose one of 5 pre-built stages for you to play in, whereas in crypt mode it’s procedurally generated. I know it says it’s randomly generated on the store page, but it’s not. The game takes tile-sets from a predetermined pool to make your crypt level, as I’ve seen the same area multiple times on different runs without any change, meaning that the areas in the dungeon aren’t random if they’ve already been designed. That being said, it’s nice to have a bit of change here and there when it comes to the stages, so it’s nice to have some procedurally generated dungeons to keep the life of the game going a little more.\n\nGraphically, the game definitely isn’t anything special, and can probably go as far as ugly. The animations are a bit stiff, and just doesn’t look all that great, regardless of if it’s a walking or running animation, or an attack, they just all look rather clunky and aren’t all that special to witness. Character design is interesting, but the characters themselves, along with whatever enemies you come in contact with don’t look particularly great and that won’t be changing, no matter how many different creatures you come across.\n\nThe 5 stages for the most part are all different from one another, so it’s nice to see the different stages, since one is focused around ice, and another one revolves around fire, so thankfully not every stage looks the same or has the same colour pallet for you to deal with. Where the stages don’t shine so much is in their design, as I’ve found myself clipping into objects numerous times, and even at one point was almost completely stuck in a corner, with little to no way out until spamming the jump button for around 2 minutes solved the problem. Even if you can solve that problem while playing, they shouldn’t be there in the first place. When you’re being stuck on something that you really shouldn’t get stuck on can quickly get frustrating, especially when you’re being followed by a train of mobs that want your guts for garters.\n\n\nSpeaking of mobs, the AI in this game is incredibly simplistic. They do little to nothing more than just walking up to you, a lot of the time in single file, just to bash you on the head. Their AI isn’t complex at all, meaning that you can pretty much just back away from any enemy coming towards you, and kill them without any trouble. Up until the point you get clipped on something that you shouldn’t, which you’ll find will quickly frustrate you when that’s the reason you’ve just died.\n\nOne serious problem the game has is bugs. They’re everywhere, and it really needs to be cleaned up a fair bit to make the game more enjoyable. For instance, when selecting a character in Survival mode, the character model doesn’t change until the moment you hit select and get in-game, so for a first time player, you have little to no idea who you’re picking. Then, once you’ve picked your character, the character model that floats in this tube that you’ll see when picking a character stays on the level, even after you’ve started.\n\nThese bugs don’t really affect gameplay, but this next one does. With Ricochet you have access to an SMG, which obviously will have ammo tied to it. If you use every single bullet in your SMG, but don’t let go of left mouse click, you’ll switch out to your pistol, but it will fire like your SMG until you let go. Oh, and once you have let go, all the sounds that you can hear from then on is multiple layers of the same shooting sound effect being looped over and over again, at a surprisingly high volume. You may be able to cheat, but your ears will be paying the price if you’re not careful.\n\nAlong with bugs, you’ll come across a few grammar and punctual mistakes throughout. Not to the degree where you can’t understand a single word on the screen, but enough so to at least mention it, in the hopes that it might get sorted in time.\n\nOverall, Epic Showdown shows some promise down the line, but it really does need to have those bugs sorted out, sooner rather than later. However, if you don't take the game seriously at all, and just enjoy it for the lighthearted theme of it all, then you'll probably enjoy it a little more. I am going to recommend the game, but that's down to the fact that I'm putting hope that the game will be improved down the line. Plus, I enjoy supporting indie developers. If you're still on the fence, be sure to check out some gameplay. You'll know from there whether you want to try the game out for yourself.","November 6, 2015","true","1.0"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","17","25","0","1"

Just think Mario Kart Battle, you get to run around in an area and shoot the incoming enemies.  The controls are easy, and anyone can pick this up and figure it out quickly.  The developers are adding new stuff each week, they recently added Multiplayer which is a plus for anyone looking for more fun out of the game! I highly recommend this game for anyone that is looking for something new, and just want to shoot a bunch of things!","November 9, 2015","true","8.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","1"

There are some bugs and glitches but that's common when you are dealing with new releases.  That being said, I had a lot of fun playing it.  There are 4 characters to choose from. Rotheart is a pumpkin man with magical abilities. Mrs Groundfire is a little old lady with a cute assortment of guns.  Boris Porkov a hacking and slashing Hog.  And Sonny Ricochet Banani, a monkey packing some serious heat.  Sonny was probably my favorite to play.   His Molotov did a a heap of damage.  There are two ways to play.  You can either play survival mode or crypt mode.  In survival mode you are basically killing to gain power that will activate portals.  Crypt mode is basically a maze you have to survive till the end.  Crypt mode was probably my favorite.  It was more of a challenge maneuvering through the crypt killing while staying alive and not falling into the many traps.  I definitely recommend this game.  It was fun, challenging, and cute to look at.\n","November 8, 2015","true","2.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","1"

I would have loved to have controller support but the controls are simple enough with the keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe Menu -\nIt was kind of strong and glitchy but I was able to navigate through it with ease once I got used to the flashing graphics.\n\nCharacter Selection -\nI would like to see a preview of the different characters to choose from during the selection screen. I love the different options and had fun trying out different ones.\n\nDifficulty -\nIt is a challenging game that was alot of fun. It would have been nice to have a few more animations but I think it would have cluttered the screen. I think that the actual game mechanics were done well and I have always been a fan of weapon drops and weapon selection games.\n\nOverall -\nI think the game has promise and is worth checking out. I'd love to see continued updates to see where this game ends up. I did enjoy it and will be recommending it.\n\nCost -\nThe cost is somewhat high considering a few of the glitches, but overall if it were improved, it would be definately worth it.","November 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"
