Basically, a generic RPG with no testing, lacking originality, and that seems to have been as rushed as it could.\n\nPros & Cons:\n\n+ Can be a 8-10 hour distraction if you take it casually as a Solitaire game\n\n- A lot of generic art and music that I recognize from other games, probably from RPGM packs\n- Story is all over the place and tries too hard to rely just on featuring vampires\n- Characters are very clich√© and underdeveloped\n- Battle is completely unbalanced, and you basically just attack, except on some bosses, and when the difficulty suddenly skyrockets when you get to some new areas\n- Invisible walls in the middle of the path, passable walls that shouldn't be\n- Almost no equipment and the economy is a mess\n- I managed to skip to the final boss without doing some "mandatory" stuff near the end\n- Sometimes you get no or almost no clue as to what to do next\n- I did one side-quest near the end that brought me from lv 30-ish to lv 99, basically ruining the end game\n- One of the worst, most unrewarding endings I've ever seen.\n\nI could go on and on listing cons, but that should be enough. And all those positive reviews... they're either blind fans, or they have very, very, VERY low standards.\nI have AoI 2 as well, and I think I'll try it someday, but, god, if you don't have it, don't buy it unless you just want the cards.\n\nEdit: After playing AoI2 for about 3 hours, geez, it's abysmal! Don't bother with this series.","November 5, 2015","false","15.0"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","31","39","3","0"

She will recruit allies along the way each of whom has their own story to explore as bonds are formed and personalities develop.\n\n\nThere are many battles along the way, but they never overpower the actual story, and the game does a good job of keeping your interest in what is going to happen next ---- and there are, indeed, lots of surprises.\n\n\nEach area is nicely presented ---- towns, dungeons, woods, etc. ---- and all need to be carefully explored for the treasures to be found.\n\n\nMusic is nicely done, stays in the background yet adds to the structure of the game.\n\n\nIn addition to the main story, there are many side quests to do, all of which offer good rewards for completion.\n\n\nAll of the characters, including the npcs, are interesting, entertaining, and are easy to like ---- even the somewhat eccentric ones.\n\n\nThere are a great many things to like here, and I think anyone that enjoys the 16-bit type rpgs will have a great time with  this well told tale.\n","July 1, 2015","true","8.9"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

I rather enjoyed the storyline and how it got all these different people to interact.  It was a rather solid story with cool game play.  THere was some lack of guiding, but it was a pretty awesome game, overall.","July 5, 2015","true","16.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

Once you get this game's 'airship' you can fly STRAIGHT to the final dungeon and tackle the final boss, however despite the fact this is a sequence break which I LOVE this does the worst sin of a sequence break, if you do this you miss out on the last big section of the game's story to the point that you miss a good portion of the game's story.  To the point the game feels unfinished and unpolished, the game is fun to play just the ending fell flat.","March 18","false","10.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It's got references to virtually all of the major vampire fictions (Buffy, Dracula), and is very funny.  The gameplay is fairly standard, but enjoyable.

The plot seems to be well thought out, even a fine mix of humor built in.  I like the characters and battle system.  If there was a flaw it would be the mob lists.  Dungeons consists solely of the same encounters over and over until you get to the boss/end.  Other than that, I love it.","September 16, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Oh, and you are in search of your father.\nDuring your search you  find companions. Most bizarre companions like a Vampire, an half Vampire and\nanother member of The Family (who wants to get you back for judgement).\nThe story, even if not new, is fun enough. In the dungeons you solve a few and easy switch puzzles, find new\nequipment and kill monsters.\nOh, and there are a handful of side-quests and of course the long collecting quest.\n\nIt was fun playing the game...till you got your airplane (a big bat). With it you can visit all loacations.\nAnd....there is this one location with Dracula...if you beat him...booom you are max level and rich.\nOK, there is another location where you can fight against boss monsters (including Dracula again).\nBut at that point the fighting is useless. The enemies can't hurt you anymore....I fought Dracula and\nparalyzed him...even with 50K Hitpoints it was over in a few minutes and he didn't hit my party once.\nOh, and don't miss a nice reunion for one of your party members.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, till the not so good end it was fun.","May 26","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
