That isn't true. Shutter, for what it is, is a nice little experience that'll make you ask yourself why didn't someone think of this sooner. It's a nice idea. Unique with a story that makes you go, "*inhale* OHHHHH."\n\nBut Shutter isn't reinventing the horror wheel. It's your run-of-the-mill horror game. You might be startled, you might not be. Your mileage may vary with the jump scares (not many) and you might get the intended creep factor out of the general reveal of the diary pages heroine's fate. Personally, I cringed, I jumped, and I did as intended. My worst reactions came out of the epilogue chapter where I truely felt like clawing the walls in a panic. You will feel panic. You will either panic because that beautiful, expensive equipment or... I'm not spoiling you!\n\nShutter, however, is short. The price reflects the "you'll clock in about an hour IF THAT" game time. Shutter also has some woeful graphics that even I crossed my eyes at and wanted to scream "WHY?! WHY OH GOD WHY?!"\n\nI say to hell with that it's not pretty and if you're that hard up for cash, wait for a sale. But it's a nice way to waste a quick hour if you like a quick horror game. If you liked Paranormal, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of Shutter. This storyline is a little bit more believable but the scares are dialed down. Play both games for a fun night of video camera footage horror.\n\nThere's no huge learning curve. The camera takes a moment to fire up and I'd prefer rapid fire shots, but that would make it too simple to take a ghost's picture, now wouldn't it? As you move along in the game, you get "upgrades" to your equipment to take better pictures of "camera issues" and such that may hinder your investigation. Personally, I enjoyed that. You can also go into first person mode. This is complete rubbish when you're first using it but you'll be counting on this later on to help you flee. Yes. You will be chased. Your drone will need you so it doesn't get boogled by ghosties. A love story between man and drone. Except man uses drone to capture footage of ghosts so I have to ask what sort of relationship this is.\n\nThe one thing I would have enjoyed was a little warning that there was flashing lights used (not like you're obligated to, but this is why I make myself the health guinea pig!). Yes I should have guessed when I noticed there was thunder and lightning in the videos, but I subject myself to this so that other gamers don't have to go "HOW BRIGHT ARE THE FLASHES, REALLY?" Enough to put you into a migraine or a seizure easily. There are lots of bright lights. Tread with caution if you are a gamer with a handicap that may be set off by flashing lights. Take breaks between chapters. I know the final chapters are about ten minutes long, but TAKE A WALK. Give your eyeballs a rest.\n\nIf you don't care for horror and want a little taste of something unusual, I say give Shutter a shot. If you're a diehard horror fan and you only like extreme experiences, skip it. This is a bit tame for your tastes. If you like collecting horror games because they're pretty fun to compare differences, then you needed to get this game YESTERDAY. Why didn't you get it yet?\n\nI personally enjoyed it. I wish it could have been longer and a little bit more polished, but I can comfortably say it's not something you'll regret in the morning. Like that ghost lady. I'm pretty sure she doesn't regret anything, either. She was pretty happy to suck the battery life from my drone.","April 14, 2015","true","1.3"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","97","31","32","10","1"

At the time I defended The Chinese Room in this decision, and while I still agree with the general reduction in The Dark Descent's many unnecessary mechanics (including superfluous sanity systems and borderline-inconsequential "healing" items), the extraordinary suspense created by Outlast and its battery-conserving antics made me rethink my stance in regard to such issues.  Having said that, Shutter takes such matters to new extremes of extraneousness, by arming the miniature "droid" you control with a battery which not only controls your ability to switch to first-person mode, but requires constant recharging whilst adding precisely ♥♥♥♥-ALL suspense to the matters at hand.  Indeed, I am wondering if the only reason for this mechanic to exist are:  a. To shut up the kinds of people who complain incessantly about lack of "gameplay mechanics" in recent horror games, and b. To pad out the length of an already very SHORT game.\n\nHere's another theory.  After coming up with an admittedly VERY clever and VERY original concept for their little-horror-game-which-could - one in which the player commanders a Mars mission-style robot in its explorations of a haunted house, and the unravelling of the mysteries therein - the developers of Shutter then faced the difficult decision of whether to make it a first-person or third-person game.  The smart money would probably have been on first-person, but their love for early Resident Evil-style camera angles apparently won out to the degree where the player can now readily switch between first and third-person.  In its own right, not a bad idea at all, but then that dreaded need for "mechanics" reared its ugly head.  After all, what fledgling development company wants to become the new Chinese Room, and be "hated" by all and sundry (except ME, of course?  Hell, I even liked Gone Home).\n\n(On a side-note, I'd also like to thank all the ♥♥♥♥ers who whined about A Machine For Pigs for the current plethora of horror games in which the protagonist can't run for more than seven seconds without stopping to catch his breath.  All of these unnecessarily overdone "mechanics" are thanks to YOU, ya whining pack o' ♥♥♥♥♥.)\n\nAnyway, back to Shutter.  Oh, and if you need further evidence of the aforementioned Resident Evil obsession, you need look no further than the fact that your "boss" looks like Barry Burton and makes a joke about being a "master of unlocking".  'Nuff said.  So what of the game's GOOD qualities?  It's certainly not lacking in atmosphere or spookiness, but the genuinely "scary" factor is a little hampered by the fact that, at least until the final chapter, you're just a little electronic thing on wheels which can't really get hurt or be emotionally traumatised.  It's an inspired idea just the same, and the "story" you uncover is interesting enough (if told in the slightly ludicrous manner of finding pieces of a "diary" plastered on walls here, there and everywhere), but its a little difficult to recommend to all bar the horror-faithful at the price of five bucks for barely over an hour's worth of gameplay.  By all means, pick it up in a sale, and I'll certainly be eager to see what the devs get up to next, as this shows an awful lot of promise.  But less of the gratuitous mechanics next time, eh, Cosmic Logic?  You guys were brave enough to try something genuinely different for your first foray into game design, and if there's one thing horror games are in dire need of right now, it's a bit more risk-taking.  Let's all stop quaking in the shadow of The Chinese Room's "epic fail" (minor masterpiece, if you want MY ♥♥♥♥ing opinion), and keep things moving forward, whad'ya say?   Definitely a very solid, if flawed, first effort.\n\nVerdict: 8/10.","June 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","22","31","6","2"

Sadly, the game itself was not very frightening. I usually am not able to sit through horror games, but untfotunately most of the jump scares were predictable. A lot of the sounds became exhausted after the first few repetitions, and became more annoying than scary. The atmosphere was creepy, but I think the game would have benefited from less jump scares and more atmospheric developement to induce fear. Overall it is innovative, and was enjoyable -- even with the few decent scares given -- and for the price, it is worth giving a shot.","April 11, 2015","true","1.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

This is a very short game hence all the reviews having a very low play time.  I have beaten the game in just under an hour.  Overall Shutter is a good horror game and gives a fresh vantage point over the other horror games out there.  The robotic controls are a little bit to get used to at first but become second nature in no time and you are zipping around enjoying the story the unravels in front of you.  For what the game is it does it very well, I am glad they didn't make it any longer because too many games push boring and unneeded content in a game just to make it longer regardless of whether it's needed or fun.

This is a neat little game where we control a small RC car equipped with a camera - this surveillance unit is to be used to discover the strange occurrences surrounding a house.\n\nWe are constantly in contact with a software engineer, a guy who asks us where to go and what to take a photo of. The photos we then upload and await his further instructions. Occasionally he upgrades our software which basically means a camera with different modes for shooting (night vision, spectral vision). We take photos of objects, apparitions while experiencing some good-old survival horror scary stuff: suddenly closing doors, flickering lights, sudden blackouts and ghostly sounds / voices.\n\nRegularly, we find notes telling us the story of the place and while it is not much it still contributes to the great atmosphere the game has. Graphics-wise the game is a bit rough around the edges - in-game menus are particularly ugly, still, Shutter has a good entertainment value for a couple of hours especially in case you are interested in something different than the AAA games out there.\n\nI look forward to playing its sequel - I have to admit I have my expectations, though.","March 28","true","2.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kamarae667/recommended/359560/","kamarae667","Kamarae","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kamarae667/","829 products in account","Basic concept of the game is that you are exploring an abandoned cabin with a RC robot car thing. As the game description says, as you progress you upgrade your robot dude giving you a better camera to keep getting pictures of paranormal things like floating objects, shadows, and orbs. The more pictures of paranormal activities/shadows, the more you progress.\n\nControls are a little janky, but felt fairly appropriate considering you arent controlling a person. You can use your battery power to get into a first person view, but when the battery runs out, you need to let it recharge. Letting you switch between the RC camera and a 3rd person view was a very nice touch.\n\nIn my opinion, they absolutely nailed the atmosphere. I might spook pretty easily, but I know I sat there jumping, flinching, and squeaking like a little girl the entire time I played (and especially at the end).\n\nGraphics are a little dated (as a nod to PS1 era I guess), but the audio is very well done. Would have loved for an audio setting though. Im also very happy the dev didnt 100% rely on cheap jump scares. Also absolutely loved the story. Make sure you actually read the papers you find, as well as the police report in the menu (after you finish the game of course).\n\nOutside of the bug mentioned in the description, I didnt find any major bugs. My mouse didnt lock in the window on windowed mode, but Im not sure if it was intended to be locked in or not. It wasnt game breaking for me though.\n\nThe only downside to the game is the length. The game is pretty short. Theres actually an achievement to finish in under 10 minutes I believe. So, expect to spend 30 minutes up to an hour on your first (blind) playthrough. I do wish the dev's had added some more meat to the story and expanded the house. It would have been cool to have more rooms to explore for more story pages.\n\nAll of that said, I very highly recommend the game. The story was creepy and the RC robot thing was a pretty cool/interesting concept. I definitely look forward to their next release.","January 20","true","7.6"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/recommended/359560/","TheIronicGamer","TheIronicGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronicGamer/","1545 products in account","I have to admit when I started playing this game I had very low expectations of it. But suprisingly I really enjoyed it.\n\nI would describe this game as a puzzle horror game. You control a robot that is equipped with a camera. The robot has access to a computer that you use to receive orders from the person that sent you in there. The orders generally relate to power problems in the house that you are exploring and you are told to investigate these. However as you progress through the game you realize that there is a ghostly presence in the house haunting it.\n\nThis is when what I like to call the puzzle mechanic comes into play. The ghost will leave small clues around a room such as a floating plate. You need to take pictures of these items to trigger the puzzle. After taking the picture a new "clue(?)" will be revealed which you need to discover by taking pictures. It is kinda detective style investigations. This is what I really enjoyed throughout the game. Sometimes it can take a while to find these clues but that just adds to the investigative fun.\n\nThe game does also feature a story. This is told by notes found around the area. It tells the story of the women who used to live in the house. In my opinion this is the weakest aspect of the game. The story is very cliched and is frankly not told very well. I noticed a fair amount of grammar mistakes in the story as well. Although I believe you can just leave the story and the rest of the game will be enjoyable. The story of your robot and investigation is also told via the person giving orders on the computer. This is also not very well told in my opinion but can't be skipped because the gameplay revolves around it.\n\nShutter features a very unique control system. It is meant to represent old school horror games. You see the robot through fixed camera angles. This means the robot is very hard to control initially. You use classic WASD and mouse to control it but due to the fixed camera angles it can get very confusing with what direction you are travelling in. This takes a long time to get used to but I believe that after you get used to it the unique control is what is another main strength of the game. If you don't like this control scheme you also have the option to view in first person mode. However this is on a timer and needs to be recharged frequently so can't be used constantly.\n\nNow the horror aspect of the game is done fairly well. There were many points in the game where it made be jump through typical game jump scares. They were very well done and the majority of the time I wasn't expecting it. The voice acting on the ghost and atmospheric music is also very effective.\n\nTheres also a few other smaller points that I feel I should mention-\nThe graphics aren't very impressive but I feel the particle effects are very well done.\nI had a bug where at one point in the game all images where showing as a broken texture. Although this is aparently going to be fixed upon full release of the game.\nThere is no in game options menu but only an out of game one present. And it has no audio settings at all.\nThe game only took me just over an hour to complete so it is fairly short.\nOverall I really enjoyed playing this game and I would definitely recommend it to people that enjoy horror and puzzle games.\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!\nDisclaimer: I was provided a review key of this game by the developer ahead of the games official release.","April 2, 2015","true","2.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","11","16","3","0"

It even has a few sneaky little references to classic RE games thrown in for fans.\n\nYou play the role of a little RC drone and you drive it around through a fixed-camera environment similar to the old Resident Evil games with similar tank controls. It's an interesting game mechanic having a game of this style where you can't actually directly interact with the environment, all you can really do is observe, take pictures, and communicate with your off-site HQ, and you have to solve the mystery through these methods.\n\nThe graphics are pretty primitive for a newer game, though still competent enough, and doesn't quite give the sense of immersion as better visuals would, but it works well enough. It's also very short, as are a good majority of games of this type. The biggest issue I had was getting used to the controls. The game starts you off in a very confusing place and doesn't do terribly well at communicating what you're supposed to do from the start, so it takes a little orientation to get into it because of this.

However, it still has a very tense atmosphere about it, and there are a few moments where you are truly scared. This game took a huge risk by making the player control a robot instead of another human being. By doing this, it takes away the fear that something can hurt you, since you're just a robot. This is perfectly shown in this game towards the end, when you play as a human for a little bit, and it becomes terrifying just entering the house. The game design is very innovative, and I enjoyed being able to control the robot from both a 1st and a 3rd person perspective. This game took a risk by making the player a non traditional character, and creating a non-traditional horror game, and I really wish that other horror games would also be willing to take risks instead of sticking to the same repetitive horror style.

Wasn't really too sure what to make of it when I saw the the trailer and screenshots, but I took a chance and I feel satisfied.\n\nThe atmosphere was good. Not quite as haunting as I was looking for, but it was definitely in the right place.\n\nThere were moments where the flashlight does not work, but it clearly shows it being on. Not sure if that's a bug, or intentional but it when I see the light on and not lighting anything up, I got confused. Another issue was when going down hallways, the flashlight seemed to do very little at all if you point it forward in the fixed camera perspecting. It would have been nice to see just a tad bit more, instead of relying on the first person view for things that shouldn't require it, in context.\n\nPacing was fine, can't critique the writing. Not my thing.\n\nI really really liked the consistent upgrades to the camera and such. The fish eye lens at first was not terrible, but I do recall not being overly fond of it. Thankfully it's just a pre-upgrade situation and for that, I think it added a bit more flavor to the situation.\n\nWith notes, they tend to have this almost blinding light on them. This came in handy during one section in particular where I really had trouble finding it, but I feel the sort of bubble effect that was used early on in the game would be a better indicator rather than the blinding light. Just a personal opinion.\n\nWhen entering rooms, the thing you're supposed to look at or photograph seems to only spawn when you've gone in, and then try to leave so that the door closes and locks you in. Since there's no point in leaving anyway, it would be better to have the door instantly close as soon as you enter.\n\nThe 4 chapters felt solid, I liked the "puzzle" with the portraits, and the epilogue chapter was nicely done.\n\nFor the price and what you get for it, I say Shutter is a worthwhile game. I feel it captures what it set out to and while I would have loved to play with it longer, it was a good experience.","May 3, 2015","true","1.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I took about an hour to finish it on my second attempt (the first was aborted upon the discovery of how difficult it was to move around, I looked in vain for a way to change the control system) while taking the time to explore. It has a tense, creepy atmosphere to it despite the fact that you're piloting a small drone and thus shouldn't feel any sense of danger. I'm not fond of ghost stories in general, as so many of them rely on jump scares so it was quite a relief to find that this one didn't. The music is perfectly done, and really adds to the overall feeling of the game.\n\nThe actual gameplay consists of piloting your little drone around and taking pictures, which require a bit of timing to get right. Controls are imprecise, which was slightly frustrating but made it a slightly more immersive experience, I felt as if I was actually controlling the drone at some moments. My biggest annoyance was that I had to wait for the battery to recharge quite a bit, especially during the last chapter. Either a revamp of the battery system or an option to play entirely in first person would have been nice, but not needed. That's my one issue with this game though, which is more than I can say for most. Give this one a try for sure if you enjoy horror done right.","March 29","true","1.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

It's not the most original of storylines but not bum numbingly long to find out the overall plot anyway.

You vaguely understand that it's probably a great movie with a tense atmosphere but the chimp's medium of storytelling and your lack of total comprehension hinders the experience.\nShutter has a very decent central concept and the beginnings of a classic ghost tale running through it but it is hindered by being an hour long, uglier than a squashed frog and possessing no good reason at all for having fixed cameras as a primary view. The gameplay is pedantically dull, mainly consisting of you rolling around taking pictures of floating objects and uploading them to your technical support, Barry, who constantly accuses your photos of being clever fakes or software glitches.\nThere are a couple of nice ideas here and, if you're a horror fan, I found it worth the playthrough for the surprisingly competent epilogue chapter but wait until the price crashes down.

Usually in horror games we control someone or even something that we can relate to and empathize with.\nA person or an animal even, has the possibility of feeling fear and dread.\nI myself can't find the emotional connection to the mars rover, that is needed for me to feel the fear it might be experiencing.\nThe player's character isn't in any danger. You just happily control the rover probably a hundred or more miles away from it. If you "die" its the rover that dies. It's replaceable and so it's possible battery drainage or death hasn't the same impact as a death in other horror games.\n\nI do love the idea though with the camera surveillance and the rover itself but it would have needed some more refinement.\nI can guess that it draws some inspiration from Fatal frame and Five nights at Freddy's, but in both of those series the player is in some sort of danger.\n\nNow imagine this.

There are no side quests, no extra content, and no collectibles. It is one hour of slow, linear gameplay. One of my favorite games, Thirty Flights of Loving, finishes around 13 minutes. The difference is, a games like Thirty Flights of Loving offers a unique and engaging experience, whereas Shutter only offers boredom, confusion, and the occasional mocking laughter when something goes awry.\n\nShutter’s story is played out both in real time and through several ~100 year old diary entries you discover around the property of a client's old house you’ve been assigned to investigate for vandalism. You control a small robot using fixed security cameras installed around the house, as well as a camera mounted on the robot itself, in order to investigate reports of graffiti. You’re a part of a team that does this professionally, and you have a dispatcher named Barry who checks in with you via R.A.V.E.N. Shield (Remote Access View of Environment and Navigation). Barry guides you through the game and provides software (and somehow hardware) upgrades to your robot. The house ends up being haunted by ghosts of the past, including the author of the diary pages. In a strange way, this aspect reminds me a bit of Luigi's Mansion. But the story creates more questions than answers...\n\nFull review: http://infiniteindie.com/4115/shutter-what-am-i-looking-here","April 2, 2015","false","1.2"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

It's bug riddled as hell, in addition to some very legitimate complaints about the game itself. Reading some of the descriptions, and some of the more positive reviews, I figured I'd like this game. I'm a 90's kid, like most of you, so I grew up playing the clunky tank-control horror titles with cheesy dialogue, like Silent Hill or Resident Evil (both of which I'm a huge fan of). Other than controls (to an extent) do not expect anything like those titles out of this game. It's not the worst $1.50 (on sale) you'll spend, but it's still not worth the purchase.\n\nGameplay:\nA huge, huge reason I give the gameplay such a low score is that taking pictures is a huge part of the game, and half the time the camera bugs out, so you can't see what you took a picture of, requiring a restart of the level. There's even a warning about this bug in-game! Spoilers, but a lot of the gameplay consists of roving around looking for shining objects to take pictures of, to recieve jumpscares. The handling on the little robot is pretty good, and the general concept is something I'd love to have seen from a competent or more experienced developer. However, the jump scares lose their draw after the first one. You'll spend a big chunk of the game wondering what the hell to take a picture of next, and it's usually a shiny dissapearing shovel (not kidding). I literally expected a skeleton to pop out and go "boo" most times. If you're not doing that, you're wondering why doors keep locking you in areas for over-used, and plain boring, set-pieces.  I (obviously) didn't finish the game.\n\nGraphics:\nLooks like something made with community assets in the Unity engine or something. The rover and the house you explore aren't that bad, but the "ghosts", props, UI, and other things are just plain bad. Nothing blends together, nothing is believable, nothing is scary. Try again.\n\nSound:\nI couldn't tell if the sound bugged out a lot, or if the developer thought it was a good idea to have loud repeating annoying noises at random times in the game. Jumpscare? Expect the same sound to repeat 5-6 times as loud as possible. Ambience? Expect the same sound to repeat 5-6 times as loud as possible. Something changes somewhere else? (Rinse, repeat).\n\nStory:\nWhat story? You're apparantly investigating the security concerns of a clearly abandoned house that kids have been spraying with graffiti (nevermind the fact that the roof/windows are busted). Someone had time to install security cameras all over the place, along with a recharging/calibration station for your UGV, yet they couldn't just simply send in a dude with a camera, cell phone, and note pad to check security issues on a ran-down abandoned house? The scares, notes you find, and things your email partner says have nothing to do with eachother, and it's all very juvinille level writing all around.\n\nIn conclusion:\nDo not buy this game, it's ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. The concept is nice (piloting a UGV to hunt for ghosts and such), but this team cannot produce, as is apparant. I wish I could say better for this game, but I cannot and will not reccomend anyone purchase it.","February 10","false","0.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Shutter  runs you about $3 for a horror experience pitched at the level of a low-tier episode of  Are You Afraid Of The Dark.  It's a haunted house story; the main gimmick is that instead of exploring the house in first-person with a flashlight, you instead pilot some kind of remote-controlled rover through it, with which you occasionally take pictures of suspicious-looking phenomena (hence the title of the game). The whole thing takes about 90 minutes to complete. There's diary entries to be found, and ghosts roaming the halls, etc. You know the drill.\n\nThere's nothing offensively bad about  Shutter.  There's also nothing particularly remarkable about it. I'll give the developers credit for an original approach to a shopworn genre, and for eschewing the use of cheap jump scares. I didn't find it scary, mainly because piloting a remote-controlled robot removes any sense of personal threat from the experience. I also don't remember any blood, so squeamish types should be all right with it.\n\nI could just as easily have given this game a thumbs-up, because it's competently made and well-priced. I'm only voting it down because I just can't picture myself actively recommending it to anyone; it's too, well, not-scary for that. I wish the developers the best though, and the screenshots of the sequel (which apparently takes place in an abandoned prison, and are included as an "extra" with the game) look interesting.","February 22","false","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","10"

You're moving around in the house at night, with a little robot, equiped with another camera, trying  to catch the culprit red handed. So basically, the game goes for a "found" footage idea, which could be really nice, with a proper budget, art direction and game design skills.\nThe game looks bad. Not in a charming "Baby-Sitter Bloodbath" or "Power Drill Massacre" / PlayStation 1 era kind of way. Just in a poor Unity kind of way. Low texture, not even stylised, decent lighting projection but terrible use of it, generic environment...nothing that can stick to your brain. The sound-design is the same. Though the game tries to use it correctly (I'd say it's "ok" for the mood it's trying to create) it's just annoying when it tries to actually scare you with some random loud noise of a guy mumbling.\n\nBut that is actually not the real problem. The problem is, the narration and the pacing suck. First of all, why should I be scared for a robot? I don't really know who is driving this thing, where is that character supposed to be, and why is he/she not with the rest of the crew (that seem to be coding software in only few minutes to update the damn thing). Secondly, the notes don't need to be there. If you actually create an environment, and put so much effort into putting the player in a position where he can take pictures, move around, just use the environment. Do not use notes. Notes are good for human beings actually opening drawers, desks etc. The notes come out of nowhere and the story flows mainly if not only through these...I won't even talk about the actual story, which is average or below average. i've seen worst in the amateur creepy pasta realm, and I've seen better too.\n\nOverall, I'm sorry to say, but it feels far to amateurish to be sold. It's a nice idea, sure. I like the concept of making fixed camera angles diegetic. But it's use with such a mediocre ghost story, bad graphics, poor level design and overall lack of skills, that it feels like I've been robbed.\n\nHad the game been free, "of course" just try it. But even for a this small amount of money, don't bother.\n\nPS: I'm arsh, but there's something to make out of this. The developer should try again, and again, and again. But don't make us pay until you REALLY have something.","August 11, 2015","false","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

That excitement turned to frustration very quickly once I started playing. I found the battery system so unrealistic it was outrageous. You should be able to look around for longer than 2 seconds at a time, especially since that's the only way to actually find what you need to take a picture of. And having to run back to the generator in the dark when it's extremely hard to see with the lights on just to turn the generator back on is stupid, pointless, and maddening. If the guy talking to you from the security company can open doors he should be able to turn the generator on for you!\n\nI kept having trouble with controlling the drone. At times it would only move sideways when I pushed forward or it would refuse to go through opened doors. Sometimes backing up and trying again worked but sometimes I had to restart the level to gain control. This was especially maddening when I was close to the end of a level since you always start back at the beginning.\n\nI did not find this game scary at all. If I wasn't so frustrated or if I had actually been able to see the ghosts & shadows it may have been at least a little creepy. Flashes that last less than a second aren't scary! If those were ghosts then let us see them so we know they are ghosts. You can let then disappear or fade away after we get a good look. As-is they flash so quickly we don't know for sure what they are and just as quickly forget them. The shadows would be pretty spooky if we could see them better, but a shadow in a very poorly lit place is easily overlooked or dismissed as regular shadows.\n\nThe fish-eye lens was a dumb idea and almost made me quit playing before it was removed. It's hard enough to see in this game without giving us a headache too. Very bad idea!\n\nThe concept of this game is awesome, and if the things above were fixed I would highly recommend it. Those problems make the game no fun to play, and if I don't enjoy the game at least a little then I can't recommend it to others. I really hope the developers give this game an overhaul or make a better game using this concept.","October 7, 2015","false","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"
