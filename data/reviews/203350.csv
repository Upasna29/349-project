This means that in more then 1 year Katauri hasn't fixed all the bugs that afflict this (otherwise) very good game.\n\nTo help them, I want to report the main issues:\n1) in Merlassar, when you enter the Pirate cave and win 1 fight, the "Victory music" goes crazy and goes on continuesly;\n2) the Spell "Avenger Angel" doesn't work: a lot of times, it makes only 1 POINT damage!\n3) everytime I cast "Justice" spell, the game crashes before performing it;\n4) there are random crashes to desktop;\n5) everytime you use the "Catapult Goblin", and in particular when you activate its ability with the static bomb, making it explodes, the game crashes to desktop.\n\nSo, I really ask to Katauri to correct the game.\n\nOnce they will do that, it will be a very good game.","April 9, 2014","false","147.4"," 72 of 87 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","72","87","0","2"

I will be the first to admit that I am NOT "the brightest bulb on the tree." But even I can easily win these games (on easy.) And what fun is it to play a game that you can't win? (Okay. Some people, like "my brother the genius" play on impossible just to see what it is like. And seem to enjoy it. But for the rest of us...?)\nI have read some reviews of WOTN that complain about the reuse of certain maps from TL. (King's Bounty - The Legend. Two games back.) That seems spurious to me. It takes place in the same world, just a few years later in time. And the very few maps that are the same have all been altered by time and the ravages of war.\nThe only complaints I have are: 1- Many of the troops look the same and have the same names that they did in previous games but their powers and abilities are changed. And 2- there are a LOT of side and main-line quests that require sailing or running back and forth between world-map areas. (Most with very minor rewards for completion.)\nStill, it is an enjoyable game and one that I will replay at least a few times so it is well worth the price - now that most of the glitches have been ironed out. (When buying a game from 1C it is a good idea to wait a year after the initial release.)\n\nUpdate: (Jan 24, 2014) During my second play-through, about 2/3 of the way through the game and one of the manditory fights keeps crashing on me.  This MAY get fixed when the new expansion comes out... BUT... I now say -- Only purchase this if you feel lucky. 1c's support isn't especially good either.\n\nFire and Ice Expansion: F&I adds some new areas and some new enemies, but it is basically more of the same... except more frustrating.\nThe frustration comes in three forms. First, it crashes without warning more often. So..., it's a pain, but it's also a good idea to save after (or before) each battle. Or at least every other one so you don't have so many re-do fights.\nThe second source of frustration is that now you don't get your flying horse until much later in the game. Why is that frustrating? Not because you can't avoid unwanted battles, they are mostly all winable anyway. It is because of ALL those "traveling quests." The ones where you have to go back and forth from one side of an island to the other several times for very little reward. (A few bucks and even fewer experience points.) Before you could fly up and go straight... now you either have to wind back and forth through the maze of trails, OR as i did, put them off until after you get the horse. (You pretty much have to revisit most of the islands several times anyway.)\nThe third is the difficulity in finding enough of any one (well 5 actually) troop. This is even worse in F&I than WOTN, because they have added a leveling up system for troops which gives a BIG incentive to keeping the same ones throughout. But is a half full troop at it's maximum level better than a full compliment at lower?\n.\nBottom line: F&I adds a few more hours of play time, and if you liked the game before you will probably like the expansion.  (But I have become bored with all the meaningless back and forth between Islands quests. It feels like most were added just to make the game longer, not better.)\n\nSo... while I DO like and recommend this game F&I is my least favorite of the King's Bounty games.\n\nIf you care, they run from favorite to least favorite: 1- Armoured Princess 2- The Legend 3- Crossworlds (the expansion of AP suffers from the same problems as F&I) 4 - WOTN and 5- F&I","December 29, 2013","true","547.4"," 51 of 63 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","51","63","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenixfeiren/recommended/203350/","phoenixfeiren",".//slayer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phoenixfeiren/","379 products in account","Any fan of the modern "King's Bounty" series would probably be highly interested in new iterations of the popular franchise. And what's there not to be excited with? Tactical battles of great depth, a vast variety of class skills and spells, cute and comprehensive visual style... But several hours in, you'll inevitably discover that "Warriors of the North" made next to none progress since its grand predecessor, "Crossworlds".\n\nSure, no one was expecting an overhauled engine, revamped graphics or a lot of completely new assets. But the rest of the series' games already set up a quality plank high enough to raise our expectations to the appropriate level. What did we get in the end? A fairly bland story about vikings fighting undead (tons of undead... gargantuan armies of undead) throughout several isles and continents without any particular variance. Don't hold your breath for amazing plot twists or engaging discoveries, there simply aren't any. You can expect to meet some familiar faces from the previous chapters, but then again, takes time to even get to that point.\n\nBut the plot never was the reason we love "King's Bounty", right? The REAL reason was always the tactical battles - oh, that hex-based warfare, with every unit having his/her own unique capabilities, stats, affinities... And those things are still there - in fact, you can expect a whole new race of vikings with their own synergy and special perks. But this brings us to another problem - there's a certain lack of sources of creatures that belong to any other faction. Good luck finding enough spawn points to raise your own army of vampires or dragons or whatnot. Most likely you'll have to stick with one and the same setup throughout the major portion of "WotN".\n\nWhat's even worse, the game is long... in the worst sense of the word. There are games that constantly challenge you, give you new tasks and make you think out of the box. "WotN" is not of these games. It's pretty much a grindfest, for the lack of better word. When embarking on the glorious journey to cleanse your land of evil, be prepared to hack and slash your way through 700+ generic enemy armies that only differ in size. Yes, sometimes you'll meet hostile heroes, but don't hope to have a nice chat with them - most of the time it's going to be yet another bleak fight that'll take 10-15 minutes if your life before you can continue to the next pointless skirmish... Of approximately 80 hours of gameplay, 90% is extremely mind-numbing experience. Power your way through if you want, but keep in mind that in the end, it's not your wits that will bring you victory, but only your sheer stubborness to finish the damn thing.\n\nGood features include a new utilitarian school of magic with some fairly curious ways of use (refer to guides, there are pretty good ones in the corresponding section at the moment), new artifacts (can never have enough artifacts... right?), new units (the aforementioned viking race, which you'll have to stick with for as long as the game lasts) and a new companions system (different from the previous chapters, which is good in itself, but not very interesting for my personal taste, since it limits your abilities to combine items equipped by your main character and by his current companion).\n\nAll in all, "WotN" is a typical case of "more of the same", with a huge accent on "same". Only buy if you are sick to death from replaying "The Legend" and "Crossworlds". Although in that case, I'd rather recommend you to explore a fan mod "Red Sands" for "Crossworlds", which improves on the original in several ways and provides enough content to warrant a full re-play.","November 10, 2012","false","73.5"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","30","36","0","1"

Each race features its set of units with both variety to enjoy and optimal tactics to determine. Besides, the game is easy at 'Easy' level and hard at 'hard'. It may sound too obvious, but again, such a level of gameplay comfort could not be seen too often today.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs! Well, there was an awful lot of them when I played the game for the first time after it was released in 2012. Most bugs are corrected now, of course.

The entire series is one of my all time favorites.\n\nEssense of the game play is to Gather creatures as an army and fight an opponent with their army in a turn based hex grid.   Has some extra gaming features by the addition of the Valkyries and Runes compared to prior King's bounty games.   Has three skill trees to build your character thereby offering replayability, similar to prior King's bounty games.  Some skills remain, some have changed.\n\nHas numerous achievements to drive towards if you're that way inclined.\n\nTakes about 80-100 hours to play it through to completion doing most quests.\n\nGold is easy to come by, so buy all equipment/artifacts.  destroy for crystals or feed to the valkyries to raise their level.\nMake sure you have the Valkyries all at level 3 before entering Demonis otherwise you have to play again to get that achievement.   Also to get to level 70 you can't allow the Elf troups to become Neutral in the second act (so avoid going to Rezo in Arcania until you've cleaned them out) otherwise even with the skill that gives 15% extra experience you still won't get to it.

I've read some of the reviews before playing it and I had a few doubts if I'd actually enjoy it or not. Anyway, I decided to start the game and play as a warrior. I've seen that most of the complaints concerning the game were because there were glitches or random crashes. To tell you the truth, the only glitch I've came across during my gameplay was this magic rune that I simply couldn't pick it up because I couldn't reach the location. Really, I've tried A LOT and eventually I gave up. Then again, since I was playing as a warrior, I didn't spend much time using a diversity of spells and according to the reviews, most of the bugs were pointed to that area. Anyway, I've experienced a few random crashes, which made me extremely mad because I had to fight a few annoying battles again, so I've developed the habit of saving the game after every battle (autosave, anyone?). I've also missed the diversity of the troops from the previous games (although I confess that the vikings faction wasn't that bad). Last but not least, this game is unnecessarily long. I've finished it without fighting some battles and quests, simply because I wasn't in the mood to keep on grinding anymore. Overall: If you're a fan of the franchise, go for it. If you're not...

Even when main developer, Katauri Interactive, has left the stage and left 1C all by themselves. Can this end well? Warrior of the North says "Nay" and becomes the beggining of the end for series of so loved and respected game.\n\nFirst thing you see as you enter, is how drastically the writing changed. Not in a good way. I understand that devs tried to create special viking atmosphere in their game, so they had to move somewhere. Well, it didn't help, because after few dialogs with NPCs I lost the will to read through them. You won't find old witty humour of past games, be it an innocent remark of a child or a feeble rage of captured orc. And protagonist is... let's say he just doesn't deserve my sympathy. Plot of King's Bounty used to be a fairytale, now it's nothing but poorly written fanfic.\n\nThen you notice the music, oh god the music. Soothing and magnificient melodies by Lind Erebros has been mixed with cacophony (can't really call it otherwise) by different composer, recorded on different volume levels as well, which makes your speakers (or headphones) explode with loudness from time to time. Also, it seems that devs decided that music in game makes no sense anyway, so now you will hear peaceful themes during the battles. That made me mute in-game sounds and play my own music instead. Because why not, it totally doesn't ruin the atmosphere. If you ignore these major flaws, you can still enjoy the original soundtrack. Lind also made few new tracks for this game and they're amazing too.\n\nOverall game feels extremely unoptimized and will lag even if previously you had no problem running The Legend or Armored Princess. The graphics are also somehow worse than before. New effects (especially valkyries) and unit models (for the most part are simply recolored versions of already existing ones) are losing in quality to old ones. It's like 3 years of difference actually made artists go down a degree.\n\nTo mention the gameplay... Balance suffered an overhaul. Forget everything you knew about the simple units from The Legend. Skeletons can now teleport basically anywhere on the field, magic along with poison and fire can crit(!!!), every units has got a bunch of super complicated abilities, undead's corpses damage your units when you walk past them (kills like 10% of your units)... New units, spells, artifacts - new everything - are boring and make no sense, old ones are weaker, so you either play with "innovations" or make the game harded for yourself. Amount of bossfights is underwhelming: only two and the first one is basically the remade version of a boss from the first game. Remember exciting fights that were actually challenging, such as siege of Karador? Forget it, this games makes up in quantity for quality. Instead you'll get dozens boring fights over and over.\n\nI tried really hard to give it a chance, but after my game crashed as I won a really long battle few times in a row, I could not take it all anymore. This game overall is a major downgrade from first two games. Even if in some moments game looks slightly better than it was before, it is immideately overshadowed by lower quality of everything else. Not to mention occasional bugs and crashes.\n\nPlease, stay away from WotN if you never played King's Bounty before. And  if you did, think twice before buying it. This game has barely anything in common with The Legend and Armored Princess.","October 1, 2015","false","26.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/recommended/203350/","MonikaWeiss","Monika "I.Q." Weiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/","149 products in account","The fourth game in Katauri Interactive’s reboot of olden strategy/RPG hybrid King’s Bounty is out now. Warriors Of The North requires no knowledge of the earlier games, involving a new storyline and a new hero, and a whole lot of Norse mythology-inspired beasts and magic. More of the cheerful same or a new take on what’s become somewhat routine? Here’s what I think.\nI should probably be angry. If I’m moved to shake my fist at the uncaring heavens about identikit military shooters year after year, I should certainly be similarly resentful that the initially super-fresh King’s Bounty series is now on its fourth near-indistinguishable game.\nAnd yet. And yet. Like Armoured Princess and Crossworlds before it, Warriors of the North seems somehow so happy to exist. I’m not in the business of kicking puppies even if one did wee all over my carpet. There are any number of longboats Warriors of the North should and could have pushed out, but instead it settles for adding Nordic units and fine-tuning existing mechanics and not a whole lot more.\nIt looks the same, it feels the same, it plays the same, and as such I pretty can only say the same things about it as before. Although it does have a HEROIC FANTASY soundtrack so subtletly-free and overblown that I came to love it even though it’s indefensible. But somehow, its robust turn-based-strategy/real-time roleplaying/overland exploring systems, comparable to an infinitely cheerier and more streamlined Heroes of Might & Magic, and its semi-incoherent, consistently enthusiastic absurdist babble makes me warm to it despite myself. D’aww, how could I ever be angry at that face?\nA future in which I played a new and not particularly changed King’s Bounty game ever year is not a bad future. Then again I do quite enjoy the Great British Bake-Off and entirely expect to watch it again next year, which probably says a frightening amount about just how easily I take to cosy, unambitious, inoffensive things. I’m a creature who craves calm and comfort, and by God King’s Bounty games give me that. They’re my annual pair of new slippers for Christmas.\nBut I would love to see them strive as well as maintain that cuddly, compulsive formula.\nI’d like, for instance, the new half dozen-odd Viking units to be real game-changers rather than slightly more melodramatic variants of existing units.\nI’d like the hero powers, now primarily based around Valykries rather than spectral summons or Armoured Princess’ cutesy dragon, to become agonising and deadly tactical choices rather than so-so spells, and I’d like to have them used against me rather than purely by me.\nI’d like the island-hopping that the series now prefers to slowly trudging from zone to zone to offer a true choice of route rather than a fixed order.\nI’d like the game’s world to be alive, rather than having fixed enemies in fixed places and becoming empty wastelands once you’ve cleared them out.\nI’d love multiplayer.\nI’d love a fleshed-out economy which entailed generating specific reinforcements from specific captured/defended territories, rather than just buying from fixed unit stocks as you encounter them.\nI’d also like a bigger telly and a second cat, but actually my existing telly’s fine and my cat’s adorable, so maybe I should just stop moaning. I’ve had a happy 20 hours with Warriors of the North and if I really was so damned upset that it was just the same as always, that figure wouldn’t have had a zero at the end of it.\nTellingly though, that figure starts with a 2 rather than a 4, and that’s because, as with its three predecessors, WOTN is over-long and can’t maintain its early energy. An initially playful start, with quests including getting vikings drunk then curing their hangovers, gradually gives way to relentless fetch quests across multiple large zones, with a poor mapping/questlog system making it a headache to work out exactly who was were once you’ve obtained/killed the relevant item/enemies.\nI’d be far happier with 20 hours of steadily escalating battles than with 40 of bimbling around fighting the same old zombies and skellingtons again and again. The dialogue remains peppy throughout, in its somewhat translation-mangled way, but the game has only so many tricks up its sleeves – we’ve married zombies, we’ve pulled dragons’ teeth, we’ve fought inside our own belts, and because of half of that stuff happens only in text it now feels like an old man telling increasingly tired jokes at the dinner table, not a series of beautifully absurd events.\nAnd yet. Twenty hours of my time isn’t easily given away these days, so I must have done it for a reason. That reason is a finely-crafted upgrade system, the slow and frequently-rewarded pursuit of new skills, better skills and larger armies. Same as it ever was, but there’s a sense of real effect as you construct your own skill tree or add a new type of unit to your army (for instance the beefy viking Jarls or the huge, ugly Jotun ice-giants) – not the piddly, fractional boosts of a Diablolike.\nIt’s fine! It should be a £10 expansion pack rather than a £25 expandalone, and as such I can’t in good conscience recommend Warriors of the North over picking up King’s Bounty: The Legend or Crossworlds for far less. It is more finely-balanced, it is free of the slightly grating cutsiness of Armoured Princess and being a big, tough, hairy viking on a flying pony (a quickly-obtained alternate means of navigating around the large overland maps) is a constant delight.","January 3","true","5.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominicUnlimited/recommended/203350/","DominicUnlimited","Dominic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DominicUnlimited/","167 products in account","This game... is frustrating. It is frustrating by design. First off, it's a great game if you like HoMM-style tactical combat in a fantasy setting. The graphics are nice, the setting is okay, there's a story that guides you through the game and the combat mechanics are excellent. On top of that, the game runs very smoothly on my 5y old gaming laptop (aside from a rare crash).\n\nThat said, it taunts you at every step. With a minimal grasp of the game, you can get far without much trouble [on normal difficulty]. You can beat most yellow or lower difficulty mobs without significant losses. If you combine some of the more interesting spells with a good army setup and decent equipment, you'll be winning most battles with barely any losses at all. However, as you can only bring backups for two unit types, any time you lose another type of unit means running back, or fighting at reduced strength (generally not a good idea). If you level up, you can carry more of each unit type and... you'll be running back.\n\nOn top of that, the game has a built-in achievemnt-style "Medal" system. For several types of actions, you can get a medal if you perform them a number of times, which provides a passive benefit. For example, using 50 defensive spells grants 3% damage reduction for the rest of the game. And, of course, a medal for zero-loss fights. And the reward is great, especially early on.\n\nThe game doesn't punish casualties, but makes them annoying enough for you to obsess over zero-loss fights. A Very Weak mob with ranged units can still kill a weaker unit. Sometimes you have the option to skip Very Weak mobs, giving you the exp and gold without fighting. However, you're not grinding for your levels this way, so you'll be tempted to fight them anyway. But a Very Weak mob with ranged units can still take out some of your units, possibly forcing you to backtrack. Ultimately, when you spend 5 full minutes thinking "Should I fight this Very Weak mob?", you have to wonder whether this game is doing something horribly wrong or horribly right.\n\nThe game does provide all the tools required for drastically increasing your odds of zero-loss fights, by means of interesting spells and units. However, large portions of the scrolls you find are randomly generated. In all my King's Bounty games, I've never found a Summon scroll at a relevant moment, which are critical spells for the Mage/Soothsayer class. And that gets frustrating.\n\nSometimes I feel like this game is a psychological experiment. It's not about the battles; it's about you facing your fear of losses, accepting imperfections, letting go of your achievement-lust and just playing the game more casually.\n\nOr maybe nobody bothered to playtest the game without cheats.","June 2, 2014","true","10.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The gameplay is practically the same, with minor changes to classes/skill/magic, companion system and rage use (now it's valkyries not pet dragon or rage spirits). Starts out a bit more restricted, first just one island then a few more, little by little. Also takes more grinding, and sometimes felt a bit tedious. The DLC adds a LOT more content, so I advise choosing the extended campaign. The game itself is super long (about 120 hours for me, that's with killing/solving everything), and is highly entertaining and challenging. At its current price it's already a bargain, if you liked the previous ones you'll probably like this too.","August 22, 2015","true","271.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has pretty much everyting previous titles had with some added features here and there, like viking faction. But this time it delivers pack of gamebreaking bugs on top of it. For example there is "0 dmg instadeath" bug, your troop take 0 dmg from status effect and dies straight away. I also got my spellbook erased near the end of the game. There are some others, but these are the worst. I read that 0 dmg bug does not ocurr if you start new game with the DLC. Sadly for me I didn't and I was way too far in game to start it all over again when I encountered this bug. Oh, and don't forget to save often, "crash happens" (Edit: game crashes very often during "practice" fight with inkeeper Whistle in Arlania. Seems like it always happens when he cast Dispel).\n\nI would advise you to buy a different King's Bounty game. I heard that Crossworlds is good.

If you're a hardcore fan of the series, you'll certainly enjoy another race, another school of rage abilities, more troops, more spells, tweaked skills and artifacts, nice art and continuation of the storyline from previous chapters of the game. In my opinion, however, playtime of 80 hours (I took my time, I admit) is way too much for an extention. Especially given that upon arrival to Arlania (took me 20 hours at most) I've established combination of troops which I used till the end of the game, hardly losing any of them in battles.

It's useless against the boss.  The devs went and disabled it saying that the boss needs a "Fighting Chance".

Either that or they should have at least did some sort of nerfing on the effects of the item when fighting bosses.\n\nFor the price it's worth and the length of the game it may be worth it.

Being the third game in a series that hasn't changed all that much from installment to installment (and of course beyond that there's the part where it liberally borrows from Heroes of Might and Magic), I found this one to be very much more of the same and in turn I am very much okay with that. Okay, that's selling it a bit short. It does mess around with the formula in some minor ways, adds some neat new units and spells and also seems to crash a lot more often than the other two did, and if you spent somewhere around 50 hours in the previous games like I did those changes will matter quite a bit, especially early on when you're pretty much stuck using the new Viking units exclusively for the first dozen or so hours.\n\nIn short, it still delivers that kind of exploration+tactical combat that made those other two games enjoyable, warts and all (though you gain the ability to fly quite early in the game, as opposed to around the halfway mark of Armored Princess, making getting around a lot less tedious as a result) If you  aren't  okay with that, perhaps you enjoyed The Legend or Armored Princess but got burnt out by the end of either or found the previous games to be slow and boring and repetitive, stay away. This is more of that. If you are into Heroes of Might and Magic or something and are wondering which game in the series to get, I'd say Armored Princess (with mini-expansion Crossworlds) is the way to go, and that extends to people wondering what these games are all about as well. It's more stable (i.e. doesn't crash nearly as much), not quite as lethargically paced and has some neat side scenarios to mess with outside of the main game. That being said, if you're still up for more King's Bounty after that, Warriors of the North does a pretty good job of filling that niche.","February 10, 2014","true","42.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A huge amount of side and main quests keeps the player busy, the story is interesting and some dialogues have a good portion of humour. The variety of Units, spells and items to choose from allow for much diversity, replayability and most importantly: fun.\n\nI have played through the main campaign several times already, tried different tactics, units and spells. I've never grown tired of fighting although many fights tend to be very similar and some of them really long. For me, the gameplay of King's Bounty: WotN offers is unique and simply the best I have found so far. However, every game usually has it's downsides and so is it as well with King's Bounty: WotN. The game is quite buggy in means you can encounter crashes to desktop. There are very few game breaking bugs where there is no fix or work around. Worst is, that there is almost no support from official side regarding the gamebreaking bugs. Although I feel this is getting better now as the DLC was released.\n\nIn the end I can say: If you already played the prequels and liked them, you will not find too much new content in WotN and you might be disappointed. If you are new to the series I'd definitely recommend this game and you should start loving the very unique experience.","April 3, 2014","true","527.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am new to the King's Bounty series and started with Warriors of the North. I definitely will add Fire and Ice dlc.  I had played single player turn-based combat games, but this is my first team turn-based strategy and it was not too difficult. You do have to pay attention to the battlefield, your strenghts and weaknesses, and know your enemy. So far I think it  is captivating, and well-done.","May 23, 2014","true","129.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The combat is annoying, the story is generic, and it isn't entertaining for much more than 15 minutes at a time.\n\nIt's not a particularly BAD game, but it's not worth the $30 price tag.

Meaning it's basically just yet another expansion on the original.\n\nFor me, that was a mixed thing. Every couple years I get a craving for exactly this style of game and this time Warriors of the North satisfied that. However the repetition from title to title is starting to become so glaringly obvious that it's difficult to imagine picking up any more games in this series until they take some risks and redesign things. After playing through this one I'm sick of fighting the same giant spider, using the same tactics and strategies, and having the same predictable AI. After fighting enough battles (which you certainly will) the patterns in AI become obvious to pretty much anyone and suddenly winning battles isn't a strategic endeavor anymore so much as a grind.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that I didn't find it as challenging as Armored Princess. I played both games on Impossible from the start and Armored Princess had me very carefully choosing my battles and managing my troops just to survive for the first half of the game, while the second half became more of an easy grind. Warriors of the North had its challenging moments but for the most part the entire thing felt like the second half of Armored Princess - too easy.\n\nMy second biggest complaint is the lack of variety - undead enemies over and over for the first half of the game, and then in the last half undead still in excess but every other battle rather than every single battle. In the last half you get out into areas that start tossing demons and dragons and whatever else your way but even then there is almost always a pack of skeleton archers thrown in even when it's entirely out of place (skeleton archers just hanging out with 10,000 devilfish). I fought skeleton archers so many times it started to become instinctive to just take them out with the same strategy at the start of every battle, with a rather ridiculous amount of battles boiling down to waiting for the "post skeleton archer" portion so that the real battle can begin.\n\nOverall I had fun playing through the game in a grind and progress sort of way, but I'm thinking this is probably the last time I'm going to pick up yet another King's Bounty expansion. This game is way overdue for a complete overhaul in both gameplay mechanics and general game engine, and even though I love this style of game probably way more than most people do I don't think I'll be able to drum up much excitement for yet another stab at the same old thing.","May 27, 2015","true","172.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm pretty sure this is how they boast of a 'long play time', half your time is going back and forth for stupid quests or fighting just tons and tons of mobs for pitiful xp instead of giving you fewer battles with more exp, for example.\n\nI'm slugglishly trying to finish this game. There is no way I'm buying another expansion based on this same game engine. They need to invest in this franchise with all the money they made and build a new game engine; make this game quality again like it was with the 'Legend'.  This franchise is going down the tubes just like Heroes of Might and Magic, ironically, since they are similar genres.","April 16","false","123.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For you who didn't tried KB, it's like Heroes Of Might and Magic, just real time. Interesting and nice game to play. Everything is in real time, except combat, it's like in HOMM.\n\nPros:\n-  It still got that KB atmosphere and soul of older series. Interesting, fun to play, many task etc.\n\nCons:\n- Graphic is very nice and it was amazing when game came out 6 years ago, but they could update it more, however, graphic is still beautiful.\n- Games crashes sometimes","January 20, 2015","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I checked the options to see if the resolution is right and graphics aren't too low. I saw the 3D option! It's amazing if you don't have eye problems. I started the game. I chose a viking to play. Talked with the brother and my first fight. For the first time it felt awesome, but then it got boring. Reading, reading, reading and reading AGAIN. C'mon, Civilization even has that lots of text, but it's more interesting! I really didn't like the game. It felt too much as Heroes V.\n\nBoring....\n2/10","May 20","false","1.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are not yet tired of the game after playing "The Legend", "Armored Princess" and "Crossworlds", buy it without hesitation. If you haven't played any games in the series and like RPGs, turn-based combat and fantasy, it's a must play.\n","May 31","true","32.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
