"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/339230/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Zombi is, as many of you already know, an enhanced port of ZombiU, a launch title for the WiiU. While it was a pretty good game overall, it wasn't really well-received, and I always thought that was unfortunate because I enjoyed it a lot.\n\nZombi is a game that puts a big emphasis on death, and features two different gameplay modes to accomodate this. The first Standard mode, which is more like the death mechanic used in the Souls series. When you first start the game you get a random character with a quick explanation of his or her name and occupation, and that's your character. A single zombie bite will kill you, though they usually attack through swipes unless they catch you off guard. If you die in this mode, your character is permanently killed, and a new survivor arrives at the safe house for you to play as. If you can get to your old survivor without dying, you can regain your items, but if you die again, all of the items from the original survivor are gone, barring the ones that can't be taken from you like the cricket bat and flashlight. In the second mode, Survival, more inspired by rogue-likes, the stakes are even higher and if you die then that's it; the game's over.\n\nThe two options each come with a "Chicken" difficulty setting that makes them easier, but if you're the person that would actually pick a difficulty like that then I'd recommend just playing another game because the big draw of the game is the tension that it builds from making your character so vulnerable. Ammo and guns are relatively scarce, so you'll be forced into close melee encounters pretty often, and even though your backpack holds a decent amount of items you'll quickly find that it never feels like quite enough, creating a risk vs reward situation where you have to decide whether you want to keep moving forward or if you should head back to the safe house to put some items into storage to make room. Certain areas may change when you leave and return, like a certain area that sometimes may only be gently raining, only to turn into a downpour similar to Left 4 Dead 2's Hard Rain when you return and making things a lot harder to see.\n\nAs far as the improvements go, they're a bit hard to tell. The PC port, performance-wise, is fairly good for me, but I'm not really a good judge of that since I have pretty good specs. It supports high framerates and has an FOV slider that works well enough that I didn't feel the need to look for an external fix, and while graphically it seems like all they've done is enhance the textures and let it run in higher resolutions, the game already had a good enough art direction on the WiiU that it manages to look well enough. There isn't much in the way of graphical settings, however (aside from things like vsync and resolution, you can't really change much at all), so if you're worried you won't be able to run it it may be best to wait and hear other peoples' experiences. Gameplay-wise they've thankfully included the drag-and-drop inventory management, and the controls are all around pretty fairly adapted. They've also added two new melee weapons to break up the monotony of the cricket bat (which was one of the bigger complaints about the original game, since you do end up using it a lot) that have different attack styles and do varying amounts of damage. The removal of the WiiU gamepad element has somewhat lessened some of the effects the original game had, but not by much - you don't have the tension of having to look at a second screen to manage your inventory and hoping that nothing is coming towards you on the main screen anymore, for instance, but the mechanics are still adapted enough that I don't think it impacts the game very much.\n\nAnother thing that should be noted is that all online functions seem to be gone, as far as I can tell. The local multiplayer function (which was basically just Zombie Master in ZombiU, so it's not a huge loss to the PC crowd anyways) was already known to be gone, but they also seem to have removed the online features where you could leave tagged messages for other players and also potentially find zombified players with the supplies they had on them when they died in their game. It may just be that I'm not far enough in to remember when those begin to occur, though, since it's been 3 years since I played ZombiU.\n\nOverall, Zombi is a fine game if you haven't burnt out on zombie games yet. It takes what would normally be a pretty tired concept by now and spices things up by making your deaths count and turning zombies into actual threats instead of cannon fodder. As a $60 WiiU game it might've been hard to recommend, but for $20 I think it's a great price for a pretty fun game.","August 19, 2015","true","14.1"," 634 of 694 people (91%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","91","634","694","19","24"

You'll have to complete some missions for this voice (loot some places, reactivate the surveillance systems, and so on).\n\nThe core of the game is to survive as long as possible while looting places, gathering new equipment and completing missions the voice gives you.\n\n\n\nCombat\nYou can defend yourselfes with a variety of different melee and ranged weapons. I wouldn't recommend using ranged weapons unless you don't have any other choice, because you will make a lot of noice and attract other zombies.\n\nThe melee combat itself is pretty simple. You just have to hold down the right mouse button to "charge" up your attack and then press the left mouse button to hit a zombie in it's ugly face, that's it.\n\n\n\nDeath\nOne pretty cool feature of this game is the death system. When you die, well you're dead. At least the character you controlled at this time. You will spawn as a completely different character (male & female). You will loose all the stuff that you've looted with your other character, but you're able to get your stuff back by going to the place you died. So here comes the cool thing: Your previous character will turn into one of the many zombies wandering around in London and you can kill your previous character to get all your stuff back. Of course you don't have to do this, but I'd recommend to do so.\n\n\n\nSome Q&A :)\nQ:  ZombiU had the second controller of the WiiU, which was a core element of the game. So how does Zombi manage this gameplay feature?\n\nA:  You still have some sort of scanner you can equip by holding down "C". You can scan the area around you by pointing at points of interest and "scan" them. They will then be highlighted on your minimap.\n\n\nQ:  I heard about a 30FPS lock on PS4 and XBOX ONE, what about the PC?\n\nA:  There is no FPS lock in this game, at least on the PC, but the graphic settings are s*** the only thing you can change that affects performance is the resolution (Or I'm just blind and you can change things like textures or AA somewhere else in the settings)\n\n\nQ:  Is it worth the 20 bucks?\n\nA:  I'd say yes it is. It has a decent atmosphere and I like that type of gameplay. But if you're looking for a game like dayz, you're definitely wrong with this one.\n\n\nQ:  Does this game require uPlay?\n\nA:  Sadly, yes... It does\n\n\n\nAnd some Pro's and Con's :)\nPRO:\n- Awesome atmosphere\n- No FPS lock\n- Fun and addictive gameplay\n- Pretty cool perma-death-feature (kill your previous character to get your stuff back)\n- Real life locations in London (Buckingham Palace for example)\n\n\nCON:\n- Poor graphic settings (you can only change the resolution, brightness, FOV, and I think a few other things, but nothing that really affects the performance, except the resolution)\n- Graphics are very outdated (washed up textures, stiff animations, etc.)\n- No multiplayer\n- Uplay is required","August 18, 2015","true","4.2"," 1,167 of 1,354 people (86%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","86","167","1","78","83"

If you don't like Uplay, avoid the game.\n\n\n\nI've played this a bit on the Wii U, so I know enough about the game to give it a bit of a review at this stage.\n\nYou play as a survivor in London, England and you have a rather linear story mode, that focuses on intense close quarters combat rather than fighting off hordes of zombies. The survivor is pretty much a nameless person, as in they're not a hero in the story. If they die, they die. Anything they were carrying you "lose". You come back as someone else and continue the game. I say "lose", because your recently dead survivor joins the undead and you can kill them to get your stuff back. This is a great mechanic and really adds to the immersion.\n\nIt's very much a survival horror, you can easily become overwhelmed if you make a mistake. You manage your inventory in game, and the game doesn't pause when you go into your backpack, so choosing the right location to do it is necessary. You have 4 quick slots to quickly access certain items (other weapons, medkits). You also have very limited inventory space, so you need to carefully choose what you take with you each time you leave (the rest goes into a storage box at the base).\n\nYou have guns, despite it being England, and finding a gun over here is about as likely as finding a zombie survival game with crafting that isn't in Early Access. Ammo can be pretty scarce since you need inventory slots to carry it, and instead opted for the melee weapons (like a cricket bat, I liked the reference to Shaun of the Dead). They take longer to kill zombies, but saving ammo is crucial.\n\n\nNow for the port.\n\nThere is no framerate cap. I'm running it at 144fps.\nIt has resolutions higher than 1080p (I'm on 1440p, so I don't know if it can do 4k)\nThere is an FoV adjustment option, but it doesn't really give you much info other than -10% to 10%. Numbers would be better.\nThere are no other options for editing AA, SSAO, Shadows etc. Basically, if the game doesn't run well on your machine, your only option is to lower the resolution. There are some unencrypted files in the base folder that seem to hint at changing things like MSAA, so perhaps someone will work them out if they actually do anything.\n\nInitial impressions seems that it runs fine. Keeps steady at 144fps at 1440p. The graphics aren't going to win any awards, but for a £15 Wii U port, they're better than the original. I'm on quite a hefty machine (4790k @4.5ghz/SLI 980s/16gb RAM), so I can't speak for lower end users, but at least it's not like Arkham Knight where you can overpower it and still get sub par performance.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend it. It's not a bad game, and the port is pretty good, even if there are a lack of options in the menu.\n\n\nSomething else I didn't like was that it gives me the Xbox controls on screen (the controller is plugged in), despite using the mouse and keyboard. Something PS4 controller users might like is that in the options, you can change it to display PS controller button prompts. It's a case of either using a controller or memorising the keyboard controls. I'll do the latter.","August 18, 2015","true","2.2"," 509 of 584 people (87%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","87","509","584","37","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/339230/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","What is it?ZOMBI is an excellent horror-survival game where you will roam through a masterfully-recreated London, guided by your mysterious helper, "The Prepper".  The story starts with the tale that England's capital has been struck down by a foretold (but ignored!) plague.  Your shelters are mapped out for you but you need to scavenge for edibles (to repair your health), ammo, wood for boarding up doors and just about any salvageable weapon.  As usual, there never, ever seems to be enough ammo, so get used to that cricket bat!  There is no manual save either; instead, you must find a shelter where you can sleep, at which point the game is saved and your health restored.  A word of warning: shelters are few and far between, so staying safe really matters in this game.\n\nImportant!  This is an older game ported to the PC from the Wii-U, and where the rough edges show particularly is in textures and any close-ups of just about anything.  Images don't look as sharp as those advertised on the store page thanks in part to an overly zealous chromatic aberration effect that muddies outlines somewhat.  Unfortunately, there is no way to alter any of the game's graphic settings beyond v-sync and resolution (not even a config file) so if you want to improve the game's looks, you're going to have to dig into your GPU drivers for some AA settings, and maybe blag SweetFX or whatever you do when you have a game that offers nothing more than V-Sync and Resolution.  However, even without extra settings, the graphics really do generate a dark and desolate atmosphere and play a huge part in the setting of this story.\n\nIt is not all that similar to Dying Light.  I mention this because some reviews and forum comments imply that it is.  It's quite linear, there is no parkour and you can rarely climb anything, but survival is MUCH more emphasised in this title and the atmosphere is much more oppressive.  This truly feels like a very different - though equally enjoyable - game.  Where Dying Light feels like an energised romp to save the world and defeat a power-hungry institution while everyone awaits rescue, ZOMBI feels bleak and desolate, with no hope.  This is the first of many, many survivor games where I truly felt like I was merely a survivor clinging to life, and despite my unseen helper's presence, I felt very alone.\n\nIs it open-world?No, but there are a good range of locations you can revisit at any time to gather remaining consumables that you've pinned on your map for later use, and some areas are huge.  Some locations are frustratingly linear where you are forced by a tumble of boxes to walk a specific route (despite the boxes being low, or very few - something you could easily climb over in real life).  That makes the game feel a tad old-school.\n\nIs it scary?The atmosphere can make it very tense, especially in dark areas, and there are occasional, rather too well done jump-scares that will catch you out if not expecting them!  As usual, there are no gore filters in zombie-world, so only buy if you find lopping off heads quite a casual pastime!\n\nIs it hard?For the Easily Bewildered (of which I am one), it's not overly hard, but hard enough.  Meeting an individual zombie is easy, but being flanked by three or more becomes very difficult - harder than Dying Light so don't get flanked!  There are two modes you can play: the standard mode and a survival mode (permadeath).  The Easily Bewildered will need to join me in the first (standard) queue where you can elect to play as CHICKEN or STANDARD difficulty (Hint without spoilers: choose the one that clucks and lays eggs unless you're brilliant at games).\n\nThe game has a novel mode where you will continue to play until you die (at which point you have now become a zombie yourself (too bad), and as zombies aren't playable (see - told you it's not like Dying Light...) you respawn as an entirely new person back at the shelter without any of your much-loved kit and so your first task is to set off and find your zombified former person and wrestle it (you?) for your previous back-pack.  Be warned: if you die AGAIN on the way, you will lose access to the full back-pack because you will again respawn, and of course the back-pack you find will be empty because former-you never found the full back-pack!  The random respawn is a great twist to survival and really enjoyable.  Even if I was any good at games, I think I'd prefer this to the harder mode.\n\nThe harder 'survivor' mode for grown-up gamers is permadeath.  Yes, you only have one life and when you die, it's GAME OVER.  The emphasis here is on how far into the game you can get.  After a certain point in the story you are given a limited tool that will save you from a single zombie-bite, but it won't help you if you're mobbed.\n\nHas it been remastered?No - it is the original game, along with some of the original incidental bugs.  The main change made is to overlay the map and back-pack inventory onto the screen (these used to be shown separately on the Wii U controller's digital pad).  Curiously, a couple of graphics effects (like dirty lens view) have been dropped from this version.  Otherwise, it is the exact same game with no extra frills - hence that cheap (for Ubisoft) price.\n\nWhat's not to like?Well, there's everyone's favourite whipping-boy, UPlay, though of late the client is MUCH better than it ever used to be...  Secondly, it loves to crash, and given that your progress is only saved when you sleep in a shelter (and shelters are as rare as hens' teeth), inopportune crashing is frustrating and can lose a lot of progress, so make a habit of returning to your safe-house or shelter often.  There's that lack of graphic settings (a bit naughty of Ubisoft) so you have very little visual control over your game.  Finally, it does its absolute best to insist you have a gamepad connected, so get ready to disconnect everything that isn't a mouse or keyboard if you do want to play with mouse and keyboard.  Oh, and there's no multiplayer in this version.  Me being anti-social, I'm not at all bothered, but the removal of multiplayer has upset a few fans of the original game.\n\nWhich is the best version?Ordinarily, the answer to this kind of question is nearly always 'PC', but in this instance that might not be so true.  If you own a Wii-U, then buying the game on that platform is recommended because your backpack is managed on the digital display of your controller, ramping up the scare factor because you have to look away from what might be behind you in order to change weapons.  Or, if you have a PS4, the game is arguably better there too because the mysterious 'helper' voice comes through your controller's speaker and feels for all the world like a portable walkie-talkie or ear-piece as it would be.  Graphically the game is no different on either of these platforms, but those little extras are neat touches on Wii-U and PS4.\n\nIn summaryZOMBI is a fun (in that horrific-fun way) and atmospheric crawl around a gorgeously painted plague and smog-ridden London.  It's not a massively long game, but there is plenty of game provided.  Its 'mixed' rating on Steam is largely down to three problems: it hasn't been enhanced for PC at all, it uses UPlay (which has been improved massively in recent months so is not really an issue any longer) and many people have been blighted by frequent crashes or have not been able to get the game running at all.  As a result, PLEASE use Steam's 14-day 2 hour refund window to test at least the first 'proper' mission in the supermarket.  If you get through that and are then able to move on to the next part of the story, you should be absolutely fine.","August 21, 2015","true","66.1"," 177 of 207 people (86%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","86","177","207","15","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/339230/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1596 products in account","Ah, Zombi. Undoubtedly Ubisoft's attempt at cashing in on the zombie craze. I was reluctant to pick up this game at first due to the mixed reviews, and the fact that I'm still angry at Ubisoft over Assassin's Creed: Unity. In fact I haven't bought a Ubisoft game since that catastrophe, which I paid full price for. I'm also pretty sick of zombie and zombie accessories. But my friend was feeling pretty bad today, and I knew that playing this would cheer her right up since she'd ask me to play it a while ago.\n\nFirst off, this game runs through both uPlay and Steam. I really don't understand the point of this, other than Ubisoft maintaining their uPlay Reward system; which is crap, if you ask me. The game has Steam achievements, so uPlay is really unnecessary here. About an hour into the game, I encountered my first game crashing bug... I simply attempted to remove a barricade from a door. Luckily my save point was only about 10-15 minutes from the point where I crashed, but others may not be so lucky.\n\nBy the third hour in, I'd made it halfway through the very linear storyline. There are a good variety of zombie models, although you will encounter many zombies that look the same. There are also "special" zombies (L4D) like the Spitter. I've managed to grab three different guns at this point, although I'm stuck with the same melee weapon that you start with. So far I've been through the streets, a supermarket, sewers and part of Buckingham Palace. I have to say that the setting of Zombi is unique, I don't recall having gone through London in any zombie game before.\n\nThe level designs are fairly boring with little to do. Most of the time when you go to loot any container, or body, in the open world they're empty. So it makes exploring a little pointless and dreary. I should also mention at this point that anytime you die, you come back as another survivor. So there is a minimal rogue-like essence here. However, I just lost my first survivor and I did not even die. Out of nowhere, while I was attacking, the zombie jumped through my attack animation and infected me; while I was at full health. You lose all your stuff when you "die", so good luck getting it back.\n\nOverall, up to this point I have had a fair bit of fun and I've had many moments where I've screamed; which is rare for me in horror games anymore. I'm not necessarily scared during the gameplay, but the jumpscares are actually fun. Normally I hate jumpscares with a passion. Sadly, Ubisoft are (typically) unresponsive in the forums about crash and bug fixes. The graphics are completely under par for the current generation and have an annoying haze to them. I can't recommend the game for the price, but I can recommend it on sale. Just be forewarned about the issues that will most likely never get fixed, let alone noticed.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0 - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 27, 2015","false","3.0"," 153 of 206 people (74%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","74","153","206","13","0"

The survival-horror elements are really and well-implemented, especially because of the death system the game implements.  If you die, you lose your stuff, and have to get it back.  If you die again before reclaiming it, it's gone.  For good.\nHaving played both versions now, I have to say, although I still prefer the Wii U version, this is a very accurate recereation of it.  I do wish, just a little, that the multiplayer was still a part of it, as I really liked that, too, and I think they could make it work on PC, but unfortunately it was cut.  That, really, is my main gripe.\nAlthough the game's a bit short, and the ending is dissapointing (unless they've changed it for the PC version), the game has quite a bit of challenging, especially if you play survival mode.\nThis game is a must-have for fans of the survival-horror genre.  Although it isn't adding much new to the genre, it's still a lot of fun to play, and for $20, it's a great deal.\nI'd give it an 8.5/10.\n\nUPDATE: A lot of people have been saying this game is crashing on them, and those people seem to all have Nvidia graphics cards.  Or something like that.  So, the caveat is, I guess, be careful, because it might crash.  It hasn't crashed on me yet, surprisingly, and runs quite well. I play on a toaster-top.

You then spawn as another randomly generated person and you have to go back to your body to retrieve your loot.\n2) If you hit your former self in the face like I did to make sure he/she is dead the game will crash(windows 10). Not sure if its the game or the OS.\n3) Just found out that there are zombies who have an explosive tank on them. IF you engage in melee combat 1 hit KO.\n4) If you die again on the 2nd character you get before looting your first dead body. All loot disappears from that person. If you are unlucky like me you lost a bunch of ammo, a pistol, spiked bat and a shotgun along with some molotovs and med kits. It is a bit frustrating due to the game being hard to find stuff in. Just don't die, simple as that.\n##########\n\nThis game just works, I have rarely found any game that could actually scare me, even in the slightest. Haven't jumped out of my chair this many times since I last played the Dead Space series. The reason this game is capable of pulling it off, is that you truly don't know whats coming next. It's not so easily predicted like other games in the genre(which I am an enthusiast of survival horror and zombies in general).\n\nI have not played the original as I don't own a WiiU. This game actually makes me wish I did, but I will never fray from PC gaming. From what I have read this is the same game(someone please clerify).\n\nAnyways right from the start, the game draws you into the immersive environment. You have a person (who I have yet to meet) guiding you along your survival journey. So far most combat for me has been preferably melee. Don't want to draw too much attention becasue the zombies do pack a punch(quite literally). The game has a very dark atmosphere, so get used to having that flashlight out for some periods of time. If you played games such as Dead Island or Dead Rising(though not as many zombies) you will be pleased by your 20$ investment into a complete masterpiece.\n\nWhat you will learn in this game.\n1) How to kill zombies and be stealthy!\n2) You will soon be a professional cricket player!\n3) Learn to trust strangers!\n4) Reclaim your childhood fear of the dark!\n5) Discover your fear of what hides in the water.\n6) Realize you might be making frequent bathroom breaks after nearly sh**ing your pants from jumpscares.\n7) Figure out that a single shot/blow to the head is simply not enough..\n\n20/10 Would review it again!","August 21, 2015","true","15.9"," 112 of 147 people (76%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","76","112","147","27","5"

And yes, I've tried all of the fixes, which fix some of the crashes, but not all.\n\n- NO AUTO SAVE. Prepare to lose a LOT of progress.\n\n- Inventory management is BONKERS.  Dedicated bank is too small for the massive amount of loot. Cannot remove ammunition from guns (or if you can, I STILL have yet to find a way). Cannot remove your starting pistol and bat from inventory. Cannot move around currently equipped item.\n\n- Some of the UI is useless. The map especially.\n\n- Exploration is minimal despite what it might seem like. Places feel very recycled in areas. I can describe this game as "extremely overwhelmingly dark for no reason hallway simulator". You'll get tired of dark storage rooms within minutes.\n\n- Story is barebones and uninteresting, no characters to latch on to. Quests feel pointless.\n\n- Suicide zombies are TERRIBLE in a game about survival. Two of my deaths in the game came from a suicide zombie that appears on my shoulder at the wrong time. Also, LITERALLY: Ghost zombies. Not even kidding. Like why the ♥♥♥♥ is that a thing??\n\n- No control over how your character looks in a game where it looks like there are several different ways they can look. I can accept no customization after the first death, but can I at LEAST customize my first guy so it hurts even harder when I lose him?\n\n- Missed opportunity in having a nursery level without children zombies. I know why they didn't do it, but it was still a let down how manufactured that whole area was.\n\n- Audio/Graphics options are minimal.\n\n\nOverall:\nI enjoyed it but it was a giant missed opportunity. It plays exactly like a game that would be decent on the WiiU, but terrible when compared to how great it could have been. It's also very fustrating how broken so much of it is. Despite that, I'd recommend it when it's on sale for a fun 9-10 hours... otherwise, I give it a no.\n","February 28","false","10.1"," 77 of 99 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","77","99","4","1"

ZOMBI is a lot like Dying Light meets One of the millions of zombie survival games on steam today, but Zombi does a lot of good things. The horror part of this game is awesome it has a great atmosphere and fantastic environments to explore a little less open world as I hoped but still good. The combat is fun I wish there was ADS, but the gunplay is still fun.

Few survivors are left in the city, but those who are still alive are doing their best to survive. You play as a random survivor of 'The second blight', a plague that would kill everything it touches and cleanse England to begin again. That random survivor that you are assigned with is saved by a man who calls himself 'The Prepper', he will give you certain tasks that you must carry out through the game, while searching for supplies and weapons. The game has some interesting characters with great motives, like a scientist stuck in Buckingham Palace searching for a cure, or 'The Prepper', a man who is convinced that there is no cure and the only thing possible is to survive.\n\nGameplay The game can be finished in between 8 to 10 hours, depends on how much time you'll take searching for supplies. Melee is the main combat in the game, that can get pretty dull after you smack a few zombies with a cricket-bat. There is also a large amount of firearms in the game, which are mostly used for an emergency. You'll get a couple of quests that you must carry out in the whole game, all mostly fetch quests, but enjoyable to play since most of them will send you too new locations. And a new location means: New weapons, new supplies and a new way to die. Most locations are also very grim and full of atmosphere. This game is one of those examples where atmosphere is done right.\n\nDeath ZOMBIU (ZOMBI for the WiiU, the original title) was famous for the interesting death mechanic. Once your randomized character dies, he's dead, no going back to that guy. You'll spawn in your safe house with a new randomized character, stripped for all supplies next to the things you decided to leave at your safe house. The now dead survivor will be a part of the undead horde with all your supplies still safely in his nice little backpack. So the first task at hand is to get back your supplies. Once you reach the area where your survivor died, you must put him out of his misery and regain your supplies, and so the cycle continues.\n\nConclusion The zombie survival genre is bloated with the same 'Online zombie survival crafting sim' game. It's refreshing to see a linear open world zombie game done in a singleplayer experience. No crafting, just fun. The PC version of ZOMBIU is a fun, but flawed game. Melee combat is very dull with a total of three melee weapons to find in the game, and one move to execute. The atmosphere is amazingly done, and will give you a real feel of dread through the whole game. Death plays a key part in ZOMBI and you'll get attached to your character even though he has no real voice and backstory. ZOMBI is overall a real joy to play, the game is flawed, but knows how to make a great zombie survival without a dull online open world with a crafting mechanic.\n\n7.5/10","August 22, 2015","true","12.7"," 79 of 108 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","79","108","3","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AshmoreSan/recommended/339230/","AshmoreSan","Ashmore [目隠しダ]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AshmoreSan/","255 products in account","Let's be honest, Zombi is just a quick cash grab from Ubisoft to make some dosh this summer, so you should not expect an amazing port. So what did they do? They took a WiiU exclusive game and ported it to others platforms. Basically, you are playing a zombie game where death is permanent. You die, you loose all the stuff your character was holding and you start from scratch with another character. It's a cool concept, it reminds me of Diablo II where if you died, you were starting from scratch and you had to get your stuff back.\n\nThe gameplay consists of looting areas, fighting the zeds with your melee weapons or fire weapons, and of course, do the quests your being told to do. Talking about weapons, there is a nice variety of weapons like MP5,UMP, AK, silenced pisol, pistol, shotgun, M1014, crossbow etc... . To help you in your looting you have a scanner that tells you the locations of loot in your area, reveals code for numpads, reveals if an infected has some loot on it. That feature on WiiU was done with the gamepad, but here it's everything on one screen, just like all the gamepad feature in fact. Since we have no wiiu gamepad, all the stuff is done via one screen, same goes for the map that is on the bottom right corner. So when it comes to immersion and all, you could say that the WiiU is superior in that point. The main issue about the gameplay is that we have WAY TOO MUCH ressources. Seriously, you have a really big arsenal of ammunition.  There are so much ammunitions to find, that I found myself just not caring in some areas at some point because I knew in the safehouse I had enough to keep feeding my trigger friendly fingers.\n\nThe story is pretty much meh. Another zombie infection where you'll try to find a cure or a vaccine and get the hell ouf of there with the same old clichés that you've seen a hundred times either in moves or in other games. I guess the cool thing in the story is that you get to see a zombie eating a child. The main story is kinda short as well. I've completed the game in 9 hours and I could have beaten it faster if I didn't have so much trouble to find the 7 Dee's letters. Talking about those letters, they are just there to do some padding and try to increase the length of the game artificially. At least, if you are a good explorer, you can get some of them in advance on your first run and won't have to do too much back tracking.\n\nThe port in itself isn't very exceptionnal. You got FOV settings, resolutions, vsync and that is it. At least, the frame rate is completely uncapped. Overall, the game is running fine, but there are some areas where the frame rate will just drop from 125fps to 45fps in just a matter of second. I didn't experienced frame drops too much but it was happening often in the roof of the London Tower and the turret areas near Buckingam. The game isn't looking very good and it has some physics issues with the zombies.\n\nOverall, this game is okay, I had fun playing it and I'll probably go back to it at some point.","August 20, 2015","true","8.8"," 76 of 104 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","76","104","6","0"

That's right,  it'll just CTD and lose you an hour of gameplay for no good reason.   I'm downgrading this one to a 4/10 and Uninstalling.  Piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\n\nHrm,  mixed feelings about this one.\n\nThe game itself is a solid,  although not exceptional survival experience.  You roam around the metro tunnels and abandoned streets of London in search of snickers bars and handgun ammo.  Ocassionally you run into zombies,  whose heads you must beat in with your trusty cricket bat.   The combat isn't particularly deep or even very satisfying,  but it provides some basic sense of tension and fun because of just how hard it is to keep a zombie down.  The gore / damage modeling is pretty basic with the head being the only 'destroyable' part of the zombie (that i've noticed thus far).\n\nSo that's the game, and on its own I'd say it's kind of a 7/10 type experience.  Not bad, even pretty good.  But not exceptional.  But then there's the whole 'Port' side of  things, where its clear that nobody gave a single ♥♥♥♥ about making this work correctly on the PC.\n\n- Must restart game to change resolution\n- Letter boxing, and no support for different aspect ratios.\n- Xbox controller UI art,  even when you're not using a controller.\n- Clumsy inventory system which is a nightmare to manage\n- Unskippable intro cinematics\n- Muddy looking graphics with non-optional post process effects.\n- Requires Ubisofts lame 'UPlay' service to run\n- etc. etc.\n\nIt just adds up to drag the game down to more of a 5 or 6  out of 10 type experience.    If you're REALLY hooked on zombies,  I guess it's worth a punt.

This game is...alright at best.\nI have to mention that Zombi is prone to crashing....combine that with the fact you can only save by going to the safe house and this can be very anoying. When I first started the game I lost about 40+ mins of playtime and then the next day I lost 4 hours of progression. Just take every single chance you can to save your game. Also quite scary sometimes.\n\nNow to the gameplay...its very fun overall even though it doesnt really do much special throughout the game. The majority of the time you will be using the cricket bat (or one of the other 2 better weapons later on). Killing zombies with these is very repetitive which mostly consists of hitting them over and over and over and over using the exact same head-hitting animation for every zombie in the whole game. Default weapons/items still take up your limted inventory space as you cannot remove them to put them in storage for some reason, despite having a better version weapon of the default cricket bat you have to carry this useless thing around because survivours love cricket apparently. Ammo is very scarce but in my opinion its like candy because it makes the game feel fun compared to everything else. I found around 12 guns in the game, half of which are better variants of the same weapon however weapon upgrades are everywhere.\n\nThough you can see the game has some empty content as in the weapon upgade menu you can see supressors and scopes are an blanked-out option  so you are only limited to slight stat-increases. In addition some guns are basicly useless due to finding them near the end of the game and having almost no ammunition in the game aside from the very rare chance a ZOMBI drops 1 bullet (I'm looking at you magnum).\n\nThe story of the game is what you expect from a zombie survival game (almost no-existant, exculding a select few) and the game feels sort of short if you dont try to look for the extra weapons or upgrades (the letters are required for the story though).\n\nOverall the game is alright. play it long enough and you can see it was made to be bigger and more polished but never reached the point. I recommend it if its on sale but remeber it may crash and anoy you.","August 31, 2015","true","18.1"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","27","39","4","4"

First off, the game plays very smoothly, I saw a lot questions bringing up the quality of the port, and I can safely say this ran at well over 60+ FPS throughout my first 45 minutes or so playing. It's worth mentioning that there is NO multiplayer support, and this game requires uPlay to enjoy. There seemed to be a lot of complaints about the latter, but I had absolutely no issues with uPlay when I first booted the game. Sure, it's pointless with a Steam title, but when we're talking about actual "issues" here... I had none.\n\nThe graphics by no means are "next-gen" but they're perfectly acceptable and on-par with Outlast. The "settings" leave a little to be desired (along with the FOV - which there is a setting for but only up to +10%) but otherwise looks just fine. As I prefer an actual crouch button (insert left control button here) that's been scrapped. Everything is universally interacted with using the E key, but I *again* didn't see that as much of an issue after 10 minutes of gameplay.\n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with this game seeing as it is a $20 title (which was surprising - *ahem* Ubisoft *ahem*), and would easily recommend this game to someone looking for a mid-tier SP zombie experience. If you're looking for (and I hesitate to say "polished") but a more modern zombie game a little more competitive with current AAA titles, I'd say pick up Dying Light and come back when you're staved for more zombie killing action.\n\nFor those interested you can find some of my gameplay below: WARNING: NSFW/Lots of language\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?t=55&v=5GR2UI7BGl0","August 19, 2015","true","7.4"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","22","30","0","0"

The game is 20 gigs (of which I do not know why) the graphics have been increased from what I have seen from screens of the original vs this one. The one drawback is they removed the multiplayer, which wasnt really a big deal for me as I only wanted to play the campaign. The game is NOT open world however the game does not stop you from going back to other areas you have already been to for scavenging, I am only a few hours in and the game is really solid and combat feels nice, sometimes a bit harsh especially with the finishers when you go to hit one guy and you swing at another. The game comes with two modes, regular which if you die your character is replaced and you have to retrieve your items, the second is a much harder mode that if you die its game over. Both modes have "chicken" difficulty as an option which eases the games difficulty a bit making it a bit easier for new players. All around this is a fun game and I can recommend you buy it if you like horror, zombies, and/or tension.","August 19, 2015","true","4.4"," 35 of 56 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","35","56","5","0"

I really do. It feels like a good game is there, somewhere, but it's lost in all the fluff. The game's biggest feature is that you play as a new survivor and your old one is zombified with all your old gear, but I've only died once and it was to an environmental feature, not zombies (A doorway on fire looked fine on the other side, so I dashed through it and instantly died).\n\nI wanted to play the game, but dropping the coin on a WiiU for a launch title was not appealing. At least I know the quality of the game now.\n\nPRO:\nSurvivors becoming skilled with weaponry is a good incentive not to die\nZombies hiding around doorways and pretending to be dead does add a decent amount of tension\nScoring headshots feel satisfying\nCertain weapons have enough ammo to carry you for a while (Special mention: Crossbow bolts are retrievable)\n\n\nCON:\nTouted as a survival horror game, the only legitimately scary part of the game is brief and never mentioned again\nVery little is explained, and what is does not deserve mention\nToo many different weapon categories relying on different ammo types - Do we need a pistol and a magnum? In a game about inventory management, there's a lot of useless noise. (Looking at you, planks)\nSecret areas were a bit of a disappointment - Usually it's not about being clever, but finding the right item to come back and unlock them.\nIt's pretty hard to die. Most - If not all - Encounters can be completed just by kiting the zombies backwards in a large circle and clubbing the leader over the head.\nDespite the game early on telling you to do it, there's little point in barricading doors.\nCharacters you play as are very disposable - We're told a name, job, age, and are shown their appearance, but they add nothing to the story. It'd be more interesting if there was at least a blurb of randomized backstory and some skills/deficencies already existing for survival skills.\nGame is linear. You can wander around for supplies, but generally they're scraps you might use up during a scuffle while you're out anyway. There's no zones just for exploring.\nItems in your secure safehouse disappear, and your storage has limited inventory. This might be a gameplay feature, but it's just a weird decision.\n\nIt's just so close to being good. It needs to offer a more open world experience - If you had to find food and water supplies for other survivors, or if there wasn't always just one route to every step in the story, it would have been a much richer experience. Instead, it's a straightforward shooter with an emphasis on melee. Get it on sale if you must, but there's no meat here and no replayability.","August 24, 2015","false","10.6"," 43 of 71 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","43","71","0","0"

They give zombies the respect they're due, not just some cannon fodder for your weapon with so much ammunition it doesn't even matter you have an ammo counter.\n\nPeople are reporting crashes everywhere, but i've only gotten 2, one when reloading a Mounted Turret (The game's camera  goes into third person to show you doing it, but it went like 50 meters off to look at some random container at the edge of the game's level, crashing a few seconds later), though i've tried reloading it again the next time and while i had the same camera error, it didn't happen again. Another one was when it finished showing the loading screen, the next level wouldn't load and i had to quit.\n\nSpeaking of loading screens, their length was one of the complaints the game had when it originally came out (For WiiU in 2012), but here each one of them lasted 10 to 15 seconds for me (You can skip the loading cutscene once it's finished loading).\n\nI've seen reviews that say that they cannot recover their past selves' backpacks, which can have mission critical items in them, making the game impossible to continue. Oh right, i forgot! When you die in this game, unless you're playing the Hardcore mode, you take on the shoes of a new survivor, who loses everything but his starting equipment, and has to kill his previous avatar, now zombified. I haven't died once, miraculously, so that problem didn't happen to me, just the 2 crashes and i finished the game alright.\n\nWhile i personally found this game really fun for how long it lasted (10 hours i believe), it comes down to personal taste. You have to take the game slowly, you definitely shouldn't rush this or you'll die constantly. EDIT 17/11/2015: I've had a few advantages since i watched a playthrough months after the WiiU version released back in fall of 2012, not fresh in my memory. The game pulls a few cheap punches to try to get you to die, which i avoided because of it. Still, i did not rush.\n\nWait for fixes to the possible game-breaking bugs together with a sale (The hub's community manager says they're working on the problems), i mean, i'm waiting myself in order to play the Hardcore mode. I think it is totally worth it if you're a fan of Survival HORROR. Don't expect any complex puzzles though.\n\nOh, and, yes, it requires Uplay.\n\nUPDATE: 17/11/2015: The game received an update on Halloween in time for its first sale. I had decided to try the Hardcore Mode once it was updated. I've had one crash just while walking around since then.\n\nYou can minimize the game now and it will come back after a few seconds of pressing it's icon, before the update it wouldn't come back most of the times i did it. The turret camera bug is not fixed (Though i haven't crashed while doing it so that's something), together with a certain container on a pier that just closes the second i try to loot it. This one had been reported 5 days after the game's release, it hasn't been fixed as well.\n\nI don't think the 46 hours of Gameplay on my account are true. I've played the Normal Mode once without dying, which took 12 hours, two failed Hardcore attempts which took 3 hours (Over due to a deliberate thing i did, which turned out not being true and killing me)  and 7 hours i think, then the one that succeeded was 8 hours long. I did leave it on a few times but god, double the duration?\n\nHere's proof, sorry, i'm proud of it (No spoilers, i swear): http://imgur.com/73sibWB","September 17, 2015","true","46.8"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/339230/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","Zombi is a survival horror game that puts the player in the shoes of a survivor during a cursed blight that is plaguing the streets of London. Apparently, a 16th century magician, John Dee, had predicted this “blight” but he was considered a heretic for believing such nonsense. Fast forward to present times, the world is in chaos and probably John Dee is rolling in his grave saying “I told you so.” Now, with no means of developing a cure, some people turn to the lost writings of John Dee as their only salvation. They believe that the only way to stop this disease is to locate the writings of John Dee and produce the “panacea” that is described in his manuscripts. Guess what? It’s our job as the main character to find these writings and at same time, ensure that we survive long enough to see the next day.\n\nIn terms of the port, it’s decent enough, with hardly any drops in framerate. The graphics options are bare which is disheartening but there’s nothing I can do about it.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=504155396\n\nIn my 10+ hours worth of gameplay, I only crashed 3 times at a certain part, which I believe is a game breaking bug. I’ve read in the forums that some people are crashing at the intro scene and that is a rather unfortunate.\n\nSee here:  Nursery Crash\n\nI have no complaints with the graphics because the game is quite pleasant to look at. I’m not really playing it for the graphics so I can’t complain. There is also that pesky Uplay DRM so if you don’t want to deal with Uplay, do not buy the game.\n\nTo tell you the truth, Zombi offers nothing new to the table, in terms of a survival horror zombie game. You kill zombies, loot, scour for supplies, and kill some more zombies. You know, the usually Friday night. The several locations we visit in Zombi tend to be small but there are hidden nooks and crannies to be explored and shortcuts to open (God, I love shortcuts). Our pad, a multipurpose scanner that can hack doors, check for hostiles and useful items, and reveal hidden messages, is our best friend and I found myself using it more when laziness kicked it (I don’t want to go to a locker, only to find that it’s empty. You crazy.)\n\nCrafting isn’t available. However, there is a way to upgrade your weapons with parts found in the world. There are four types of upgrades: firing speed, capacity, spread and firepower. From what I can tell, once a certain upgrade has been installed in a weapon; a second upgrade of the same type cannot be placed in the weapon again. For example, let’s say you placed a firepower upgrade into a shotgun. You cannot modify it again to strengthen the shotgun’s firepower. So once a weapon has all the necessary upgrades it can hold, that’s it. Your brand new shiny weapon is fully upgraded. It’s simple and there is no way of upgrading a weapon further unless you find a stronger version of the weapon.\n\nThe weapon diversity is pretty good, ranging from your average pistol, to the more practical shotgun. Additionally, your skill in using a specific type of weapon increases the more you use it. This allows for faster reload, lower recoil, and better stability when aiming (from what I can tell).\n\nMy favorite so far is the crossbow. It’s silent and there is a 100% chance of recovering the bolt from the zombie, if you manage to hit the enemy, of course. To my surprise, the game doesn’t flood you with ammo or curatives as I thought it would. Granted, I am playing on Survival Mode (perma-death) so maybe that changes how much items spawn in the world. With me, I have to make each shot count, or else, it’ll be awhile till I find another ammo cache.\n\nThat’s where our melee weapons come in. We have a starter Cricket Bat that makes me appreciate the sport in ways I never thought I would. There are other melee weapons but why use them when you can Cricket…ya know? Common sense, people! Besides, there is no way of dropping or storing the starter weapons (I tried) so they waste two valuable slots in your already skimpy backpack space so might as well use them. Speaking of backpack space, they can be increase by finding upgrades for your backpack…yay! Gotta get all them pockets for your dru—food. I mean food.\n\nThere are different kinds of zombies friends we can meet in our arduous journey. There are spitting ones, exploding ones, always want to be the center of attention ones, and just plain ‘ole regular cute ones that enjoy a good buffet of humans. Their A.I. are nothing special and can be exploited by finding their “how much can I back up until the zombie turns away, forgetting they were ever pursuing a juicy human” limit. It’s a mouthful but I am working on an alternative title. Unless it’s a horde mode section, you can do this to almost all zombie mobs. I do find the brain eating fellows hilarious sometimes because they will do whatever it takes to get to you if you’re in their aggro range. You see one on the floor above? Don’t worry; they’ll drop down to you so you can beat them to death...again?\n\nI do find the game easy at times, even in Survival Mode. Despite that, I did get cocky and ended up dying at the hands of the exploding monster because I had the audacity to whack it on the head with a bat. Such a diva. From that point, I was a bit cautious and I actually began taking Zombi seriously, which surprised me because I tend to fool around too much in games.\n\nI really do enjoy it, especially survival mode. Normal mode is an alternative if you don’t fancy perma-death situations and if you die in normal mode, the birth of a new survivor occurs and you have some time to gather your belongings from your dead character. The tension does increase in Survival Mode because you don’t want your person to meet a terrible fate, right?\n\nAll in all, $20 is a fair price for this game. It’s fun and engaging enough to hold your attention. Buy it if you can.\n\nBy the way, here’s me fooling around in Zombi…\nZombi Video","August 21, 2015","true","12.6"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","25","39","8","2"

I was very happy to see this game make it over to the PC, even if Ubisoft did completely mess up the port.\n\nPros\n\nGenuine jump scares\nGreat locations to explore\nAmazing Atmosphere\nIt's set in London which is a nice change of pace\nGreat voice acting\nIt's a scary game, I found myself creeping around every corner incase there was a zombie hiding around it.\nSome very tense moments\nThe Prepper Pad was fun tool to use.\n"Special" zombies aren't overused.\n\nCons\n\nUplay\nItem management is awful, you can't move any of your items around in your backpack (unless you're using a mouse and keyboard)\nThe cricket Bat, the pistol and the flashlight is permanently stuck in your backpack even though the flashlight is        clearly strapped to your chest.\nMost items felt a little bit pointless, especially the food items since I was always overflowing with medpacks.\nStory is very weak\nForgettable characters (Apart from "The Prepper")\nThe main character is a random mute survivor, who has no input to the "story" whatsoever. Once you're dead, you're dead, a new survivor is spawned and you have to get your loot off your old survivors body, who could be a zombie at this point. It's a good idea in practise, but I cared more about my loot than I did for anyone I played.\nCombat is very boring.\nGuns felt weak.\nZombies would ragdoll through my legs, sometimes disappearing altogether.\nZombies would clip through the floors, walls and ceilings.\nThe crafting system is pretty much "upgrade your gun once", it felt very unnecessary and more of an afterthought.\n\nNitpicking\n\nNo Crouch button\nNo jump button\n\nNot real reasons not to get the game or lower the score, but something that bothered me a little.\n\nAfterthought\n\nI know I've complained a lot in this review but I did have a good time playing it, the atmosphere was great, the game was genuinely scary and the sound design was top notch. But this game has so many problems, poor item management, clipping zombies, a weak story, forgettable characters and survivors who you just don't care about. I would recommend the game, but not at £15. If you ever see this game on sale then I would pick it up, but don't go in expect anything deep because you won't find it here, it also helps to go in remembering that Ubisoft aren't known for great PC ports, as some of you are well aware by the nightmare that was Assassins Creed Unity. I do hope they try again with a sequel, this game has the potential to be so much more.\n\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nBelow Average game, but it had it's moments.\n\n2/5","September 4, 2015","false","10.5"," 48 of 85 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","48","85","9","3"

I had to launch in a different setting to get it to work but easy fix. Overall, I love the game BECAUSE of the permadeath. I enjoy submerging myself into the realism of surviving as a character. However, the designers decided to put in mechanics that cheaply rob the player survival. I went through 20 hours of game play only to be blown up by an exploding zombie in tight quarters. It is like the designers decided that a cheap scare was justification in cheating the player of hard working game play. I managed to avoid future deaths only to be confronted in a deathcage scenario towards the end where you're guaranteed to lose a beloved character over and over again no matter what choices you make. The last part of the game is so frustrating because it negates the beauty of the entire permadeath design.\n\nPros-\n-Controls are easy to use (Used 360 wired controller)\n-Simple Chivary type melee combat with good gun variety\n-You can survive for a long time with smart game play\n-Permadeath forces you to take your time\n-Sound design\n\nCons-\n-Sometimes it is hard to know what to do next\n-Limited inventory\n-Certain items cannot be dropped\n-Some people will complain about graphics\n-If you care about keeping a single character alive all the way through you might be upset at cheap death scenarios\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a good zombie scavenge survive experience on rails this is the game for you. Just know going in that there's nothing you can do about making all the way through with just one character. The school was one of the creepiest levels I've ever played, Barely survived. Play this level in the dark and at night.","November 6, 2015","true","32.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","0"

Unfortunately it takes a random number between 1 and 9 to kill them. Five one hit zombies are easier to deal with than two nine hit zombies. Sadly there's no way to tell how many shots it takes to kill so prepare to get stomped randomly.\n\nSome zombies wear oxygen tanks on their back. If you bash them on the head they explode and kill you instantly. There's no way to see them in a cloud of five zombies chasing you so enjoy dying randomly while Ubisoft cackles slowly at you.\n\nThe CGI rigging in the conversations is some of the worst I have ever seen in my entire life. It's hilariously bad.\n\nWeapon and ammo management in this game is below abysmal, some of the worst I've ever seen.

ZombiU was the main reason for me buying a WiiU, It was worth it to me. Super Stoked that it came to steam. For the Wii U owners, it's the same game and pretty much same graphics. But, With a nice pricetag of $19 it's worth the buy, and for those who haven't played it, this is well worth the asking price. Now for the ugly things I would have liked to been diffrent. Theres no graphic settings at all, the game had way to many tap something actions because of the WiiU Pad, and they left them all in there, just mash a button now, Wish they would have cut at-least a few out, Also would have been nice if my Uplay acheviemnts, from the WiiU version, would have moved over. And last of the bad but not that bad things is no Multiplayer. The WiiU multiplayer games were really gory fun with friends. We spent countless hours spawning the zombies against each other and seeing who could last longer. Hopefully the game sells well and maybe we can see some much needed DLC missions and maybe a few more items.

This is an issue that will hopefully be fixed. My biggest CONS for the game thus far, are the INCREDIBLY WEAK weapon sound, it feels even less powerful than a Nerf gun; and the EXTREMELY limited graphical settings: you may ONLY change your resolution. This is unthinkable for a PC game, even for a port.\n\nEDIT: Having played the game for 14 hours, I can now expand a bit more on my review. I noticed that the CTD were actually not random at all, they happened when I did a particular action ( such as trying to remove the bar blocking the door in the supermarket quest ) so it is not that much of a nuisance anymore. While I enjoy the game and recommended it, I COMPLETELY have to agree that ZOMBI is not the definitive edition, ZombiU is. So many little details are making the ZOMBI experience much less immersive ( the lack of the WiiU gamepad for example reduces the tension associated by having to be on your toes at all time ) and the lack of infected survivors associated with the removed multiplayer.","August 19, 2015","true","14.3"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","5"

Long story short the man behind the camera teaches you how to survive and gives you a goal.\n\nNow, let us get into the the juicy bits?\n\nZOMBI is a survival horror game that takes place in London, Which has now fallen into the greasy hands of the shamblers. You're given an objective and a few pieces of gear, and the rest you have to find yourself, Gear-wise that is. ZOMBI pulls the horror off very well; it's terrifying, dark, and merciless. By Merciless I mean it, when you die you lose that character and the gear you owned. Congratulations he is one of the shamblers now!  Oh did I mention once bitten you're dead? Now that you're dead you take over someone totally random. You obviously have the same goal, but... You can still recover your gear if you go back to hunt down your previous character and show him what's what!\n\nNow all that aside let's talk about the array of weapons and gear you can find in London. The amount of weapons this game delivers is very decent, it comes with: Shotguns, assault rifles, Handguns, even a crossbow the most silent weapon besides the silenced handgun.\n\nOh yes the cons. Well I haven't really encountered cons that should be mentioned in this review that will detour you to the other direction.\n\nStory. Well there is not much to it. You're basically trying to get out of London and along the way there are some interesting things to the story that have nothing to do with escaping London.

Now we know, it's because a great WiiU zombie-survival game, makes a mediocre PC zombie-survival game. Make no mistake, this is a REALLY great zombie game; however, having core mechanics designed around the WiiU's bizarre controls/interface makes it impossible to port very well to other platforms.\n\nOn the positive side, it has a somewhat fresh take on zombie survial gameplay. The London setting manages to be both fun and dreary in equal measure. Also, the stakes are raised by giving players only one life. When you die in the game, that character dies and you resume from the perspective of a different character.\n\nUnfortunately, this PC port is not the way to experience it. A lot of the gameplay was conceptualized around the WiiU's controller, which features a second screen and touch interface for that screen. When playing this PC port there are a lot of arbitrary game concepts left over that are either infuriating or downright broken.\n\nIf you're looking for a good, PC + FPS + single-player + zombie-survival game then checkout Dying Light. If you are some kind of Zombie game aficionado, then try to find a WiiU to borrow to play this game.","April 10","false","1.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Well after playing it for a bit I learned a few things about the game, first, the framerate drops at random times, often when you're fighting off zombies or just walking around. And the lack of graphics settings is something that needs to be adressed, all you can really do is adjust your resolution. But if you can manage to get past those issues, the mechanics are good, if you want to look in your bag your character sets it on the ground and you're left in a vulnerable position for a short while so you'll have to think carefully, the AI is'nt great, but it's bearable. So, if you want a half-decent zombie survival experience with a pretty cool death mechanic, you could pick this up.","August 20, 2015","false","1.0"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","24","43","3","0"

The game was far too frightening for me to ever finish on the U because of the whole “lose all your ♥♥♥♥” mechanic, but the easier controls made it a breeze this time around. I would have to say that I really enjoyed my time with Zombi and I am sort of sad to be done with it. Though it may have frustrated me from time to time with its bugs and odd design choices, it delivers exactly what I was needing from a zombie game. Visceral combat, an exciting and sometimes heart pounding atmosphere, and last but certainly not least the idea that death actually matters, which aside from games like dark souls is an aspect that is sorely missing from most games. I will sit here hoping that this port does well enough to get the idea out of the paper shredder because if they ever announced a sequel I would most definitely buy it.","August 21, 2015","true","14.9"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","23","42","0","0"

This game does offer a fun gameplay and has a unique factor, you do not play as a single character, you play as random survivors that have no link to one another other than the fact that they are alive and find themselves in a Zombie apocalypse set in London, England.  Once you die, your character becomes a zombie which you may return to and slaughter for your gear later.  The ability to go back and kill your past self is awesome!  I do wish there was more to the story and characters as they are forgetable, but the game is suprisingly fun to play dispite the last generation graphics and linear styled gameplay. I am annoyed at the control scheme in that if you have a controller plugged in, even if you are uising a keyboad and mouse, all of the in game instructions will default to the controller scheme.\n\nThe Good:Suprisingly fun gameplay\nGreat atmosphere\nUnique character system\nThe price (Only $20)\n\nThe Bad:Shallow story\nWii-U port (not much improved for PC including controls)\nGraphics are dated (not much of an improvement from Wii-U)\nNo graphics options (unless you count resolution)\nCombat system is average at best\nLinear gameplay\nControl scheme is faulty if you have a controller pluged in but use a keyboad/mouse\n\nConclusion:Zombi is a fun game and well worth $20 for the enjoyment of killing zombies, including your past self.  Just don't expect a well polished AAA $60 game for $20.  This is a $20 Wii-u port that does next to nothing to improve upon itself.","September 8, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","1"

My personal hightlights:\n-Classic survival horror elements: The game utilizes resource starvation und (mostly) manual save points to create tension for the player à la Resident Evil, except here even save points aren't completely save since you only get one shot to retrieve your gear after you die. Depending on how well you utilize the environment, molotovs and mines, you can save a lot of ammo.\n-Environments: The UK setting was realized nicely.\n-Voice acting: Richard Hawley does a superb job as 'the prepper'.\n-Melee combat: When you attack with melee weapons, it does feel like someone desparetely trying to survive, partly because of the increasingly hysterical grunts when the player character repeatedly hits something, partly because zombie movements and whether your hits connect can be unpredictable.\n\nAbout the technical problems: I have played through the game with the 1.1 patch and didn't experience any performance problems or bugs (except getting stuck while climbing a box once which was remedied with a reload).","February 23","true","17.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dan_958/recommended/339230/","dan_958","Dan958","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dan_958/","1214 products in account","ZombiU is arguably one of the best launch titles for the Wii U. A gritty survival game that managed to make great use out of the extra screen in the form of the Wii U gamepad. Unfortunately, the game sales was considered a flop to Ubisoft, and as such, I don’t think we will see a sequel anytime soon- if at all. ZombiU was one of the few games that made me actually wish that I had a Wii U, and I’m glad that this port was made so that I can play it without purchasing a brand new console.\n\nNow titled Zombi on PC, Xbox One and Ps4- players will find themselves deep inside the heart of London after a zombie outbreak. With your base set up in the London Underground, you must traverse the maze of tunnels to reach other locations for supplies and other mission based challenges. You are able to find a variety of weapons and ammo, such as; Shotguns, Assault Rifles, SMG’s and so on- this is all fine and dandy, but you will end up using your trusty cricket bat more often than not, Shaun of the Dead style. The cricket bat combat can become repetitive for some players.\n\nCombat is not fast paced, if you are going into Zombi expecting a run and gun Left 4 Dead esque game, then Zombi may not be for you. The game has instead gone for a slow style combat- before you can swing your cricket bat, you must first raise the bat using right click to which you can then swing at your foe. Weapons also take a while to reload, so you can definitely feel the tension as a small group of zombies start getting too close as you scramble to find a weapon that is loaded. As mentioned previously, people may find the cricket bat combat a little repetitive, and it is- you do the same swing and when you make contact with a zombie the same animations will appear- at first the skull will crack open and you continue hitting it until it stops moving. There doesn’t really seem to be much of a variety in the zombie combat, sometimes you can take one down with just one strike of your bat, sometimes it takes a few more strikes. I do not find the combat repetitive,  yes I am doing the same thing again and again, but the tense and adrenaline filled moments that I get really do mask up the repetitive motions- and the combat is definitely one of the main things about this game that makes it as tense as it is.\n\nIf you find yourself surrounded by zombies, there are a few things you can do. First, throw some flares to distract the zombies, and then throw a grenade to kill the zombies. Secondly, run-  run away as fast as you can to a safer location. If all these fail you then I’m afraid you may be dead, and this is where an interesting game mechanic comes into play.  If at any point you die in the game, that’s it for you, but that doesn’t mean that the game is over and you need to restart from a checkpoint- instead, that character is dead and you get to respawn as a new character. Any items that your previous character had on their person is now gone, unless you get them back. The character you previously were is now a zombie in the world, you can either find and kill them to get your items back, or just leave them. I found this game mechanic to be very interesting, and it definitely made me ponder on whether it not my previous character had enough items of value on them that it was worth tracking them down and killing them.\n\nOne of the concerns I had going into Zombi, and concerns that many people had, was how well does the game hold up without the use of the Wii U gamepad. Surprisingly, it holds up pretty darn well. On the gamepad you open barricades by tapping on the screen, on the PC version you just need to mash the Use key. Inventory management is very similar- On the Wii U they showed how all inventory management is done on the gamepads screen as the main game still plays around you. This is the same on the PC version, press Tab to open up your inventory, but be careful as a zombie may get you while you are busy searching through your bag. The Wii U gamepad was also used as the games scanner, a device where you can scan objects to see if there are any items in them, or to other tasks such as hacking.  On the Wii U, you had to hold up the  gamepad to and pretend it was a scanner – so at least on the PC version I feel like less of a fool when I have to use the scanner.\n\nA problem that some of you may have, is that the PC version does use Uplay. I have no problem with this, I would much rather it was just Steam, but it caused me no problems. However, I do understand that many people do have problems with Uplay, so I am just pointing out now that Zombi does use Uplay. Most of the problems will come when you are trying to verify your game code so that Ubisoft knows you have legally purchased it, but if Uplays services are down, you are not going to get very far.\n\nHow is the port? Not bad. It maintains a solid framerate throughout the game, but I wouldn’t have expected any better from this game, because there is’t much on show to really lower the framerate. The texture quality isn’t great and everything looks a little rough around the edges- you can easily tell that this was originally a Wii U game, no doubt about it. There seems to be a bug that occurs when you have a controller plugged in but are using a mouse and keyboard, the button prompts will always display as if you were playing on a controller -so if you are not using a controller, make sure you unplug it from your computer.\n\nZombi is a well done horror game. It has made me jump on a number of occasions from scripted jump sequences and from the atmosphere the game provides.  If you have a Wii U, it may be better to purchase ZombiU instead, but if you do not own that console then you are not missing out on much when you play this version. Despite the game being a little rough around the edges, it is still an experience that I thoroughly enjoyed and I would recommend that everyone gives it a try.","September 5, 2015","true","4.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I think it was closer to ~6.5 hours because of following reasons:\n\n1. I ran into a permacrash after getting killed for the first time: 1 hours lost and and 1 hour to debug until restarting\n\n2. Crash in the nursery (but recovering from this only took around ~10 minutes)\n\n3. Crash in the ending section tunnels: threw a grenade, it just bounced to the floor, game crashed. Only maybe 5 minutes there because LUCKILY I had a save in near the turret section: going back to that area after dying was not only confusing but really hard.\n\nOverall, like I said, I really, really liked the game. Missed couple of C4's (I think) so I couldn't blow some stuff up in Buckingham Palace and I didn't care to find all the 4 paintings: other than that I found most everything. At some parts the game was a bit vague in which direction to go the gasoline station part but otherwise it really scratched that Dark Souls itch. One big minus for the repeated environments: why were there like 10 of those "ladder, hole in the wall, metro station" parts?\n\nThe game was really, REALLY tense. Like some say the weapons, especially the guns lack oooopmh, but otherwise the game has totally awesome sound design. The graphics are okay, but the cutscene videos have been packed with the ♥♥♥♥♥iest Bink compression (I guess) they could find. I like the gameplay too, I can see why not everyone would be a fan of that. I only died 3 times, 2 of those at the exact same spot to an exploding zombie which was weird (I think when going back to that little island area to reach some place, maybe that gasoline station?).\n\nThe missions were fun, the pacing was great except for the ending sequence. It was just... too long and too tense, with zombies coming from every side. It got me sweating though, so I guess that was good. I also didn't like the repeated paranormal zombie x 2 in the last palace section.. Some of the enemies like all of the special enemies were kinda annoying in retrospect which was kinda weird game design: I counted 3-4 of those lightning zombies and 2 of the paranormal ones. So they could have been just boss fights.. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ those explosive enemies. The arena section was kinda weird too. It had this Walking Deadish plottwist that was solved in very Walking Deadish way: by doing pretty much nothing.. Also the ending was really abrupt: shoot the most quiet turret in the world, run to a door, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quality movie plays which I didn't really understand. Prepper picked up another guy? Okay, but wasn't place firebombed just now? At least the epilogue was surprising.\n\n\nFor the sequel I would want: less run and gun sections, less hectic sections, more creepy Zombi'ing and less paranormal zombies.. Basically, just more of Vanilla Zombi. If you like horror games or Dark Souls or just permadeath games in general, Zombi is a must buy","August 30, 2015","true","9.1"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I had only 4 issues with this game, two of them small and the other two intertwined.\n\nProblem 1: Melee Combat, this can get very repetetive even with the new melee weapons you find throughout the game.\n\nProblem 2: You can't use the scopes on scope weapons or aim down the sights, I find this to be a big issue as with some weapons you could be hitting your target at a range easily with aiming using the sights is not possible in this game, especially with scopes. Sure this problem is remedied slightly having upgrades to your weapons to reduce spread, but it only remedies it to an extent.\n\nProblem 3: Saving the game, i'm used to going through doors and the game saving for me or "fast travelling" or going into the menu and pressing save game, in ZOMBI this is not possible as you have to sleep in a designated save bed/sleeping bag.\n\nProblem 4: Crashing, so far I have only crashed once in ZOMBI and this was a hug pain in the ♥♥♥ because I was just about to complete a mission, getting the anti-biotics from the nursery and as those of you who completed that mission know how easy it is to ♥♥♥♥ your pants in the process. So it had to load me back before I even started the mission, this issue ties in with saving as the save system is spot specific.\n\nWell thats what I think about this game so far and I thouroughly enjoy the game aside from these problems and I reccomend this game to those who like games in the horror/zombie genre.","August 30, 2015","true","8.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sorvall/recommended/339230/","sorvall","Sorvall Sergal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sorvall/","515 products in account","I have to admit that I used to love zombies but the rather over saturation of media concerning the undead in recent years has somewhat slowly put me off more so when it comes to video games where we've seen loads of dull zombie related times crop up in recent past with only a few titles being good (left 4 dead 1+2, and Tale Tale's The walking Dead being the exceptions). So the revival of Ubisoft's long since dead (pun not intended, and yes Zombi was a game that Ubi pushed out in 1986/1990 not just on the Wii U) Zombi franchise has had me interested. Why? Because people have said that it's actually very well done, and actually favours traditional survival horror over undead skull bashing.\n\nA few hours in and I do believe them here.\n\nEssentually Zombi is a first person survial horror game, that pit's you as a random surviver trying to stay alive in a fairly corny "tourist trap" version of London. You're aided by a man calling himself "the Prepper" who comes over as one of those tin foil hat wearing survivalists (only in this case he was right about the end of the world).\n\nHowever it hits all the right notes for fast paced survival horror. Ammo is far from plentiful, combat sluggish and inaccurate, and running, sneaking, and avoiding is sometimes and quite often better than a straight up fight. You can also barricade doors or have to remove barricades in order to escape.\n\nOne of the big features is death in this game, oh and you will die, you will die a lot in fact. Death in this game isn't a return to the last saved checkpoint but a "permadeath" of your last character. He or she is gone for good, but will leave their inventory in the game for your next character to collect. Sometimes your last character may even "reanimate" and will require you to kill them again before you can get your stuff back. Die BEFORE you get that bag back and it's gone for good! Even on the easiest setting of the game. Characters also can level up too as you go, but this is also reset on each death adding to the sting, and more so if you kept them alive for quite some time. This is a line of mechanics I normally expect to see in indie games, but here they are on a full release from a big brand company.\n\nThe only real pain with this feature is that while you do have a health bar, death in this game can be sudden and instant (more so when the annoying exploding guys start to show up). It's still fun but the slightly unforgiving nature might be a bit too much for some.\n\nSome of the more novel features concerning the WiiU's controller have now been ported over as onscreen overlays. Nothing seems to have changed though or removed beyond the novelty. As far as I can tell the menus are still in real time to keep in sprit of the WiiU version.\n\nHowever if I have to take a pot shot at the game then it's over the typical Ubi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Yes there is UPlay but given some of the advantages for multiformat gamers, that hardly bothers me. However if you are the strict PC gamer then the addition of having to use the service right next to steam feels like a pointless exercise. Just take it or leave it TBH.\n\nI can't however say the same for the quality of the PC port which is grotty to say the least. There is a lack of detail options, and the visuals are somewhat low-fi and muddy to say the least. Worst is the current state of stability, this game crashes a lot, and I mean a lot. Crashes that can easily wipe 10 to 15 mins of game time away, can and will ruin your day.\n\nOverall Zombi even with the grotty port issues on the PC is a good game, it's the sort of old school survival horror that we don't see much of now in 2015. In short it's worth a look in.","August 25, 2015","true","10.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Levels are nicely interlinked, if linear, but more importantly, the death system helps you get a sense of affinity for your character, and makes you want to survive and plan rather than quickload. Death results in you spawning as another randomly generated survivor, with a need to hunt down your previously zombified self if you want to reclaim your backpack. The game puts some effort into giving each new survivor a unique character, from their own outfit and gender down to an ID card with their age, occupation, and stat tracking of how long they've survived and their individual score. As a result, you tend to get the same involvement as with a squad member in X-COM - after you've struggled through a few hours as the same character, you really want to see how long you can last.\n\nIt's important the game generates tension this way, since combat itself is fairly simplistic and where the similarities with Dark Souls end. For a large part of the game the default cricket bat will serve you well, to the extent that guns are largely unneccessary. This has a knock-on effect of you saving ammo to the point it's scarcity isn't an issue in the later stages of the game, which is a shame. This isn't a hard game, but the desire to stay alive rather than save-zerg helps maintain suspense, and it is certainly possible to meet a swift end if you make a mistake.\n\nVisually, the game has some interesting locations, and whilst it's not going to be picking up any awards for next-gen graphics or push a high-end PC to its limits, it looks suitably atmospheric. I've seen some reports of crashing, but on my vanilla rig (i7/9700) I've yet to experience one. The audio gets the job done, with the usual zombie moans alerting the player and some good player voice acting reflecting their terror after caving in a zombie's head.\n\nIn terms of the negatives, a uPlay account being needed is an obvious one, but not too much of a pain to set up if you don't have one already. The plot is rather scattered and implausible, with your character unswervingly doing what they're told even if it flies in the face of common sense or survival instinct, and not helped by the questions raised by the player character changing but the NPCs treating them as the same person. Given the alternative of a single character with a quicksave/load function, though, it's a worthwhile tradeoff. Multiplayer was dropped for the port, but it wasn't that great in the first place, and there are many better multiplayer zombie games out there.\n\nThis is basically a solid 20 hours or so of atmospheric, single-player FPS gaming. Not a AAA title, but a worthwhile experience at the price tag.","August 20, 2015","true","12.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

On the Wii U.......\nIn my mind, this title could have sold millions of Wii U consoles as it was available upon launch of the console and took beautiful advantage of the gamepad functionality.  I still play the game from time to time and have pumped in hundreds of hours of gameplay on that version.  Even beat survival mode twice, which is frustratingly difficult.\n\nAs for this PC version after my first quick playthrough:\n\nThe Good:\nThe HD and increased frame rate looks and plays great.  So thats a plus.\nThe game itself is a lot of fun for single-op, survival strategy.\nControls on an Xbox controller are intuitive enough that with a little practice its easy to pick up and go\n\nThe Bad:\nOverall Wii U kinda sucks, BUT this game was practically designed FOR that gamepad.\nUsing the Prep pad was a unique immersive experience with this title that is missing in this incarnation\nThere is literally no new content to speak of, cept for 2 different melee weapons\nNo online connection for leaving behind messages, warnings, etc. (similar to Dark Souls but via graphiti)\nNo online survivors who were killed pop up in your game to be looted.... This was a serious boon sometimes\nSo in actuality, content has been removed from this version, which I hope will be fixed with an update\n\nOverall Impression:\nI will still recommend this game, as it's pretty damn awesome.  However, it IS NOT a new release, and is more or less un-altered from the Wii U version so there is no new content or "scarier than ever" elements.....\nSo it looks pretty cool, but is still a game that is ultimately several years old.\nIf you enjoy a single-player Zombie survival game that values patience and itelligence vs. run-and-gun.  This is a really cool experience.\nIf you haven't played the Wii U version, then you don't know what your missing, so this version is going to be pretty awesome to play.\nIf you did play or still play the Wii U version, a lot of the missing elements and game functionality being gone is going to be missed, or at least severely noticed.\nI'm going to play this version enough to grab some achievements and enjoy it to the end without dying once, but I still have my copy in the Wii U to fall back on when I want the full-immersion experience\n","August 21, 2015","true","2.3"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","0"

I initially wanted the game, and even considered buying a WiiU just to play it. However, after the reviews came out, I decided against it. Apparently it's one of the worst zombie games ever made; and that's saying a lot considering COD: Zombies is now it's own separate game. I was turned off from it, but I couldn't help but want to come back to it. The premise is perfect: You're a survivor of the zombie apocalypse, who must try to survive in destroyed London. When you die, you don't respawn, and you don't just load up another save; you get turned into an infected, and take control of another survivor. You can go and find your shambling corpse to get your stuff back, but chances are if you died, that's not a good idea. I haven't played much of it(only an hour so that I could return it if I didn't like it), but I have to say, I'm really enjoying it, so far! Yeah, sometimes the game will freeze up. That's annoying, but other than that, I have to say I'm really loving it! And I don't mind having to install UPlay in order to play it, though others might. I read through the reviews of it before buying it, of course, and many seemed to recommend it; despite being a bit sour about it. I wish Steam didn't have a 2 hour playtime limit for their return policy, or I'd be much more willing to just dive right in. Now I'm gonna have to limit my time as much as I can so that in case I don't like it, I can get my $20 back. I've got 52 minutes left before I pass the point of no return. Let's hope I don't wanna go back!\n\nAnd of course, you gotta love that epic twist on "London Bridge"!","August 19, 2015","true","5.2"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

After reading so many negative reviews... I must admit, THIS GAME IS REALLY GREAT!\n\nI'm only into the game for about 5 hours and I already like it very much, the atmosphere is dense and feels real. I play with keyboard/mouse and it works out well. There are all these reviews complaining about a bad port... well the original may be better in some aspects... but I'm happy to have this PC Port, and as said before I like it much. This is one of the games best played at night with the lights off. The sound, and sceneries are pretty well made... well the textures could be a bit better, but I have seen much much worse than this, and it wont disturb the fun of playing this.  I already killed two characters as fighting zombies in this game is much more "realistic" than in most of the zombie slashers... but it's fun, you have to be sneaky and smart to survive, no rambo action at least most of the time, but then there's guns, mines, and even big machine guns... so also something for the slasher fans, but really not like L4D. You are on single-player mission in this game and have to keep your charakter alive. You get a new charakter once you die, but you carry on with the mission at that very same point as before, u keep your mission progress, but the new charakter has to loot in order get enough good equipment again.\n\npro:\n- dense atmosphere\n- not only a shooter, also kind of strategy\n- great and realistic sceneries well made with lots of details\n- smooth graphics engine\n- explore and loot to survive, have to be sneaky and smart\n- works fine w Keyboard / Mouse\n- the devs made a very realistic ego-perspective... wow!\n\ncon:\n- graphics look sometimes dull / foggy, but this may be intended... adds to the atmosphere,\nor it's just due to the port...\n- no multiplayer-mode, as the original is\n\nTip: be sure to adjust the brightess right as the settings of the game recommends, for best game experience.\n\nI bought it on the halloween-sale, and it's worth every cent I payed.

The number one answer for many of the issues were to "start your game over form the beginning". One bug/glitch in particular takes place just as you are about to finish the game, you are running with X item to get to Y place but a Z just so happens to kill you, which results in the item you need to retrieve from you former character to magically vanish and every access point you need to take you reach end game suddenly seals, locks, becomes unavailable... aaannnnddd makes it to where you can not... i repeat can not finish the game... so... all that aside if you don't that particular glitch or any of the others I'd say this game is worth about $9.99 usd...","September 8, 2015","true","21.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

A good survival horror for 20 bucks? Hell yea!\n\nThe graphics and atmosphere are good, despite the fact there being little to no graphical options, I certainly had nothing to complain whilst in game. The atmostphere is awesome allover. I like the element where you are turned into a zombie when you die, and respawn as a new survivor with the possibility to get the gear back from the last survivor you played.\n\nYou can hack boxes so that the cameras connected to it in a certain area create an up-to date map for you. That together with the possibility of barracading doors and planting mines creates interesting options to master a certain area, which can be useful (and imo added to the gameplay) when forced to flee from a horde of brain-thirsty zombies.\n\nAfter 2.5 hrs of play however the game started to be less and less entertaining for me. The reason for this started out with some minor frustrations within item interaction. Then I got the feeling that it was the same all the time. Just smashing or shooting zombies with a new weapon that looks almost the same as your previous, and has no new graphical effects. Again a quest where I have to retrieve this from that area. The storyline didn't bring enough for me to keep these quests interesting. And this "Prepper" guy... After 4 hrs of playing I got obsessed with finding him and shooting him through the head. There is no option to turn his voice down and for some reason he can't seem to shut up for atleast 3 mins. Most of the time babbling the same crap about how important it is to survive. And when he was used to develop progress in the storyline, he had already frustrated me to a point where I just put off my headphones.\n\nKeep in mind I played this for only 4 hrs, but here is my conclusion:\nFor a 20 buck game pretty solid, but not the surival horror I expected it to be\n+ Graphics\n+ Atmosphere\n- Promising elements not worked out sufficient (barracading and mining, upgrading weapons)\n- Uninteresting story\n- Most weapons have the same graphical effects, stronger zombies just have a glow\n- Almost no options to adjust graphics/sound (most annoying being "the Prepper" who can't seem to shut up)\n\nUnfortunatly not a 20 buck miracle, but stands decent for it's price.\n\n","August 22, 2015","false","4.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

Sound is good as are the graphics, and the atmosphere created is spot on.\n\nGameplay - linear and managed. If you die (which I did a lot) you respawn back at base and can then work your way back to where you were quite quickly. There's a bit of problem solving but you're spoon fed by a voice in your ear, the Prepper. It's not in the league of Dinocrisis where you really did have to use your brains - but guess with walkthroughs out there on the www this is quite an old fashioned view for me to have anyway.\n\nCombat - simple, unsatisfyingly simple. Dead Island set the standard for combat in my opinion. In Zombi - LMB = shove with weapon, RMB = raise weapon, then LMB again = strike with weapon, Not very effective and there are no other strikes etc to play with.\n\nReason for not recommending the game - none of the above issues would have put me off. What makes me say don't buy this game for PC is that the game is heavily bugged with crash to desk top when your character gets back to the area where they last died. This is frequent and problematic. There is no official fix coming that I know of, and many of the player developed work arounds seen on Steam relate more to wishful thinking than actual fact, and don't seem to work for each and every player.\n\nAdditionally, having asked for a refund on the basis that the game isn't fit for PC release, Steam have declined as I have played 8 hours. Seeing that I have only been affected by the bugs in the last hour of my gameplay this is not a very happy outcome. My advice is - if you're in doubt about whether it will work on your PC, don't buy it, as you may not be able to get a refund.\n\nEDIT: it seems the game devs have now debugged the issues that led to constant crashes - which is good. However, I am still dissatisfied with the Steam response re the request for a refund. Having carried on playing, the game has got boring, mainly becasue of the game play and strategy which is very very linear and micromanaged, plus the introduction of sudden death explodng zombies. There's no real sense of fun or exploration - just follow the route map, swing the bat and occasionally get blown up.\n\nFinally decided to quit and uninstall when I was kidnapped and you are then forced to play a minigame of sorts in an arena to move on and I just cannot be arsed. If you're a sugar fuelled teen with lightining reflexes you'd possibly not mind, but after a  long day at work I don't care for it.\n\nI like the game but the things I don't like about it really hack me off. I think that many players might like the gameplay and the Englishness of it though so not a conclsuive thumbs down, 6/10.","August 25, 2015","false","40.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Couldnt store much loot.\n\nThat out of the way its terrifying, its fun and the zombies feel realistic if thats possible. death is around every corner you need to think and prepare, story is strong to start off but becomes kind of bland by the end since it appears as though they had half a game and decided to relase what the had instead of creating a full blown rpg. Shootings clunky but fun, weapons feel really good especially the shotguns and snipers and the crossbow is amazing to use. stealth is fun but hard since you never know when they see u or not since there is no crouch mechanic.

Sorry.\n\nThe first hurdle is to acquire a uPlay account. Easy enough however you cannot launch the game without one. You also cannot launch the game without steam so, you need two (2) seperate DRM sources to play one game. uPlay also cannot be closed or even placed into a semi sleep state and will constantly demand resources while it loads your uPlay page with randomly generated information while it runs in the background taking up resources. This on top of steam also running.\n\nThe options can be a bit confusing but you can stumble your way through them easily enough, the FOV slider doesnt seem very useful though.\n\nIts a precursor for another more amazing game called Alien Isolation. Same simple crafting system, find recipy upgrade item. Same way to duck into and out of things. However there are massive differences which need to be noted. The first of which is the complete lack of a stealth system or even a crouch ability. In a zombie game? No way to duck or hide or anything? its run and block a door wait for the zeds to file in one at a time kill them and thats it? Yes that it literally it. And you will do this repeatedly over and over and over and over and over. If you are any kind of decent gamer you will find you have little to no need for ammo as the cricket bat is deadly enough with its rng OHK abilities and no need to run around to try and reload, just hold right mouse and wham your way through that horde.\n\nThere are places where you will die, and die needlessly as the game forces you into certain, unavoidable animations. For one, when you enter water that is higher than knee deep, your character will lift up his pack, which btw only has 12 slots, making for lots and lots of return trips to your base to simply store loot in your whopping 14 slot storage case, which you can only find at your base despite there being smaller outposts scattered around areas, but I am getting off track here. Your character will enter these unavoidable animations and will take their sweet time exiting them even in the face of a zombie breathing down your neck, and this has caused me great distress. losing a high level survivor to something so ridiculously unecessary really spoiled the game for me.\n\nAlso, you will not be able to complete hard mode as a female survivor, as you will always start as a male, because the first survivor in the opening cut scenes is male, so yeah, lol ubisoft gg. i guess it was too hard to make the opening survivor cloaked in some way so you wouldnt be able to tell sex, and you could pick sex once you reach the first hideout section, but w/e's not a huge issue for some, just a few steps backwards in a unisex gaming world today.\n\nRandomly, either after entering or exiting an area, dying, sleeping (which is the only way to save and there are zero checkpoints) your inventory will become completely unresponsive forcing you to shut the game down entirely then jump back through the uPlay hoops to get it back running again. Sometimes randomly, certain inv items will becomes locked for reasons, forcing you again to quit the game and restart it to fix the issue. Which means, lol if you are neck deep into a mission, you need to run to the closest shortcut, which can be as close as the very start of a level, forcing you to run all the way back, if that is even possible, which sometimes it isnt, just to save progress so you can fix your inv issues.\n\nSome good points was, this reminded me of a very basic alien isolation, it could have used a ♥♥♥♥♥on more depth, but hey, it was fun for two hours, then it got extremely repetative extremely quickly. And if you are the type who likes to explore around, loot everything you can etc., forget it, this is a very much on rails game with everything from not being able to jump over the smallest obstacles, because you literally cannot jump unless prompted to, to needing c4 of all things to get that one energy drink just out of reach. Also about 70% of all containers will be disappointly empty, so unless its a large cache or clearly ammo, which you dont need, you will be rushing through areas quickly, completely ignoring lootable objects.\n\nI wish I could recommend this game but it simply does not bring enough to the table to justify the $20 price tag. if it goes onsale for maybe $5-$10 I maybe will pick it back up to finish but for now, definately look elsewhere for a good $20 bang for your buck.","August 26, 2015","false","2.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The zombies are actual threats and not just targets to shoot at. You scavenge supplies to constantly replenish your very restricted amount of inventory while you'll be doing a mission or just lookin around for a weapon upgrade. The death penalty system is fun and interesting in how once you die, your previous character is now a zombie and you can go back to him/her to risk retrieving your previous stash of goods or die trying.

Zombi is neither. It's slow, it's tense, it's unsettling and it's terrifying. The Wii U version (ZombiU, from way back in 2012) had the advantage of two screens, but this one translates the tension that feature generated pretty well (especially if you tweak the controls to work with a Steam Controller).\nYou will:\n-Panic because you need to take on tons of zombies with only a cricket bat + a flashlight\n-Spend more time watching your radar than the screen because you don't want to get ambushed\n-Get ambushed anyway\n-Die\n-Die again\n-Kill your zombified former self to get your stuff back\n-Set a mine\n-Forget about the mine\n-Get blown up by the mine\n-Seriously, watch out for the mines\n\nFantastic, if slightly flawed game.

As a Londonder myself I find very, very upsetting that my city's people were not portrayed properly. A city that is more than 1/3 made up of foreign nationals. A city that has a considerable amount of black people, and Asians, and Eastern Europeans, and Italians, and Portuguese, and Spanish and French... and yet all characters are English and from what I've seen 99% are white. How many working hours more the developers would have needed to add foreign sounding names to the pool, or samples of the identity card (which we don't even have by the way) for the profile page, or stretching the eyes a bit... I'm not calling them racists, but I am definitely calling them lazy.\n\nI know, I know, it's a game, not a documentary... but if you're using a city that exists, names of places that exist, you have to portray the people that exist in these places as they are. you can't pick and choose.","May 26","true","22.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/339230/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","434 products in account","Before the WiiU launched, Zombiu was hotly tipped to be its first killer app, and whether you agree with that or not, it made a big impact upon its release. Critics and players alike were divided though, with many calling it “ugly”, “slow” and “repetitive”. Much noise was made around its novel use of the gamepad as a map and inventory screen, drawing your eyes away from any lurking zombies approaching on the TV. Yet, even the game’s harshest critics conceded that there was something special lurking beneath ZombiU’s rotting facade. But what is ZombiU without Nintendo’s unconventional controller? Zombi, as it is now known, plays the same as before but it is, arguably, all the better for having dropped the “U” from its name.\n\nFor all intents and purposes Zombi is the same game you can pick up for a fiver on WiiU, with the exception of a few changes. Combat is still clunky and dull, but a few new melee weapons thrown into the mix, and a slight attack speed increase. Graphically, the game is as dated as ever, with big ugly textures and asset repetition being commonplace. Multiplayer features have been ripped right out as well, leaving you with just the single player campaign to fight through. So, why then, is Zombi still so appealing, even with its many imperfections and cutbacks?\n\nPlaying as a lone survivor you’ll sneak around the derelict streets of London, while they are teaming with infected. Guided by “The Prepper” – a cynical ex-military survivor – you’ll work your way across the city from the underground to Buckingham Palace, all in a bid to stay alive, and escape to safety.\n\nSurvival is your focus in Zombi, and you’ll find plenty of equipment scattered across London. You can carry a limited number of items around with you in your bug out bag (B.O.B); a bag that holds your food, first aid kits and weapons. And here’s where things get interesting. If you get overwhelmed by the undead you’ll re-spawn in the underground as a new survivor – and you’ll need to get all of your old equipment back. To do so you’ll have to track down your previous character, cave their head in and make off with your loot. Lovely.\n\nOnce you’ve got your stuff back you’re free to pick up where you left off, before your previous survivor had their brains scooped out. You could argue that Zombi does little to endear you to your character, perhaps subtracting from, what is otherwise, an immersive game. You never really learn much about them, except for some intro text every time you re-spawn, so there’s no real personal connection tying you to the game.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Zombi is a little rough around the edges in the graphics department, but it still manages to succeed in creating a foreboding atmosphere. Expert use of lighting, shade and audio serves as proof that graphical fidelity comes second to well-designed environments and sound. This is a game where you’ll tentatively turn corners, flash your torch every few steps, and stop to listen for nearby undead. Paranoia becomes an asset rather than a burden, leading you to decapitate already dead enemies, look behind yourself every few seconds, and take the long way around to avoid encounters.\n\nZombi’s combat is never the focal point, and neither it should be because it’s rubbish. The game’s main appeal lays in its ability to mess with your head, make you preempt things and expect the unexpected. Outright scares are sparsely dotted throughout the game, evoking panic and disorientation at the worst possible times. Zombi doesn’t want you to win, and that’s why it’s so great.\n\nThe majority of horror games I’ve played simply try too hard to evoke a reaction from the player, but Zombi is different. It’s all too happy to let you become comfortable with your surroundings. It lets you become sloppy and the pounces on you with expert precision.\n\nAlthough it’s far from perfect, as an original IP Zombi is among some of the better games and deserves a second chance to live.\n\nTemper your expectations,  close the curtains and lose your head in its undead fantasy.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginally available at: http://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/08/upping-the-res-dropping-the-u-zombi/\n\nDisclosure: I purchased my own copy.","August 26, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can carry a limited number of items around with you in your bug out bag (B.O.B); a bag that holds your food, first aid kits and weapons. And here’s where things get interesting. If you get overwhelmed by the undead you’ll re-spawn in the underground as a new survivor – and you’ll need to get all of your old equipment back. To do so you’ll have to track down your previous character, cave their head in and make off with your loot. Lovely.\n\nOnce you’ve got your stuff back you’re free to pick up where you left off, before your previous survivor had their brains scooped out. You could argue that Zombi does little to endear you to your character, perhaps subtracting from, what is otherwise, an immersive game. You never really learn much about them, except for some intro text every time you re-spawn, so there’s no real personal connection tying you to the game.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Zombi is a little rough around the edges in the graphics department, but it still manages to succeed in creating a foreboding atmosphere. Expert use of lighting, shade and audio serves as proof that graphical fidelity comes second to well-designed environments and sound. This is a game where you’ll tentatively turn corners, flash your torch every few steps, and stop to listen for nearby undead. Paranoia becomes an asset rather than a burden, leading you to decapitate already dead enemies, look behind yourself every few seconds, and take the long way around to avoid encounters.\n\nZombi’s combat is never the focal point, and neither it should be because it’s rubbish. The game’s main appeal lays in its ability to mess with your head, make you preempt things and expect the unexpected. Outright scares are sparsely dotted throughout the game, evoking panic and disorientation at the worst possible times. Zombi doesn’t want you to win, and that’s why it’s so great.\n\nThe majority of horror games I’ve played simply try too hard to evoke a reaction from the player, but Zombi is different. It’s all too happy to let you become comfortable with your surroundings. It lets you become sloppy and the pounces on you with expert precision.\n\nAlthough it’s far from perfect, as an original IP Zombi is among some of the better games and deserves a second chance to live.\n\nTemper your expectations,  close the curtains and lose your head in its undead fantasy.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginally available at: http://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/08/upping-the-res-dropping-the-u-zombi/\n\nDisclosure: I purchased my own copy.","August 26, 2015","true","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

For starters this business about Uplay and the xbox controller.  Yeah, I would rather not use uplay (I like my controller) but it is what it is...most of us already have a Uplay account and I imagine the same is true for using a controller. The game is what is important,,,and this game isn't that bad.  Reminds me of Survivor stories.  Graphics are decent, controll is OK too. There is not alot of roaming and exploring, zombies come at you similar to an arena game. More focus on just a few zombies rather than a horde. Limited storage as well,  so you need to store stuff at your safe house.  Not worth 60 bucks but for 20 I'm having a good time.

The PC version, however, is generally disppointing.  The game does get some things right, namely the moody and atmospheric setting, the music, and the jump scares.  The graphics, however are just not up to the current standard.\n\nThe game world is quite small and you'll find yourself going over the same ground time and time again.  In many cases, there are areas that simply cannot be accessed until you aquire the right item or upgrade (and for which there is no clue or hint of where it might be found), which forces you to go back to areas you've already visited.\n\nThe weapons you can aquire in the game are terribly underpowered and ammunition is extremely rare, which limits their effectiveness even more.  You'll find yourself using your trusty cricket bat 90% of the time and simply bludgeoning zombies over and over again until they die.\n\nSpeaking of which, every time your character dies, you respawn at the original location without any of the items you have found.  Your only choice is to go back to where you died, kill your former self and recover your items, or forget it completely and start with no items.  After a while, I didn't bother picking up any of the advanced weapons (shotguns, assault rifles, etc), since you only get enough ammo to ensure that they run out in the middle of fight.\n\nThe game can only be saved from certain locations and only if you have discovered them\n\nAll in all, I really like the atmosphere and the "feel" of the gameworld, I just wish the actual gameplay wasn't so frustrating and repetitive.\n","August 24, 2015","false","25.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

Have to say that 'warn' is an appropriate word to describe this rushed buggy mess. I have gone through numerous crashings, graphical glitches and game-breaking moments to even recommend this game. It's a typical scrubi-soft pile of crud. Half the time you whack zombies and then can't find the corpses... then discover a bug has sent it flying halfway across the room. I got as far as the fuel station only to discover the needed fuel canister didnt spawn and couldnt go any further, I was livid and reluctantly restarted the game from scratch. Now I find myself on the roof in the Évac' quest and after clearing the landing site, nothing happens. I am stuck in an area and no event have been triggered. Walking aimlessly about with nothing I can do. I am done with this f*cking mess. I refuse to play this crap until it is patched. The missing item bug was apparently n the WiiU version as well. This is nothing more than a ca$h-grab because sales of the WiiU version were disappointing. Not as disappointed as I am that I paid good money for this abortion. F*ck you Ubi, you should be ashamed of yourselves. People are complaining left, right and centre and still no patches or announcements.\n\nTextures/graphics are over used so it's easy to get lost as there isnt any real land marks. Corridors look all the same. Just a case of copy-paste everywhere. Even graffiti/objects are in the same place in every corridor. Makes travelling about confusing and easy to get lost. A very lazy port with unnecessary UPLAY drm. Steam is more than adequate. I also find the zombie snarl/growl to be done far too much and definitely over used. You can't even drop old inferior weapons when you get an updated version so forced to carry crap in your inventory and waste a storage slot! :/\n\nSave your money for something fun and worth buying.

Survivor two went down and there went all of my equipment. I quit and never played the game again.\n\nThe game's hit PC now and I don't have to muddle about with a Gamepad or twin-stick FPS controls, so I gave the game another shot. I came to find the game's semi-permadeath gameplay is still incredibly awful.\n\nMy first go around I made good time, in about 30 minutes I was in the same spot I managed to get to on the WiiU; fantastic, having a keyboard+mouse makes a world of difference. However, over an hour later I came to find Zombies with oxygen tanks who in my findings blew up when I shot them, cool, let me crack them over the head with my cricket bat and... Boom. I explode. My first survivor is dead. Great. Now I have to trek back to my corpse and get my supplies.\n\nI did that via the sewer tunnel fast-travel system in a couple minutes and got my things back. Around an hour after that I step on a mine and my second survivor is dead but it's my fault, so screw it, except that my corpse is nowhere to be found and all of my stuff is gone for good. Why? No idea.\n\nAt this point I'm at the end of the game, I'm running out of a building while an alarm wails and I'm getting attacked left and right. Things start taking a turn for the worst and I die. At this point I just want to finish the game and never play it again but it doesn't want to let me do so. My new survivor has nothing, not even the tools to scan open the door that'll let me use the fast travel tunnels. I'm going to have to get my ♥♥♥ all the way back to the end game with a survivor that has the bare minimum of supplies. I gave it a shot, ran into a room and proceeded to get overwhelmed by 6 or so zombies that there was no way in hell to deal with.\n\nScrew it, uninstall.\n\nOther than that the game looks pretty aged and the level design is awful, everything is windy and maze-like with very little that is destinguishable. Also, more than half of the game takes place in the sewer system. Every area in England is apparently only connected by sewer systems. Also the sewers suffer from Halo levels of copy-and-paste level design, you'll see the same areas over and over when you're in the sewers you're going to wonder if you're going in circles. It's horrible. There's also a lot of back tracking through the sewers, it's awful.\n\nThe sound/gun mechanics are great and this could of been a really good title but it's definitely not worth it.","August 27, 2015","false","4.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Sound design and music are spot on, and I really appreciated all the little touches put into the survivor characters to make each one feel pretty unique. However the game is buggy - and these bugs are most pronounced when you die for something that you didn't deserve (say, clipping through the floor of an elevator and falling to your death, or clipping off a ladder and falling to your death - lots of falling to your death) and you lose a character that you may have put alot of time into. The game is just about good enough to keep you wanting more in the face of these really frustrating problems... until you factor in uplay.\n\nUplay is a pile of filth, not only because the very idea of it being forced on you is abusive but because it is a grossly incompetent service. The game failed to launch at least half of the time and would occaisionally crash back to desktop, but the real cherry on top, the real reason I am even writing this review, is when uplay stops everything to say you need to re-enter your activation code to bring the game up but then says the code you enter is already in use (because you entered it when you initially started the game) and then just leaves you stranded with a game you can no longer open. It very cheerfully tells you that your account has already used this code and to please access your games from your library, but when you go to your library to open the game, it pops back up with the enter activation code window and the whole process becomes a loop - which ends with uplay suspending your account if you try to enter your valid code enough times. Sure, you could get in touch with uplay to resolve the issue, even though there is no direction from uplay itself about how to do this, but at this point the only thing I want to express to uplay is disgust.\n\nDecent game made unplayable and a waste of time by a shambolic, embaressingly inept and wholly unnecessary service.

This is because when the game is working, it's absolutely the funnest and near realest apocalypse/zombie game iv'e ever played. The weapons, supplies, animations, evrything is literally AWESOME. Then comes the bad part. Pretty much 9/10 times whenever I get to a loading screen after going through doors marked "exit" (which leads to the loading screen to continue on to another part of the map) the game tabs out to my desktop and then the game just completely crashes, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it takes like 10 minutes to boot the game up in the first place, only to have it crash again once I get to a loading screen. most likely this is on my computer's end, but i'd still like to see smoother loading sequences and possibly more options to downscale the graphics so this awesome game doesn't crash everytime I try to use it.

I think the permanent death of characters was what really set this game apart from other zombie survival games, but it should've been emphasized more. I also wish I could switch the cricket bat out for other melee weapons. I found the shovel that had better damage and range, but it had to take up a separate pack spot, even though it made the cricket bat obsolete.\n\n\n\n","September 22, 2015","false","2.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Left4Dead, Dying Light, State of Decay, Dead State, Dead Rising, etc, etc.  So when I heard ZombiU (a game I had never played) was coming out on other consoles after being a WiiU exclusive, I was excited, and bought it on day one.  I had heard mixed things, but it had my interest, and I was hoping it would be something fun.\n\nInstead the overall product is underwhelming and unpolished.  My first red flag went up when I saw that the cutscenes were extremely muddy and pixelated, like something out of the old PS1 days.  During game play, glitches abound.  Hits often don't register, prompts to execute zombies while on the floor are ignored, and things like that.\n\nThen the game crashed right at a cutscene on the top of the London tower.  Disgusted, I decided to take a break from it.  The next day when I decided to try again, apparently the crash completely deleted my game save and I was faced with starting over the whole lackluster process again.  I said no.  I'll try and see if I can get a refund even though I'm beyond the playtime cap.  It's worth a try, right?  Better that than slogging through all that again.  So, no, I wouldn't recommend it until a patch or two comes out.","August 20, 2015","false","22.7"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","12","27","2","0"

But badly programmed. And here's why: items don't stack in your invenorty. The game doesn't remember your hotkey settings for unstacked items. Things like flares and molotov cocktails. You can hotkey 1 flare and 1 molotov cocktail but you can't alternate: you can't do: (HotKey) 3: equip flare. Throw flare. HK 4: equipe molotov cocktail. Throw molotov cocktail. Beng. Dead zombies. Let's do that again.\nUh, you can't. The hotkey was on the flare / molotov cocktail you just lobbed. Pressing 3 or 4 won't help you. They are no longer assigned. You've got to go into your inventory to equip them. And no, the game doesn't pause. And this is just one of many examples.\nTo make a long story short: you are dead because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programming.\nBut it's a gauntlet game. You learn by repetition, a bit like a rat in a maze. Just do it again. Learn. No, don't reason, think or anticipate, The game doesn't cater for that. You can be as careful or as raging as you want: you cross a trigger, zombies will spawn. Out of nowhere. Improvise. Die. Try again. Ah. Now I've got it. And you can continue.\nThe game just caters for little dogs who are happy to learn how and when to jump the hoops for a treat. That kind of game. Doom III, Hitman. The kind of game in which you you can't, as an epic uber hero nightmare, navigate a wall that reaches your navel, step over a curb or ancle high daffodils. Because the game designers thought they know best. Here's the path, here's the options, select one. Whieee.\nSo, with this game, you are in for a treat if you like to be a little doggie. You'll learn to navigate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ programming as if it was intentional, more little hoops to jump through. Anybody who doesn't want to be an obedient little doggie, in for another day of domestication, should give it a miss.\nThankfully, for Ubisoft and all others, there's now going be tons of little doggies who'll start yapping and pissin themselves while asserting the're wolves, actually.\n","August 20, 2015","false","35.2"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","6"

I could complain that the graphics are mediocre or that the game is so weird that they think that if England suffered a zombie apocalypse then our first reaction is to vist the monarchy. Ignoring them issues the game it's self is quite boring. The gameplay remindes me of Dead Island where it's just very cluncky, slow and dull. The gun play works fine but since your at limited ammo and you don't want to attract noise, its not worth the risk so you end up playing constent wack a mole with your trusty cricket bat against the zombies. The constent moaning as you hit the zombies heads almost gets annoying and it takes so many hits, please if your going to make a sequal, make a range of weapons to bash the zombies heads with to make the combat less tedious.\n\nHowever, the whole idea of the game is acually great and I think it deserves another shot. The dark murky atmostphere did honestly bring me the chills and scared me at times. The games permerdeath system is really unique. When you die, you lose all your supplies and if you want them back then you need to kill the zombie version of old you. Its acually amazing how you almost grow a emotional attachment to your character after a while and your gutted to see him or her die not just because of the suppies but the person itself is a loss.\n\nI think that ubisoft should give Stright Right another shot at making this better (making a sequal). A better combat, better graphics and less 'WiiU'ness would possible make this one of the best zombie horror game since resident evil. Sadly though, this is not something i would recommend buying unless you are just doing it to ask for a sequal.","August 23, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","5","13","3","0"

Oh well, welcome in Steam Community.\n\nIs this game is fun? I would rather have more fun driving arround Glasgow City Centre at the pick hours with my granny on the backseat.\n\nWould you enjoy visiting virtual London? Hmm I was in London and it doesn't look like the one in-game :)\n\nYou would be good to visit your local Recycling Site and still be able to get the very same experience...\n\nGraphics in this game are outdated.\nCombat? what kind of combat? 3 moves? It's kinda never ending head bashing story.\nNo crafting at all.\nNo free open world. Just linear straight way to do things.\nNo graphic settings.\nPhysics? Oh well I've approched a zombie lying on the floor and it sent zombie flying all over, I've approched a desk and desk pushed me away to the other end of the room :) lol\n\nIs this game is wort the money? Of course it is worth the money but not the original asked price of £14.99. I would and probably will wait till it drops to £3.99 as I won't pay more than that for this game.\n\nThe game is unpolished, full of bugs and it's not even a stain on Ubisoft's reputation as they are pretty known for releasing unfinished products just for quick buck grab...\n\nFortunately for me there is Steam refund which I've used and now I suggest you to do the very same thing and wait till it goes on sale and I can assure you it will happen very soon.\n\nAs far as I am a huge fan of the genre this game is not fun...

So I will keep it very short for someone that owns and played alot of high graphics video games considering Im running a state of the art PC. I'am the person that enjoy's graphics and detail and yes don't get me wrong the game is fun and it does reminds me of Dayz just a better version. If you are into graphics lets say Metro graphics you will not like this game at all, graphics are terrible and lots of ghosting when you are in the dark. Game has lots of potential and it is a fun game but graphics just dont cut it for me. Game play overall is pretty simple and straight forward controls are basic nothing too crazy compare to daying light and I noticed alot of people compared this game to Dying light .....HOW DARE YOU lmao anywho. So if i was to rate this on graphics and engine used etc I know this wasn't built for PC at the beggining but I would give it 4 out of 10. If you don't care about graphics at all and you just care about a hardcore surivor zombie game bit better then Day Z  then I would suggest you buy this it is pretty cheap. I spoke to some people at Ubisoft here in Toronto and they said that the game will be cheap on STEAM and I see the reasons now why.","August 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

Firstly, there is no crouch or jumping unless you come across an object you have to jump over or crouch under but the game prompts you to push a button to complete the action, talk about atmosphere breaking. Secondly, while the graphics are not awful, there are no options to tweak the graphics except for screen resolution, which is awful. Thirdly. I came across this game through the "Open World" tag and then researched it a bit and decided to try it, but this game is not really open world. There are loading screens galore along with horribly designed map spaces that are very limiting, which just gets worse when you realize that you cannot crouch or jump in a "Survival Horror Game". Bottom line is, this is a sub par game thats not really what it markets itself to be and ontop of being an awful port $20 is way too much for this game (Maybe I'd recommend it if it was around $5 at the most). I requested a refund so I'd suggest anyone wanting to try this game out to keep your playtime under 2 hours.","August 26, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","17","1","6","0","0"

I personally don't have many issues with Uplay other than Assassin's Creed 2's outdated Uplay launcher crashing, which was easily fixed by updating it elsewhere, although i still despise the idea of DRMs and understand others' frustration with DRMs in general.\n\nIf you're like me, and you've been dying to try out ZombiU since it was revealed at E3 years ago, then despite the minimalistic PC port effort, give it a try, becuase IMO $20 isnt bad. However, i still think that Ubi$oft could've and should've put much more effort in the PC version in terms of optimization, graphics options, and Mouse+Keyboard controls, which is why i do not recommend this game to just anybody.\n\nIf you do plan on trying out ZOMBI on PC, then just be prepared to deal with a sub-par port with issues that may hinder your experience.

While writing this review I noticed they increased the price of the game from $19.99 USD to $24.95 USD and the game hasn't even been out for more than 48 hours yet! I know some people are reporting they still see it for $19.99 but This is what I'm seeing right now and also showing my purchase. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/35561843/ubiderp.jpg\n\nAnyway... If you already have Dying Light, there is literally no point getting this game. Even if you don't have Dying Light yet, you are better off just getting that even if you have to wait for it to go on sale.\n\nThis game is a cheap port from the WiiU. I've already found many issues ranging from minor to game breaking. The graphics and pop-in distance is a bit rediculous too. I'm currently uninstalling this due to the game breaking bugs that occur, costing a huge chunk of gameplay time to just vanhish...\n\nPros:\n-A half decent zombie survival game.\n-Some decent atmosphere work.\n\nCons:\n-Requires the use of UPLay. (Ubisoft's DRM. If we wanted Uplay, we'd get it ourselves. Don't force it on us...)\n-Poor story structure that brings nothing new to the table.\n-Combat becomes highly repeditive and loses it's impact value quickly.\n-Graphics are the same as the WiiU. (in otherwords, very bad graphics on average)\n-Sometimes the game can glitch during a cutscene and can cause crashing.\n-Pop-in distance on certain props or objects can totally throw gameplay immersion.\n-Controller prompts will be displayed instead of keyboard/mouse if a controller is connected.\n-Another lazy console port from Ubisoft.\n-Ubisoft...

The game is mediocre, and everything that made it unique vanished with the loss of the Wii U gamepad.\n\nAnd don't listen to people comparing this to games like Dark Souls. With a mouse and keyboard this game is easy. If you have any experience with FPS games, expect to never get to see the much boasted about death mechanics.\n\nThe levels are linear, short, and often have only one path through them. You can't even soak in the ambience because the game is terrified of leaving you alone without throwing objective markers in your face and shoving you along while a condescending unseen NPC barks orders at you. It's like playing Bioshock with an Atlus that never shuts up and treats you like you have severe brain damage.\n\nGo buy Dying Light instead.","August 19, 2015","false","1.1"," 11 of 29 people (38%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","38","11","29","3","0"

Game is just as bad as it was on Wii-U, only with more annoying Ubisoft ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that makes it take an extra hour to play the ♥♥♥♥ing game, forcing you to make an account and download and run Uplay to even start up the game. Do not be fooled with this port, there is almost nothing for Pc here. The only visual change that you can make is in resolution but as far as anything else you are screwed. Won't run for low profile computers, and will be not as great as you would think for high profile computers. Gameplay is boring, with no jumping, little melee feedback, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hit detection because as far as the game is concerned you can only hit "zombis" in the head. At the start of the game you are forced into a situation where you are supposed to die and teach you, “Oh, you die a lot BUT IT’s OK!” But all I got out of it was frustration because the way I died was being pulled off a ladder over and over again by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animation that felt clunky and poor. SPEAKING OF CLUNKY, let's talk about the physics. When you hit a zombi they fly across 3 feet away, and fling up in the air when they die by melee. For a game that is trying to be SO GREITY it just comes off and STUPID AND SILLY, and gives no satisfaction in the kill, only confusion as to wtf just happened. Also, the first time you see an explosive barrel by a few zombi’s you think, “ Wow, i’m going to blow them up, cool.” Well hold on to your butts little jimmy because this is a whole different wild ride. I’ve seen better explosions in golden eye, it felt and looked like I just lit a firecracker in a pool of boring burning gas. So anyway, the explosion happened and one zombi dies, “With all his limbs attached,” and the other just comes towards me confused and burning,”I felt the same way as him.” Also should mention that there are just spitting zombis out of no where that they don’t explain that kill you really quick before you can even realize what insane ♥♥♥♥ was just dumped on you by poor game design. Not to mention the you first meet the doctor in buckingham he spends half the conversation saying nothing and walking slowly around his room while you just get slowly and slowly more ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that the game isn’t progressing AT ALL. Then the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ door mini games that take no effort, aren’t fun or puzzley, and just waste your time when your trying to play the game, which is boring anyway. Because instead of running around and finding supplies to survive you are doing stupid ♥♥♥♥ for this big brother guy, who once and awhile shows you important thing on these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low res tvs that you can’t see anything on. ALSO, time to call out one of my video game pet pev’s, MINIGUNS. You see a mini pointed towards a plaza and think HMMMMMMM, I WONDER IF I’LL USE IT. No ♥♥♥♥ you will use it, plan to be ambushed two seconds later, it takes all the suspense of trying to survive out of it. Also, I should also mention the added bonus of using guns, you don’t have to listen to your “character's” painful war scream every time you swing something. Also, the game has no stamina system so you just have to guess how long you can run for. It makes me sick that there are so many good reviews of this boring and thrown together game, that I just had to call it out for what it is. Nothing in this game is new, if anything it is a step back for the genre and can be thrown on top of the VAST bargain bin of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unoriginal zombie games that also coincidentally have equally as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ titles.\n\nIn summary,\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME, maybe check it out at $5, but at $20 it’s just such a big ♥♥♥♥ing joke!!!!! Bad port, bad/boring gameplay. Doesn’t compare in the least bit to actual functioning roguelikes. Annoying Ubishit sprayed ALLLL over it.","August 19, 2015","false","1.4"," 24 of 57 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","24","57","4","0"

Graphics are absolutely outdated for a 2015 release, while the engine provides laughable physics that'll send a zombie that was just lying down in front of you flying once you bash its head. The only actual interesting feature is the death part where, if you eventually get run down by the zombies, your character will become one of them, carrying the very same loadout, which you will have a chance to get "back" if you go back to the same spot as another person and find your old "self" and bash their head to nothing.\n\nGraphics about as unimpressive as its sounds and general soundtrack. The biggest expression I've made in my time playing this game so far was a frown when I had the chance of ending a zombie with a blow to the head, but the game didn't exactly respond as it should, and the zombie kept resetting from his former position and tried to get up, only for me to smack him down again some good 5 or 6 times until he finally died, taking with with him whatever curiosity was left in me to play this sad attempt on Ubisoft's part to have a share of the zombie apocalypse themed games.\n\nIt plays fairly well in spite of some serious overlooks (or simply not caring, as it gets more and more common by the day in the gaming industry), so I'd give it a 6.5 out of 10. My recommendation is: only buy it if it's on sale, you've ran out of options on games to play or buy, and you're extremely bored.","August 19, 2015","false","1.6"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","11","31","0","0"

Doesnt truly support 2560x1080. Graphics options severely limited. Played 30 minutes and then got stuck next to a box after picking up an item and had to resart. Requested refund and suggest you all steer clear and wait for it to be 3 quid in a sale if you need to scratch an itch. Or better yet pick up dying light.\n\nTo Clarify\n\nMy resolution is shown in the menu but when you play at that res it doesn work correctly and is buggy with black bars. Fonts are scewed and the loading screens are cut off as well. The graphics options severely limited as in you cannot select texture size or aa or af. No shadows modificatiion or anything but res. The bug was game breaking for me and I had to start over. Not a brilliant start was it. In its current state its not worth 15 quid. And like I said without the actual point of this game the wii controller it plays poorly as well. To much mouse acceleration and you cannot properly aim down sights for accurate headshots as it was clearly not designed for a mouse. If you still feel like buying it carry on.","August 19, 2015","false","0.5"," 37 of 93 people (40%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","40","37","93","6","9"

Of course I promptly left it on the pile just like I did with the original release until now. I definitely feel bad for doing that since the game is just as cool as it's fans say it is. The developers did a really smart job of borrowing some Souls game design and wrapping it into a slow-paced zombie survival horror game. While the run back to regain your weapons and supplies isn't quite as punishing as the Souls games, a death does feel more fittingly punishing than just a checkpoint restart. The level design is surprisingly clever and does a really nice job of feeling just layered enough to make revisits to areas interesting (being able to mark locked doors on the map is really handy). The combat feels just the right level of clunky. The melee weapons are pretty poor for mobs, while the guns feel slow and weak unless you nail headshots consistently. The balance works well and keeps each engagement interesting as you weigh your options. I loved the mood of the game too. It's aggressively British and the fog and grime help out the weaker aspects of the visuals.\n\nVerdict: Give it a shot.","February 12","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the run back to regain your weapons and supplies isn't quite as punishing as the Souls games, a death does feel more fittingly punishing than just a checkpoint restart. The level design is surprisingly clever and does a really nice job of feeling just layered enough to make revisits to areas interesting (being able to mark locked doors on the map is really handy). The combat feels just the right level of clunky. The melee weapons are pretty poor for mobs, while the guns feel slow and weak unless you nail headshots consistently. The balance works well and keeps each engagement interesting as you weigh your options. I loved the mood of the game too. It's aggressively British and the fog and grime help out the weaker aspects of the visuals.\n\nVerdict: Give it a shot.","February 12","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm sorry I'm no expert. It's not only focused on jumpscares and the fear of the unknown like all other horror games, but this game has my "Best Horror Game Features Pyramid": fear, fun and Survival.
