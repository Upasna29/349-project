Like the first its all fully voice acted and overall done well. Only on a couple occasion did I think it was slightly over the top but even then it somehow seemed to fit with the comic style and added to the charm.\n\nSome areas and characters carry over from act 1 along with some new. The environments are nice clean quality HD rendered scenes though somewhat low polygon character models and sometimes little slow animations are not as nice but by no means an issue. Although the faces can sometimes appear creepy :).\nBeing a point & Click the controls are simple and effective. Left-click interact & right-click look/examine is basically all you need to get by and you can press space to highlight spots or objects to interact with. Works great and including the ability to double click to skip to other screens/areas saves the games from ever feeling sluggish.\nMy run-through came out around the 3 hours mark , roughly similar to my playtime with act 1, and I didn't really get stuck at any points.\n\nI find it hard to give any kind of recommendation either way being only 1 part of a series. My opinions and experience is still only based only on a part of the whole (half if include act 1) but I've enjoyed this and the first act so far and I am eager to play the next instalments so they must be doing something right.\nThis was another good 'part' of what I hope will be a good complete whole and so far I find the story and characters intriguing and gripping. Bring on the next act.","October 27, 2015","true","4.1"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

The devs seems to go for a bi-yearly release cycle, and that is a long wait for these 3-4 hour chunks of greatness, it also means that we have to wait a long time for the conclusive fourth episode.","March 9","true","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I was just scratching my head a lot)\n- The walking animation is extremely slow\n- The background story is pretty confusing for new players of the series\n- It's hard to tell what to do during some parts, and sometimes the solution seems pretty strange and unlikely.\n\n\nOverall it's a pretty good point & click game with an interesting story and characters.","February 8","true","5.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I enjoy playing it. It's about 4 hours to play. It's classic adventure game with logical puzzles. The puzzles are not too hard, but just hard enough. The ambient music is awsome, I love music in the capena church. The actor voices are good enough. The story is great and good implemented with puzzles. You can read some books to know more about the story. The dialogs are good and classic written. I love the inventory. Its easy and functional. If you try to give something to someone and it's not correctly, then it appears red x in inventory, cool staff.","May 29","true","4.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is extremely slow to load and crashed within 20 minutes. I don't get it. The graphics are all static single framed and there should be no burden on your  graphics card or CPU based upon the minimum requirements. My system far exceeds in every aspect but It was painfully slow to load from one scene to the next.\nFinally that black screen between scenes became permanent after about 20-25 minutes in. DONE. Got my refund.","May 23","false","0.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","33"
