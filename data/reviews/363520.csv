Not enough thunks, and booms. The rest of the audio is a bit more than atmospheric, and while not terrible, doesn't add much either.\n\nWhere the game succeeds: Core mechanic.\n\nA fun crafting system that doesn't feel like work. A nice balance of action and exploration where mechs are a tool and not a means for unending material grind.\n\nCombat system could use a little work in terms of creating "impact" which you hit an enemy... but this also isn't a fighting game. It plays a lot more like an isometric ARPG, which isn't a bad thing.\n\nFinally, the dev team is EXTREMELY responsive on the forums. They are currently answering every single question and concern that pops up, which shows a lot of promise for future development. I have confidence that Whalebox will continue to shape this game into a well polished gem.\n\nAll in all, it's hard not to recommend this title, despite its flaws. It has so much ambition and heart, I can forgive its first day fuzzies. If you like the concept of this game at all, I'd say it's worth showing your support.","May 12","true","35.3"," 58 of 68 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","58","68","2","2"

It feels like it could have the impact of something like like a more complex Bastion type game, but it just falls through.  The graphics seem well stylized, but the music and animations are very lack luster.  Many of the actions in the game don't seem to really have feel of  being a big robot.  Also the dialog interace is just so boring and feels tacked on.  The K+M controls feel clunky with the locked camera angle.  The default keybinds are also unconfigurable and feel akward.  Having to spam E and then other times hold E are totally inconsistent.\n\nThe game has potential, but it feels much more like an Early Access game.

Music no longer stops suddenly and polish on just general mechanics have already gone out\n\nThe game as a whole isn't bad. I'm enjoying the different types of Goliaths and they feel different to fit different situations. You won't be simply abandoning one goliath just because the next one unlocks.\n\nThe game, however, still needs a lot of polish. The music abruptly stops when combat ends, and some interactions are very picky and simply won't work unless you shuffle around trying to adjust where you stand, despite the prompt showing up. I've also just simply died with no way of really knowing what just happened. (I literally blew up when picking up my stuff from a previous death, no reason for it at all, just... boom. Done. The only thing I can think of is the mines in my pocket activated when they dropped.)\n\nI would still recommend the game because you're looking at a pretty fun, and rather extensive, game for the price. The release of the game still needs work and bugs are all over the place, but if you can overlook it, or if it's updated and fixed, it's fun to play, action rewards reflexes and adjusting to your surroundings, and the elements play well in this game.","May 12","true","7.7"," 23 of 30 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","23","30","2","2"

The developers have freely acknowledged the problems, respond to bug reports as they're made, and have already released some fixes / small feature requests three days after release. Folks who want a thoroughly tested game should wait a month or so to skip the teething pains.\n\nIn spite of the problems, I'm still recommending Goliath for those who are less bothered by bugs, or who appreciate responsive developers. The music, art, and character styles are well developed, making me feel like I'm in an steampunk / Old West movie with attitude as soon as I launch it. The game looks like it will be huge (especially if you're an exploring type): lots of worlds/areas each with their own loot layout, multiple special attacks for each elemental robot (and specialized subtypes of those robots, too), several NPC factions, and even a dungeon sprinkled here and there. And if you like gathering until your bags burst and crafting specialized gear, you'll find everything you need.\n\nThey're not kidding about "punching monsters in the face", either. Though really, you throw boulders, do whirlwind and charge attacks, freeze or set the monsters alight, and just cause general mayhem, leveling trees and rocks as you pass. The monsters remind me a bit of of Torchlight and early Diablo: I get swarmed by fast-moving spiders, or knocked to the ground by bulls, damaged by acid or fire breath, or chased by little creatures with shaman masks throwing darts. And my robots smash them all!","May 14","true","122.3"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Where am I? Yes, I remember. A malfunction with the engine and I had to do an emergency landing. Well, seeing the extended damage the plane has suffered, I’d say its more or less a crash! Gromov… Gromov… can you hear me? Incredible, the radio still works! Hello, Gromov here…\n\nGoliath is an action/role playing game where you take control of Gromov, who crash landed his World War 2 plane on a mysterious planet. At the start of the game, you will have to do simple tasks: cutting trees, picking berries and setting up a camp. This is basically a tutorial and it will show you how to use both your inventory and the crafting menu to a certain aspect. After, hearing from your co-pilot which is stuck on the other side of the world, you will be shown the way to a teleporting device which stands in the middle of a specific circle (your new base). From here, you will be able to construct a laboratory, weapons and a Goliath construction. At your tent, you will be able to craft plenty of objects, but you must have the correct items to do so. I might add, you can store a good number of items in your inventory, which is great.\n\nThe world itself is very interesting; it is a kind of forest with ruins of 1930 buildings here and there, futuristic fragments of spaceships, very large creatures to fight or to avoid if you do not have the right Goliath under your belt, and factions that each want to dominated this strange world. As you go along, you will meet with different characters and will be given quests to do and teleporting Gromov to different areas of the planets. What I like about the world is that each part that I have seen so far has different weather elements, deserts, snow, forests with specific plants to harvest and with different creature too. As you achieve your task, you will be given experience points. Depending on which level you have reached, you will be able to access special abilities in your Goliaths.\n\nAt first, you will only be able to construct a wooden goliath, and if you have built a weapons construction table, you might be able to craft weapons for it. Then you will be able to construct stone, metal and other types of Goliaths. Each Goliath has three combat abilities, but you must reach a certain level of experience to enable each of them. To give you an example, for the wooden Goliath the first ability is available as soon as your reach level 4 of experience, then you must pass level 6 and 17 to unlock the other two. You might be able to beat a Dodo by itself quite easily but a bunch of Dodo’s are always hard to get rid of. There are a lot more creatures to fight but I will let you discover them. If you have more than one Goliath constructed, you control one and can order the other to follow you into battle or to guard an area.\n\nThe combat mechanism is simple and easy to use, whether you use the mouse and keyboard or the gamepad. One thing you must collect at all costs is the gems. Every time you teleport from one part of the world to another, it will cost you a certain number of gems.\n\nI really like the artwork and the controls work pretty well. One thing I noticed is that each time I load a game, the animations are not fluid for a while but then it seems to rectify itself.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good artwork\n-	Plenty of quests to do\n-	Good crafting mechanism\n-	Interesting world\n-	Achievements and Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	A bit buggy at times\n\nI really enjoyed Goliath; it is a good RPG, and tell me, who would not love to build big strong robots?\n\n8/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/363520/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Goliath is a fantastic RPG that focuses on building and customizing your own Goliaths for combat whilst you navigate a world you find yourself crash landed on.\n\nStory\nIn Goliath you’ll find yourself playing a young pilot who crashes on a mysterious island. With limited survival gear and a radio to contact your now lost co-pilot you’ll get to explore the lands meeting new factions, enemies and most importantly you’ll get to craft some of the awesome Goliaths in the game. With limited information fed to you from your co-pilot you’ll need to find out where you are and just how to get back home\n\nGeneral Gameplay\nAt first Goliath seems pretty similar to many survival games as you’ll quickly find yourself gathering some wood and other resources around you to survive your first night in this strange land. But you’ll very soon find yourself embroiled in much deeper affairs. Once completing a few quick starter quests you’ll find yourself ready with your own base which you can upgrade and most likely enough materials to craft your first Goliath. Goliaths are essentially large robots you can control directly as though they are a suit of armour, or order to follow you around as slaves/pets. Goliaths are big and very strong and will be the only protection you have in this world, but fear not, there are many types of Goliaths and each has it’s own perks. Though you only start with one Goliath you can craft, as you continue on you’ll be able to learn how to make new types, often stronger in some form than the last. Goliaths can also be upgraded and equipped with one of the many weapons you’re able to craft at your base and each can have both a ranged and melee weapon at the same time. Not only do Goliaths have different ability types they also react differently with your environment which can turn the tide of battle in your favour if you utilize this properly. For example stone Goliaths are faster in hot environments whereas wooden ones can heal in water.\nThere are main quests for you to follow as well as some side quests but mostly the story is linear and it’s not easy to get lost or fall off your chosen path which is appreciated because many RPGs have far too much filler now just to bulk the gameplay hours. Most of the quests you receive will be from the various factions you encounter BUT you may only do quests for factions you are on good terms with so you may want to think twice about who you attack and who you befriend.\n\nGraphics and Audio\nThe graphics are nice and run smoothly most of the time but sometimes I feel like there is a little hiccup/stutter when i’m moving on occasion. The soundtrack that plays in the background is very awesome and adds a little something extra, especially to combat as it seems to fit the mood perfectly. Something about smashing mobs in with my giant fists just feels better with great background music.\n\nCons\nThough I am loving Goliath I do have to mention some of the things that bother me, the first being a lack of explanation. Maybe I missed something but I’m learning everything from the tips when I teleport without finding too much information anywhere else. Things like how to have your Goliaths follow you and where to find the objectives for upgrading your Goliaths should be clearly explained to you as I don’t tend to pay attention to the loading screens. There are also things you are told to find and not given any indication at all of where to find them or even what they look like. This is freaking annoying on your first timed quest and just had me running around like a maniac killing everything.  Another small issue is objects floating off of the ground slightly and enemy mobs getting caught in them but this is a superficial one and didn’t really affect my gameplay, it was just very noticeable. Lastly I find things can be a tad ‘grindy’ because some of the enemies are just so damn hard to kill that I find myself needing to level first. I don’t see any difficulty settings either so it seems it's grind or nothing.\n\nSummary\nOverall Goliath is a fantastic light RPG with a story i’m enjoying and many hours of gameplay. The addition of a great story and chuckleworthy dialogue makes for a brilliant combination and is well worth the price tag. For those of you on the fence, check out some YouTube gameplay videos, I don’t think the store page does this game justice at all.\n","June 4","true","7.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Build your home base, craft fearsome titular suits of armour, and fight to survive hostile worlds.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSm5kkxjVd4&feature=youtu.be\n.Story.\nYou are Andrew Gromov. You and your pilot crash-landed and the smouldering remains of your ship are around you. You’re both uninjured, but separated, and your copilot is able to communicate with you via radio. You’re immediately tasked with setting up camp and, during your tutorial fetch quest, you find out that you’re in a strange world unlike any other—or, rather, a collection of worlds that you can teleport across via the teleportation device in what soon becomes your base of operations. Your task? Find out why you’re here and what’s going on.\n\n*The story is, at best, an excuse to keep pressing on, but that didn't bother me. I don't typically look for deep, in-depth plots in my survival games.\n\n.Gameplay.\nGoliath can be played with mouse and keyboard (WASD plus hotkeys) or controller. I personally prefer using a controller if only because using the middle mouse button to turn the camera is uncomfortable for me. More on that later. You’ll gather materials, a task made easier if you're piloting a Goliath, and build structures within a protective field generated by your teleporter. This is home base. Home base teleports when you do, so you'll always have it to fall back to. In your home base, you'll be able to craft--both consumables, equipment for your Goliaths, and Goliaths--as well as store your equipment and spare suits.\n\nYou can play as either Gromov or one of three Goliaths he can keep with him. Gromov has the ability to go invisible and also has a gun with which he can protect himself, but he is ultimately made useless by his Goliath unless you're attempting to sneak somewhere. Your Goliaths can also be commanded to stand guard at a location or to follow behind you.\n\nOutside of home base, you'll be exploring a decently sized map and engaging in battle with various, giant wildlife. Combat is not random and you can see the enemies as they wander the map.\n*If you die--and you will--you're instantly returned back to your base camp. You lose some of what's in your inventory, but you can go back to where you died and ransack your own grave in order to reclaim what was lost. You'll also have to spend resources in order to rebuild your broken Goliath.\n\nOtherwise, much of your time in Goliath will be spent teleporting from world-to-world in order to complete the main story.\n\n.Atmosphere.\nI’m going to lump graphics and soundtrack together here because they work very well together. From the title screen, you’re greeted by a rock instrumental with Western influences and a fantastic battle scene.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=698380741\nSeriously. It’s awesome.\n\nThe rest of the game has been lovingly cell-shaded. The biomes, whether hot and arid, cold and snowy, or verdant and teeming with life, were all well-detailed and the way the environments tied into the way your Goliath functions was a nice touch. See my gameplay for an example of the biomes.\n\n.Pros and Cons.\nCrafting. I love being able to make giant robots out of some logs and a few twigs. And weapons for those giant robots out of refined sap and cobwebs. As unrealistic a survival scenario, the crafting creates, it’s fun and easy and the U.I is clean cut (albiet small).\nMaterial tiers for your Goliaths. No tier has a clear advantage over another--it just depends on what you want to achieve. For example the Wood Goliath is quick and it can dodge out of the way whereas the Stone Goliath is slower, but it can block.\nMutations for your Goliaths. You can complete the challenges listed at all times in your character screen under the "challenges" tab,and unlock mutations--known as "spare parts"--for your Goliaths. These spare parts change stats (like HP), how the Goliath interacts with the weather (regeneration in hot places), and appearance. Most challenges are kill related, but they also limit you to a certain type of Goliath, area, or type of equipment.\nAuto saves. This is a questionable pro, but I liked being able to back out of the game at any time. The autosave is actually pretty smart and loading a game will show you not only the most recent save, but also five other saves that were made before it, each a few minutes apart. This gives you the option to go back before a fatal mistake--but not too far.\nYou can switch Goliath's mid-combat for some interesting results.\n\nCombat is sometimes overly difficult, so the game becomes grindy quickly. Enemies on or around your level will still take a good while to kill and will often times kill you first.\nNo zones. There’s no gradient for levels—i.e, the area closest to your teleporting base camp isn’t full of low-level beasts and the areas further away from it full of high-level beasts. Rather, it’s a mixture of either and I oftentimes found myself exploring the map only to get one-shot by an enemy that was much stronger than me.\nCamera angle. This is a minor complaint, but the slightly angled camera (it’s not directly overhead) makes it difficult to see where you’re going or what you’re hitting in combat. This only becomes a real issue when you’re using the mouse and keyboard because it feels a little\nawkward pressing down the middle mouse button while using the left mouse button to attack.\nKeys are not re-bindable. At least not in-game. This goes with the camera angle complaint.\n-The range on E (your interaction key) is huge. Sometimes Gromov will start harvesting a tree halfway across the screen instead of picking up what's right in front of him.\nUpon starting up the game, the initial load time is a little lengthy.\n.Bottom line.\nGoliath strays from the typical survival formula by including the ability to craft and pilot giant robots. It looks great, plays well, and will keep you entertained for a good while.\n\nThere are several tiers of upgrades for your Goliath, skills to unlock as your pilot levels up, buildings to upgrade in your base, and quests to undertake. The landscapes are varied and interesting, though limited in size. Exploration allows you find resources and chests filled with loot, but also runs the risk of running into a monster that’s bigger and badder than your Goliath.\n\nIf you’re looking for a survival game with some light RPG elements and you’re not afraid of a bit of grind, Goliath is well worth the price of admission.","June 6","true","8.2"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Well-designed locations, full of resources and mobs to farm. Interesting dialogues, simple and creative, goes well with the syle of the game. Addictive gameplay, quite varied and intense, that will not get bored even in the quiet moments of the game. Giant robots, which can be put as companions in battle or max all their abilities out by the player.\nThe idea and the successful implementation of natural elements in the game gives some interesting complexity/advantages in battles and casual walking through locations. Such small but essential details make the game interesting and unusual.\nCrafting system and the RPG elements are also simple and neither bind to anything. The lack of a typical skill-tree is justified - given the dynamics of the game, it is not necessary. The game encourages the player to do stuff and to experiment, so the skill tree is called 'Experimentations" in the game.\nOf course, there are downsides. Long load screens which tend to freeze at times, ending up in the crash of the game, are upsetting, but it's not that frequent. Inventory is not very handy, where at least some kind of sorting might be useful, maybe for types of things (materials, weapons, gadgets). Combat system lacks targeting, so the player always has to face the enemy at the moment of pressing the button, thus risking Gromov's or Goliath's life at times. I won't talk about minor flaws and lags as developers, I think, know about them already and are doing their best to correct them.\nThe game is good, the game is cool and powerful, but requires patches and polishing to be better.","May 13","true","40.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

In order to compete in the environments that are increasingly foreign and dangerous, in your search for a way home, you build automatons called Goliaths. Mechanoid constructs you ride around in and perform combat in. It features open concept mini-worlds where you can gather resources, help indigenous races, and generally do their bidding. All in the search of information that most claim to have, but are unwilling to just give away, expecially to someone with the skills to do them a favor, or two.\n\nThe game itself has some rough spots with polish. Not everything seems to be 100% hammered out, but the communication by the devs on the forums and responding & fixing bugs is superb and they are hammering though bugs rapidly. None of the issues I encountered were blockers, most were errors in dialog, statements out of order, certain experients to unlock new parts not being 100% clear, and generally just a feeling of not having the time/budget to do 100% of the bug testing. So I'm assuming they decided to do the last 10% with the cuminity. But none of these are anything I'd hold against the game, let alone use as justification to not get the game. It has a certain charm to it, and I find myself enjoying going through the content, trying to unlock new Goliath parts, laughing at some of the dialog, and generally just having fun.\n\nIf you do get the game and encounter any issues, I'd encourage you to let the dev's known on the forums so they can iron them out. I'd hate for anyone to miss out on what is an enjoying game because of poor feedback due to bugs that can be fixed.","May 15","true","20.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The game succeeds at entertaining its players by offering constant new areas, monsters, and NPCS! You are always upgrading your goliath which will keep you busy aswell! Overall, this games strong-point is its mechanics, and overall design.\n\n...and now the less enjoyable things. The game fails at many things, but I will not be harsh when doing this section of the review. Goliath was literaly released a few days ago. There are many bugs that are present in the game, and things that I would like to see added. I will have times where there are crashes one after another, and sometimes it will run smoothly. There is a lack of sounds coming from everything, the environment, combat, to opening the inventory and other simple things.\n\nAll of these things are to be expected from a newly released game, and I am happy to say that the devs communicate with their audience, and have released bug fixes / and other things that make the game smoother :).\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n\n1) I feel that there is also a lack of "storage" inside of your base.

So really, open world adventure fans.\n\nVideo Review:   https://youtu.be/WlZOBGyUtE8\n\nSummary:\nBuilding giant goliaths is a bunch of fun in the open world environment, even if the game needs a bit of WD40 sprayed on its joints. There's a child like fun you'll have exploring the environment and building new mechs that you can battle with, even if the combat is simple and not the most challenging. Crafting another spare part for your mech after completing its requirement was always a pleasure, and the story does a reasonable job of keeping you at least slightly entertained so that you ignore that you're doing a lot of the same things over and over again. A grind will develop, as most of these games end up having a grind of sorts, but I will admit that this game's one didn't seem to get me as much due to the game's themes: it's just so fun picturing yourself in a giant mech and bashing things in the head.  The game's big fault is its polish: it's rather rough around the edges in performance and engine execution, and could have used a bit of an overhaul of its inventory system (here's a hint: sorting options). And yet, the game had that X factor: the game feels different from others out there, and its theme alone will draw you in.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nYou're building giant mechs and battling in them. Do you really need more then that?\nCombat wise, it's simple but effect. Like the fact that elemental damage means a lot at times, and that certain Goliaths have strong weaknesses against certain enemy types, even though it's not a “true weakness”, but due to the Goliaths strengths.\nSome good humor. Plays off its own story rather well, and hits the meta rather well.\nCrafting system is straight forward and does the job. Like the fact that I didn't have to go out of my way to resource farm.\nLike the destruction of your goliaths. Can leave you scrambling to run away, and punishes you for not paying attention.\nControls for both the controller and the keyboard works.\nLike the spare parts system to customize your mech, and the requirements to unlock those parts being tied into achievements/quests.\nLength seems to be there. Believe I'm halfway throught the game at the 10-12 hour mark, which is reasonable for the price.\nNegatives:\nPerformance issues. You'll notice autosaves as they cause the game to significantly load.\nPrecision issues. Brings up prompts that aren't able to be activated unless you are at the right angle or distance. Will get annoying.\nAI is too dumb for its own good at times. Easy to exploit.\nCrafting menus and inventory management is not as streamlined as it should be. Having to go to multiple places and run around to craft can be a bit annoying. Needed a sort inventory feature.\nNatural Writing Flow feels foreign for the English translation, at least at times. Can feel awkward in presentation at times.\nA grind does develop, although it's not as bad as other games in the genre. It's still a little annoying.\nWhy do the weapons that equip to goliaths drop after a goliath is defeated? It's just annoying to keep on having to reequip.","May 13","true","12.5"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","13","19","0","0"

The art style and aesthetic of the game are A1 and right up my alley and the crafting system is intriguing. But It all depends on if the devs support this game. It definitely feels like this game is a work in progress. The framerate is laggy, the music cuts out abruptly with no segue and the combat feels weak. My biggest gripe is the combat, it feels like its missing sound assets that and theirs no weight behind it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/363520/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1509 products in account","Introduction\nGoliath is a traditional Action Adventure Survival game much like any other. You collect wood, stone and various other things lying around in order to survive. Unlike others, rather than building yourself a nice customized base of operations, you build yourself giant robots in order to survive!\n\nGameplay Impressions\nAfter a mysterious plane crash, you awaken to find yourself in a strange land. A brief attempt to explore your surroundings quickly results in your running for your life back to the safety of your burning wreckage. A giant beast has tried to attack you. You realize that in order to survive for any length of time in this strange place, you are going to have to become Iron Man. You speedily turn the wood you have collected into your very first suit, the Wood Goliath. The Wood Goliath is great, it is strong, it can heal in water… and it can really help you see where you are going at night when it catches fire and burns to ash. This burning aspect is something that is actually quite interesting. Not only do you need to avoid fire, you also need to worry about how hot the area you are occupying is. If you find yourself at high noon in a desert in a wooden Goliath, you will quickly find yourself in a useless burned to ashes Goliath. Luckily, the Stone Goliath thrives when it is hot. There are at least four main types of Goliaths you can build, each one having variants you can craft after completing the required experiments. Each of the main styles of Goliath have their advantages and disadvantages so you need to weigh your options when selecting which one you want to use. If you need a hand, you can actually craft and deploy additional Goliaths to help you in a tough fight.\n\nCrafting isn’t limited just to building the Goliaths though; you can craft and equip various weapons on the Goliaths. Some of them even have elemental effects that can really come in handy if used properly. In addition to weapons, you can also craft items. Some items allow you to craft new things and base upgrades, others will help you or your Goliath heal in battle, and there are those used as offensive weapons by strategically placing them on the ground.\n\nYou can actually play the game without using a Goliath. It really ramps up the difficulty in combat, but in general, it allows you to move around the map without drawing as much attention to yourself. Armed with only a pistol and cloaking device, you can creep around the map looting treasures guarded by hostile creatures. If you were to thump on up in a Goliath, you would easily incur their wrath, but on foot, you might just get out of there without them even knowing you were there!\n\nThe game itself involves multiple fragment worlds, each one consisting of its own biome. Each one is procedurally generated so if you replay the game, everything will look different. You move between these worlds using the teleporter in your base. As you quest for the various factions, you will be sent back and forth between multiple world fragments in order to complete their request. There are also dungeons to explore.\n\nGraphically, the game looks great. There is enough variety that each area does feel different from the last, even if it is based on the same basic biome theme. There are some graphical glitches that are common to procedurally generated games where you will encounter floating shrubs and trees, but this is not overly common. Enemies sometimes also get trapped inside of objects. One thing that I think was a really nice touch is that when you are thumping around in your giant Goliath, you smash small shrubs beneath your feet while on foot you do not. Also trees get pushed out of the way, causing them to bend to one side and then spring back into place once your Goliath (or any large creature) passes by it. The sounds in the game can be a bit understated and sometimes glitch off at times but it rarely is an issue. The music does help you get into the spirt of things though, and while I have read others mentioning that the Goliaths should sound heavier with more stated thuds as they walk, I feel that would get annoying fast, so I am glad they are understated.\n\nI do have a few complaints that I can’t go without saying. I generally have no issues with looking past minor graphical and sound issues to the point where I sometimes don’t even bother to mention them. One thing that can really get under my skin though is the camera. The default camera in this game, in my option, is bad. It doesn’t really offer you much in the way of control for it and really restricts your forward view. You get a nice ring around you and you can see all of that really nicely but you often run head first into a concentrated enemy area without even realizing it until it is too late. After struggling with the camera, I ended up editing the INI to change the camera angle myself. Once I did that, the view in this game was fantastic and no longer worthy of complaint. It felt so much better seeing much further forward with minimal rear view. Rather than a high floating camera that is placed slightly behind the character, I now have a much lower, more shoulder mounted view of the game. This is even more noticeable when on foot in comparison to being in a Goliath. For example, knowing there is a lake nearby I could spin in circles and never see it with the default camera, but could easily spot it with my modified one. Luckily I read the Developer is looking into the camera and plans to implement changes for it, so hopefully soon the editing of the INI file will no longer be necessary for me to enjoy playing it.\n\nAnother complaint I have is the fact that while the Developer knows what they are talking about or referring to, I often have no idea. To unlock new variants of a Goliath, you have to perform experiments. These experiments are basically performing a certain action to a certain unit often in a certain biome with a certain Goliath type. As an example, it has you killing 15 spitting (shooting) spiders with the Stone Goliath using only heavy blows. That one is pretty easy to figure out. I know what a spider is, and I can figure out if they are shooting stuff at me, that it is probably the right one. But most of the time, I have no idea what the creature looks like, or where I can find it in order to complete the experiment. This leads me to try randomly doing the required action on everything I encounter and then checking my progress for that experiment. That sounds simple enough, but the creature could be on any of the world fragments, it could be in multiple, might only be in one. I might not even have unlocked the area it is in yet! Some kind of tracker that points you in the right direction, or name labels or something would really help you figure out what you are doing. The Developers also stated they are looking into that as well. Lastly, other than the basic explanation at the start, you either have to learn everything by trial and error or by paying attention to the load screens.\n\nSome things only seem to work when using a game pad (or else I could never find the right key combination on the keyboard) while other things only seem to work when using the keyboard. You can’t use both at the same time as using one deactivates the other. For example, I can call up the map when playing with keyboard and mouse but can’t find it with the gamepad, and I can’t figure out how to put my Goliaths on auto-pilot other than with my gamepad. So I have to make a choice, map or assistance in battles. Either way, it would be nice if there was some indicator what the gamepad buttons stated on the loading screen translated to if using only the keyboard and mouse (much easier to aim with) or what the map button is when using a gamepad.\n\nIn conclusion, Goliath is a wonderful action adventure survival game with the unique twist of giant robots. If you are fan of survival games, you should definitely check out Goliath!","June 5","true","12.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I do not recommend it to anyone in the current state. Bad controls for camera and movement (sometimes), very bad sound-design and even worse quest-design.\n\nOverall\nYou are stranded on a shard of a world and have no memory of anything and start building a giant mech-suit. You want to get to your friend, that is stranded there, too, and have to overcome several barriers like getting to another shard via teleport and finding new mech-suits (Goliaths).\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics are decent and look nice, they certainly create the world in a good looking way. Running into trees and seeing them bop away is a nice sight. The camera angle can certainly be annoying in smaller spaces like dungeons and canyons.\n\nSounds\nThis is where mediocrity strikes the first time: The punches of the goliath sound bad, there is no impact. The sounds are dull and never inspire the sense of you fighting a real fight. The explosions are nice, though.\n\nControls\nThe fighting and moving is solid except for some instances. You can hit light or heavy or shoot a projectile so there is nothing much to do wrong. Some special attacks are a hassle since the camera is a bit wonky in tight spots and in dungeons. The movement would be good if it weren't for the objects placed around the maps that can stop you totally. It was common to be stuck in front of a tree stump or within some giant skeleton from an animal.\nThe camera itself could need some improvement. Maybe always look into the direction the goliath looks, that would be a good start. And if you have problems reading the map: The map changes based on the camera. Move the camera and the map will change, too. Not a good idea.\n\nStory\nSeems to be like an interesting story but it is too drawn out. Whatever they wanted to tell, they could do it in less time and add some other story. You have lost your memory and try to find a person. Along the way you find factions you "can" (aka have to) help in order to progress. Foreseeable and uninspired. Everything is presented in textform so you better like to read text, lots and lots of uninteresting text.\n\nQuests\nThose are of poor quality again. Most of the times you run from one place to another or have to teleport several times. Every teleport requires you to load a new area. Defeat this, gather that, like a MMORPG. Several times I found myself choosing an option, that should have had a negative outcome but instead, I completed the mission and that's that. One of the final missions, to reach a certain area, is particularly bad. At that point I just wanted to see through to the end and had to run from place to place, loading area after area, because every time it was at the wrong place (as intended by the story). Than, I had to build a device but instead of showing me every bit I need, it showed me only everything from one stage: Bring the first part, see what next is needed, bring the rest. This was frustratingly bad and drawn out like they wanted to add time to the game they clearly couldn't fill otherwise. Oh and on a sidenote: I was lucky to bring enough resources, since the text for the quest stated falsely 10 bars of meteorite instead of the 30 that are needed.\nBTW: Finding one quest giver in several locations is common. He is there even if the quest line is not that advanced, just standing there, waiting for you to help his twin until he is able to help you help him.\n\nFactions\nThere are several factions and they seem to be at war. This is something a help text says while loading and I had time to read this one over and over again. This war is never seen. There are no incursions, no real fights, nothing. It is bland and shallow. It is advised to help the faction you like the most so they can win the war .. which is non-existent. Helping them is something like: Teleport somewhere else, do something mildly interesting and return. Most of the time you will be staring at the loading screen. You can get faction-points also by simply finding stuff and giving it to them. Easy and less annoying since you find much of it while running around anyway. And that's it about the factions. No deep system, no war, no interesting stories, no interesting factions (the smiths that don't give you any special armor or weapons, the nature-lovers who don't do anything at all and a third one. I don't want to spoiler the third).\n\nEnemies\nThe enemies vary enough for my taste. There are alot of spiders running around, lizards and later on some robot animals and more. The bosses are laughably bad excluding the last one, that can kill you in seconds without you being able to hit the heal button fast enough. The worst enemy for me was the Stag. Atleast I think that's its name because I cannot see names and this makes finding the right ones to upgrade your goliaths .. annoying. The Stag can run at you and throw you back, doing lots of damage. Having two or more of them is a real threat. Most of the bosses I can stand close to, in Overdrive(damage increase) and they are dead after a short while. Your worst enemies are those that can throw you back or stun you. That's why those enemies are appearing more and more the further you progress.\n\nItems\nSince this is an ARPG there are several items for every goliath. Each goliath can use one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Since these can break, it could be good to keep a spare with you. But since the higher tier weapons you find loose so little of their durability, it is not worth it. As always, you can find the best stuff, not buy and why you can get someone that opens up a weapon shop that late in the game is beyond me, because you don't need him nor do you need something where you can create weapons.\nThe ranged weapons are a joke and only worth against very small, ranged enemies but since you are a bit slow while firing, you can easily get hit.\nMost of your inventory will be filled with junk or stuff you later need. The three chests you have in you basecamp are too small and everything only stacks up to 40. After several hours I had lots and lots of stacks and no use for them and it was always a hassle to sort through the inventory to see what I want to keep and what not. At the end I gave up and didn't care anymore, throwing out whatever I clicked on first.\n\nReplayability\nNone. You can get new Goliaths only after doing some main plot and getting some other goliaths forms like a stone goliath made of ice, you have to do stuff and find creatures, that are far away and you have to do the plot anyway. So there is the linearity of the plot and everything unfolds around it thus making it, that there is no change whatsoever. Starting with your wood goliath, you get your stone goliath, than it's iron and lastly crystal.\nEven if the terrain is random and what monster types, it is always the same way and this can work for some games, not for this.\n\nVerdict\nThere are even more things to add but those can be updated away. I still hope, that they continue and improve but right now I'm only frustrated and let down. I bought it even though I knew about the bad sound-design but this game is even worse than everything I have read about it. The worst crime although is the quest-design. I can forgive too small chests or some annoying controls but that attempt at humor that totally fails and those nonsensical stories is too much.\n\nBuy at own risk. I do not recommend it!\n\nRackhim\n\nSome hints for the developer:\n- Make it so that when you craft something in your base, that the things in your chests are useable.\n- Increase the stack number up to maybe 100 or more.\n- Let the factions have some soul, make them fight in other territories, maybe a strategic map?\n- Add replayability. Let me earn a different goliath through other means, by collecting 1000 wood or something.\n- Rebalance ranged weapons. In fact, take out half the weapons and create a clearer difference\n- Open up slot for goliath from the start","May 15","false","13.8"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","8"

That being said, it is obvious that not everything is implemented just yet; the animation and textures could be brushed up, and the music needs a bit more Oomph! For example, I would really like the music to fit what the title screen has, this thumping, bass-heavy tune of impending poundage while in combat and maybe a jolly thumping while walking through a forest (again, just for examples). I like the design of the giants, as in my let's play I noted how much I loved the way the wooden giant actually looks like the Iron Giant (my favorite mech of all time), and the design overall. The differing moves between each goliath is cool, as well as the differing attributes (the nimble wood goliath vs. the bulky stone goliath). A better differing, at least between those two I mentioned, would be having the wood goliath be more visibly swift and fast in attacks while the stone goliath can pull large and heavier swings while being a bit slow. The dialogue is witty and gave me a few chuckles (especially the rats), and while it gives little to no choices, it does seem to poke fun at current rpgs. Really, the rpg function comes from constructing and customizing the goliaths, unlocking new parts and creating awesome weapons to decimate foes! Already, the dev is pumping out bug fixes, which hopefully means that bugs people are encountering will disappear quickly and this game will then begin to look better and better by the update. :) If you want to enjoy the ride and the changes this game will come with, I suggest buying it. If you wish to wait, then follow this game and/or put it on your wishlist, cuz this game is already looking good. :D","May 13","true","3.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Sorry, GOLIATH. This will serve for a while as you are led through a fairly decently done tutorial. I quickly learned in this game that not only are there power up weapons designed for each type and style of goliath, but that there are also upgrades and new versions of each one that can be unlocked through levelling, completing specific tasks, or through the narrative of the game. The controls are basic but functional and designed to fit the game in a fairly intuitive fashion and the gameplay itself is also basic but surprisingly fun and entertaining. Coupling the crafting mechanics for creating new goliaths with a top-down shooter was actually a good match up here.\nThe graphics are decently serviceable, but also nothing to really write home about. I do say quite often thought hat good graphics do not a great video game make. The graphics here are good enough to do what the developers were wanting to do here and it actually lends a certain basic charm to the game."\n\nAll in all I found this game charming, well designed, and very enjoyable! The Single player aspect is worth the price at launch by itself. The Co-op and versus Multiplayer is simply icing on the cake!\n\nSee my full critique here:\nhttps://youtu.be/r_1z0yILKaM","May 25","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I've followed it since kickstarter or even before that, can't quite remember... anyway, for a long time.\nI've gotten for a key for the purpose of making a review which is still being written as we speak. So... what can I say about Goliath?\n\nWell... It might be slightly unpolished but I get that. The kickstarter was unsuccesfull so they had limited funds and it shows. The animations are far from perfect, there are occasional bugs (haven't encountered any game-breaking ones) and there is no voice acting. However, I still find the game quite enjoyable and very fun to play. The combat is fluid, the variation of goliaths is huge (first I only thought there were 10 different parts so I was like... not bad. You imagine my surprise when I unlocked stone goliaths) and the crafting sistem is nicely done.\n\nTo add to that, the developers have stated that they will continue to polish the game and fix the bugs, which deserves certain praise. Some developers simply abandon their game when it releases. I reccomend picking up the game, the price is not that high and the amount of content you get for it is huge.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay, I'm including a let's play video, however it is NOT IN ENGLISH but Slovene.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qnFRCiICOQ","May 15","true","10.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Graphically attractive enough, suits the overall mood of the game. Audio feels a bit hollow in general and combat especially. The meat of the game is really quite fun and entertaining. Equal parts rpg, crafting, and exploration. Some these areas being stronger than other, however, if any of these aspects aren't your cup of tea, don't let it dissuade you. I really like Mech's, especially quirky one's like these and the game does a good job of forcing you to utilize the many different types and sub-types to take advantage of your scenario or unlock new things. Story's definitely not AAA, but at least there is one and adds some filler to why you're doing the things you do. Overall good game, best in 1 or 2 hour spurts rather than you're go-to play for long stretches game. 7/10","May 18","true","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Still some frame rate glitches during special moves, but all in all, much easier to play. Thanks to the devs, who increasd the stack limit of your inventory. Can't wait for more updates!\n\nEDIT: (5/132016)\n\nSo the devs were able to patch the game quickly. I've been playing it for about and hour and it hasn't crashed once. Stil, some fine tuning would be appreciated. There is stll some disconnect between strikes and hits. The devs addressed the problem where the player doesnt have any sound effect for attacking, but the sound effect for contact on the enemy is either unsynced or does'nt trigger at all. Also, since I assume that chaining combos among the goliaths in your loadout is a big part of battle, they could make the transitions more fluid control-wise. I have to wait for a combo attack to finish in completion before I can bring up  the submenu for changing goliaths, which breaks the flow of my control inputs, because I'm spamming the LB button (It could just also be my controller, but I've never had this problem with other games). On a more subjective note, I think there should also be a lot more storage space. You have the three chests in your camp, but each hold only 16 slots a piece. Inventory in this game is done so that each item has a cap limit per slot in your inventory, before it takes another slot. I'm used to this game play, its a lot like Diablo of old, but in a crafting game it feels very restricting and, honestly, very stressful playing when I dont remember if I have enough space in my chestas for something while I'm out farming for drops. I could also, just be part of the game difficulty, thats why I lead with stating that the inventory issue was more personal.\n\nAll-in-all, Goliath is still really fun to play, but I still feel like the devs need to work on the the technical issues I mentioned above. I would gladly, change my review to positive after. The inventory thing is just something that the devs can think about.\n\n\nORIGINAL: (5/12/2016)\n\nGreat game, but a work-in-progress. The game play is fun, like any other crafting-survival-sandbox game, except in this one you get to build robots. There are still a lot of minor bugs and tweaks that the devs should work on in order to make this game feel complete, combat sound effects for instance (or the lack thereof).

While base Goliath types (Wood, Stone, etc etc) are unlocked based on story progress, there are a number of additional subtypes unlocked by "Experimentation" or, simply certain kinds of goals, be they kill monster types, player level, or something else, which change many of the benefits or penalties of the base type, available as new parts for your Goliaths.\n\nMusic is decent, if nothing memorable.\nStory and writing is decent, with the style being one to not take itself too seriously.\n\nNow that most of the launch bugs have been fixed, many of the gameplay issues addressed, this action-survival game is alot of good fun.\nThe only touchy issue I currently experience is some noticeable frame lag from time to time, it isn't constant however, and now that we've seen that the developers are doing a great job communicating with their community and addressing issues, it's a good sign for the game.\n\nWill most definately be spending more time with this game, as it's quite good fun now.\n\nOriginal Post:\nA game I attempted to back in their failed Kickstarter, shows much the same potential it did then, sadly a slew of bugs and gameplay issues prevent it from being great fun.\n\nCurrent issues experienced in my short play time so far:\n- Harvesting is... problematic at best, clicking to harvest doesn't work most of the time making this essential gameplay mechanic a highly irritating chore.\n- Aiming often goes nowhere near where you think it is with gamepad, while less an issue, still a frown maker when a gunshot heads in the opposite direction of the cursor targeting said creature\n- Straight up CTD without error message when using the teleport stones can really destroy the interest of a gameplay session.\n\nWill return to revise my review when they fix they the bugs, after which it shows much promise in it's action-rpg-survival style gameplay.
