Kinda similar to risk, but really freaking easy. There is a list of things wrong with it however: Window is not resizable, controls are somewhat obfuscated, they're only really relayed by the loading screens between games, and the game has no real menus, including no start menus.\n\nWhile it does have it's problems, it is still pretty fun, and it's technical problems don't make the game unplayable in any way (it's hard to break a TBS) It's worth playing for a bit, but probably not with playing for very long without some content and technical updates.","April 22","true","5.1"," 49 of 58 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","49","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/recommended/444250/","cussbrother","A WINDSHIELD WIPER","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cussbrother/","861 products in account","A simplistic and slightly buggy game that absolutely feels like the jam-game (a game created in a short amount of time, usually in a distracting party environment) it is.\n\nFor starters, clicking doesn't quite work right. Sometimes clicks just won't register, other times the hit detection just doesn't quite align with the displayed cursor. Managing to mess up the act of pointing a mouse and clicking on things - something that's been handled with grace and relative aplomb since approximately the mid-1980s - is bad enough, but in a game consisting mostly of clicking it's borderline unforgivable.\n\nThere's an RNG element which is utterly frustrating - sometimes you'll waste an entire turn trying to attack an undefended territory and repeatedly losing, then watch the AI attack one of your fortified strongholds and capture it on the first try. RNG absolutely *can* spice things up when used sparingly, but this game offers no real strategic choices to mitigate the RNG. You can't choose between a high risk / high reward or low risk / low reward technique, and territories don't have any form of a hitpoint system, so attacking multiple times isn't necessarily going to chip away at a wall of defenses. You're basically just rolling a d6 and if it's 2 or higher you win, or natural 6 to capture a fortified territory.\n\nFurthermore, because of the RNG and simplistic (as in "virtually non-existent") strategic element, the broader game quickly collapses into which side manages to capture the most territory on the first turn. More territory = more money = more attacks = more territory. Sure, that's the basic gist of every 4X game and RTS on the planet, but - for example - in Civilization I can place cities in better territory for defense and economic bonuses, and easily hold back an opponent with twice as many cities in poor locations. In Starcraft, I can use recon to see an enemy is weak against air, and focus my research and unit creation into air units, making the best of what may be a bad situation and eventually turning the tables. Hell, even old-school DOTA (even before all the comeback mechanics) wasn't quite as much of a snowball as this game - and nothing is more tedious than playing out the last few turns when you're in an unwinnable situation, or even the last few turns when the enemy has just one territory left and you can't tickle the RNG into giving you your justly-earned victory.\n\nIt's single-player only, and the AI is about as bland as it gets. You don't see certain opponents prioritize defensive fortifications and others going for larger acquisition - it's just a cacophony of attacks and random tile improvements. It's the worst sort of AI - not smart enough to bother planning ahead for, and even worse, not predictably dumb enough to manipulate.\n\nTo top it off, there's seemingly no options menu, which means you're stuck listening to the bland and repetitive music throughout the experience. It's a bit like the songs in a Koei game from the SNES era, except far shorter and far, far more repetitive. No full-screen option either - hell, you can't even change your character color away from blue.\n\nAll in all it reminds me of the "games" that might be bundled with a Linux distro ten years ago - sort of a tile-based Liquid War, except Liquid War had more map variety and, hell, you could even change your color and name.\n\nIt's free and I think it's still a little bit overpriced.","April 24","false","0.3"," 49 of 85 people (58%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","58","49","85","15","12"

Others have mentioned that the interface is a little irritating at times with clicks on countries not always registering.  Honestly, not that big of a deal but I can see how it may frustrate some people.  My biggest problem with this game is the AI is not that intelligent. Once you understand how the game works it becomes mindlessly easy.  The AI tends to spend a lot of money on buildings while you are sweeping up huge swaths of land, at which point you have large amounts of money coming in and you can quickly dominate the board.  The AI also tends to focus on small border enemies and completely ignores you while you build a massive empire.  There seems to be some kind of animosity mechanic in the game where if you don't attack another player, they will generally leave you alone until they have to attack you because you're the only one left, or there is no other way for them to expand.  I have found that, generally, it is best to just ignore building anything and focus on grabbing as much land as possible.  Then use your increased income to crush your enemies.  Several people have said this game is like Risk.  Anyone saying that has never played Risk before.  This game has little in common with Risk.\n\nBasically a fun little game to play around with but it gets old fairly fast.","April 27","true","5.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

You'll get 30-60 minutes out of it, depending on how well you play.\n\nThere is RNG, but it's not as bad as all the negative reviewers are saying, and even if you do get a bout of bad RNG, you can quickly restart the map by hitting "R", meaning there's not much downtime if something screws up. I'd say that in the 75 maps, there's about 5 that I felt the RNG was actively against me from the start, but after you get the ball rolling, it's rarely an issue.\n\nMy biggest complaint with this game is the lack of viable strategies. on large connected maps, the best strategy is just zerg rushing the AI and grabbing as much land as possible, ignoring buildings. On smaller island maps, you simply need to build villages on every piece of land you have held for longer than 1 turn. There's no reason to go for upgrades or forts, and usually, by the time you're going for fleets, you can just throw them at your enemies because you have so much income.","April 22","true","2.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The gameplay is so simple that it largely feels random, with victory only a practical option because the AI is so clueless.  The actual game mechanics are hidden, making it feel even more random. It might be a nice, relaxing game, but the bugs make it frsutrating.  Clicking only erratically works; the region flashes, so I know the game recognizes the click, but the command doesn't work.  Clicking on the tiny lake in the middle of the region cancels your current action, requiring you to reselect it. As far as I know, there are no keyboard shortcuts for the 5 actions; there certainly aren't any tooltips.  The game can't (usefully) be run full screen, meaning my aging eyes are squinting to see what's going on in a relatively small window at 1920x1080.\n\nWith some bug fixes and UI polish, I would recommend this as a relaxing time waster, especially if it remains free. In its current state, I cannot recommend it.","April 22","false","1.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

As a free game, and an entertaining way to spend at least a few minutes, it is hard to not recommend it.\n\nIt just isn't a well-designed game.  By design, it is a simply strategy title.  You gain gold based on the territory that you hold, and spend gold to attempt to capture enemy territories.  Whether or not your attempt succeeds comes down to random chance.  Unfortunately, the game is so simple that it is ruled by that random chance.\n\nYou can neither shift the odds of battle nor mitigate risk.  You cannot build superior force short of stockpiling gold in order to launch successive separate attempts.  While the game later introduces more factors, at its core there are few strategic decisions to be made.  That minimal strategy ultimately means nothing when results are entirely random, where the difference between taking three territories in a single turn and failing to take any territory for three turns straight is entirely random chance.\n\nCrown and Council, at its core, takes the chance-based gameplay of titles like Risk and Dice Wars and increases the random nature further.\n\nOn more technological matters, there is no ability to resize the game window.  If your vertical resolution is around 768 (such as with laptops or even smaller desktop monitors), then the Windows taskbar will cover the button used to end your turn.  You either have to move your taskbar to the side (revealing the button), or maximize the game window (revealing the top few clickable pixels of the button) to proceed.","April 23","false","4.2"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","0"

I'll list some pros and some cons, hopefully Mojang will take note and maybe we'll one day get a real strategy game from them, since this is a promising little game.\n\nPros:\n-It's simple, so you'll get the hang of it in a game or so.\n-It's quite fun to just conquer lands.\n-Adds stuff every map, so it gets a little more interesting and complicated every round.\n\nCons:\n- it feels like 40-60% of mouse clicks aren't registering. Frequently have to click multiple times just to end the turn or perform any action.\n- I wish the maps would get bigger than they are!\n- maybe a little too simplistic. The real fun part of a strategy game is usually being able to jump in a random game and get going, and have a different experience every time.\n- you can replace a fort on a tile with a city (for reference, Fort strengthens defenses and costs 3 gold, city doubles income and costs 2) but it didn't make it clear to me. I had hoped I could build both, so you can worsen your chances if you don't realize and end up spending 5 gold thinking you just 'upgraded' a tile.\n\nSo in short, it's interesting and for free you should definitely look at it. But I'd love for Mojang to at least fix the bugs, ideally look at what they could improve, since I wouldn't mind paying if we got a full-fledged little strategy game.","April 22","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now you get more gold by capturing neighboring nations and holding them, in fact it takes a turn before they start producing gold for you.\n\nHowever producing gold is all they do, they confer no bonuses to attack or defense, no price reduction in actions, there is no way to affect the outcome of an action, the game gives you fortifications you can place which supposedly increase one's defensive capabilities, but in a game powered strictly by RNG with no skill involved these fortifications mean little when they can fall in a single action and an empty node can stand the test of time and weather an entire turn worth of actions.\n\nAs I said previously, there is no strategy, there is no thought to this game (either in production or playing), the game is essientially a clicker game, just keep clicking nodes you don't own and eventually you'll win\n\nPros\nNone\n\nCons\n*Terrible Music and repeditive sound effects quickly become irritating within minutes of starting.\n*Terrible controls, yes thats right a mouse driven game with terrible controls.

The art style didn't bother me in the least, in fact I rather liked it. But that's where my joy and pleasure ended. In the short time I played this game it was clear what it was going to be. About 50% of my clicks didn't register correctly, forcing me to redo certain actions...thus slowing the gameplay down. And when they did work it was pure RNG. There is no actual logic why an attack is a success or failure. What's even more irritating is what could take me 3, 4 or even 5 attacks to take over an enemy tile/space but the computer could do so with single attacks. There are no stats to read. No system of "you have x amount of attack power while this title has x number of defence". There is no strategy to the game. It's just click until you're out of gold. Maybe toss an added tower here and there (which rarely seems to make a difference).\n\nThe combat is simply decided with RNG, an RNG system that seems to favour the computer at all times. You have 20 gold to work with? Enjoy those 3 new spaces. Computer only has 10 gold? Well they get to have 5 new spaces (including the 3 you just took). Logically with double the resources I should be the stronger force. But since this game doesn't have logic built into it...it makes no difference. It's pure luck.\n\nIs it free? Sure, which is cool and all. But free doesn't always equal fun.","April 24","false","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

But I expect it to accomplish basically functioning gameplay.\n\nPROS:\n+ It has a neat soundtrack\n+ It is easy to understand and to play\n\nCONS:\n- It is repetitive and gets boring very quickly\n- It has pretty much no strategic content or gameplay (yet calls itself a strategy game)\n--- It is COMPLETELY based on RNG and Luck. It doesn't matter if you are a damn military computer or the world record holder of the lowest IQ point quota ever scored: If RNGesus isn't with you, some levels are completely impossible.\n\nHere, a little example:\nI own 3 counties with towers, my enemy 5 without. I attack with all of my 5 gold, all attacks fail. My enemy defeats and conquers my counties in 3 attacks straight.\n\nAnother example:\nThe first water level (the one that introduces fleets). I actually got stuck at this level.\n\nI manage to conquer 6 counties after 7 turns and built a tower on each of them. The other three AI's conquer all my counties first try in that very round. Game over. Try again.\nAnd again.\nAnd yet again.\nAnd- you know the drill now.\n\nIf you are patient enough to try and try and try the same level over and over again to hope for a little, tiny, puny help of RNGesus, this game is perfect for you. If you aren't, welcome to the club. This game aswell fails to deliver another aspect it promises, fast pace, as the quarrels can turn out to become rather long, when (and this is no exaggeration) for 23 rounds straight, there have been !!!2!!! successful fights.\n\nI am actually very sorry that I have to rate this game so negatively. With a bit of tweaking, adding more (or rather any) strategic aspects, a little more diversity in gameplay and especially not a pure focus on RNG, this little game might actually become a nice little timekiller. At this point however: Pure RNG-Frustration and low entertainment value.","April 23","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And for the first few minutes it is. But as soon as you play for more than half an hour or so, it becomes clear that this game needs some fundamental tweaking in order to not be mind-meltingly frustrating. I got stuck for over half an hour on one level because the RNG appears to be genuinely random, or favoring the enemy characters. As soon as I got a foothold, I immediately lost it, and was back to square one. Because the game is so simple, especially on that particular map, winning is almost completely random because there isn't any real way to play more skillfully than the computer. At least in the first couple levels, when there aren't that many different units to use, I figure the game needs to give the player an edge so they can actually win at some point and go on to something more complicated that is actually challenging instead of based completely on chance. If not for this aspect, I would totally reccomend this game.","April 24","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You could at least add some start option to help us out here... I have solved the problem myself by putting the taskbar to the right of my screen.\nAfter fixing that problem, I started playing. The first 2 levels were great, but easy. The boat level brought the RNG part to me in a real fashion. I was never able to get any area of the map to myself and then only had one piece of land left to work with. The AI didn't care about that and fought against itself. When I tried attacking their forts (I only had 1 viable boat per turn) I never got any attack to actually destroy anything. But as soon as the AI came to my fort after 5 rounds, it attacked me twice and I was done. The AI had so much money there was no chance for me to stop anything. the realest bull about it then was that the AI just played on for the next 10 minutes, rolling its dices and having repetitive play. I closed the game down to stop it. There is no main menu, there are no settings, there's no way to change the resolution ofthe game to make it compatible with the screen without replacing the taskbar. There are too many flaws for me to give a good rating here.\n\nI know Mojang games are mostly released during development and things can happen there.

For me it has this "just one more round" feeling to it. You have minor tactical options, e.g. where you place your forts to strengthen your frontline and have to forsee how to spend your cash most efficient. Oh and it features local MP too, which is always nice. A lot of actions are RNG based, but this is how things are done in a jam game, where there isn't much time to develop deep alternatives/tactics/routes.\n\nCONTROLS 2/5\nThe (mouse)controls are really wonky, sometimes the game does not respond to my clicks and I have to keep clicking the same icon to have my action carried out.\n\nMUSIC & SOUND 3/5\nI enjoy the relaxing music that didn't get old in the 1.3 hours I have played so far. The sound effects are fitting and give a good overview over the action that is currently carried out.\n\nVISUALS 4/5\nI like the pixel artstyle. The green player is hard to distinct from unconquered ground sometimes and I wish there was an option to play fullscreen.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\nIt's an easy to understand turn-based strategy game. The ressource management is boiled down to gathering gold via conquering ground and to place various buildings the most efficient way on the newly won space. Each fight you start costs a bit of gold. There are offensive (fleet, army) and defensive units/buildings (forts, villages, universities). The universities give you research points, which you can use to upgrade said units, but also occupy precious space you might need for other purposes (to gather money for example). So it's constant cost-benefit analysis, which i like. The game is randomly generated and comes with pre build 75 maps, but you can generate some on your own. I imagine the local multiplayer mode to be great fun, but I haven't had the chance to test it yet.\n\nI think the game is fun to play, if you are not into micromanagement in strategy games. If you are, don't touch this game and rather blow the dust of some old SSI classics.","May 8","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal of the game is to conquer your enemies by attacking them in a risk-like fashion where a random roll done behind the scenes decides whether or not the money you have spent on attacking is successful.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much to say about this game. The levels are randomly generated and range from large maps with lots of land to conquer, to small maps with only a few islands.\n\nI would say the game is fun to play for a short time, but gets boring quite quickly. The best way I can describe the experience would be to say... imagine playing Risk many times again and again and again in a short time. Sure, Risk is fun, but there isn't much to it. After a while it gets a little stale.\n\nSo I'm giving this game 6/10. It's not really anything new, but it is cute and it's also free, which means if you're looking for something to kill time that doesn't cost anything, I see nothing wrong with recommending this game to you.\n\n~ Kyle","May 15","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It contains a little bit of everything: tactics, economy, stationing, improvement for units and buildings, reckless attack and indestructible defense.\nIt has a few flaws due to the simplicity, the largest of which are: battle results are calculated randomly (so you can capture a few castles in a row, but fail to capture an empty area with five armies) and AI constantly start fighting with each other, if you do not attack them (even if you have more than any other territories and can destroy them all after a couple of days).\nResult: easy game to feel yourself like a strategist and conqueror for those who do not like difficult to mastering strategy games or who just want to spend a little time for a tactical game.","April 30","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The goal of the game is to conquer your enemies by attacking them in a risk-like fashion where a random roll done behind the scenes decides whether or not the money you have spent on attacking is successful.\n\nUnfortunately there isn't much to say about this game. The levels are randomly generated and range from large maps with lots of land to conquer, to small maps with only a few islands.\n\nI would say the game is fun to play for a short time, but gets boring quite quickly. The best way I can describe the experience would be to say... imagine playing Risk many times again and again and again in a short time. Sure, Risk is fun, but there isn't much to it. After a while it gets a little stale.\n\nSo I'm giving this game 6/10. It's not really anything new, but it is cute and it's also free, which means if you're looking for something to kill time that doesn't cost anything, I see nothing wrong with recommending this game to you.\n\n~ Kyle","May 15","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun and challenging once you get through the "teaching levels" and for the low low price of nothing it's a must play. It would work wonders on mobile devices, but on PC is still great.\n\nLong review: It's not as unfair as some people are pointing out. The random number generator (RNG) looks wild at first but once you get to the complex gameplay it really shines. It's a shame the game doesn't do a really good job of telling you it's just teaching you on the first level because it's kind of confusing. Once you get to the real boards it catches you offguard when the AI wipes you out and you realize it is you fault not the RNG. Managing your space becomes way more important and you start thinking twice. I'll be playing this from time to time.

The CPU players also aren't very good which just makes it boring even faster.\n\nThe begining of the game does feel good when you're deciding which part of the map you could strategically get and hold on to.\n\nFun little thing for about 20min, when features get added (spoiler there aren't a lot). Then you figured it out. No one would be talking about this if it wasn't a Mojang game.","April 24","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's fun and challenging once you get through the "teaching levels" and for the low low price of nothing it's a must play. It would work wonders on mobile devices, but on PC is still great.\n\nLong review: It's not as unfair as some people are pointing out. The random number generator (RNG) looks wild at first but once you get to the complex gameplay it really shines. It's a shame the game doesn't do a really good job of telling you it's just teaching you on the first level because it's kind of confusing. Once you get to the real boards it catches you offguard when the AI wipes you out and you realize it is you fault not the RNG. Managing your space becomes way more important and you start thinking twice. I'll be playing this from time to time. Nice job Mojang!\n\nPS:I'd LOVE to be able to play this with friends a multiplayer version would really do this game well.

The lack of a quit-game option.  If you end up getting eliminated early or find yourself in an inevitably losing situation(which will frequently happen due to the game mechanics), you are limited to exiting and restarting the game, or waiting for the AI to play it out rather than having an option to exit to the 'menu' and start a new match.\n\nThe other key problem with the game, is the issues with the battle mechanics.  There is a complete lack of transparency regarding territory and unit capabilities.  If there was some indicator, like with an army "xx% chance of success" or a defensive value of X on a territory, the feel of being at the mercy of an RNG would be satisfied.  There is nothing wrong with high or low odds of success, but not knowing those odds is extremely frustrating.","April 23","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The smaller thing, though still quite annoying, is the interface. Clicking often doesn't work, and I'm constantly having to re-select what action I want to do.\n\n2. The bigger thing is that there is a degenerate strategy: just attack with armies when possible, and fleets otherwise. Oh, there is a little bit of tactics when you take territories in order to discourage the AI from going a certain direction, since it prefers to attack neutral countries. And you sometimes can and should build cities and castles when you don't have the resources to attack. But the technology investment, as far as I can tell, is worthless, because if you spend money on the tech buildings (are they cathedrals?

The random generation and RNG nature of attacking territory often puts you in unwinable scenarios.\n\nCase in point:\nI'm currently stuck on one where you start in an Island with 3 gold no possible actions on the first turn. Meanwhile the enemy factions all start on better terms. Two of them statrt with massive land surrounding them and the last one while starting in an island it does posses a patch of land nearby that it can take from the start turn.  So far the same faction wins all the games (Red) And its not due to strategy is pretty much down to the fact that none of my attempts to capture land with the boat have succeded in 10+ attempts costing me both money and the second turn, If I wait another turn the Green faction always cuts you off then the Red proceeds to grab everything with sheer money.\n\nIts not unwinable though, once I finally manage to capture a foothold on the main territory the map can theorethically be won but not before RNGesus decides to grant me 2 good rolls in a row on the second and third turns. Does that sound like stategy to you?\n\nDespite this I do recommend you download and play the game, its free and it could get patched in the future to curb this sort of scenario.","April 25","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The castles have a completely random amount of health - seems to be anywhere between 1 and 10 - which makes any kind of strategy almost completely impossible.  The animations are clunky, meaning you will try to execute several actions and only a third of them will actually occur.  So many things about this game are random, and everything that is random is hidden from the player.\nIn summary: this game looks like a cute, casual strategy game, but it is actually an infuriating ♥♥♥♥fest where the odds are stacked against the player and dice are rolled constantly behind the player's back.","April 23","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Capturing a territory is a random chance, so you can even fail to capture unguarded territory. There are also RNG plagues and rebellions.

The random generation and RNG nature of attacking territory often puts you in unwinable scenarios.\n\nCase in point:\nI'm currently stuck on one where you start in an Island with 3 gold no possible actions on the first turn. Meanwhile the enemy factions all start on better terms. Two of them statrt with massive land surrounding them and the last one while starting in an island it does posses a patch of land nearby that it can take from the start turn.  So far the same faction wins all the games (Red) And its not due to strategy is pretty much down to the fact that none of my attempts to capture land with the boat have succeded in 10+ attempts costing me both money and the second turn, If I wait another turn the Green faction always cuts you off then the Red proceeds to grab everything with sheer money.\n\nIts not unwinable though, once I finally manage to capture a foothold on the main territory the map can theorethically be won but not before RNGesus decides to grant me 2 good rolls in a row on the second and third turns. Does that sound like stategy to you?\n\nDespite this I do recommend you download and play the game, its free and it could get patched in the future to curb this sort of scenario.","April 25","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
