With each game there are a bunch of missions to complete and things to blow up. The graphics in these games are old school. The shooting in the games can get frustrating at times because you might get headshot from a AI that you can't see. Just take each level slow and steady and for the most part you can kill enemies really far away since there is no bullet drop. The missions can also get frustrating since if you fail something in the mission you might be put right back at the beginning of the level and might rage quit because it was hard to get to a certain point. Just remember quick save and save alot while playing to avoid frustration. The online portion of these games are still alive, but you might have to go looking in some of these Delta Force games. Ive really enjoyed playing these classics from beginning to end and I know you will too if you are a army buff and enjoy a good old fashion First Person Shooter.","April 2, 2011","true","7.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I cant explain it. I first started playing this game once it first came out. As being a DF/DF2/DFLW vet, I instantly enjoyed it. I made a few clans and went by the name with weird writing "Prophet" and was in/made several successful clans such as x1ABE and several others with a fellow old friend of mine I met ingame. I have had couple hundred hours of game play, same as my brother. I started young and was attached to this game! I cant explain how much pwnage I dished out with my M60e mowing through church walls and small walls killin people all day. or my silenced m4. ♥♥♥♥ I MISS THIS GAME. BUY IT NOW!

Using the Delta Force brandname and the Land Warrior engine, this game was rushed out the gate in order to capitalize on the invasion of Afghanistan. Not only is the game buggy and unpolished, but missions are ridiculously unrealistic and manage to incorporate many common myths and misconceptions about the conflict, thanks to the low standards of research that went into rushing the game. Definitely the low point of the series.","April 30","false","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Kinda wish they made it a bit more clear on the objective like Land Warrior. But i'll still recommend it. And like Land Warrior, i cant guarantee any multiplayer.","January 28, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Many of the bugs are fixed and patched and the game feels as if it is a more completed experience overall. It also has one feature that made this Delta Force stand out from the crowd. Allowing you to choose which military organization you wish to be affiliated with. It doesn't change anything about the game but allowing you have some uniqueness to your character makes the stand out.","July 28, 2015","true","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I honestly think this is an amazing game. Wonderful grpahics, weapons are plentiful. Missions are always unpredictable.\n\nIts straight to the point and easy to get use to. This game is based on the events of 2001 terrorism attacks in Afghanistan. Everything is so real. I don't care what anyone else thinks. I love this game I play heaps of this at night.\n\nIf you are true Supporter of DELTA FORCE the series. This is a great game to have in your collection. Before COD and Battlefield, Delta Force was around. I am very happy Steam recognises Delta Force as a serious combat game.\n\nI hope to see more games from NOVALOGIC in the future.\n\nThis is the game which defines military  FPS. This game is for real players, not arcade style like COD.\n\nDELTA FORCE TASK FORCE DAGGER = AWESOMENESS. 10/10","December 31, 2014","true","14.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not much improvement in the graphics side of things. And I'm sure by 2002 the visuals look kinda of dated compared to games like Splinter Cell really pushing the standard back then. The guns still look like sprites and there's no good relead animation. It's just a simple animated sprite that goes below the screen and back with a sound. Gameplay is quite basic...you just run around and kill anything that gets in your way. The only reason I would recommend this is because of the price. Go for it if liked Delta Force: Land Warrior","June 19, 2014","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
