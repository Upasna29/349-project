"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freddiegibbsesgn/recommended/203770/","freddiegibbsesgn","BearDownChicagoBearsHo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freddiegibbsesgn/","351 products in account","Crusader Kings 2 is a complex grand strategy game.  The most complicated game I've ever played. Be prepared to spend hours and I mean hours confused as hell, looking at youtube, the wiki and forums.   Once it clicks though, it's awesome.  Not for everyone, but its kinda like playing through 'real life' Game of Thrones (there's a game of thrones mod too).\n\nYou control a land owning character starting on any date between 1066 and 1453 AD (The Old Gods DLC will push this starting date back to 867 if you wish).  You can start as a powerful emperor or a lowly count.  The map you play on is more or less Europe stretching into parts of Asia and Africa.  Your sole goal in the game is to keep your bloodline going (and I believe holding land).  Other than that, there isn't a win screen, there aren't defined goals, its open ended, you play until 1453AD and then the game ends (save exportable to Europa Universalis 4 to continue your game with the purchase of a DLC).  You get a 'score', but that is just a rough estimate on how prestigious and pious your bloodline was.  It's quite possible to have 400 years of super rewarding gameplay without getting a high score.  This is a trend you will see me developing on and is a big part of what makes CKII so awesome.\n\nThat's kinda hard to grasp, but it is less awkward than it sounds.  The goals sort of present themselves naturally.  You don't often sit there with no idea what to do (again, once you understand the game), you kind of always have something you're working towards.  For a first time player this is usually just become as powerful as possible, i.e. aquire land, become a king, then become an emperor and expand your empire.  If you're an advanced player you can set your own crazy goals, roleplay, or do other things to spice up the game.\n\nThe game runs in 'real time', with a day going by a few times a minute on normal speed.  You can fast forward and pause.  Most of the time you will indeed be going through various menus.  Arranging marriages, keeping tabs on powerful families, plotting assinations, acquiring territory through political shennigans, keeping your subjects happy, bringing in powerful characters to tutor the children of the realm and hold office, and much more.  You can micromanage to your hearts content, play a more hands off style, or switch between the two.\n\nWhen combat breaks out, it is done by moving stacks of armys around the campaign map, meeting an opposing army will cause a battle.  These really just compose of watching numbers go down, and kills go up, so if you're looking for Total War style combat you arent going to get it here.  Don't be fooled though, many times I've been on the edge of my seat watching these numbers change.  The combat system is quiet nuanced as well. To be the most effective you have many things to consider. Terrain bonuses, attrition penalties, appointing competant commanders from your realm, and more add depth.\n\nIn all I highly recommend this game to anyone who has played something like Civ or Total War and fancy themself a strategy gamer, is looking for a challenege, and has a lot of patience.  This is kinda the next step you can take into something quite a bit more complicated.  That is the path I took into the game am loving it.\n\nThe game is still actively having expansions and patches developed for it as of the writing of this review 11/25/2013.\n\nFull disclosure:  Your reviewer has not quite finished a playthrough yet but am close.  I have 120 hours playtime. I own the dlcs The Old Gods, Legacy of Rome, and the Europa Universalis 4 save converter.  I solely purchased EU4 because of how much I enjoyed my crusader kings 2 game and wanted to continue playing my empire, I haven't even played it yet.\n\nAlso: Don't buy for full price.  Even though it is worth it, getting the game and all the dlc all at full price is pretty expensive. The base game is often on sale or in bundles.\n\nThis is my first steam review so if you think this is helpful give the thumbs up and I'll do some more reviews.  Hope you enjoyed reading.","November 22, 2013","true","178.6"," 3,756 of 3,814 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","756","3","3","42"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doc_Gore/recommended/203770/","Doc_Gore","Dark Lord of the Sith, Revan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doc_Gore/","787 products in account","My friend and I decided to play a multiplayer game of Crusader Kings II earlier. Never in my life have I ever been more frightened in a video game. Let me explain.\n\nMy friend and I decided to be counts in different kingdoms and empires. My character was a little interesting.\n\nFirst Name: 12\nLast Name: ISIS\nGoal: Spread my "seed" to all corners of the world\nLocation: England\nRank: Count of Kent\n\nI had set the goal of spreading my "seed" all over the world because I thought it would make for some interesting gameplay, and boy did something interesting happen.\n\nThe game started off normal, my friend was in the Holy Roman Empire as a Duke, and I was in the nearby province of Kent in England, not far from the border of the Holy Roman Empire so we were both well within diplomatic range. I started to spread my "seed" by seducing as many women as I could. I tended to seduce the women who had high rankings, such as the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire, the Queen of England, Queen of France, and other higher ranking women. My fertility was well above average, and basically any woman I seduced would have a child.\n\nAfter a couple of decades having passed, my friend had become Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, and I spread my seed to almost every major kingdom and empire in diplomatic range (little did my friend know, he was actually playing as my illegitimate child that I had with the Empress of the Holy Roman Empire). You could always tell which children were mine based on their names. Most of my children had the most ridiculous names like, "THANKS OBAMA" or "Nigerian Prince Simulator". But, there was one child I had that would cause a lot of problems for everyone. His name was "Forgot the Condom".\n\n"Forgot the Condom" was a normal child at first. He grew up till the age of 6 relatively normal, but then something went horribly wrong. While trying to seduce more women, I got a notification in the game. This is essentially what the notification said: "My son 'Forgot the Condom' is not like other children. He does not scream or cry or even get upset, but he observes the world with keen interest. This morning, he burst into bubbling laughter when a cook cut his hand badly and there was blood everywhere. Animals do not like him and he makes a strange buzzing sound when near other children. Courtiers whisper 'demon spawn' and the servants have started to avert their eyes and make covert signs to ward off evil." After telling my friend about the event (he had a lot more experience in the game than me), he immediately mentioned that I should stop whatever I was doing and kill my child. My friend exact words were, "Your son is a demon, you have to kill him or it will be too late."\n\n"Too late?" I asked. My friend remained silent. At the time, the only way to kill your own child was to imprision them and execute them. So, I decided I would try to do that. Well, whenever I tried to imprison "Forgot the Condom", he ended up escaping and fleeing the country. I explain this to my friend and he tells me, "We have to kill him, somehow." At the time, neither my friend nor I knew about the character search tool in the game, so we had to manually find "Forgot the Condom" in all of the provinces. We looked for 30 minutes, and could not find him. After we finished searching, we decided to continue with the game as normal. "Let's just hope nothing bad happens", my friend exclaimed.\n\nFive years pass, and I get a notification. It reads: "My dear daughter 'SWAGYOLO420NOSCOPE" must have suffered a stroke in her sleep last night. She was found drooling in bed, one eye bloodshot, mumbling about a small monster that stabbed her in the eye before it ran off. There are dark rumours about the so called 'demon child', my son 'Forgot the Condom', again... As always when something terrible happens, she does seem inordinately happy." I thought we had been rid of "Forgot the Condom", but he was back, with a vengeance.\n\nI tried finding "Forgot the Condom" again in all of the provinces near me, but I could not find him.\n\nAnother year passes, my son "URLUCKYIDIDNTABORTU" dies. Then my daughter, "6 Salads" dies. My son, "Taco Tuesday" dies. At this point I realized, "Forgot the Condom" is killing all of my children. I entirely dedicated to finding and killing him. I'm looking around for him, and he is killing all of my children. We look for him for 2 years in game, when my friend says something.\n\n"HOLY ♥♥♥♥, I FOUND HIM!"\n\n"WHAT WHAT, WHERE IS HE?" I ask.\n\n"Holy ♥♥♥♥, he.... he"\n\n"What? What's wrong?"\n\n"He is the ♥♥♥♥ING POPE."\n\nI immediately check to see if he is right. My son... my son, "Forgot the Condom" is the ♥♥♥♥ing Pope.\n\nMy friend and I start to freak out, "How the hell did he become the Pope?!?!" "What do we do?" "HOW DID WE NOT NOTICE THIS BEFORE?!?!?!"\n\nImmediately we start a plot to kill "Forgot the Condom". We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late. We have to kill him before it's too late.\n\nWe had 167% plot power, we were going to kill him, but then the worst thing happen. I get a notification: "My dear son 'Ebola Paitent 0' has died." So, what is so special about Ebola Paitent 0? Well, Ebola Paitent 0 was the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, aka my friend. My demon child "Forgot the Condom" killed my friend. At this point in the game, the entirety of my children and lineage, the ISIS family line, had been completely wiped out. Except for one person, except for me, "12, 12 of the family ISIS". I could no longer kill my son because you cannot plot against your children, I was stuck. I had no where to go. I was going to die, the ISIS family line was going to die.\n\nI struggled to find any way to kill the Pope, my friend could not start a plot because his new character was a child. We had nowhere to turn. We were out of options.\n\nEventually, the worst came, "Forgot the Condom" killed me in my sleep. I was dead, the legendary "12 of ISIS" was dead.\n\nThe game ended. I had no heirs, and I was eliminated from the game. The game was also hosted by me so it ended for my friend as well.\n\n"WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥ was that?" my friend said. I didn't even say anything. A few minutes pass, we were staring at the defeat screen the entire time.\n\n"We must remember this in some way." I explained. "We must remember '12 of ISIS' and 'Forgot the Condom'. We need to memoralize them forever." "How do we do that?" my friend asks.\n\n"I don't know, but we must remember them. They are legends and must never be forgotten."\n\nTL; DR The game is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.","January 7","true","502.9"," 632 of 646 people (98%) found this review helpful 734 people found this review funny","98","632","646","734","19"

Whilst great, the interface is certainly intimidating at first, but the tool tips are excellently written for just about every button. Just take your time and don't worry about losing to much at first, just mess around and it will soon come to you.\n\nThis is the type of game that makes you want to write down your stories just to share with other people.

I remain a lowly Earl.\n\nStart plot to assassinate the current Duke of Cornwall, I want that position. Nobody likes me enough to join it. End of plot.\n\nThe only guy who actually liked me a lot and had great traits, my Chancellor, today died of depression. The only two suitable replacements look more like the living embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins. I chose one of them with reluctance.\n\nMy wife is pregnant. Hopefully it'll be a boy!\n\nMy first daughter, whom is to be my heir, refuses to learn any of my traits. To this day, she remains Ambitious, and only Ambitious.\n\nThe child is born. It's a girl.\n\nAnd to add the icing on the bitter Cake of Feudal Disappointment, my loving wife died giving birth to said child.\n\nGot married again!\n\nWife insisted on becoming a Spymaster. Funny, both my wives have been Spymasters...\n\nTreason! Rebellious scum have risen in Cornwall, and I am besieged. According to someone of little importance in my Council, this rebellion only had a 6.5% chance of actually happening. I should buy a ticket for the Great Monarch Lottery.\n\nDuke Arsewipe of Cornwall has aided me in removing the rebellious scum that infested my lands. I still hate him.\n\nPraise be to God! A plague of Typhus has swept Cornwall. Perhaps Duke Arsewipe shall be given a painful and miserable death.\n\nDuke Arsewipe lives...yay.\n\nMy wife is pregnant, I hope it's a boy. I'm sure the saying goes “Second time lucky”.\n\nApparently the saying goes “Third time lucky”, and I am now the only man in a house of my wife and four daughters.\n\nInstead of consoling me, today my Court Chaplain came to me to spread heresy. Naturally, I imprisoned him.\n\nMy Steward is dead, and there are no candidates to replace him. I now spend a portion of my day keeping the chair warm.\n\nToday, I learned that Duke Arsewipe had a previous wife who tragically died of Camp Fever. I'm still unsure as to what the hell kind of name 'Hungifu' is for a woman. Those weird Anglo-Saxons.\n\nMy wife is once again pregnant. Since this is the 'third time', maybe I will be in luck.\n\nMy first daughter has married the son of the King of Denmark. We are now far more Prestigious, and Denmark are now my allies.\n\nIt's a boy! Cador is born!\n\nMy eldest daughter has given birth to a daughter.\n\nMy second eldest daughter has just married the son of the King of Navarra. We now have an alliance with Navarra. Duke Arsewipe better look over his shoulder from now on.\n\nMy niece has asked me to help her find a suitor to marry. Rather concerning is the fact that someone has put my newborn son on the list. I will choose her someone that isn't related.\n\nI decided to hold a marvellous feast, with only the finest food. Unfortunately, I only have one guest. The feast went well.\n\nManaged to convince my Bishop, whom was formerly my Court Chaplain, to become a Catholic once again. Upon doing so, I released him from prison.\n\nI have started a new plot to kill Duke Arsewipe, and with a little (a lot) of coin, I have convinced two others to join me. At last, my enemy shall die!\n\nFor whatever reason only known to them, my two supporters backed out without telling me. To add insult to injury, Duke Arsewipe had the nerve to ask me to let a member of his family educate one of MY children!\n\nTurned 50 today. Happy Birthday to me...yay.\n\nToday, my WIFE discovered that my eldest DAUGHTER is planning to kill my only SON and heir. I think my family has finally hit rock bottom.\n\nMy wife is pregnant...\n\nA boy has been born! This is becoming a big family, hopefully they won't murder each other.\n\nAlas, sickness murdered my newborn son.\n\nIt's been twenty years since Duke Arsewipe became duke, and for some reason, he still insists on breathing more life into his wretched soul. I may be older, but I will outlive him!\n\nMy wife is pregnant...again. I really need to calm down in my old age.\n\nIt's a boy. The family seems to be evening out a bit now.\n\nI have no idea how I do it, but I've managed to get my wife pregnant again. My Court Chaplain insists I stop these so-called “shenanigans”.\n\nI am blessed with another son.\n\nDuke Arsewipe has stepped over the line now. He has asked me to allow HIM to educate MY son and heir. May the Devil take him!\n\n60 today. I insist upon outlasting Duke Arsewipe!\n\nMy eldest daughter's husband has died at the age of 31, and the circumstances are very suspicious.\n\nMy son and heir is now married to the princess of the Holy Roman Empire!\n\nMy half-brother, Dumnarth, died today. He will be greatly missed.\n\nInsulted my wife by calling her gluttonous and a monster when it comes to table manners. I shall not be doing that again.\n\nIt is done. Duke Arsewipe finally had his last breath on August 1st, 1101 at the age of 69. I can now go to my grave a happy man.\n\nAt the age of 72, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall died after a period of illness on November 2nd, 1103. He succeeded in his goal of outlasting his mortal enemy.\n\nRest In Peace, Earl Cadoc of Cornwall.","January 9","true","22.4"," 329 of 344 people (96%) found this review helpful 328 people found this review funny","96","329","344","328","4"

Want a genius hunchback who rules over the Arabian Empire?\nDo you want to try and backstab your way to the top of the Byzantine Empire with a powerful spy?\nIt is up to you!\n\nThere is one indicator on how well you have done, that is your Score which the game at the end compare with other great historical dynasties. You increase your score by having rulers with high prestige and piety, but also having other dynasty members in high positions, will generate prestige to your dynasty, giving newborn a higher starting position in life, when it comes to their prestige.\n\nThere are so many DLCs!Many seem to get overwhelmed by the amount of DLCs this game has, however many of those are cosmetic DLCs, adding other graphics or sounds to the game.\n\nThe main DLCs that expand gameplay are:\n\nI will rank them, with the top being the most important expansion to get first, by my own opinion.\n\nRuler Designer - This will enable you to create your own ruler, only your imagination will limit the replayability of the game.\nLegacy of Rome - This expansion not only gives more deepth to the Orthodox rulers of the Byzantine, and greek cultures, it also provides new game mechanics, such as military retinues. (Also allow the possibility for castrating and blinding prisoners playing as a ruler of the Byzantine culture group)\nThe Old Gods - This enable you to play the game from 867 CE, and also make Pagans and Zoroastrian rulers playable.\nSword of Islam - Makes muslims playable, as The Old Gods each unique religion has its own mechanics.\nSons of Abraham - Adds more deepth to the abrahamic faiths and also Judaism. Heresies for religions are also possible.\nThe Republic - Want to try out the merchant life of Venice? With this DLC that will be possible, take control of a patrician family, amass wealth and control the trade zones around the shores of the known world.\nCharlemagne - Introduces a new starting time, at 769 CE, gives you the option to create custom Kingdoms and Empires.\nRajas of India - Allows for control of the Indian rulers.\nWay of Life - Focus the life of your ruler towards certain areas of his life, want to became a great hunter to catch the fable white bear? Or became the greatest architech in the whole realm?\nCustomization Pack - Customize your ruler ingame, change the beard, hair style, even the dynasty name or shield.\nSunset Invasion - If you want to add an extra level of crazy to your game, only recommended for veteran players of CK2, what if the Aztec discovered Europe first? And decided to invade?\nSave Game converter - If you own Europa Universalis IV and want to continue your saga from CK2, this DLC will enable you to export your CK2 game into EU IV.\nAll the other DLCs are cosmetical.\n\nMods!\nCrusader Kings 2 has more mods, that will expand your game, one of the more popular mods is a total conversion into a Game of Thrones universe. Where you can encounter spoilers from the series, but it will also make you play out the stories in George R.R. Martin's universe in another direction, should Tyrion Lannister have the Iron Throne?\n\nLearning curve?It has a steep learning curve, and the ingame tutorial only scratches the surface of possibilities. I would recommend picking up the game, and play with a friend online, or experiment as a count in Ireland.\n\nBut when you get a hang on it, it will grab you, and pull you deeper into a world of intrigue, murder, war, romance, and much more. In an forever going struggle for power over the realm, and the world.\n","January 20, 2015","true","100.1"," 153 of 165 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","153","165","10","0"

(Last I read, the average player had over 500 hours on this game.)\n\nCrusader Kings II is a strategic game where you spend most of your time looking at a big map of Europe cut into little counties, but it is drastically different from a game like Medieval II: Total War.  Whereas in those games, every nation had rigid boundaries and an entire nation was a distinct, unified entity, Crusader Kings II focuses upon the feudal system of governance, and especially its hereditary system of succession.\n\nYou are not a nation, you are an extended family through the ages.  You may start as King of England, but lose the throne in a succession war, only to wind up inheriting the Kingdom of France, instead.  It is a game of political machinations more than warfare.\n\nYou can't just declare war whenever you want to, you need to, by hook or by crook, manage to get a claim to that land you want to invade.  Battles are relatively quick and hands-off (play that Total War if you want to manage the troops directly) but it's the space between wars that makes the game interesting.  To get that claim, you probably need to find some way to get the princess of that land in your bed (or your son's bed), and it's this medieval bloodline plotting that make up the meat of the game.\n\nFor that matter, you don't necessarily need to declare war to gain land - just marry into the family that succeeds a throne, and make sure that, one way or the other, your chosen heir also manages to be the chosen heir of a target kingdom, and the kingdoms will be unified upon the death of your current character and the current king of the target land.\n\nLikewise, just because you gain land doesn't mean you can keep it.  You need to delegate land out, and succession laws can fragment your kingdom so much that you see hard-conquered lands slip out of your grasp by inheritence without your consent.\n\nWorse, while whomever you give land will be quite grateful for the first 20 years of their rule or so, their children will have no gratitude for the gift of land your father gave them, and will likely be burning with ambitions you have to keep in check.  Every few decades, your character ages and dies, and succession wars and civil wars are the primary way the game keeps your over-arching ambitions in check.  Rather than letting a large empire mean that no external threat can challenge you, and no internal threats exist, the larger you become, the less vulnerable you are to external threats, but the more vulnerable you are to internal ones. You spend more and more time trying to find a way to bludgeon the rebellious nobles and religious minorities into line.\n\nIf you get tired of games of Total War, and don't bother completing them because, once you are the strongest power on the map, there's nothing to do but steamroll everything else that stands in your path, then CK2 is a great remedy to this.  (You can still make a world-spanning super-empire, but it's much more interesting to try to keep it when the owners of that land still fight you when you plant your flag there than to just have them mutely pay taxes to you and have assumed loyalty to your cause.)\n\nIt's a game that's just hard and realistic enough to make the things you do actually feel like you're thumbing your nose at history.  You can play an Irish earl, rise to High King of Ireland, and conquer England.  Or play as the West Africans, and conquer the Muslims and convert them to your pagan faith.  Being a norse viking that captures the pope and sacrifices him to Odin is always fun.  (And nabs the Holy Smoke! achievement.) And if you do it with an unbroken line of Viking empresses, all the better.\n\nMods are also a high point: Play the Elder Kings mod, based upon the Elder Scrolls, and conquer Cyrodiil and beyond as an immortal or vampire, using magicks to summong hordes of demons when under threat. There's an A Game of Thrones mod, as well, and mods to turn the game into something like a space 4X game.\n\nDLC still comes out for the game, as well.  While more than a little annoying to be nickled and dimed, the trickle of new content keeps the game fresh and new achievements are meaningful challenges, requiring players to take up historic underdogs to rise to glory.  Getting a full board of achievements is extraordinarily difficult, but enjoyable for the challenge they provide.","July 14, 2015","true","472.3"," 116 of 119 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","116","119","3","2"

You're not just a country, like in other grand strategy games. You are a ruler with qualities, flaws, vices and virtues. You can be a Duke who is a brilliant diplomat with a hunchback, an ugly, stuttering dimwit count, or a mastermind plotter/lesbian queen. (I'm NOT making it up). And you can be all that within in a single playthrough, as you re-incarnate into your heir when you die. You have to be good at managing your realm, but you've got to be even better at managing your dynasty by arranging favourable marriages, assassinate pretenders... It's all very involving and requires a lot of micro-management (which you may or may not like).\n\nIt's not without flaws: the interface could see much improvement and the game starts to slow down when you become powerful. By slow down, I don't mean that your computer has a hard time coping, I mean that there are many more events that require your constant attention, making things move at a slower pace. To be honest, after several hundred hours, I think I'm a bit burned with the game. And that, even though there are entire DLCs I haven't really explored yet: I have only really played as a Catholic or Muslim ruler, but DLCs let you play as pagans, Orthodoxes, republics...\n\nAnd then there are a couple of Mods that are probably worth exploring as well: "Game of Thrones" and "Tamriel" (from the Elder scrolls series)\n\nStill, with so much content and the unbeatable feeling of being an actual Middle-Ages ruler, it's hard to rate CKII anything lower than a 9 out of 10.","November 30, 2013","true","252.0"," 101 of 105 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","101","105","0","0"

You do not compare a Picasso with children drawings from school. Students have to do quick flashy drawings for good grades, and do them as often as they can, with accent on flashy rather than on detail. Crusader Kings II is a game that puts the accent more on detail, quality rather than quantity.\n\nThe game itelf may feel a bit hard to understand at first, but if you give it a moment of your time, it will surprise you. But buyer be warn, if you just wanna play a game where you plug in, then all you do is fancy easy war TW style, or EUIV, then better avoid CK2. Crusader Kings II requires the player to think, quite a bit actually, and consider choices and plan ahead, sometimes for a few decades. It is a real strategy game, and as such it is a gem, since I do not think there is another game on the market that challenges you truly at this level and in such a complex way.\n\nWhy is it challenging? Well for one, you need to plan your dynasty, you need to plan your marriages to seek advantages and gains, secure the blood line, be wary of who will you end up playing next, and after that, manage your vassals, manage alliances which can only be made through marriage, manage your holdings so you can have more income and troops, manage your realm to pick laws which will either upset or make your vassals happy, or play nice to your liege if you are not independent, watch over your armies when you raise them, pick terrain carefully as it matters quite a bit, be carefull who you put in charge of your armies, watch over you flanks, be carefull what troops you use when, since the holding they come from gives them bonuses, plan your technological advancements, mind religion, convert, play the cardinal game, expand, go on crusades, plot to murder your enemies, to revoke titles, fabricate claims, and so much more.\n\nYou think that list is big? Its small, even more so, get a mod from the Paradox Forums, and you can get 2-3 times more features, some mods even take you to other worlds, use maps from settings you know and love and add a ton of events and new features. The ammount of depth this game and its modding community offer is mind boggling. Crusader Kings 2 is the Skyrim of Strategy Games. Its got depth, its got versatility, its got deep modability, its a gem.\n\nAnd trust me, nothing compares to the feel you get, when after starting as a Count, you end up an Emperor for the first time...","February 12, 2014","true","208.2"," 79 of 79 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","79","79","0","5"

A wonderfully convoluted game, where you define your goals and the means to achieve them. Be warned, you learn this game by playing it, gradually blooming into one of the most magnificent machiavellian meanies (darn you, profanity filter) the world has ever seen. Rewrite history as you see fit, Scheme and plot, command armies and then laugh at your demise at the hands of your subjects, your enemies, your supposed friends, your children and the wonderfully cruel winds of change and chance.\n\nBut be warned, this game does not provide you with a goal aside from survival of your dynasty. Do you wish to unite Ireland and then subjugate the heathens that currently hold Jerusalem? How about bringing forth the downfall of the Holy Roman Empire as just a lowly Count of France? Or maybe you really just want to make that one guy pay who plotted the death of your insane, crippled and infirm Court Jester? Do what you want and suffer the consequences.\n\nAll in all, this game is ripe with dark humour and seems to be easy at first. But it deceives you, sucking you in and suddenly gripping you by the balls, as you die from consumption, your son gets killed in a crusade and your remaining heir turns out to be gay, possessed and a complete lackwit, all while your allies drag you into wars and your vassals rise up in arms against you.\n\nSo, laugh at the cruel twists of fate, or grow mad from the revelation. Or maybe just enjoy a quiet, uneventful life as a lowly vassal to better lords.","December 6, 2013","true","187.7"," 66 of 67 people (99%) found this review helpful","99","66","67","0","0"

It looks like a historical strategy game: a large real-world map to play on, countries to control, lands to conquer, etc. But don't be fooled. It is actually a “life simulation game". You have a country (or part of it), but what you really play is a dynasty, or family.\n\nYou rule, you fight, you want to see the death of your regent, you kill, you murder, you have parties, you make friends, you meditate, you do business, you love your wife, or make wild loves with your lovers, you have enemies, you are supported by your vessels, you travel around the world, you educate your children, you become the king, you are defeated on the battlefield, you lose your titles, you are nobody again, you are old, you die, you leave nothing but chaos to your sons.\n\nYou go over the rises and falls of the family, interact with everyone around, and play your particular part in everyone's own story. There are tens of thousands characters in the virtually living world, everyone with his or her own life being written. Sadly you can never have sufficient energy to learn every unique story!\n\nThis is one of the best games I've ever played, definitely top 5.

There are 9 "Major" DLC"s for this game, which add as much content as the base game, and drastically opens the game. So what Crusader Kings 2 is, greatly depends on which DLC"s you get.\n\nWhat this game is though at its core, is a real time strategy game set in the medieval era's, the base game is from 1066 to 1453. The DLC's The Old Gods and Charlemagne allow for a start date of 867 and 769, respectively, allowing for over 700 years of game-play through the early dark ages, all the way to the beginning of the Rennaissance period.\n\nYou can start playing as a Duke of a few provinces, under a King. A King, or an Emperor.\n\nThrough this time, you will be restricted by realistic "rules and laws" which governed the world at that time as you balance your lands among your vassals, and family. Keeping the Feudal system together, your people happy, and making sure vassals don't revolt, is much tougher than you'd think.\n\nYou could start off as a King with 40 Vassals, 70 counties, and countless castles in your control, and in 200 years, find yourself owning nothing more than a half disseveled castle in a province nobody cares about, having lost your seat on the throne, to an usurping vassal who got the better of you.\n\nOr you could find yourself in the same situation in reverse, having bested your King on the field of battle, and taking the throne for your own.\n\nHoly Wars, cultural differences. Supporting, and or working against your King, or Emperor, vassalizing near by independent rulers, and sometimes, even attempting assassinations against your own family, are all things which you may need to do, to keep your next of heir securely in line for the throne, and your current holdings and estates safely in the family.\n\nThe game revolves, not around the country, but your family. In Medieval ages, your family "house" is whats important. As your current ruler dies, you will take direct control of the next of heir of your house, and they will gain the titles which the laws of your country allow depending on succession laws.\n\nThe politics are setup pretty realistically to how it was in those days as well. Marrying off a daughter is what made alliances, nothing else. (Not 100% accurate, but damn close enough to be considered "historical"). Succession laws of how your children are allowed to take the throne, greatly impacts your future as well.\n\nAll in all if you love Medieval history, and want to learn more about how it worked, this game will teach you things you never knew.\n\nIf you own Europa Universalis IV, there is a converter which you can get for Crusader Kings 2, Allowing you to convert the world exactly as it is from Crusader Kings 2, into Europa Universalis IV, allowing you to continue your reign of your Kingdom, as you move from the Medieval ages, into the age of Rennaissance and exploration.\n\nThere is no game that has better replayability than Crusader Kings 2. I have played nearly 400 different games, and have over 1000 hours in this game. (Before I got it on steam), and not a single one of my games has been remotely close to playing out like any other.\n\n-------------------\n\nThe DLC's\n\nI know there are some upheavels about the amount of DLC's, and some people screaming bloody murder and cash grab insults. I have to beg to differ, and I'd like to explain why if you're one of those people who have been hearing this.\n\nThis game was released in Feb, 14th of 2012. That's 4 years as of this year in 2016. In those 4 years, Paradox has released 9 "Major" DLC's, which open the game up tremendously, and add in depth mechanics, new events, and great game changes, all of which are superb. (You can tell if it's a "Major" DLC if the price is over 1.99)\n\nThese DLC's are not "DLC's", they are the equievalant of legit expansions from back in the day, when a developer would release an expansion to a game you had to pay for, which adds just as much as the base game originally had.\n\nThe Old Gods for instance, allows you to play as the Pagans. All with their own 100's of new events for both pagan and non pagan leaders, new mechanics for the pagans, and opens the game up tremendously in that area, as well as pushing the start date back another 200 years.\n\nThe Republic expansoin does, well what you think. Allows you to play as a Merchant Republic, such as Venice, AND allows any leader to setup a Merchant Republic within their own country, which greatly increases gold income. Playing as a Merchant Republic is vastly different than playing as a feudal lord, and is yet again another major expansion, adding 100's of new events, entirely new different type of game-play to play around if you're playing as a Merchant Republic, etc.\n\nThe list goes on for every single one of those 9 "Major" DLC's. None of which are a rip off in anyway for the price because of how much each add to the game as a whole.\n\n\nSo what about those countless 1.99 stuff?\n\nThis is where I can understand if people say "cash grab", however I personally would still disagree to some extent simply because being an Indie developer myself, I understand the work that does need to be put in to make it viable. Albeit it still isn't much work over all.\n\nThe 1.99 little DLC's which change sprites on the map, or allow for more family house crest art to personally change, etc. its over all cheap, and it's entirely up to you to buy it or not. They however in no way take away from the game by not having them, and are all cosmetic.\n\nThe ones I personal like are the ones which change the look of the people and their outfits, etc. to fit the time and appearance they'd of had for that culture and area in the world a bit more than the stock game.\n\nThese are all very cheap however, 1.99 to about 3.99, depending on how much it adds, but all of which are about 10x cheaper than going to the movies, which only nets you 1 hour of annoyance while you try to enjoy it, and people decide now is a good time to be loud and annoying.. I'd rather pay the 7 small DLC's for the same price and fully enjoy it for the rest of my life... Step aside movies..","January 6","true","642.4"," 52 of 53 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","52","53","3","0"

Legend has it that in the late 11th century Venetian spending ground to a complete halt as the city-state had quite literally too much money and not enough places to invest in. A ruthless and cunning family, the Pasta family spared no expense in making sure their trade ports were renowned the world over. If money was being spent in the Mediterranean, the Pasta family got a cut; to do business and avoid them was difficult. To avoid Venice altogether was impossible.\n\nWhile avoiding open conflict as much as they could, the Venetians did get in a few trade squabbles with the Amalfi, only to render the Greek patricians an afterthought when it came to doing business in the Mediterranean. Using a mix of intrigue and some well-placed military show-of-force, the Pasta patricians were able to get a monetary lock on almost the entire Mediterranean Sea, and were even looking to find a weak county along the Red Sea to capture so as to expand their trade empire into India. Venice made many political and cultural strides in southern Europe, notably by turning its back on Roman Catholicism in 1207 to adopt the Cathar heresy. This did very little to dissuade people from trading with them, however, as Rome itself was home to a particularly busy Pasta trade port for several hundred years at that point.\n\nIt wasn't until Serene Doge Cavatappi III in 1349 did cracks begin to form in the illustrious Pasta mansion, so to speak. Through a series of marriages to various Saxon and Bavarian princes the Pasta family came in posession of a few counties in mainland Europe; far away from warm, balmy climate of Venice. Sitting on a veritable mountain of gold at this point, the Venetian powers that be tended to ignore their lands to the north, and left it in the capable hands of their respective rulers. After Penne IV, son of Cavatappi III lost the election to become the next Serene Doge (an event that did happen a few times during the 600 year Pasta tenure, but few and far in between), he decided to turn his back on Venice altogether and tore his family's ties from the Republic. Adopting a few of his rightful counties in Bavaria and suffering a hard but brief blow from the bizarre Sunset Invasion, Penne and his kin lived in a financial nightmare. While by no means broke, the family now had a mere fraction of the wealth they amassed during their mainstay in Venice.\n\nThe reason not much has been written about the Pasta family is because after this exodus the dynasty pretty much lost all of its prestige and money. Left with a few counties in Saxony (which were quickly overthrown by their bigger and more powerful Frankish neighbors) and no historical records left over save for a few manuscripts found in the wine cellar of the old Pasta mansion (discovered only recently), the Pasta family became a cold, stale remnant of what it once was. The only surviving history of the family for a while was of its brief stay in mainland Europe, which was far from glorious.\n\n...\n\nI did all of this by clicking things on a map and looking at spreadsheets.\n\n10/10 would create a grand trade empire only to fade into obscurity and have a terrible score at the end of the game again.","September 12, 2015","true","307.9"," 51 of 54 people (94%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","94","51","54","37","0"

Another Euro-centric medieval simulator, like we haven't seen that before. With a snail pace and no sprawling, Total War like combat, it seems more like a "watch time pass" simulator than a game.\n\nBut you start a game nonetheless. You chose to start as a small, independent region - maybe the one where you or your ancestors hail from - glory to the motherland and all that. And you just want to learn the ropes, no need to get into anything large. The game starts; you press play and fiddle with the speed. Nothing happens. You leave it on high. Minutes pass; nothing happens. 'OK', let's see what this button at the top left does. You spend the next half hour fiddling with all the info there, trying to make sense of it. From time to time, pop-ups show up, detailing little events that seem to have no impact on the game. 'Oh, cool. This random courtesan fancies me. Who friggin' cares?'.\nBut one message catches your eye - the neighboring ♥♥♥-hat has decided he likes your lands and he'd like to make them his lands. You quickly raise your impressive army only to watch in horror as ten times as many butcher them with ease. Your dynasty ends with its founders head on a pile. Game over.\n\nOK, that went as well as can be expected - can't be be blamed for not winning with the small guy on the first time. You start up another game, this time as the biggest, baddest nation that you see - what greater joy could there be than to steamroll all your punier neighbors into fine grains of dust? As the game starts, you watch with greedy eyes as the gold rolls into your treasury. 'Yeah, time to build some ♥♥♥♥'. 'What? It takes one year, costs that much and increases my army by ♥♥♥♥-all percent in this region only?? Screw that, time to slaughter some franks'. 'OK, diplomacy, declare war... Why is it greyed out? Casus Beli??? WTF is that?'.\nBut no matter, while you were scouring your memory of high-school Latin, the guys to the south have graciously decided to bring the fight to you. 'Pathetic basters, they're like half my size. This is going to be fun'. You raise your levies and merge them into one big glob. 'That skull must mean I'm one deadly S.O.B' you think to yourself. And you march to meet them head on, only to see your guys start to die off before you even get there. 'Doesn't matter' you think to yourself, 'I still outnumber them 2:1'. By the time your armies meet, it's more like 1.5 to 1, and you still barely beat them. But you do. Time to reap the rewards...\nYour peasants have taken up arms against you.\nYour vassals have risen up to lower crown authority.\nYour king has died, only to be inherited by a possessed dimwit.\nYou have been excommunicated.\nThe franks have decided that that small little province on the border is theirs and they are willing to drown you in blood for it.\nGame over.\n\nAt this moment you are fuming. You steel yourself - this stupid game isn't going to get the better of you. You start thinking, 'what's the best starting point?'. You start again, this time as a count in province deep in the heart of a stable empire. You start slow, making friends with everyone. Then your lord and brother dies, making you the new Duke. 'Oh, so I don't have to attack everyone to take their land'. You make a mental note. The years pass; through claim fabrication, key marriages and poisoned wines you grab a few more adjacent duchies. A few gold coins later and you are the King of Bavaria.\nThis makes the emperor uneasy. He demands that you release a duchy that he claims is rightfully his. You're too weakened from your last conquest to fight him - and it's just a small province anyway. You grin your teeth and accept his demands. And the years pass again; your line is well loved and respected by your emperor and fellow vassals. You are seen as a keen supporter of his Imperial Majesty. But the strangest thing keeps happening. All the bright, attractive or strong princes, they never seem to make it pass infancy. As generations pass, the crippled, the dim and the feeble seem to favored by some unseen force and raise to the crown. Unsurprisingly, your fellow lords are not happy with this rule.\nThe time has come. You start a movement, to replace the inheritance law with an elective one. A bloody civil war erupts and, after many years, you emerge the victor. You are now next in line to become the most powerful man in Europe. Just. one. more. assassination.\nAnd... the Huns happen. Your empire is too weak and you fail to protect your lands against the scourge.\nGAME OVER.\n\nIt's morning. You have to go to work in about an hour.

Those seeking a way to crack the "optimal" way to play, and those seeking to "win" will be disappointed, whereas those seeking emergent systems and effects will enjoy hundreds of hours of discovery.\n\nIt is therein that lies CK2's greatest strength - creating a narrative through emergent systems.\n\nCrusader Kings II relies largely on the player setting their own goals and then working towards them. Be they immediate goals, medium term aspirations, or long term dreams, a large part of CK2's appeal lies in pondering how best to "exploit the code" to reach your ends. In fact, the best way to play CK2 is not to play to win, but to let the game "happen"; to let your dynasty's fortune ebb and flow with the passage of time, creating a narrative of a family streching across the centuries.\n\n\nCrusader Kings 2 is a game that you can sink literally hundreds of hours into and still find out new and exciting things to do. CK2 isn't a perfect game; the learning curve can be steep, particularly for those new to the genre, and the presentation is a little short of the cutting edge. But, with a fantastic level of developer support, continual free and paid content additions, hundreds of mods, and a lively, friendly and supportive community, it is fair to say that CK2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time and, for strategy fans, possibly one of the greatest games of all time.

The content added often brings new depth to the game, but frequently has features that we shouldn't have to pay for. I'm looking at you Ruler designer! Also you dirty portrait, unit and music packs should be ashamed of yourselves for existing! If you look at other game companies, they often give comparable content for free as an update. At the very base of it, I'm sick of all this piece meal DLC. I can understand expansions increasing the longevity of the game, but seriously Horse Lord's cost is 37.5% of the price of the base game. And don't you lie to me and say that any of these expansions add enough content to justify their price. Most of these are just paid unlocks, not anything "expansive". Also don't talk to me about steam sales, the most recent releases only get 35% off. For Horse Lords, that's roughly 5 dollars, whoopee do. By the time, we get a substantial "deal" on any DLC, it's often way down the line and Paradox has already churned out another one. All of this means two plainly disappointing facts. You'll pay considerably to have a complete and current content version of any Paradox game and that when a new game releases it's evident you're only getting a bare bones version of the eventual game. However, I know that nothing will change as long as people keep apathetically buying the product. And so this 'just another ranting guy on the internet' is going to reach into his wallet, pull out his credit card and buy the next "grand" expansion for CK2 because oh well, right?\n\nSlightly More Rational Rant\nI'd prefer that more game developers learn from CD Projekt. Witcher 3, as an example, has become incredibly successful and it doesn't require a smattering of DLC to be enjoyable. I have no problem with additional content coming out after the base game's release, but it shouldn't take away the enjoyment from the base game. At some point just make a new game and quit selling us content piece by piece. Ck2 is an incredible game, but suffers from the DLC making the base game unappealing by itself. I didn't want to buy this game for the longest time because of the now classic DLC approach. I can understand that, after 4+ Years, having at most 6 expansions costing $5 to $10 could be reasonable especially if the base game was more fleshed out to start. However, the existing cluster pile of DLC acts as a major turn off for players. It creates the feeling of having to pay for the basic structure of the game and to flesh it out. At this point, we're not judging whether Paradox will make a good game, but how much it will cost us to enjoy every bit of it. I honestly enjoy Paradox games and I hope to enjoy more in the future. Just as usual if you purchase any of their games remember to be patient, wait for sales and slowly navigate the DLC barrier without letting it kill your wallet.\n\n\nUPDATE 4/10/16:\nWith the release of Mare Nostrum, It's evident that Pardox Interactive is trying to milk their games in increasing fashion. This is pitiful and doesn't show well for the future of Hearts of Irons 4, Stellaris and their other franchises. These are good quality games being subjected to obnoxious pay walls. Paradox makes base games that are just good enough to entice people to buy multitudes of DLC fillers which in the end ruins consumer enjoyment. Paradox knows what it's doing and all of their community streams and involvements are distractions to make us buy into a friendly exterior and therein be consoled into buying their products. The only action I'd want them to take is in their DLC practices. If you're going to sell us the game piece by piece then at least make it more worthwhile. Combine the cosmetic and music packs into their corresponding  main DLC expanisions then lower the prices to $9.99 and lower. You may think you'll lose far too much profit this way or that your efforts are underrepresented at such prices, but you'll have both a greater purchasing base and a longer lasting franchise to milk if you do this. If the reason prices are so high is because not enough people are buying the product then this solution would solve that problem in the long term. If you have merely caluclated that you can sell at these unreasonable prices and still make a hefty profit then whoever made that decision should be fired. Our else, your company will be crushed under the boot of companies like Sega, who specifically has turned CA and Relic Entertainment into DLC producing Cash Cows that take all the heat.Your CEO has stated you're undergoing the IPO process, therefore you'll be an option for buyout within a year or two. The gaming industry is full of puppeted developers straddled by larger publishing corporations that use them as proxy moneymakers without taking any real accountablity. You're on a path that will be your undoing; please become something better, Paradox, not something so pitiful and so often seen with developers.","January 28","false","346.1"," 195 of 282 people (69%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","69","195","282","16","28"

Why not, I thought. The father of the family was a decent warrior, so I allowed him to command troops in battle. He distinguished himself in many wars over the years and was awarded one of the recently conquered counties in Northern Germany. He continued to serve me loyally and has even converted to Norse religion. For his service I gave him a duchy to rule. Generation after generation his descendants continued to marry local nobles.\n\nNow, nearly two centuries later, Germany is ruled by white dudes in turbans who think they're Indian, worship Norse gods and train War Elephants. Breaking history has never been so much fun!\n\nI started playing CK2 during a free weekend. It looked like something I might like, so I gave it a try. I bought the game the next day along with several DLCs and never stopped playing. CK2 has now climbed to number 1 of my most played Steam games, in spite of being in my library for less than a year. I don't recall another "game addiction" that lasted this long for me. And there is the fact that nearly 400 hours into the game I've only played as one of the many game religions, one of the numerous cultures (disregarding the training scenario). Playing as a different religion, culture, starting location, starting rank changes the way you play the game. You could even start your second play through in the exact same character as last time and the way things will go will be entirely different.\n\nThis game is more complex than any other strategy I've played before. It takes a while to take it all in. Luckily there are in-game hints to what every screen means and what every button does (you can switch these off later, but I found myself checking every now and then). There is also a tutorial campaign that will teach you how to play.\n\nWhat adds to the fun greatly is the fact that you play as a specific character. Their traits and abilities make them more appropriate for certain roles within the Kingdom than others. The current King might make a better priest than military commander, but you don't say that out loud in front of your liege (or their spymaster). Once your character dies, you play as the heir to their titles, this being usually one of their children, depending on the hereditary laws of your realm.\n\nFeel like expanding your Empire? You don't necessarily need to wage war to achieve that. Why don't you marry your eldest son to that second daughter of the neighboring empire and then make sure the first-born daughter (already married) has a little accident before she has children?\nHowever as I am not the patient type I prefer marching my armies into enemy territory and be done with it. What I love about the battles is that the smallest thing can change the outcome of the battle (much like in history). The commander of your strongest flank was killed shortly after the skirmish began and his confused troops now run around the battlefield like headless chickens? Well, s**t happens.\n\nThere is always a chance, however small, that things will go wrong. It's up to you to play the odds (don't put your only heir in battle, especially while he's sick) and have a backup plan in case things don't go your way or you might end up losing your realm, or the entire game. Once I lost a major battle and most of my personal army. One of my vassals decided now was the good time to revolt, my stronger neighbor saw it as an opportunity to invade and on top of that a peasant uprising started in one of my counties. Bottom line - I lost it all and had to make tribal huts in Norway my capital, which was a bummer after living in a mighty castle in Western France for two generations.\n\nThe good news is you can appoint commanders as you see fit, provided your authority within the realm is strong enough to do so. Each of the several types of troops (and culture specific special units) has a different attack and defend stats and these evolve as you research technologies and construct special buildings. Your commanders can employ various tactics during battle, some of which depend on their personal traits and/or martial capability.\n\nThere are many situations you will find yourself in - often thanks to random events, most of which require very specific conditions to be met first. Many events are bound to a specific time and realms that existed at that point. I will not spoil these for you because I found it to be a lot of fun to face some of them followed by a palm on the forehead and an exclamation: “Of course, I (sort of) remember this from history lessons!”\n\nI’ve always been interested in history and considered my knowledge of geography very decent and yet I’ve learned a lot of new facts by playing CK2. My natural curiosity took over and I've since researched many medieval realms and rulers online.\n\nIf you’re feeling competitive then know that achievements are only awarded if you play on Ironman mode. So please make sure that if you come across a player with some of the most difficult of achievements you salute and/or bow as appropriate.\n\nAt some point you might find yourself lying on your death-bed. Your son and heir might be an imbecile, your younger brother has possibly convinced half of your court he'd make a better King than you and yet you’ll enjoy every minute of it. This game has my full recommendation.\n\nIf this looks like something you might like then give it a try. But be warned - You might be buying the new number 1 in your library and may thus face the "Should I do something meaningful with my day or should I finally become the King of England?" decision. And we both know it can only go one way from there.","December 14, 2015","true","402.3"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","95","40","42","20","5"

I have hundreds of hours logged into this game. I even loved crusader kings 1.\n\nBut Paradox has decided to let some no talent idiots take control of the Crusader Kings 2 project. Essentially they have repalced the main development team and the vision of the game has drastically changed. I have almost all the DLC's for this game and have spent quite a bit of money on it and NOW they start ruining it? Instead of giving us new things to conquer or new characters to interact with or new cool things to do they have decided just to make the old things harder and more annoying.\n\nBetween conclave and the proposed black death dlc the developers are severely limiting game play by injecting annoying, illogical and unrealistic events into the game. People already plotted to rebel and acquire power for themselves but conclave made it easier for them. There were already illnesses that caused quite a bit of devastation in the game so the new DLC is proposed to maximize that already annoying situation. What fun is that going to be?? Well let me tell you it will be about as fun as micromanaging all your vassals is in Conclave. Basically none. The UI and real time mode of game play severely limit micromanagement oppurtunities.\n\nI am very unhappy with the direction crusader kings 2 is going with the dlc's and I will no longer be purchasing them. But even that doesn't stop the new jerk developers because they patch in idiotic things like broken retreat into the game whether you like it or not. I have quite a bit of money wrapped up in this game and the jerks have made it unplayable. The developers are so arrogant and foolish they don't even make their stupid new rules optional.\n\nThis is what happens when you don't allow negative feedback on your forums and fill it with bootlicking yes men. They pretty much ban anybody who makes the slightest criticisms of their games on their forums. Don't believe me go and see. Screw you paradox.

Finally after an hour and a half of going throught the tutorials a second time I figure it out. Start up an empire in Iceland. I don't bother anyone. I marry a Danish girl and help out my father-in-law with a rebelion and a small war but I don't really cause any trubble. The king of Norge (Norway) keeps wanting to start wars though. One day I get a letter, he wants peace as long as I fly his flage. Seeing as my wife was sick and had died a month before and her father was now losing a war I did not have the gold to help him win I had no other choice but to submit and accepted Norge rule. Immediatly the King of Norge invites me to his grand feast. He treats me well and offers me protection and safety. Alpha as ♥♥♥♥ King of Norge fights the Scots who have been bothering me for years. I ask if my son can marry his beautiful daughter who will one day be the Queen of Norge, and without question or hesitation he sends his daughter to Iceland and congradulates me on entering the family. WIth this my son is happy and I can concentrait on my kingdom. Over the next few years I build up a great army and nearly 1000 gold in wealth. However, I am an old man. I fear the fate of my father, I fear that soon I will die. The King of Norge is not a young man either anymore. One day I get another letter. The King of Norge is plaining to invade Scotland. Seeing as my other son married Godwinson (The King of England)'s daughter I was prepared to invade Scotland and claim all of  England and thus most of northern Europe for the King of Norge. I constructed a fleet of ships, hired thousands of men from the country side and some extra mecenaries just in case, and set sail. This time I was prepared for battle, I knew what would come. It was minutes laters as I prepaired my assault that I watched a Scotish fleet came from the deep ocean and landed on my shores and slaughter my people. Half of Scotland fought me in Scotland while the other half banded together and invaded my homeland of Iceland.\n\nAnd that folks is the story of how Crusader Kings II gives you a cookie, lets you eat it and enjoy it before slaping you across the face and wash your mouth out with soap and hot sause.

That’s where things steer into a different direction. This game may well be the best game created by the game smiths at Paradox Development Studio. It’s a huge strategy game with layers. I would suggest running the tutorial in the game. In fact I would also suggest keeping the hints option on, it is full of valuable playing information.Taking place over a 400 year time span the players take on the persona of a character running the realms and struggling to make it in these troublesome times.Throughout the game life, the character deals with the world and other characters of the court, they have stats and traits; they marry, and have children in hopes of conceiving an heir to the throne. That is the main point too, having a legitimate heir to the kingdom. As that first main character grows older and or dies before their time, as long as there is an heir the game goes on to 1452. Hierarchy and the bloodline are of some importance in this game as it was in yee olden days.The game plays in different ways depending on how the player chooses to start. Hierarchy plays a role here. So if the player starts out as a lower rank of the upper class, say a Count, well you have some leveling to do. There is so much information to be had during game play it can be over whelming at times; thankfully Paradox Development Studio has integrated so many buttons and drop downs to assist the player in keeping track of events and information. Plus the game can be paused to take a break or assess the situation. The interface and game play seems polished enough, though the animations took some getting used to.As gaming goes in the grand strategy style, there is some replay ability here, with so much going on, try different playing styles, be aggressive, or less so. See how things turn out, be a tyrant if you like.The graphics of the lands and seas are beautiful to behold, with clouds shadow and weather passing over the lands as you look down from your almost celestial view from above. Sound is pleasing as well, with music and sound bites setting the mood for events appropriately. This is truly one of the better games to come out from Paradox Development Studio, now like most strategy games, things do not progress always at a fast pace. So some patience in gaming is involved here. Crusader Kings II is exactly the sort of game I was hoping it would be. As deep and complex as its predecessor, but more accessible.","December 5, 2014","true","75.2"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","31","33","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/helixcrusader/recommended/203770/","helixcrusader","Helix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/helixcrusader/","31 products in account",""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."\n- Lord Acton\n\nThe Medieval Age wasn't the brightest moment in human history. War, Assassination, Torture, Greed, Betrayal; those are merely some of the words associated with the atrocities committed by the rulers of the realm. Some good and honest men have ruled, but most rulers couldn't resist the temptation from the power they wield; the power to rule. They were tempted to gain more power, and they are willing to use even the most atrocious of acts to gain it.\n\nCrusader Kings II gives players a taste of that power.\n\nStarting at any point from 1066 (Or 769 with a certain DLC enabled) to 1453, players are allowed to choose from a very large amount of historical characters that once ruled over a part of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa.\n\nFrom the lowliest duke to the highest emperor, the game has no final objective whatsoever, leaving players to create their own story and decide their own goals for their dynasty.\n\nDo you want to be the most prestigious family in the world? To work your way up and create an empire that will last for generations? Or simply to make sure your bloodline survives through all the coming conflict?\n\nGrand strategy games typically put players as an eternal invisible guiding force controlling a single country, viewing the world from above as a map as they manage the country’s Politics, Economy, Military, and Diplomacy through various factors. These games use simple visuals to accommodate the large scale gameplay. There are no fancy Total War-like massive battles or anything of sort. Almost every aspect of the game depends on numbers. In other words, the main part gameplay is to manage those numbers and the various factors affecting it to the player’s benefit.\n\nCrusader Kings II offers a sandbox grand strategy experience into a more personal level; giving players control over a single Catholic ruler (later DLCs adds the options to play as Muslim, Pagan, and Jewish rulers) and continue on as his/her heir after passing away.\n\nInstead of dealing with faceless countries, the more personal approach allows the game to have a large amount of characters, be it a lord or a simple courtier. Every character in the game has their own set of skills, traits, and relations with other characters. A major part of the game is managing the relationship between characters by various interactions. You can cement the loyalty of your vassals by keeping them happy with gifts and inviting them to feasts. You can increase the odds of success of an assassination plot by inviting treacherous people within your target's court. You can declare a war for a title your courtier has a claim on. Be wary as other characters could do it to you as well. The best option is to trust no one, not even your friends and relatives. These interactions increase the depth of Crusader King II's strategic gameplay in a very dynamic way.\n\nThe trademark Paradox's grand strategy gameplay is still present, even if somewhat simplified by the time period. Politics are mostly done by the character interactions mentioned above; with the addition of a player-manageable council the players can use accomplish certain tasks. Economy is much more simplified, with very little emphasis on trade. Instead of training units to form standing armies, you form a temporary military force in time of war, then disband them when the war is over. Your military comes from raising levies both from your personally owned holdings and from your vassals. (Retinues were added with a DLC).\n\nReligion plays a major role in the game, with each religion having some unique gameplay mechanic that differ them from the rest; such as the Papacy for Catholics and Decadence for Muslims. While the strategy gameplay itself for most the most part lacks depth compared to other Paradox grand strategy titles, Crusader Kings II still stands on its own as a well-made and unique game.\n\nCrusader Kings II is visuals are simple, yet fitting for the game. The map is fully rendered in 3D, it’s nothing breathtaking, but you can still appreciate the beauty of its landscape; although you'll probably spend most of the time using the political map mode. The character portraits are a great mix of realism and cartoony art style which provides a variety of colorful characters faces.\n\nThe musical score for the game is also worth praising. While not all the music in the game is memorable, they rarely distract you from the game, and for the most part they complement your playthrough with a variety of beautiful music fitting for the era.\n\nThe game is without its flaws, of course. While the tutorial is an improvement from previous Paradox titles, you will still need to learn most of the game’s mechanics on your own by trial or error. While it could be a part of the fun of playing the game, some people may dislike it. I’ve encountered several minor bugs, but the game is fully playable as of now. Another minor complaint is the lack of naval combat. While historically there wasn’t a lot of naval combat at the era, I wish that navies could be more useful such as for blockading ports. But as for the time this review was written, the only use for navies is for troop transport.\n\nDescribing everything about Crusader Kings II’s in detail would take a lot of time and energy. Both of which you could be using right now to purchase and experience Crusader Kings II on your own! (Or at least try the demo) Go and create your own story with your dynasty. Be patient and play as an honest, good natured ruler. Or fall to the temptation of power and spill the blood of anyone who stands in your way. The choice is yours.\n\nDeus Vult.","January 9, 2014","true","23.8"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","32","35","0","4"

They ruined it with this patch. They ruined it with Conclave. I fell into the machine, I bought almost all the DLC (unit packs and songs and content packs excluded) yet they finally broke me. To those of you who know the problems then this was a shattered retreat, a destruction to everything good.\n\nThis is the greatest game of all time before 2.5. Now it is mediocre at best. They keep trying to fix the game but don't realize they are trying to fix things that were never broken. Wars, factions, CHILD EDUCATION. All broken. They add in terrible things that were never there like coalitions. I wish they stopped adding content after horselords.\n\nUnlike most I have an almost inexhaustable wallet for things I like such as this game. Most can't handle these DLC purchases which allow you to use things that should've been in it in the first place. Muslims, Pagans, Nomads, the Byzantine Empire, Republics, Indians. That's a solid chunk of the map unplayable to you unless you continue on with purchases.\n\nThis was a game where you could play 800 hours easy, but now I'm sick of Paradox "improving" the game, and my eyes are open to the money grabbing and micro-transactions which have all but made people hate Total War: Attila. Too many good games have fallen to micro-transactions, it's rude and insulting to us the consumer. Those of you who lay down, eat Paradox's excrement and praise the taste are only encouraging this gross mismanagement of success. I hope this game is fixed, but I will not play it until my grievances are at least somewhat addressed.","February 14","false","901.3"," 50 of 65 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","50","65","3","3"

Such as being a lunatic and appointing your horse as your chancellor, or giving birth to the anti-christ. Also, being an absolute tyrant and just murdering your way to the top.\n\nWhy not discover the "What if" part of history, reclaim the Old Roman Empire, make Britain actually conquer the world, kill the pope, conquer the papacy, restore the persian empire.\n\nDLC List\nSword of Islam [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nLegacy of Rome [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nSunset Invasion [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nThe Republic [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nThe Old Gods [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nSons of Abraham [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nRajas of India [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nCharlemagne [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nWay of Life [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nMods\nJust thought i'd share a couple of the best Crusader Kings II mods with you!\n\nA Game Of Thrones [citadel.prophpbb.com] - Wiki for A Game Of Thrones [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nCK2Plus  - Wiki [www.ckiiwiki.com]\n\nPros Ability to do so much\nThe scale of this game is unbelievable\nA complex and rewarding system of internal and international diplomacy\nAlways challenging\nEncourages storytelling\nOpen-ended structure lets you pursue your own goals\nGreat mods out there\n\nCons Underwhelming campaign ending\nNeedlessly complex\nClumsy interface\nManeuvering large armies can get awkward\n\nRating\nWith all that Crusader Kings II has to offer I'm going to have to give it a\n\n10/10","May 23, 2015","true","21.2"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","34","40","3","0"

That is... if you enjoy micromanaging the holy hell out of every little thing.\n\nIn my version of history, my little kingdom in Ireland of two mighty provinces *cough* I slowly spread my talons into the rest of my mighty emerald isle.  After managing to convince (kill, maim, corrupt, breed out, etc) my fellow lords that I should be above them, I looked to my east.  England didn't exsist anymore... strangely it was now called "Norge".  I realized that the french had broken into 3 seperate countries, and the Holy Roman Empire couldn't keep ahold of itself either.\n\nAfter conquring Wales (which brought me a bit of joy I might add) I slowly looked at the new 'kingdom' of Norge in England. After a crusade (idiots forgot to convert to a christian faith) or two against them, I found myself in control of those silly ex English fools.\n\nMy King died of old age (3rd in his line as king of Ireland) leaving his realm in the hand of a useless pile of filth who couldn't rule a playground, let alone an empire.  With Scotland eyeing England, and my lords constantly trying to demand independence from the little useless fool.  Sad to say all of my work quickly fell into shambles, and I realized that I would never reclaim my former glory with my little idiot at the helm...\n\nSo I did what any good celestial being would do...\n\nI made sure that my spymaster hated me and ultimately provided my king with a very healthy dose of poison.\n\nMy how wonderful my son was.\n\nI highly recomend this game for anyone who enjoys long term eugenics.","November 14, 2015","true","182.8"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","93","27","29","17","0"

Its an awesome game. It develops every single aspect of a strategy game set in the past that are left out of other games. You can have families, friends, allies, non-aggression pacts. You can imprison, execute and banish annoying vassals, you can marry yourself with the daughter of the King of England, and  through the descendants of that union get a claim on his lands. The game is varied, as you an set your game in various time periods across history with hundreds of different factions. You can be a Mongolian Khan or a Holy Roman Emperor just as much as you can be a count in Iceland with no wealth, armies or power. In most strategy games, who YOU in an empire is mostly irrelevant. In the CIV series you're simply a great leader of your nation that rules it forever. Or in the Total war series, you can have a defined character bu everything about him is mostly out of your control or irrelevant. in CK2, all the focus is on your family, as it should be. Your daughters can be married to secure alliances or become great rulers in their own right. Your sons can lead your armies, and can be giving titles you win through war. Some of your sons will love you, others will only try to seize power for themselves. Every single character as a personality, related to their trait that ACTUALLY MATTERS. Be a jerk, become a tyrant and people will hate you, resent you and might even try to murder you This world feels organic and you truly feel a part of it. For all of those reasons, I recommend this game\n\nHowever\n\nIt cant be denied that this game unfortunately has TONS of issues that affect game play. The kind of which will make you want to scream at your screen at how stupid what just happened was. Complete nobodies who actually like you will have you murdered for no reason or  will get themselves 20000 men armies out of nowhere to attack you even tough they don't have a penny on them or apparent claims on your lands.\n\nThe AI can be incredibly stupid! They cant ever hold on to a king title without being crushed by continuous groups of rebellious vassals. After a century, ever single important christian kingdom will have an elective system of law. Why? Because its what theirs vassals want and the AI cant handle rebellions. You want to battle certain foreign dynasties across history? Too bad, the AI is also incompetent at keeping themselves alive for any long periods. Most great houses in say, 1066 will have disappeared in a bout a century  which COULD be considered historically accurate but at the same time it makes you feel like you're playing this game alone with no actual competition. The AI for the pope can be brain dead. Calling crusades against Kingdoms in India, forcing crusaders to cross the Persian desert to reach their target!\n\nThe DLC in this game is horrendous. Its DLC whoring that's EA worthy. You have to pay for portraits and songs in the game!!! PURE AESTHETICS STUFF THAT DOESNT CHANGE GAME PLAY. Are you sick of hearing the same 2 god damn songs in repeat? Pay money.\nThe worst about those DLC is what they offer. Without paying extra, you cant play pagans, you cant play Indians, you cant play muslims and you cant play republics. Thats right, more than half of the starting areas are impossible for the player to play unless they pay extra. Others are simply broken and as such are complete rip offs AND THANK GOD I never bought some of them!! They allow you for 5.49 $ to customize your ruler on regular mode BUT not on Ironman mode. But, thats something you could ALREADY DO THROUGH THE CONSOLE. Its vastly useless! The Way of life DLC makes every single male in your kingdom horny dogs that go after your wife, your heirs wife etc... which means, in a game about dynasties ruling across history, your son might just be the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of some random count who, thanks to the seduction focus, repeatedly slept with your wife 35 times right under your nose. The ONLY way to make sure your wives don't end up sleeping with every single man in the Kingdom is to pick a chaste one (trait that I rarely see and that they often end up losing) or a lesbian. Apparently, according to paradox, all women were ♥♥♥♥♥s in these times! Seeing how they refuse to truly fix this, thats the only conclusion I can arrive to. They tried to with a new "reject seduction attempts" system but since theres always a few master seducers running around it doesn't stop anyone.\nThe conclave DLC makes the game way harder and sooo much less fun. The Republic DLC forces you to use seniority succession and nothing else! Always playing 75 years old? isnt that fun???\nThe Sword of Islam dlc should've been in the base game, same for the old gods. There's no excuses to leave so many factions unplayable even at an 1066 start.\n\nTheres also new updates. Lots of complaints about the new update regarding coalitions that can make pagans, muslims and christians band together against you because you took a duchy through a religious war. They NEVER make coalitions USEFUL agaisnt the AI, this feature is SOLELY used to stop the player from expanding, forcing you to wait 30 f*cking years for infamy to go off unless youre willing to fight 8 nations at the same time. Shattered retreats make your enemies armies magically undestroyable while they basicly have safe conduit back to their territories. Which means, wars now drag for SO FREAKING longer than they need to because you can't kill their armies! You cant pursue them either because you will never have enough supplies and risk losing men needlessly. Sometimes, your own armies will retreat at the WORST POSSIBLE PLACES. When you raid a coast with boats and your raiders gets defeated, they sometimes retreat further in the AIs territory even tough their boats is RIGHT THERE. Theres as of date NO OPTION to turn those off. You dont like them? too bad. You have to use mods on the workshop and disable ironman mode to be able to play without them\n\nIn short?? This game offers SO much and at the same time sucks the fun out of the game with questionable design decisions, horrible dlc, and annoying AI. Is the game fun? Yes. Of course it is. But after several hours, you realize all the shortcoming of this game and you're bound to be annoyed by them.\nBtw, buy this game on a sale, that game is often on sale at 40% or 30% off (cant remember the percentage) Yet every other day its over 200$ to acquire the "full experience".

Expansions are alright, but there is no reason that they have to release other DLC with them. They have already released face packs, music packs, dynasty shield packs, and probably something else that I'm forgetting, and in their latest expansion, Charlemagne, Paradox proved that they are experts at squeezing every last dollar out of their customers. Just when I thought they had run out of face and music packs to sell, they added clothing packs. There is absolutely no reason that these cosmetic changes can't come bundled for free or at a reduced price with the expansions. In total, Crusader Kings II DLC now costs over one hundred and seventy-five dollars. While there is nothing wrong with the game by itself, the DLC model that Paradox uses is horrible, and is only defended by a group of people that have a cult-like devotion to the company.","October 14, 2014","false","460.3"," 159 of 251 people (63%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","63","159","251","6","8"

The corpse of Pope Victor II was removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgement. It was propped up on a throne, and a deacon was chosen to speak for it as its legal representative.\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the accused was found guilty on all accounts and subjected to a punishment most dire. The corpse was stripped of its papal vestments, three fingers on the right hand (those used to give blessings) were cut off, and then it was interred in a graveyard normally reserved for foreigners and low status. The punishment still not being deemed severe enough, the corpse was then exhumed again, tied to weights and cast into the river Tiber.\n\nYour only choice of responce to this news: I am sure the judges have acted wisely.\n\nBruuuh.. the church go hard..

Nothing happened, all my vassals were cool with me. Then I realized my kin in Aragon started to invade the moslems below us. Not wanting to be overpowered by Aragon a century later, I proceeded to take a small coastal province. I then promptly forgot what I was doing and spammed summer fairs and feasts for a decade or two.\n\nWhen my first character died(Alfonso), he had quite the sum of prestige(around 500 or so). And, with the game engine doin' its thing, Alfonso's succesor(his son Alfonso) got around 200 prestige. Following his dear father's footsteps, Alfonso Jr. spammed the ever-loving crap out of feasts and festivals. But, not more then five years into his reign the pope rang him and asked him to join in a crusade against the moslems. Coincedentially, the targets for Christiandom's righteous wrath happened to be the nation directly below me.\n\nSo, of course, Deus Vult and all that. I invaded two small provinces in the first part of the crusade. After conquering these two places, I sat on my bum and waited the crusade out, jealously guarding my newly acquired lands.\n\nThen, suddenly, as though the Heavenly Father himself thanked me for my participation in the crusade, I acquired half of Spain.\n\nNot really sure how.\n\nBut, Now my prestige started to sky rocket. First, it was 300. Then it was 400. Then, 500. 600. 700. And on, and on and on it went until I had nearly 900 prestige by the time I was thirteen. Que another decade or so of me stealing tiny chunks of realms from the muslims that remained in Spain. Not only was I the terror of the muslims, I had backed the nation of Aragon into a corner, with only two land-locked provinces and a handful of coastal lands.\n\nI then married the Queen of France.\n\nAnd, by the time I reached my mid twenties, I was the stuff of legend. Having already held my Grand Tournament and accumulated nearly 2000 prestige, I was on top of the world. Loving wife how owns the entirety of France, promising sons, total alegience of all my vassals.\n\nThen I became a homosexual.\n\nNothing wrong with that, not even my vassals batted an eye at it.\n\nBut they started to get worried when I went insane. Barking at people, wearing shoes as hats, the usual crazyness.\n\nI also happened to be fighting a war with Britain in defense of France at the time, all while manipulating the law to make my son's kingship more secure.\n\nThen I ♥♥♥♥ed up. I failed to see that choosing Senoirity as my inheritance guideline, I completely removed all of my children from the line of inheritence. Instead, It was my cousin.\n\nBut, you know what they say, practice makes perfect.\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nBecame one of the most legendary kings by the age of thirteen, married the queen of France, went insane screwed over my family.

Sadly, I am just not able to anymore. My view of CKII is pretty mixed, so I'll try to give the good with the bad. I'll start with the good first, since I plan to expand more on the bad.\n\nTHE GOOD\n-The map is gorgeous and easily the best looking of all of Paradox's games.\n-Music, even without the music pack DLCs, is pretty great and I've never really gotten tired of it.\n-The history is, at least on the surface, simulated pretty well and I enjoy having some of the weirder and obscure characters in history able to be played like the last Karling, a random Christian ruler in Seljuk Anatolia, and so on. It's nice that they'll include stuff like that even if you can only access it by skipping to a very specific year.\n-The early DLCs, particularly The Old Gods, are genuinely fun. I love playing as the Norse during the Age of the Vikings and it's honestly one of the best parts of the game. It's to the point I almost wish The Old Gods was spun off as a different game (similar to For the Glory) to focus on just that era and expand more into Viking clans, religion, etc.\n-Unlike most I've played Crusader Kings 1 extensively and while there are a lot of steps back from that game, I do like that the council does more than just improve ruler stats. Letting your council micro-manage your realm (before they ruined it with Conclave) is genuinely very fun and makes it feel more like an actual feudal state.\n-It got me, someone who doesn't really like video games enough to be called a "gamer" (most of the games on my Steam are gifts are stuff I bought and never played), to play for 200 hours so that's got to count for something.\n\nTHE BAD\n-First off, the DLCs. Holy ♥♥♥♥, the DLCs. Paradox, when I am expected to pay $15 to play as a Jew, when there are literally fewer than 10 Jewish players to even play in nearly _700 years_ of gameplay, how do you even justify that? Really, the DLCs have turned a good $60 game into a bloated mess that Paradox wants you to pay nearly $200 for. Even as someone with the means to do so, this game does _not_ deserve that price and is simply not good enough for it. I've bought strategy games for the PC that start at $100 retail because they are done with mind-boggingly amounts of research, study, and care. Crusader Kings II is not that good.\n-Besides the price of the DLCs, which is crazy, the amount of content that you have to add on to the game is out of control. Not only does it mean the base game is almost worthless, but that you start to break your game the more you add on to it. It is simply ridiculous and is something that warns off new players when they see mountains of DLC.\n-Patches that you have no control over that break your game. I am one of the poor people who bought Conclave on Day 1 and even though I have since turned it off like any sensible person, the forced patch means that I can't escape some of the worse parts of the DLC whether I want it or not. Paradox breaks your game for you and there is no real way to go back. I miss the days of the old Paradox games when I refused to upgrade EU 3 for over a year until better patches came around.\n-Conclave. Just...♥♥♥♥ing Conclave. If you want to know why it's so bad read one of the other reviews but suffice to say it breaks any sense of believability or historical playability of the game and turns it into a game that is almost impossible to play if you are anything more than a duke, and a minor duke at that.\n-Speaking of which...Paradox, either accept that your games are, you know, games or try to be more historical. You can't be either. Iqta government is not feudalism, CK II can't even begin to simulate medieval economies, and India. Didn't. Work. That. Way. I am a history nerd myself and that's why I enjoy Paradox games, but the way the game has been lately with the recent expansions it is almost impossible to try to play a game historically with the way that CKII works. Economy is a joke, armies don't work how they should, vassals aren't simulated anywhere near realistically, rebellions happen more often than they should for some countries and never for others (I have yet to see the Golden Horde have any problem ruling all of Russia past 1300 and often survives all the way to the end of the game fully intact).\n-A lot of the bad things in the game feel like a step back from Crusader Kings 1, which is one of my best games ever to this day. Events are basically nerfed and pointless now which severely hampers roleplaying, different numbers for a vassal's opinion of you and loyalty are gone which makes holding empires together almost impossible, armies and economy are massively changed and almost never for the better, and in general CK II just feels...less in depth. In Crusader Kings I, despite a smaller scope, I could really get lost into the intricacies of day-to-day rule. By this point in CK II with all the patches I rarely if ever care who my king is and never interact with him. I can't remember the last time it mattered who I marry beyond alliances, even.\n\nOverall, CK II is a slick-looking game with a ton of problems underneath. I keep playing it because it is, on a level, addicting, but it's far too broken and mismanaged for me to totally enjoy it or recommend it. Sadly, since the release of Conclave my playtime has taken a nosedive and it's unlikely I'll keep playing. EU4 is at least fun enough without Mare Nostrum to keep playing but with the forced patches and general unlikeability of the gameplay, I can't say I'd tell anyone I know to play CK II. Oh well, at least we'll always have CK 1.","April 27","false","238.3"," 70 of 104 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","70","104","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_grort/recommended/203770/","el_grort","Grort","http://steamcommunity.com/id/el_grort/","137 products in account","The first thing I did as the King of England was assassinate the King of Scotland. It wasn’t for any particular reason. I had just started running the game for the first time, and wanted to check out the King of where I actually lived. But then I saw the assassinate button. I pressed the assassinate button. There was suddenly a dead Scottish monarch and a massive civil war.\nCrusader Kings II is a ‘Grand Strategy Game’ by Paradox Entertainment, a lovingly created, complex board game of Europe, where you play as historical character. Unlike other strategy games, where you’re the godly hand that guides a country or force, here you’re a Count, Duke, King or Emperor, with all the extra complexities and joys that brings. You have to handle your lineage – marry, have children, assassinate children, change succession laws – so that the game continues. It is the only must in CKII: create an heir, or on death without one, it’s game over. The rest is really up to you. You could try and forge the Empire of Hispania as one of the Spanish Catholic kings, unifying the other catholic nations there and driving out the Muslim rulers. You could play peacefully as the King of Scotland in a different game, only stooping to war when vassals rebel for their own claims on your kingdom. With certain DLC, you could play as Muslim rulers in Africa and Saudi Arabia, Pagan rulers, or even as a patrician, vying for control of the sea highways and port to get the most profit possible.\n\nThe board deserves some explanation also: unlike many other strategy games, which use hexagonal or square tiles, here real counties are used, such as Gowrie, Cumberland, Middlesex, Badajoz, Leon, and Maine. And they aren’t just bits of land to get to make your Kingdom look bigger: they hold cities, castles and religious buildings that will increase the size of you or your vassal’s levies (army) when annexed and your income, from tax. You can even improve and build new holdings in these counties, to increase both of these. This is one of the many ways you spend your gold, along with creating kingdoms and duchies, hiring mercenaries, bribing the pope (yup!), assassinations, ect.\n\nThough out the game, you will be collecting this gold from the taxes, which is the commodity you will be using most often. Also throughout your characters life, he’ll gain Prestige and Piety: both add to your end game score, which you can use to measure just how well you’ve done after playing all those hundreds of years. Both also act like currencies, with you gaining prestige and piety from certain wars and events, but losing them with other events such as destroying kingdom titles (prestige), creating empire and kingdoms (piety) and reforming pagan religions (piety). Upon your characters death, they add to your score – not, however, a reason to die early.\n\nWar is enjoyable in Crusader Kings II, but possibly not as important as in other strategy games. You can’t declare war, willy nilly. You must have a cause for war, the ‘cassus belli’. This at first feels very restrictive, as in some catholic countries, the only clear way to expand into neighbouring catholic nations is through the slow fabrication of a claim on the county. But eventually it blossoms into the complex strategy, as you juggle where to war with, with what cassus belli, to what end. It becomes delightfully full of opportunities. The Catholic Kingdoms can declare Holy Wars against Pagans and Muslims and claim their land, along with participating in the Crusades the Pope occasionally calls. You also have ‘De Jure Claims’, where you can conquer counties and land that belongs to the predefined ‘de jure’ duchies, kingdoms and empires, depending if you are a Duke, King or Emperor. Pagans can conquer any bordering counties, or subjugate entire kingdoms once in a life time. There is a treasure trove of reasons to war. And with your army, you can choose who leads the armies, and whether to engage them in battles against other armies, or to siege enemy provinces in the war. But it isn’t the only way to gain land: ensuring you’re the heir to the kingdom through assassinations and plots; through offering vassalization to the weaker, smaller independent rulers nearby. But wars are one of the more enjoyable points in the game, as long as you know how to handle them. There really is no better feeling than slowly building your independent duchy into a sprawling Empire over the years.\n\nIt is important to say that all the rulers on the map are actively acting towards their own goals, with the games superb AI letting hundreds of characters act and change Europe, even in places far from where you are playing. It is sometimes enjoyable to pause the game, and just look around the map, at what’s happening far away. Seeing distant kingdoms fracture, far of empires grow, really gives the game a sense of scale that is great.\n\nAnd in multiplayer, you can have friends play in any of the Kingdoms, replacing one of the AI rulers. It can be incredible fun, with you playing as different Kingdoms, competing as you expand. You can choose whatever way you want to play with friends – you can assassinate them, declare war on them, or offer to join their wars. If they play as the same culture or religion, you may want to help them, to spread it, or fulfil goals that will help you all. With me and a friend playing Norse Pagans (Old Gods DLC), we started trying to expand my kingdom so that it controlled enough holy sites to reform the religion and grant us much needed security for successions. We’ve also had to aid each other during widespread civil and international war and bail each other out. It’s incredibly satisfying to bail your friends’ kingdom out of an independence war, and know they owe you one when you want to take over a nearby kingdom.\n\nThe downsides of the game is the initial bafflement due to the complexities of how to combine all the systems for your own benefit, and the occasionally irritation caused by wars for the kingdom after succession. Multiplayer also requires all other players must download the host save file every time they play, which can be a slow, but is thankfully all handled in game.\nThis game is one for those who wish to carve a story and a kingdom out of Europe, and are willing to learn through all the complexities and systems to do so. Once the game finally clicks and you’re away with it, it really is a magnificent game. Whole heartedly recommended.\n","January 22, 2014","true","277.9"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

Your character is a ruler. You can rule small counties or huge empires. It's up to you to pick. Now, as you play the game, you need to guide your character to success. You need to make his/her decisions as a ruler, as a general, as a husband/wife or as a father/mother. Every action you make, every decision you take is reflected to the people who surround you and eventually it affects and influences them. You need to be careful who you pick to marry, who you pick to make a pact with or to make war with.\n\nThe target is to become successful, build up your "Prestige" and "Piety" and earn glory and fame for your House. At some point, your character will die. From that point and on, his/hers older descendent will take the position your character left and will try to continue the effort you had put so far. Your new character has new traits, new beliefs, new ideas, new likes and dislikes. You have to take advantage of them and use them to assist you fulfill your plans. Although you can guide your descendents and give them many of the traits their parents had, you cannot create a precise replica of the character who just died. We are all different in this world, aren't we?\n\nThere are only positive facts to mention about the gameplay. Literally nothing negative!\n\nUnlike the Total War Series, you cannot control your army during a battle. You can only tell them to which county you want them to attack. It may at a first glance look like a shallow game but do not be fooled! It has a great depth! In TW, for instance, you cannot control your relationships with your relatives. In CK2 you can. In TW you cannot vote for laws. In CK2 you can.\n\nThe map is literally huge. It includes Europe, the African regions of the Mediterranean Sea and the whole Asia up to India, including India. The game, considering that you purchase a couple of DLCs, offer you the opportunity to play for almost 1000 years (in game) starting from 769 and getting up to 1453. Can you make your House the most successful House in the history of the world? Prove it!\n\nUnfortunately, it gets really interesting and pleasant once you get 2 or 3 important DLCs. To be honest, DLCs make the difference in this game imho. Indeed, Paradox is way too greedy when they ask you around 100 Euros to get all DLCs! Sadly that's the game's only, but in the same time, great drawback.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nSound and Songs: 10/10\nGraphics (not of big importance): 8/10\nHow long you can play it until you get bored (cannot count it): 10/10\nNeed of DLCs: 8/10\nFact that Need of DLCs is very high: 0/10 (i really hate this fact)\nHistorical Backround: 8/10 (much more accurate than the Total War series but still not 100% accurate and this can be seen in the Byzantine Empire)\n\nAll in all, 9/10 simply because there is a great need for the DLCs.","October 20, 2014","true","147.3"," 45 of 63 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","45","63","2","0"

Think Medieval Total War played completely on the overview map but injected with a touch of Civs intrigue and a lot more provinces/factions.\n\nBut that is barely, if ever scratching the surface. If you are a fan of Game of Thrones court politics or a history buff interested in having his own alternate timeline sandbox to play in, you are right at home.\n\nWant to be an English duke who sleeps with the king's wife and then assassinates said king to inherit his realm? You can do that.\nWant to start as a Hindu Indian raja and expand all the way to the Mediterranean while crushing the Arab Empire? You can do that.\nWant to be an ambitious Norse pagan in Scandinavia who amasses enough men to conquer Britain and impose the worship of Odin on all of Europe? You can do that too.\nWant to be a Zoroastrian prince in the Asian steppes who marries the princess of another khan but also has a b:astard son he got with his own sister? Guess what? Fair game.\n\nBefore said description drives you to buy everything, be forewarned.\n1.If this is your first grand strategy game, you have a bit of a steep learning curve in the beginning that, once surpassed, simply makes the game "click".  I absolutely recommend a must watch tutorial by Arumba on Youtube that does a far better job explaining stuff than the otherwise solid in game tutorial. You also might want to start as an Irish count in 1066 to get a hang of the game mechanics.\n2. The base game has come a long way since launch and you can have a solid amount of fun with just it in your library. But the meat of the game and the huge range of choices is locked behind DLC. That wouldn't be too much of an issue if there weren't so many of them. I would absolutely not recommend paying full price for everything - sales are your friends as they usually group a bunch of DLC together for a fair price. You also don't need many of the flavour DLC.\nIf you do buy the base game and decide to get the DLC gradually and later, for the safety of your wallet and for the biggest wealth of content, two are a must and are not expensive in sales - Sword of Islam and the Old Gods. Both unlock previously unplayable factions (aside from India) and Old Gods gives you an earlier starting date in the 9th century which many consider the best one (I tend to agree as Charlemaigne, while starting even earlier, isn't well balanced or pretty to look at). The rest you will get will be mostly based on your interests as each expansion tends to target one group of factions and mechanics.\n\nIf you do have all or most of its content, you might agree with me that this is the most content packed and interesting role playing experience you have or will play in a long time. Simply for the amount of fun, investment and character immersion it is as of now my absolute favorite game of all time, faults and all. If the two points above don't scare you off, give it a chance and you will be heavily rewarded. What is more, the game is probably the best intro to grand strategy games you can find. Europa Universalis IV is another game from the same developer focusing on the Early Modern Era and it has an interesting feature where you can continue your CKII saves in a new time period, potentially making your game last for over 1000 in game years.\n\nJoin in and welcome to CKII!

It's possible to start from 867 with "The Old Gods" DLC.\n\nYou're noble then you should manage only castles or county having a castle in the capital (you could play as mayor if you have The Republics DLC).\n\nThere are 3 types of character in the game nobles, religious and mayors which manage different types of holding and contribute to their liege's economy and armies in different ways. You can't have under your direct control all your lands, because any ruler has a limited number of holdings (demesne limit), beyond that you get huge penalty in relationships.\n\nYou can earn other titles in many ways:\nyou can inherit some lands if you're the heir of the relative title;\nyou can speed up when this happens via plotting or assassination of the title holder or why not all the line of succesion before of you;\nyou can push claim raising war, or even fabricate some or use claims of your vassals or relatives to raise the war and expand your realm;\nor why not decide to have your own antipope, which you can install, therefore having a really thankful pope, and in some conditions it will be even your vassals.\n\nFor catholics the pope plays an important role, because it can excomunicate you or others, call for crusades, conceding divorces or granting you possibility to invade and therefore seize some other title.\n\nThe game has also elements from RPGs, indeed any characters has 5 skills: diplomacy, martial, stewardship, intrigue and learning. And many traits either phisical traits or behaviour ones.  You can try to change skills and traits via proactive actions (ambition and plotting) or via casual events.\n\nEach ruler has a council of 5 people which helps them with specific matters: chancellor for diplomacy, marshall for armies, steward for the finance, spymaster for the intrigues and court chapelan for religious issues.\n\nThere are other aspects in the game like buildings, technology research and ...\n\nAll of these can be done either in single player or mutiplayer!\n\nSo I've just tried to mention the most important to give an idea of what game you'll play, you're advised that this game has a steep learning curve.\n\nI warmly suggest to read the manual, see some let's play and then expirementing, and look for advices, but once you start mastering the game you'll get all the satisfaction and you'll find yourself sinking hours playing without even notice it.","July 28, 2013","true","386.1"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

I think variety is one of the most important aspects in a game and this game provides hells amount of variety and then some. The scenario is constantly changing, and I literally mean constantly changing as feudal lords die, and new rulers take their place and wars coming from the thin of air to turn the balance in their favor.\n\nThe game is complicated to grasp at first, and requires some dedication and willpower to see through the initial shock of all the concepts, but it can very much be compared to team fortress and all the new weapons and learning things bit by bit. Same concept of learning, and if you ever master this game there will always be Europa Universalis IV to move onto with the save converter, or if you're feeling bold, Victoria 2.\n\nStart your character fresh with ruler designer with only yourself to expand it, and in two hundred years it could become THE leading dynasty. Pick up the Old gods and take the Norse sons of Ragnar and conquer Scandanavia and maybe even Britannia, France and the Holy Roman Empire. This is the game where you aren't restricted by anything, and in a series where alternate history is the norm.\n\nEdit: My only concern is that much of the game is locked away under DLC. While I love supporting a developer like Paradox I think I should also offer warning that playing without any expansions will limit much of your variety. I started playing the game when it originally came out and bought the DLC as they came out, but the price will seem daunting to those coming into the game. If you're just coming into the game without knowing anything, I'd recommend grabbing two DLCs in particular: "The Old Gods and The Legacy of Rome."","November 25, 2013","true","210.0"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","1"

The decreased opinion bonuses from vassals make them a hundred times more of a pain in the ♥♥♥, and they seem to remain in factions against me even when their opinion of me is extremely high. I've heard plenty of other complaints about the proper DLC as well, like ruining the child education system and making the council as reasonable as a brick wall.\n\nIt's unfortunate, really. This is such a great game, but this DLC has accentuated everything I didn't like about it and added virtually nothing in return.

I'll begin with the bad. This developer is probably the most guilty of nickle and diming it's customers for DLC. Just look at the price tag of this game 159 USD?? I'm sorry, but no game no matter how good it may or may not be is not worth such a price tag.  So, no I would never recomend this game, nor any game made by Paradox due to it's policy of overpricing, and diving small bits and bobs they've released later after the initial release of the game when they should have bundled most of the dlc available into a proper expansion pack as an honest game developer would instead of taking advantage of the consumer.                    The base game is good enough, the graphics aren't great but not everyone is worried about that. It's good strategy fun but at such a price, no. Do not buy this game, it's only driving prices for our games higher and higher, its bad for the industry and even worse for the consumer.","November 27, 2015","false","143.3"," 59 of 95 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","59","95","7","3"

Expanding into an empire becomes nearly impossible as you try and fight off the entire planet in a holy war for one county.\n\nThe recently added coalition feature might not be a bad idea but its implementantion is appalling. After pressing your claims on a neighbouring area (be that be a county, duchy or kingdom) you find yourself in a similar situation as 1938 Nazi germany. The whole world hates you and is ready to start a world war at a moments notice. The pope will join muslims and pagans alike in this global war against you (despite the fact you are a devout christian) and you will soon find yourself fighting on 4000 fronts at once in a war for a SINGLE province.

Well now I guess you're in Germany so you start all over again. You fabricate some claims, and invite some claimants and land them, allowing you to take land for them that will be added to your overall realm.

Fairly easy to learn, and with all the gameplay improvement and alternative history mods, you'll get plenty of time for your money.\n\nAs someone who's played over 500 hours in Deus Vult, I did find it a little disappointing that Ck2 didn't inflict the same amount of ungodly punishment that the previous games did; One of the best experiences in Deus Vult was getting beat down constantly and getting back up, but I'll be the first to admit it was probably for the best. Ironman is a very interesting feature that suffers slightly from the constant autosaving disrupting gameplay, but this may not be such a big issue if you have a good computer that autosaves quickly.\n\nNow one major concern is the unending horde of DLC. I really don't approve of the direction Paradox Interactive is going with their DLC for Ck2, paying for historical dynasty shields? Ehhhh.\n\nThe game is priced at $40\nTo get all the major DLC's (Expansions) alone costs $55\n\nAs It stands, CK2 is not worth buying full price.

Seduced friends wife but got caught in the act. Friend castrated me as a punishment. 10/10 would give friends wife syphilis again.\n\nIt should be called Walder Frey simulator 2014. Seriously everyone seems to get assassinated at weddings, your spy master is constantly telling you that people are homosexual and you should execute them, your wife is trying to kill you for no reason at all, your 4 year old daughter is married to a 62 year old dwarf from northern Africa, everyone is in incestuous relationships, and you have no idea what is going on. 10/10 game!\n\nAt first a lot of people are put off by the presentation of this game (those who don't play Paradox Grand Strategy Games that is). The closest the majority of gamers (apologies for the generalisation) have gotten to a strategy game is Total War, Age of Empires or Civilisation; games that keep their audiences interested by dumbing down the complexities and keeping audiences hooked with visual entertainment through battle sequences (Please note, I am not criticising; I am a huge fan of these games).\n\nCK2 on the other hand is a colourful map, on first viewing, at best. This is a game that, at first glance - and I'm extending that time period out to your first 2-4 hours with it - seems like a cold, number-driven strategy game. Something only grognards can enjoy, in between tabletop wargame sessions and forum arguments over the finer points of Napoleon's invasion of Russia.\n\nAnd to be fair to first glances, it is. This is a Paradox grand strategy game, one that doesn't just crunch numbers, it grinds them to dust, sprinkles them across 11,715 buttons and menu options and feasts on them. It's an intimidating game to come to grips with, in no small part because Paradox are so terrible at tutorials, and almost as bad at creating intuitive user interfaces.\n\nStick with it, though, and my. Oh my. What begins as a blind exercise in clicking things and getting your ♥♥♥ kicked all over Europe slowly begins to blossom. You start to realise what those little "lustful" and "deceitful" character traits on every character mean. You realise that the marriage system is an entire mechanic built into the game, not some pointless piece of window dressing. It clicks that, outside you own little fiefdom, the game is populated by every single noble, religious figure and courtier across Europe (and most of the Middle East).\n\nIn short, you realise that this isn't a game about war, or empires, or money, or some pre-anointed goal you must achieve to be the "winner".\n\nIt's a game about people. And the relationships between them.\n\nSo why is it so addicting? That's simple, because it's the only game to have ever been developed (successfully) that's about sex and politics.\n\nMost others are about killing. And don't get me wrong, as head of a medieval dynasty, there will be the blood of thousands on your hands when your game is done.\n\nBut in Crusader Kings II, unlike most other games - its strategy brethren especially - the wholesale murder of your enemies is but a sideshow. A diversion. The hammer you break out when all other approaches to victory have failed.\n\nYou don't play Crusader Kings II as some disembodied hand, guiding the fate of a people. You play as, literally, a character within the world, part of a medieval dynasty. You can marry. Have kids. Send them off to be educated. Educate them yourself. Choose your own council. Assassinate people. Arrest people. Chop the head off the people you arrested. Arrest their kids, who revolt after you chopped their father's head off. Ask the Pope to excommunicate them. Arrange your kid's marriages. You can even invite people over for dinner.\n\nEvery time you do one of these things, your relationships with people change, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. They'll remember your past betrayals, and respect your past achievements. So aside from juggling the economy and the military of a Kingdom, you'll be spending as much (if not more) of your time juggling politics.\n\nAnd it's amazing. It's not until you're knee-deep in ♥♥♥-kissing and horse-trading (well, daughter-trading) that you realise, in all likelihood, you've never done something like this before. At least not something like this that works. And it really does work. Sure, it's based on numbers - quite literally, with each character screen giving you two numerical values, one reflecting another's opinion of you, the other, your opinion of them - but those numbers are just the game's way of communicating the complexity of the relationships, and you soon overlook them, reading past the values and seeing the overall feelings and sentiments driving them.\n\nFrom the mightiest empire to the lowliest county, you'll need to keep tabs on those closest to you, lest someone sneak in one night and poison you. Or stab you. Either or. If they do, well, it's game over.\n\nOh, wait, it's not. Because this is Crusader Kings II we're talking about here, and it's smarter than that.\n\nWhen I said you're playing as part of a dynasty, that was only partially true. You are, but you're actually in control of the dynasty itself. So when your first character dies, provided they have a dynastic heir - whether that be a child or close family member - you take over as them, assuming control of not only a new character, but all their own personality traits, history, family and, most important of all, relationships.\n\nSay you're the King of England. You're loved in all corners of the land. But then, one day, you fall from your horse and are suddenly killed. Your son takes over, you think everything is gravy, but then... oh dear. Turns out your son is a homosexual, something jealous enemies can blackmail him (well, you, now) over. You're a coward. A weak ruler. Your wife, probably because of the whole sexual orientation thing, won't give you heirs.\n\nBefore you know it, a once-happy Kingdom is in turmoil as power-hungry nobles attempt to overthrow you. You scrape your armies together, begin to crush the rebellion, advance on the final enemy, and then... you're killed on the battlefield. Your combat statistics weren't as good as your dad's, you see. You take control of your sole heir (who you suspected was someone else's kid anyway, since he was born while you were off fighting), a kid whose regent is even more incompetent than the last King, and before you know it, the throne is lost. You've gone from control of one of the mightiest Kingdoms in Europe to lording it over a few crummy towns.\n\nThis should be game over. Or at least the point where you chuck it in, realising that there's no hope of victory from here. Only... remember, there is no victory. And there's 400 years of history to play through. It's entirely possible - and I know, because I've done it - to go from a King to a nobody and back to a King again in a few hundred years, courtesy of a slow and methodical game of revenge, of marrying the right people, cutting the right people's throats, climbing your way slowly up the ladder of political power.\n\nThat scenario I just described? With heroism, tragedy, intrigue and scandal? It's just one story. From one game. In a complete playthrough of 400 years of European history, from the Norman invasion of England through to the 15th century, you'll encounter dozens more. Start your next game, even if it's in the exact same place, and it'll be a whole new experience. Start it somewhere else on the map and it'll be even more different still.\n\nThe clashes of armies are just as important as clashes in the court or the bedroom, and by pinning a grand strategy game on your relationships with people, Crusader Kings II does just as good a job as George R R Martin has.\n\nHappy gaming!","November 25, 2013","true","628.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","2"

I made inroads into Sweden before taking it entirely (after the then King got taken down by a mercenary army), then married my way onto the throne of Lotharingia and used my new power to take Pomerania - in the process becoming the most powerful ruler in the Holy Roman Empire. I demanded independence from the Holy Roman Emperor who buckled before me, splitting the Empire in two. I basked in glory for several decades (holding several feasts and tournaments) before a massive continental war spanning over ten years, during which my successor lost control of Lotharingia and Pomerania. Once the dust cleared, I had to settle for being Queen of Sweden and Denmark.\n\nBut you don't mind stuff like that happening - playing a count or a duke can be as much fun (and way less stressful) than being a King or an Emperor. I held onto those two kingdoms while gaining Finland, before marrying the Kaiserin of the Holy Roman Empire! Everything was coming up Chris, but then she sadly died in childbirth - leaving my son as the Kaiser.\n\nComparisons to game of thrones in game form are not far off, in fact there is a mod (I haven't tried) and like GOT there is absolutely no guarantees of a happy ending. In my game I managed to become the Kaiser and clung grimly to the throne until the end of the game. All that in just one game - and I haven't even got the latest expansion yet, which adds India.\n\nThe multiplayer is great too, playing with a friend means you can work together and there is someone there to enjoy the narrative with you, and leads you to great stuff like marrying your buddy (in the game) and then cheating on them. Or making them your Master of the Hunt.\n\nOne complaint would be the learning curve, in that I had no idea what I was doing for the first 20 or so hours. Also periods (years sometimes) can go by with not a lot happening, but I just speed it up in those instances. Once you invest 25 or so hours into learning the game, the rewards are amazing.","April 8, 2014","true","155.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebetaplan/recommended/203770/","thebetaplan","The Beta Plan!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thebetaplan/","38 products in account","The title Crusader Kings 2 falls under the so-called grand-strategy games. The term is well-earned in this case and before you start the game be warned that there is a steep learning curve. Do not pick up this game if long-winded games that requires hours of hours to finish is not your thing. Do pick it up if you like games like Civilization, Alpha Centauri, or Europe Universalis. Having said that, and perhaps you do not know these titles, lets get into what Crusader Kings 2 actually is.\n\nLike all grand-strategy games Crusader Kings 2 is (but need not be, I will get back to this) for instance about creating a dukedom, kingdom, or empire, keeping those under you happy less they revolt, and creating a proper army. Unlike many other grand strategy games (outside of other Paradox titles) this game is actually historically correct for medieval europe, the middle east, and India. That is right, did you ever want to play as William the Conquerer? This game gives you that opportunity.\n\nThat immediatly leads to 'need not be' clasule I said before. Unlike other grand strategy games you do not play a 'faction' or a 'nation', but you play as an individuel e.g. Ghengis Khan. The game doesn't end when you die, however, no it follows the rise (and fall) of your family as your dominion grows on the map. Depending on your succesion laws you might be playing as your oldest, youngest, or even a random family member. You might even go super modern and have daughters rule on purpose, not 'just because' the male line ended as was more the case in the time period between 769-1452 AD (which how long the games played out assuming you have two DLCs).\n\nThe game features cultures (e.g. German, Anglo-Saxon, Berber, Russian, Visigothic, and Tamil) as well as religions (e.g. Hindu, Catholic, Coptic, Karasite, Tengri, Sunni, and Germanic) and this including with recently conquered, traits of a person, your history with them perhaps, can all influence what people think of you. Wil you marry out a daughter for an alliance, or perhaps with that genius of a man so you can get him to court and get a good advisor? This is all dependent upon you.\n\nThanks to all these features, as well as the fact that once the game starts randomness kicks in and the historical accurate timeline is lost, means that you will never(!) play the same game ever again. Mechanics wise yes, but give it enough time and the map will look quiet different from last time, different kings and emperors, and perhaps e.g. the Byzantine empire might have fallen by 1100. What will you do? How will you influence medieval Europe? I say it is time to find out and play Crusader Kings 2 for yourself.","January 27, 2015","true","725.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","1"

Given my huge income of 100+ gold from all my vassals, I decided to upgrade Constantinople and many of my holdings. Hours later, I mended the Great Schism by conquering Holy Lands and declaring them mine. Most of Europe became Orthodox and I removed the Pope from his seat, leaving no Christian rulers. I was then known as "The Saint", and gave birth to a long line of Byzantine Emperors who ruled with iron fists, seeking to return the Legacy of Rome.\n\nAfter years of crusading and aggressive expansion into Italy and the Middle East, I reclaimed the old Roman Borders. The Roman Empire was once more established, but Rome was not done. All the land from Constantinople to Egypt, Egypt to Spain, Spain to France, Germany, parts of Russia, and all of Scandinavia were to be conquered. I gained the S.P.Q.R achievement for restoring all that belonged to Rome and more. Much of the Middle East was conquered and pushed back. With an income of 500+ gold a month and trading posts spanning around the entire Empire, I was set.\n\nUntil it all changed, the Golden Horde formed and attacked me after I just finished off the 10th civil war to lower crown authority. The Khan stole a great chunk of land, and I was seriously low on man power. The Golden Horde continued to push foward, while my army was busy fighting off civil wars and religious rises. I finally managed to win my civil wars, and was left with a few years time to rebuild my army. 600K+ troops later with a personal levy of 80K retinues, I took back what was mine and destroyed the Golden Horde.\n\nWith less than 30 years left until end game, I was looking forward to saying I conquered most of the world without cheating. Yeah, not so much. My cousin forms the Kingdom of France and fights for independance, and somehow most of my Empire flocks towards him to rebel against me. My army is cut in half, and I am busy trying to fend off France while also being attacked by mysterious figures that start assassinating my bloodline.\n\nI eventually murder all of my cousins children, excommunicate him, and then murder him. I am victorious, the Great Emperor Buoso II. Little did I know, I had a falling out with the rest of my bloodline for killing a family member. My title is usurped, and I am forced to watch as my Uncle begins to lose Kingdoms worth of land to vassals rebelling against their liege. I assassinate him and try to marry my child into power, but before I can do that his son is also killed by that mysterious assassin. This leaves no rightful hier to the Empire of Rome, and it splits apart again.\n\nEvery duchy, county, kingdom, and what have you in the entire world splits up into over 500+ independant states. Everyone starts fighting for power, and I sit there having just lost a game I spent over 50+ hours on. My jaw drops. My computer couldn't handle the entire world fighting and I eventually just gave up on that game. Crusader Kings II can change in the blink of an eye.\n\n10/10. I'd play that ♥♥♥♥ again.\n\nI have some pictures here (not of my final result, but showing much of the progress).\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/2I9JmLT.jpg?1\nhttp://i.imgur.com/REBviYv.jpg?1\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5nLhLny.jpg?1\nhttp://i.imgur.com/pYaMvOg.jpg?1\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UHs9d9a.jpg?1\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Xcqa26M.jpg?1\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Iy0Tsj8.jpg?1","December 27, 2014","true","390.9"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

For example, this story happened just yesterday.\n\nOne day my character was chilling in a carriage in his old family lands in Hungary when suddenly he was ambushed and taken prisoner by some weirdo in Brittany. The freak tortured my character with rats. What is worse, I had no money to buy my way out of the prison. At the same time, my lovely new wife became pregnant, and, for obvious reasons, this could not be my character's child. After the first daughter came the second and only then my unwitty spymaster uncovered that the weird guy and my unfaithful wife had an affair! Sadly, due to my liege's incompetency in managing the realm, my lands were constantly pillaged by vicious pagan tribes, leaving me with almost no income. Moreover, the regent that was installed to rule in my character's place was a nice and a charitable guy. He shared all of my petty income with the starving and underprivileged. He did not like my character either and never agreed to anything I have asked him to do.\n\nMy poor character ended up in a dark and cold oubliette after his friend tried to rescue him and failed. He soon passed away, betrayed by everyone. He only needed 20 more gold coins to buy his way out...\n\nSoon after the news reached Hungary, king's brother was selected as the new king. Being an envious, lustful and ambitious fellow, he always found his brother's wife to be prettier and more attractive than his own. He immediately divorced and married the unfaithful widow. A few months later, the new king decided to relieve his stress by embarking on a carriage trip to his old family's lands, when suddenly they were stopped on a road by a group of french-speaking hoodlums...","February 21, 2015","true","409.9"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","11","11","4","0"

I am 30 years old and have been gaming since the original Atari console.  When I read reviews about this game I wasn't phased by everyone saying the learning curve was steep.  I have owned mostly every major game console released, as well as have played a few years worth of game hours in PC games.\n\nOn top of that, I have played dungeons and dragons (the dice version with a DM/GM), I have played text-based games such as the original kings quest... I have played many board games, book games, card games... etc... What I am trying to allude to is that I am an experienced gamer with above-average technical and troubleshooting abilities; usually I am the one my friends go to when they need help with figuring something out.\n\nI have spent close to 3 hours in the game and still feel I have no control over what is going on within the game, nor do I feel I have a solid grasp on how to gain control over what is going on within the game.  I understand not being able to just pick up a game and master it... but 3 hours is too long to spend in a game to still be constantly feeling at a loss in trying to do something and not being able to do it.  I can play the game, but I in-no-way enjoy constantly feeling frustrated because I'm trying to do something that I can not do.\n\nI no longer have the time I had when I was younger to play games, so when I play a game, I want to enjoy it.  I feel I would need to invest a minimum of 10 hours into this game, just to have a solid grasp on how to play it.  That is too much for me, considering most modern non-rpg games can be beaten in less than 10 game-hours.\n\nI'm not saying I'm not willing to invest hours into a game, as I've invested close to 120 game-hours into some of my games... but I have searched for more reviews and people, like me, have also had major difficulties in understanding how to manipulate the game (even when some people who are experienced in playing the game helping them).\n\nFor me... with the horrible tutorial... the insanely large amount of "buy in" time required to learn the game... this game just isn't worth it.

Infidel armies were crushed underfoot, provinces fell one by one, and the petty emir's begged for peace as the Byzantine Restoration swept to all shores of the Mediterranean. "Good!," I said, "this was getting too easy!" when the Sunni's finally declared a jihad. My forces took the initiative and several large mercenary companies and 20,000 Byzantines landed near the Nile before the first infidel armies even reached my borders. Small muslim armies were swatted away as they attempted to repel my invasion, but they were no match for my men as we ravaged the Egyptian delta.\n\nThe Shiites declared their own jihad against the recently "liberated" sicilian holdings a few months after we landed in Egypt. "Whatever," I chuckled, "the mighty sons of Rome do not fear a these desert men!" I recruited more mercenaries and landed in Sicily just as the first Shiite armies began to trickle in by boat. Each month brought a fresh wave of infidels and we crushed each attack and pressed on with the sieges.\n\nBut months turned in to years, and the trickle of muslim armies became a steady stream of larger and larger enemy armies. My fleets began to frantically criss-cross the Mediterranean, ferrying whatever regiments I could spare from theatre to theatre to counter each wave. My men were winning every battle, but we were losing soldiers faster than they could be replaced. I watched in disbelief as my army and Varangian core in Sicily was overrun, trapped, and annihilated, and the Shiites crossed the strait to capture my holdings in Italy. Then my armies holding eastern Anatolia were forced to pull back to a defensive line near the Bosphorus as large muslim hosts pressed towards my capital. My Egyptian invasion force had been significantly weakened by endless waves of Sunni's, and the desert sun was killing even more. I evacuated Egypt and pulled back the remaining armies to regroup in Greece.\n\nMy war chest was also running out, which forced me to disband the remaining mercenary companies to keep them from rebelling, and scrapped large portions of my fleet. My disbelief turned to horror as the Shiites landed in Greece and the Sunni's crossed the Bosporus and laid siege to Constantinople. I gathered what remained of my fragmented forces, nearly 20k men, around Athens and won a close battle over a large Shiite force that had crossed into western Greece, and finally convinced the desert men to agree to peace in exchange for the Sicilian duchy I had won years earlier. My men then charged north, defeating a small muslim host that surrounded Constantinople and relieving the city for a few months. But another Sunni host of some 50k crossed the strait soon after, forcing my army to retreat and threatening to destroy my last hopes for the Restoration. The situation had gone from dire to impossible.\n\nAnd that is when they appeared- A force of 50k imperials arrived on a fleet outside my capital, led by the Kaiser himself. A few years into the war, I had arranged for my son to marry the daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor in the west, and although he had officially joined the war in my defense, up to this point, I had only seen a few small inneffective armies in Italy. I marched the last sons of Rome north-east, and joined battle just as the Kaiser landed at the head of his great army. Together we overpowered and crushed the muslim forces, and the Kaiser's fleet prevented a muslim escape into Anatolia. The infidels were completely destroyed. Soon after, the Sunni's finally agreed to a white peace that left my Eastern empire intact. I never forgot that the true sons of Rome had been saved by the pretenders in the west, and our alliance lasted for generations until the new Roman Empire and the title of Augustus was finally restored.\n\nFor those of you wondering, this did actually happen during my play through way back in 2013 and it was the reason I became hooked on CKII until I eventually graduated to Europa Universalis 4. This game is unique in the strategy genre and I would recommend it to people that enjoy the Total War series, but always wanted more depth in the character aspect of the game (e.g. Kings, Princes, and Generals). If you are on the fence about this game, then check out a few of the Game of Thrones mod videos on youtube- I never played the mod, but watching the LP's sold me.

This game is addictive as all hell. It is a pure character role play orientated game where you play generation from generation of your family throughout the dark ages with everything revolving around how YOU as the player mould your character and his/her successors. This does mean that a single playthrough from just 1066 to 1453 can take in the excess of sevral days.\n\nHave you ever wanted to play as a Spaniard with Russian culture who is a staunch believer of the Zoroastrian faith and conquer Germany? In this game, you can! That is just the tip off the iceberg of insanity. I have had a succession war with my 1st born son who was also the SPAWN OF SATAN, literally a hell baby.\n\nNow understand this game can be daunting to new players especially because there are no real good tutorials provided by the game. That is definitely a shortfall and has to be made up with Youtube tutorials or experienced friends who play the game. The other problem is how random some events can be which can royally screw over a fresh game. I wont go into details but I am sure many of my fellow players can recount situations the destroyed their games. Also It pretty much a requirement to get game mechanic DLC such as Old Gods and the Republic to get the most out of the game.\n\nThat is the only real problems I can think of with the game. Otherwise its an excellent game with challenges and character driven role play. Fantastic modding community always re-inventing the game and extending the hours of life this game has.

You are buying a platform for DLCs which are the vast majority of the game. Paradox restricts you very tightly as to whom you can play, and when you can play, and what you can do if you do not buy hundreds of dollars of DLC. I personally think Paradox's DLC model on this is very unethical and would not reccomend this game to anybody who wanted a full game for a reasonable price. You can only play as western christian rulers from a relatively narrow timespan if you do not have dlc. Paradox seems to have gotten better with this, as EUIV has a DLC model that allows a full gameplay experience without DLC, but the DLC enhance it, but this is just a demo to make you want to buy dlc.","February 10, 2015","false","132.1"," 77 of 136 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","77","136","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/recommended/203770/","mrluchador","Chris","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/","1587 products in account","Crusader Kings II is a Grand Strategy game based around familiy dynasties, political power mongering and in short - trying to make sure you have the biggest wealthest family in the world. The game spans ~400 years of historical time between 1066 to 1453 and offers historical events and references that you can either choose to follow or create a new alternantive timeline from. Do you start a 'War of the Roses' battle? Does YOUR family takeover the Papal?\n\nBuilding relationships, marriages, alliances and faking claims is the key. If this sounds all very Game of Thrones then you're right - it is. Crusader Kings II is the best GoT game on the market at the moment, and that's all thanks to engine being used.\n\nCrusader Kings II is the end result of many years of creating and improving on Paradox's Clausewitz Engine (the engine responsible for Cruaders Kings, Europa Universalis, Hearts of Iron franchises). If you're familiar with those games, you might feel familiar with CK2, but the truth is this game goes beyond what the engine has produced before hand.\nThe Clausewitz Engine is in sense the major selling point behind CK2, so while the graphics aren't anything special (and are little more than 3D Marker Pieces) the true beauty unfolds as you play.\nI can't think of many greater feelings than the moment you're 50 year plotting to get your Grandson into place of power from his lowly Duke title to Lord pays off. Sending your Master of Whispers into a neighbouring region to spread lies and cause dissent amongst the vassals, while you forge a plot to fabricate claims to the title and ursurp the Lordship. So good.\n\nParadox have managed to support the game well since release in the form of DLC Expansions, which have opened the game world up and expanded the 'fringe' empires to be just as complex as the 'key' European ones. However they've also supported the game with post-release patching and balancing, so they're not ones to sitback and take your money.\n\nI'm honestly finding it hard to explain this game, the only advice I can give is; if you've ever wanted to play the Game of Thrones this is the closest you'll ever get. In fact, do yourself the pleasure of visiting: http://citadel.prophpbb.com/forum3.html and checking out the amazing Game of Thrones mod these guys have been making over the last year or so (WARNING: May contain spoilers for TV viewers).","April 26, 2014","true","417.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

Maneuver nobility relations as you seek to expand the power and prestige of your dynasty, generations after generations.\n\nPros: Where to begin? There are countless characters (thousands): barons, counts, dukes, kings, courtiers, family members and everything in between for every city, barony, county, tribe, sheikdom or other political region denominator. Relationship behaviors are based off a multitude of character and personality traits. You manage a character, and upon death his heir, then his heir, through centuries of history as kingdoms and empires rise and fall, acquiring lordship over titles through conquering armies, political weddings, intrigue and backstabbing. The base game is set specifically for Europeans during the crusades, while expansions add Northern Africa, Middle East, Scandinavia, Western Asia and India, with each distinct culture and religion having its own tribal, feudal and monarchic mechanics. Many random events allow you to determine what type of person your current character becomes, engrossing you in the story of each of them, influencing and determining the fate of any trivial or world changing event. The game is regularly and constantly being updated: I'm not only referring to the multitude of DLCs that add historically accurate ethical portraits and cultural armory, but actual core mechanics are regularly revised, enhanced and added to by the developers. The game is fully open-ended, and leaves you to determine your political goal. Do you wish to rebuild the Roman Empire? Unite Great Britain? Overcome enemies in a world-wide crusade? Overthrow the Pope? Found Ukraine? Survive the Mongol onslaught? Endless possibilities!\n\nCons: The game has a high learning curve, and new comers must be willing to put in hours of learning, trial and error, and tutorial reading to understand how every mechanic works. Graphics are passable, barely enough to serve the game's purpose. Even at easier levels, difficulty remains high and players must be willing to go through constant frustrations as you are limited to decisions your character makes as a single person, which means there is no direct control over the outcome of battles, plots and events. The game can be slow at times, sometimes requiring months, years, decades and even generations of in-game time to bring any plan to fruition.\n\nVerdict: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.\n\nThis game isn't meant for everyone. It requires a lot of patience and dedication. But the game can also be immensely rewarding when you successfully achieve your goals. This game left me retelling the tales of how, as a count, I married my firstborn son to a duchess so that my grandson would inherit the king's throne (and expected to play that character two generations later), just to have my second son get branded as a kinslayer for killing his eldest brother, becoming my new heir and throw my entire plan to smithereens! The game is addictive, so if you have the patience to play through Cruisader Kings II's demo tutorial, you just have to get the entire game!\n\n—————————————————————————\nThis was just my opinion.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.","November 22, 2014","true","275.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","10","12","3","0"

In particular the move to the Clausewitz engine needs a mention because it allows a game like Crusader Kings II to fully achieve it's potential in a way the previous game never could.\n\nThe game is a dynastic Grand Strategy game. This means that while you still take control of a single country like in other Paradox games are you not just some faceless entity behind the screens, you actually take control of that country's ruler and upon his or her death, take control of the legitimate heir to continue your reign. This makes controlling a country and leading it to greatness a much more personal experience as it's your family that's leading the charge, with the various offshoots that didn't manage to become King constantly plotting how to remove the current favorite.\n\nIn general much of the game will be spent dealing with your family and their thirst for power. Through a number of laws you can select who is the heir and how he or she is chosen and you can fully expect that anyone who doesn't not currently top that list will be working diligently to remove the one that does. And it's not always the best outcome when your able and strong son suffers an untimely accident and your gluttonous greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who is surprisingly proficient at intrigue becomes the last heir standing.\n\nLike in most of Paradox's games warfare takes the front seat and it is the prime method for which to expand your lands, wealth and prestige. However Crusader Kings, through this dynastic system makes great strides towards making peacetime more interesting. The bigger your family, the more vassals you have, the more options will be available to you during peacetime and you will often have to work hard to keep your Kingdom stable. The option for marrying off unwanted sons to powerful widows is also a very effective way to increase your lands as you may one day some generations from now find yourself the heir to whole new territories. Quicker with a little creative assassination.\n\nThe graphics of the Clausewitz engine are beautiful although that is never really a necessity or a priority of a Grand Strategy game, particularly not a Paradox one, but it is nice to see that there's improvement on this front as well. The music is heavily mood setting and wonderful as always and the many small music DLC's available helps improve the selection tremendously.\n\nAll in all, Crusader Kings II does not disappoint as it proves itself a great sequel to a great game. Everything is simple better. A true must buy for any fans of Grand Strategy or Dynastic games. And for anyone that simply thinks incest is hilarious.\n\nAlso, completely irrelevant to the game, I'd strongly recommend that you go watch the "Seven Deadly Sins" trailers on youtube that were released as promotional material before the game came out. They are definitely worth a watch whether you want to play the game or not.","November 13, 2012","true","441.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Artifical Intelligence may destroy and enslave you. ENSLAAAVEE. It's a good game. You work with a dynasty. Your dynasty. In Europe and Africa. In High and Late Middle Ages. 1066 - 1453, 867 - 1453 with the DLC "Old Gods". You rule a country: From a small province to the greatest empire. You have your heirs, inherit laws and everything other, from taxes starting.\n\nThere are five levels of authority in the game; the four highest of which are playable at the start:\n- Emperor, Kaiser, Basileus, Shahanshah, Khagan (highest ones).\n\n- King, Shah, Despot, Sultan, Serene Doge, King Bishop, Khan, Prince Mayor. The title 'King' is equivalent to the title 'Archduke' if the holder bends the knee to an Emperor or person of equivalent title.\n\n- Duke, Doux, Satrap, Emir, Doge, Grand Prince, High Chief, Prince Archbishop, Grand Mayor, Jarl, Petty King, Caliph.\n\n- The second lowest rank is that of the Count – variations are Earl, Sheikh, Wâli, Marzban, Chief, Lord Mayor, Prince Bishop, Metropolitan (Orthodox).\n\n-The lowest in-game rank of authority is that of the Baron – variations are Timariot, Shaman, Mayor, Bishop, Patrician – of which only Patrician is a playable rank if the player owns the The Republic DLC, as the government of only a single holding with no non-commoner courtiers to command would provide the player with very few or no opportunities for intrigue.\n\nThe basic provincial unit of the game is the "county". Each county contains a preset number of holdings, with the maximum being seven holdings in a single county, including the comital capital. The holdings can be of three types: castle, city or temple holding. A castle is ruled by a baron, a city is ruled by a Mayor, and a temple is ruled by a bishop (each one having their own cultural and religious variations, such as the Muslim Mosque). Generally, a county has a capital set on a barony, but some counties (most notably in Italy) have city or temples set as the capital (ex: Rome is a temple-capital county and Venice is a city-capital county). As the player incorporates a lay nobleman, it can only exert control adequate over counties with castles as capitals or he'll suffer the "wrong holding type" penalty in revenue – thus, city and temple holdings must be given to mayors and bishops. Exceptionally, Muslim rulers can control Mosques, which grant piety points. If the player owns The Republic DLC, the player can also take control of a coastal republic, like Venice, Genoa, The Hansa, Gotland or Cherson. In this case city holdings, instead of baronies, can be held without penalty.\n\n\nRealm Laws\nThere are two kind of laws in the game: the Tax and Levy laws – which determine the taxes your vassals (feudal, burgher and clergymen vassals) must pay, and also the number of levies they must provide – and the Succession Laws – which can be of two types: gender and inheritance laws. Succession laws are of fundamental gameplay importance, as the game over condition is the player's inability of establishing a dynastic heir. As a rule, succession is patrilineal, which means marriage offsprings will always be from the father's dynasty, but there is the option of matrilineal marriages for female characters, which means the offspring will be from the mother's lineage.\n\nGender Laws are the following:\nAgnatic – Only males inheirt\nAgnatic-Cognatic – Females can inherit, but only if there are no eligible male heirs.\nAbsolute Cognatic – Women inheirt on the same grounds as men do. (this type of succession is only available to Basque culture characters and the rulers with Cathar religion)\n\nHowever, although Paradox added Enatic (males are entirely excluded from succession) and Enatic-Cognatic (females have preference) succession, these are only accessible through modifications to the base game.\n\nInheritance Laws are:\nGavelkind – The most common law, in which the inheritance is divided among all eligible children, the oldest inheriting the primary title. This succession type allows for a 30% larger demesne, the disadvantage is that it fractures the demesne upon succession.\n\nFeudal Elective – The heir elected by vassals holding elector titles inherits all titles.

Artifical Intelligence may destroy and enslave you. ENSLAAAVEE. It's a good game. You work with a dynasty. Your dynasty. In Europe and Africa. In High and Late Middle Ages. 1066 - 1453, 867 - 1453 with the DLC "Old Gods". You rule a country: From a small province to the greatest empire. You have your heirs, inherit laws and everything other, from taxes starting.\n\nThere are five levels of authority in the game; the four highest of which are playable at the start:\n- Emperor, Kaiser, Basileus, Shahanshah, Khagan (highest ones).\n\n- King, Shah, Despot, Sultan, Serene Doge, King Bishop, Khan, Prince Mayor. The title 'King' is equivalent to the title 'Archduke' if the holder bends the knee to an Emperor or person of equivalent title.\n\n- Duke, Doux, Satrap, Emir, Doge, Grand Prince, High Chief, Prince Archbishop, Grand Mayor, Jarl, Petty King, Caliph.\n\n- The second lowest rank is that of the Count – variations are Earl, Sheikh, Wâli, Marzban, Chief, Lord Mayor, Prince Bishop, Metropolitan (Orthodox).\n\n-The lowest in-game rank of authority is that of the Baron – variations are Timariot, Shaman, Mayor, Bishop, Patrician – of which only Patrician is a playable rank if the player owns the The Republic DLC, as the government of only a single holding with no non-commoner courtiers to command would provide the player with very few or no opportunities for intrigue.\n\nThe basic provincial unit of the game is the "county". Each county contains a preset number of holdings, with the maximum being seven holdings in a single county, including the comital capital. The holdings can be of three types: castle, city or temple holding. A castle is ruled by a baron, a city is ruled by a Mayor, and a temple is ruled by a bishop (each one having their own cultural and religious variations, such as the Muslim Mosque). Generally, a county has a capital set on a barony, but some counties (most notably in Italy) have city or temples set as the capital (ex: Rome is a temple-capital county and Venice is a city-capital county). As the player incorporates a lay nobleman, it can only exert control adequate over counties with castles as capitals or he'll suffer the "wrong holding type" penalty in revenue – thus, city and temple holdings must be given to mayors and bishops. Exceptionally, Muslim rulers can control Mosques, which grant piety points. If the player owns The Republic DLC, the player can also take control of a coastal republic, like Venice, Genoa, The Hansa, Gotland or Cherson. In this case city holdings, instead of baronies, can be held without penalty.\n\n\nRealm Laws\nThere are two kind of laws in the game: the Tax and Levy laws – which determine the taxes your vassals (feudal, burgher and clergymen vassals) must pay, and also the number of levies they must provide – and the Succession Laws – which can be of two types: gender and inheritance laws. Succession laws are of fundamental gameplay importance, as the game over condition is the player's inability of establishing a dynastic heir. As a rule, succession is patrilineal, which means marriage offsprings will always be from the father's dynasty, but there is the option of matrilineal marriages for female characters, which means the offspring will be from the mother's lineage.\n\nGender Laws are the following:\nAgnatic – Only males inheirt\nAgnatic-Cognatic – Females can inherit, but only if there are no eligible male heirs.\nAbsolute Cognatic – Women inheirt on the same grounds as men do. (this type of succession is only available to Basque culture characters and the rulers with Cathar religion)\n\nHowever, although Paradox added Enatic (males are entirely excluded from succession) and Enatic-Cognatic (females have preference) succession, these are only accessible through modifications to the base game.\n\nInheritance Laws are:\nGavelkind – The most common law, in which the inheritance is divided among all eligible children, the oldest inheriting the primary title. This succession type allows for a 30% larger demesne, the disadvantage is that it fractures the demesne upon succession.\n\nFeudal Elective – The heir elected by vassals holding elector titles inherits all titles. This type gives an opinion boost to vassals, but it might have an heir not from the players dynasty—therefore ending the game.\n\nSeniority – the oldest dynasty member inherits all titles. The disadvantage is that it usually results in elder characters inheriting, potentially creating a quick succession of short-lived rulerships.\n\nPrimogeniture – the firstborn child inherits all titles, in depth-first search descent. Arguably the most advantageous inheritance type, but it incurs in a slight prestige penalty for landless progeny.\n\nAgnatic Open/Turkish Succession – available to every Muslim character (and also the only type of succession available) – the son that holds most titles inherits all his father's titles.\n\nPatrician Elective (With The Republic DLC) – the only succession type for Merchant Republics – the heir is decided upon by a calculation of age, prestige, and a unique campaign fund feature from the 5 patrician families. Only males can inherit.\n\nInvestiture - only succesion law for bishoprics where the successor can be appointent by the ruler if under Free Investiture or by the Pope if under Papal Investiture. If there is no appointed heir then the game will chose character from the court of the bishop or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the bishops court.\n\nElective Open – the only succession type for Republics (and also some types of holdings under the player level) – the game will chose a character from the republic rulers court or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the mayors court.\n\nTanistry – open to Celtic Culture group which, like the Elective system allows vassals to choose the heir but restricts the choice to members of the current holders dynasty.\n\nUltimogeniture – the default succession type for Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the barony of Altenburg, in which the youngest child of the ruler inherits all the rulers titles upon their death.\n\nAppointment - Used by Holy Orders feudal vassals called Commanders.

CKII used to be one of the premiere Grand Strategy titles available.  Sadly, over the course of several expansion/DLC releases the game has lost its way, becoming increasingly tedious and straying far from the original wonderful gameplay.\n\nThe Conclave DLC and the accompanying free content patch was released completely unbalanced and apparently largely untested.  It caused a widespread negative reaction which forced Paradox to immediately begin work on a fix patch.  That patch, now in open beta testing, goes a long way toward fixing the worst of the problems.  Unfortunately, it doesn't go far enough.\n\nThe root of the problem is that the entire concept of Conclave makes councils far too powerful.  The intent of Paradox seems to be to make the game more difficult and thus hinder the ability of players to "paint" the map all in the color of their empire.  The intended result was achieved.  And now the game is a mess of micromanaging council votes and council favor which detracts from the initial design concept of a fun game focused on dynasties and war in the medieval period.  Paradox might as well change the name of the game to Crusader Kings II: The Council -Hindered, Blocked and Trolled.  The game is no longer focused on dynasty and conquest and religious fervor in the medieval milieu.  Now it is just a grumpy, greedy pseudo-democracy council simulator set in a medieval era with the player forced into spending inordinate amounts of time dealing with fractious, constant council problems almost to the exclusion of everything that once made this a great game.\n\nCongratulations, Paradox.  The greed pushing a need to continually release more DLC to line corporate pockets has finally sent the core game into oblivion. You succeeded in satisfying a vocal minority who wanted the game to be more difficult (with no proof that many of those who complained had even played the game beyond the Easy setting).  In return, you've so drastically altered the basic gameplay that Crusader Kings II is no longer really about Crusader Kings.  You've turned a fine Grand Strategy game set in the medieval period into something entirely different. Short of removing the Conclave DLC and the free content expansion entirely, there is no fix for this.  The game has moved too far from its original design concept, which attracted many of us to the game in the first place.  There are other better democracy simulators available.  They aren't Grand Strategy games; but neither is Crusader Kings II since the changes of the last expansion.","January 1","false","821.2"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","3"

Crusader Kings II is an ambitious strategy masterpiece full of intrigue, diplomacy, and war. The player controls a single noble dynasty through the European middle ages in a world as changeable as it is engaging.\n\nOne word I would definitely not use to describe Crusader Kings II is ‘accessible’. When I first started the game, I had to sort through dozens of menu screens and tabs trying to figure out to do. I can’t be sure, but at one point I think I accidentally attempted to abdicate the Duchy of Kent in favor of my Norwegian half-brother. There certainly were helpful messages and tips in great abundance, but if I really wanted to spend an hour reading, I would be downloading O. Henry short stories, not starting up a new game.\n\nOnce you do get the hang of the controls, though, Crusader Kings II opens up to almost endless possibilities. You can expand your dynasty by clever power play, strategic marriages, or through military force alone. If you work hard as an impoverished count, your grandchildren could be kings and queens. In a game revolving around diplomacy, however, the AI can be a little off-putting in its lack of complexity. While computer players are reasonably clever, they always make the most rational choice, which makes you feel a bit out of place as you attempt to coerce an Arabian sheikh to help you to invade Sweden.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about, unless you wanted to let your folks know that games can be released in 2012 and still run on any computer more advanced than an abacus. The Crusader Kings II interface is basically a detailed map surrounded by different menus. If you weren’t wearing your glasses, it would look a lot like Total War, only you can’t zoom in for battles- all physical conflict is resolved off-screen as you watch the number of troops still alive decrease. The constant music definitely helps to distract from the less-than-interesting graphics. The same tracks are played over and over, but they’re epic enough to make it worth it.\n\nThe beautiful thing about Crusader Kings II is the way it generates stories through emergent gameplay. Take King Tudwal the Great, who loved gardening but would occasionally fly off the handle and kill his own family members, or Count Oberto, who despairingly turned to a scholarly life after failing to find a bride for his homosexual nephew. These aren’t characters you find in most Triple-A games.\n\nIf you only want to relax for a few minutes, you would probably be best served playing Plants vs Zombies, but if you want to spend a challenging 400 years taking over medieval Europe through vilest treachery, Crusader Kings II is without rival. Now if you’ll excuse me, my uncle just raised the banners of Scotland in rebellion against his Welsh overlords.","November 25, 2013","true","77.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

In fact, I haven't even managed to run through a full game yet, that is both from the DLC-given 769 Charlemagne starting date and the vanilla 1066 date, and I like to consider myself a competent player - atleast I would hope so by this point... BUT, by my sweet black baby jesus' grace, it was when all of this hit me that I decided to write this review.\n\nThat is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n\n400+ hours of gameplay, nearing 500, and I still haven't managed to finish a game?\n\nCK2 is the ultimate strategy out there. It doesn't recquire particularly acute battle-planning however, that is all done by a simple combat simulator and AI Martial Ability, no. This sort of strategy is that of court intrigue, seducing the Queen of Lombardy and marrying her so your heir becomes King of Italy whilst also coming from a family of barbaric Norse pagans?\n\nWhat? The predominantly Catholic Italians don't like the idea of having a Pagan King and try revolt against you? Beat them down then, that's what your well groomed retinues are for.\n\nBut still your Council might find themselves growning a tad bit agitated with your ritual sacrifice of their fellow Christians and might attempt to, instead of overthrowing you competely, limit your power with diplomacy and the use of a strange concept. Democracy. Well, ♥♥♥♥ them, send your spymaster with his seditious intent to capture or kill them.\n\nAll this in the meagre period of twenty years.\n\nWho knows what other trials, tribulations and resounding triumphs, await you upon your purchase of this game?\nWell to answer that.

IMO the republic dlc, the old gods dlc, and legacy of rome are the most worthwhile and neccesary dlc. The rest mostly just come down to personal preferance and what you think you will play.\n\nYou can find plenty of mods on the paradox forum including a game of thrones westeros mod (the whole time i was playing vanilla i was wishing there was a game like that and when i found it on the forums i was ecstatic).

PET here with my Crusader Kings II review!\n\nFirst of all this is a hard game to pick up but once you do it will create one of the best and unique experiences you ever encounter (in video games lol).\n\nIf you follow my video at the end of the review I guarantee you will be able to pick up the game. If not...\n\nCK2 is a Grand Strategy Game. You will start around year 1100 and play until around 1300 (don't remember the exact dates. You can change the start year but the end year will be the same).\n\nCK2 is a game about your dynasty, about politics, about your vassals and about surviving your dynasty. One of the reasons why this game is hard is that it does not give you a purpose. You can do whatever you want and this might be confusing to some people. You will get that "now what?" experience. Not only that but you will be able to play with any king/duke/count in Europe. As you see I wrote a person title and not a country. Why? Because in CK2 you play with a person from a dynasty. Your purpose is to expand your dynasty, marry your sons so they can create children, marry your daughters to other powerful rulers so you will have a claim on that territory... oh yes yes...\n\nCK2 follows the feudal system and that's one of the reasons why people find this game hard. For example you can not declare war on another person without having a De Jure claim. What does that mean? Well it means that you are entitle to that territory because you might have a title that contains that territory. Oh yes, you have titles.\n\nReally, I think it's much easier to just watch my review & tutorial here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYoByvot6K0\n\nBut trust me guys, this game is simply amazing. Once you learn the basics you will be able to have an amazing time.\n\nThanks!","November 25, 2013","true","108.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Because it's a masterpiece. I can comfortably say this is the overall best game I have ever played. Maybe I'm a history nerd, maybe I like maps, maybe I enjoy imprisioning and killing all my relatives so that little genius baby boy can have a shot at becoming the first Breton to rule all of Western Europe. Could be there's something cathartic about converting to Cathar just so you can launch a holy war against the Pope who gave you all your power with that invasion CB against the HRE in the first place. Maybe it's the strategy, so deep that I still find myself looking to the wiki to find the most efficient way to conquer. I might get a little too into the roleplaying, would my kind, charitable, humble, Catholic duke really execute his own son just because he's a drunken imbecile? I know I'm not entirely sure what keeps bringing me back, but I do know that the sheer replayability of this game is staggering.

I never played the original Crusader Kings, but Crusader Kings II has been one of the most consistantly enjoyable experiences I've ever had with a strategy game. Even with 150 hours under my belt, I'm still gaining skill, and with every DLC, I'm encountering new events and new ways to play. Even the base game is a delight to play, but unlike many other games, the DLC is actually worth having, and every major DLC expansion adds a new dimension to the gameplay. When I first started playing, even with just a couple of hours of experience, I knew enough to be competitive. If you're new to Paradox Titles, I'd suggest checking out a "Let's Play" on YouTube, or reading T.J. Hafer's wonderful "Crusader Kings Chronicles" on the PC Gamer web site. The game is a sandbox, so your goals are your own. You can try to create an Empire, or you can just try to hold on to what you have at the start of the game. You can use military conquest to expand your holdings, or you can strategically marry and assassinate your way into greater power. Your options are limited only by your cunning and imagination.\n\nBut it's so much more than just a strategy game. It's also got roleplaying elements. Every character has a set of five stats that range from 0 (totally incompetent) to 20 or higher (genius) that determine how he or she runs their County, Duchy, Kingdom, or Empire. Diplomacy makes your vassals and your neighbors like you more. Marshal determines how well you command your armies. Administrative determines how well you manage your finances, and how large a territory you can hold personally. Intrigue determines both your ability at plotting against your enemies and discovering plots your enemies are making against you. Learning has an effect on the rate of technological advancement, and several other factors.\n\nIn addition to these five stats, each character has traits, both positive, like "Brave", "Diligent", or "Just", or negative like "Craven", "Slothful", or "Arbitrary". There are also numerous "neutral" modifiers, like "Honest" that increases your Diplomacy, but decreases your Intrigue. There are also genetic traits that can come into play, both good and bad. The first time you have a "genius" child, you'll be jumping for joy, and the first time you have an "inbecille", you'll be wondering how hard it would be to "dispose" of him. But be wary. That imbecille might be the only hope of continuing your line.\n\nBecause that is what the game is about. It's not about your country. It's about your dynasty, your family line. Even if you start as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Emperor, and wind up as the Count of some random backwater in Eastern Europe, so long as your family line continues, your game continues. But even if you are the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, if you have no remaining members of your Dynasty, then it's game over.\n\nIt's a complex, but not complicated, game. Make no mistake. There is a learning curve to this game, but once you've learned the basics, you will find yourself coming back to it again and again.","November 25, 2013","true","358.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You might be thinking "Which game should I buy first... Europa Universalis IV or Crusader Kings II... OH DECISIONS! Y U DO DIS!"\n\nWell, I had that same feeling when I had to decide which one to get first, but since I have them both now, I think it's time to review and give my point of view of which one I liked the most and why.\n\nFirst of all, we need to place a difference between both games. What does one have that the other one doesn't? Well, Crusader Kings II aims more into diplomacy, intrigue, Middle age problems (OH! the "Accidental" Incest) and character development. In terms of combat.. well... usually the ruler who has more soldiers wins (unless you're playing as muslim and "le decadence is 2 strunk"). You can form new kingdoms by the paper and even rename counties, duchies, kingdoms and empires (Renamed "Bavaria" to "Hyrule" 12/10 -IGN).\n\nEuropa Universalis IV aims more to nationalism, you don't play as a character but as a whole nation. Diplomacy is pretty simple, just marry here and there and you'll have friendly relations to form alliances. Crusader Kings II almost works in the same way in terms of marriage and alliances, but, the difference is that in CK2 if you arrange a marriage with a ruler with your close relative you'll have better relations (+30 of opinion for marriage ties) and an instant alliance, but in EUIV, marriage doesn't mean an "instant alliance", just better relations and wars of succession. Winning combats here are not about numbers but technology and military leaders to lead your forces to battle (CK2 doesn't have military leaders but characters who specialize in combat, even a bishop can lead your armies lol).\n\nIf we speak about the map, in EUIV the  whole world is playable, from Europe to the ancient eastern civilizations and the Americas. CK2 plays in Europe, part of north Africa, the Middle East, Asia and all India.\n\nLong story short, CK2 aims to Dimplomacy and your dinasty expansion; EUIV aims to nations expansion and war.\n\nYou can tell by where am I writing this review of which game I think it's better. CK2 does an amazing job for me to recreate that hostile environment that medieval rulers had to face back then, and it's hard to find a game like this that give a focus on diplomacy more than fighting wars like most of games do. If I want to play games that focus more into waging war rather than diplomacy, I'd rather go play a "Total War" game (Medieval II, Rome, Empire, Shogun 2, and so on). This is why I like CK2, it has unique playstyle compared to other games that I've played and it deserves to be in your library. Sure, EUIV has its own playstyle but is not as unique as CK2 in my opinion.\n\n\nNote: This is my point of view about this game, it doesn't mean that you will feel the same thing. But I think it's important to share opinions to help others decide. Also important to mention is that both games are in different periods of history, you might like one period more than the other so choose wisely.\n\nCrusader Kings II --> Early Middle Ages (769)  to The Late Middle Ages (1337)  The game ends in 1453.\n\nEuropa Universalis IV --> Rise of the Ottomans (1444)  to  The French Revolution (1792)   The game ends in 1821","February 11","true","474.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

It’s a grand strategy game, a sandbox game, and in some ways a political simulator. It also happens to be one of the best role-playing games I've ever played.  I’m not even sure where to begin describing it, but what I can say without reservation is that it’s extremely immersive and fun, which is quite a trick that developer Paradox Interactive pulled off when you consider that the vast majority of the gameplay takes place in menus.\n\nThe premise is deceptively simple: you play as a king (hardly a surprise given the game's title), and your number one goal above all else is to have an heir in place who will claim your throne upon your death.  When your character dies, you assume the role of his heir, and so on down the line of succession.  Die without an heir and it's game over.\n\nBut of course it’s not quite as simple as that.  As a king, you’re naturally going to want to expand your realm and accumulate wealth and prestige, and this is where you find the meat of the game.  When you start, you can choose to play as anything from a lowly vassal like a duke or a petty king ruling a single province to a monarch of an entire country.  This also serves as a secondary way to adjust the game’s difficulty since a duke or petty king is going to have a harder time of it than the ruler of an entire nation.\n\nAnd this is where things get interesting.  I call Crusader Kings II a role-playing game because it’s all about navigating the treacherous path of court intrigue and maintaining relationships with the other characters in the game.  Sometimes you might want to have a good relationship with someone, or sometimes you may want them to think very poorly of you, and there are numerous means for doing both, from performing favors, or handing out honorary titles (including Court Jester, which never makes the recipient happy), or even straight-up bribery.  If you have a troublesome vassal, you can try and woo him back into your good graces, throw him in jail, or plot to have him killed.  Any action you choose will always have long-term consequences, for good or ill.  For instance, if you arbitrarily throw someone in jail, or attempt to have them murdered and it’s discovered, you’ll take a relationship hit with other characters almost across the board, and this could be a problem if allies refuse to come to your aid during war, or you end up with a revolt on your hands, or other characters hatch their own plans to kill you or your heir!  It all becomes a delicate balancing act as you try to keep your friends (and enemies) happy while scheming to steal land and titles out from under their noses.\n\nIn addition to good old fashioned political intrigue, you will also encounter a number of random story vignettes that present your character with various choices that create a short, branching narrative, the ultimate consequences of which could be positive or negative, depending on your decisions.\n\nWhen things come to blows, and they inevitably will, it’s time to raise an army and clash steel.  Unfortunately, this is not the most engrossing part of the game.  Your armies march around in multi-unit “blobs” represented by a single soldier sprite with a number indicating the size of the army and a small line representing its morale.  Essentially, if your numbers are higher than an enemy army’s numbers then you’ll (most likely) win the battle.  And that’s pretty much all there is to it: march your “blob” around, defeat other blobs, and lay siege to enemy provinces until your war score reaches 100% and you can force your foe to concede to your demands.  I’m not saying this is necessarily easy, and wars are extremely costly, and sometimes you’ll be thrown an unexpected wrinkle that will turn what you thought was an easy victory into a crushing defeat, but you’re not going to find detailed tactical gameplay here (although full disclosure compels me to mention that I’m not an expert in this game by any stretch, so there may be some nuance here that I’m missing).  At any rate, the simple combat mechanics are adequate because war really isn’t the focus of Crusader Kings II even if it is an important aspect given the setting.\n\nCrusader Kings II plays in real-time, but you can pause at any point if you need breathing room to untangle a particularly difficult political conflict.  You can still interact with the game when it’s paused, but your orders won’t take affect until you start the clock again.  This prevents the game from becoming overwhelming even when things get complicated, which can happen very quickly and often without warning.  Thankfully the interface is very well laid out and places the copious amounts of information you need to manage your empire within easy reach, usually no more than one or two mouse-clicks away.  However, it is a very complex game, and even with over 80-hours under my belt to date, I feel like I’ve still barely scratched the surface.  In order to understand Crusader Kings II, you need to have a basic understanding of Medieval politics and laws, and this isn’t something that most people possess.  For instance, a pop-up will inform you that you have a “Wrong type of holding in demesne”.  What does that even mean, and more importantly, how do you fix it?  Or you might discover that your kingdom is at risk of fragmenting into the hands of multiple petty rulers when your character dies because of a potential succession crisis.  Why is this happening, and what can you do about it?  The game’s manual and tutorial missions do a rather poor job preparing you for your career as a crusader king, so you’ll probably want to find some “Let’s play” videos or a strategy guide or two.  I also suggest keeping a web browser handy while you play because you’ll inevitably have questions throughout the course of the game.\n\nGraphically, Crusader Kings II is probably about as attractive as a game like this can be with the majority of the display occupied by a vast interactive 3D map.  Details are added and subtracted depending on your zoom level, so it’s easy to pull out for a quick overview and then zoom in close enough to see individual cities and holdings dotted across the landscape.  It also runs beautifully in Linux, which always scores extra points in my book.  Sound effects are pretty basic for the most part, but you’ll mostly be listening to the music anyway which is period appropriate orchestral selections.  It can get a little bit repetitive, but there are several music packs available as DLC to expand the score.\n\nSpeaking of DLC, if you’re contemplating a purchase of Crusader Kings II, you might be staggered by the fact that there is, at the time of this writing, nearly $250 worth of full-priced DLC currently available, and you may find this off-putting, but consider this: the vanilla game offers a complete experience in and of itself and can give you hours of entertainment.  In fact, I would recommend you play it sans DLC at first to get a feel for the game and to decide which DLC actually appeals to you, because not all of it will (and you should probably wait until it’s on sale anyway to get the most bang for your bucks).  I personally only have around half of the available DLC including several expansions and some of the unit and music packs, but I don’t feel like I’m missing out simply because the other content doesn’t interest me.  I should also note that when Paradox does release a major expansion, it's always accompanied by a patch that adds new features and content to the base game for free.\n\nThis review could easily be three times as long, and I still wouldn’t feel like I had given a comprehensive description of Crusader Kings II.  So let’s make this simple: It’s a great game.  Buy it.","April 15","true","92.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

When you die, you take up the mantle as your heir - and really the only way to lose is not to have a heir at all, never mind the possible ruin you put your kingdom (duchy? county? empire?) in.\n\nFeel like assassinating your old, barren wife yet?

Civ) crusader kings 2 is a must have game. The game begins in the year 867, or 1066 depending on if you own the "The Old Gods" expansion or not, and you must guide a noble family through the medievel era. This may seem bland to someone without experience with paradox interactive grand strategies, but it is certainly not. This game is very similar  to Game of Thrones(there is a Game of Thrones mod also) imagine playing as the lannisters, starks or any family in westeros of signifigance. As in Game of Thrones, intrigue is paramount. I have countless times murdered my children and siblings in the name of preserving my realm and i have been assassinated by my siblings and brothers countless times also. Intrigue however is not the only component of CKII, military, religious, and economic gameplay is as rewarding as Intrigue. When all of these elements work together, the Game is damn good. Imagine you are the king of Sweden. Your younger brother is the King of Norway and your uncle is your vassel, duke of Lappland with a measly 4 holdings(counties, castles, cities, and temples/churches/mosques). Your spymaster is unskilled and your uncles plot to claim your kingdom for himself has gone unnoticed. Even if the kingdom of Sweden is the most powerful of nations, you can still lose a war to revolting vassles. Especially if a foreign king like your afformentioned brother helps the rebels. It is gameplay like this that you experience in crusader kings but so much more dynamic than i could ever hope to explain on paper.\n\nIn my opinion Crusader Kings II is the best grand strategy game ever, fans of the genre and newcomers alike can appreciate it: 9.5/10","November 30, 2013","true","835.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Expanded my Empire from one small Baltic tribe. Expanded real Baltic religion to nearly all north Europe. Then - wham! New patch! Patch which broke all game system. Technology points were all gone, vassal opinions were all gone or of some enourmous amounts. Prestige points, piety points, score points, all gone or of enourmous amounts too. Contacted Paradox, asked for help - got replay that game system changed becouse of the latest patch.\n\nOkey I thought to my self, scew these 400 hours or carefull planning and conquest. I will start anew, better Baltic Empire. Not to mention the pain with Viking leaders/founders of Kiev rus and Novgorod, which are imba, packed with stats like on uber steroids, but they also get a huge packs of army right from the start. So I had to defend from them. Plan my battle carefully. Picking a place and time. I beat them in first battle and made them retreat and then - wham! New mechanic - "Shattered Retreat".\n\n"Shattered Retreat"\nSo that imba unber steroid packed doom ball just retreated and I had to chase them all the way to their lands. Till I got to them, they have already recovered in morale and received reinforcements. I nearly lost that other battle. And it happened again - they just made Shattered Retreat again! And again I had to run around threw all the map just to get into same doom ball with full morale and reinforcements! But by that time my vassals were mad at me because I took their armies for too long and my gold account was empty.\n\nI have bought nearly all DLCs for this game. It's roughtly 250 EUROs and I get this, Paradox?!\nSo this is what you developed all this time using your player community money, Paradox?!\n\nI am stating very clearly for the new commers - DONT BUY THIS GAME !!! You will be scewed up time after time and after time.\n\nShattered Retreat mechanic was a last nail into the coffin that I am putting this game into, Paradox. You failed miserable... just pathetic.\n\n\nEDIT No.1: Tried to find some solution to this "Shattered Retreat" crap. Looked all over the internet: Reddit forums, Paradox forums, YouTube, etc. The only working solution I found was on Steam Workshop mod called "Normal Retreat".\n\nBut guess what?! After activating it, my savefile Ironmode got corrupted. This means I can't do/complete any game achievements! Well done Paradox! I tried a new game, same thing! Well done, Paradox!!!

And, unlike other Paradox games such as the Europa Universalis series, it is not hard to learn. You play as a ruler, of a county, a duchy, a kingdom, or an empire. You choose initially from the set of rulers available at the start of the game, which is by default anyone in power in 1066 CE Europe (Further back with the Old Gods expansion) and from then on, things get rough. If your ruler dies, you then play as your immediate heir. If you have no heir, then you lose the game, so the simplest goal would be to have your dynasty survive the lenght of the game (some 400 years). Only there's so much more to do than survive. You have to plan marriages for your daughters and sons, deal with an often angry Pope, vicious neighbors with claims on your lands, angry subordinates who may be plotting to kill you or usurp your titles, a derelict king or queen who thinks they're posessed by the devil and are putting the kingdom you belong to on the fast track to destruction, an angry horde of mongols rapidly advancing, a holy war tearing apart a nearby kingdom, and so much more. It doesn't take long to get immediately caught up in the scheming and politics of even the tiniest duchy, and before you know it two hundred years have passed, kingdoms have risen and fallen, assassins have come and gone, plagues have ruined your best laid plans for succession, and you realize it's eight AM and you've been caught up in medieval rulership for all night.","December 11, 2013","true","152.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Paradox chooses to focus on the Dynasty, which gives a very interesting twist to the whole genre.  You now not only have to focus on building up your "states", expanding your empire, and diplomacy, but also ensuring your line has the right traits to succeed for decades to come.   There are so many different ways to play and things to focus on, the replay value is huge.  I have replayed this game 4 or 5 times so far, and everytime found something new to focus on....   There are also different mods you can get that add either more realism or go so far as to change the game into a Game of Thrones sim!  Be warned though, this is NOT for the light of heart, if you just want a game you can waste 30 minutes on, this won't be for you.  This is a hardcore sim, one that you will spend hours and hours on.  Yes, you can spened a 30 minute session on, but plan on spending 100s of 30 minute sessions before completing a game!\n\nThe only negative I can really say about this game is the interface at times makes it challanging to give you what you need.   If you are searching for a wife for your heir, for instance, and you want to filter for certain traits, there is not an easy way to do this.

And, unlike other Paradox games such as the Europa Universalis series, it is not hard to learn. You play as a ruler, of a county, a duchy, a kingdom, or an empire. You choose initially from the set of rulers available at the start of the game, which is by default anyone in power in 1066 CE Europe (Further back with the Old Gods expansion) and from then on, things get rough. If your ruler dies, you then play as your immediate heir. If you have no heir, then you lose the game, so the simplest goal would be to have your dynasty survive the lenght of the game (some 400 years). Only there's so much more to do than survive. You have to plan marriages for your daughters and sons, deal with an often angry Pope, vicious neighbors with claims on your lands, angry subordinates who may be plotting to kill you or usurp your titles, a derelict king or queen who thinks they're posessed by the devil and are putting the kingdom you belong to on the fast track to destruction, an angry horde of mongols rapidly advancing, a holy war tearing apart a nearby kingdom, and so much more. It doesn't take long to get immediately caught up in the scheming and politics of even the tiniest duchy, and before you know it two hundred years have passed, kingdoms have risen and fallen, assassins have come and gone, plagues have ruined your best laid plans for succession, and you realize it's eight AM and you've been caught up in medieval rulership for all night.","December 11, 2013","true","152.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is such a fun mix of history/alternate history, intrigue, state/empire building, and ruler simulator. The possibilities available (with all the DLC) are so numerous that during the 400+ hours I’ve played I’ve barely scratched the surface. Wonder what would happen if the Vikings had conquered, held, and integrated Italy into the Swedish or Norwegian kingdoms? DO IT. Getting tired of the Catholics attacking you when you play as the Umayyads (muslim rulers of the Iberian peninsula)? Holy war all the Catholic countries, take their territory and convert their populations to Islam; Rome the center of Catholicism? Not any more! take it from the Infidels and make it Sunni (or Shi'a), or if you're not muslim then convert it to Norse or any of the multitude of diverse and historically accurate religions .  The possibilities for epic, "world" conquering and non-historically accurate shenanigans are nearly infinite.  Let your inner history nerd free, and mess with the world in a fun, engaging, and often very personal way. Another important aspect of this game besides the world conquering/state building is the character aspect.  Instead of just playing a country you are actually an individual (a count, duke, king, or emperor).  Individuals have traits which affect (positively or negatively) their stats which in turn affect the functionality of your state.  There are thousands of unique events for your character to “interact” with, adding an aspect of role playing that is not merely a side thing but a full fledged and fleshed out mechanic.  All the possibilities and outcomes an individual character can experience keeps the game from being just another conquer the enemies territory and “take over the world” (brain) game and elevates it into a unique class of it’s own. There are only two negatives to this game, both of which ultimately don’t affect it's enjoyability. First problem is the price of the game and all it’s DLC. To get the best (and “real”) CK2 experience you really do need all the DLC and when it’s not on sale this game can cost $150+. Lucky the game goes on sale frequently and I’ve been able to (over some time) acquire all the DLC for much, MUCH less than $150. I don’t know exactly how much but it’s probably only like $40/50. Buying the "complete package" at the start when on sale costs $40 and is definitly a perfect deal.  Le'ts just say that despite not paying $150+ for the game I've definitly gotten WAY more than $150 worth of fun from it. I'm glad I didn't pay that much but now that I know how good the game is and if I had to go back & pay the full price I wouldn't hesitate.  The second problem is the learning curve. Being a grand strategy game there is a MASSIVE amount of stuff to learn.  I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed so it took me a good 50+ hours before I was confident enough to say I fully knew how to play.  The 50ish hours I spent learning were fun but I didn’t realize how amazing this game is until I actually got fluent in the game (around 100+ hours in).  Now though that i’ve “mastered” how the game is played I struggle to name a game I’ve enjoyed playing more (ok I know: The Binding of Isaac/Rebirth).  One way to help speed up learning the ins & outs is to watch tutorial/let’s play videos. There is a youtuber named Arumba who is not only extremely entertaining but is also a CK2 master.  Watching his CK2 content really helped accelerate my enjoyment and understanding of the game. I fully recommend watching some tutorial/let’s play videos while/before playing the game, it’ll help alleviate some of the frustration/insurmountability and intimidation the first time you boot CK2 up.  I can’t recommend this game strongly enough, it is gigatons of fun. I also recommend Arumba if you like LP’s and funny/entertaining yet not idiotic/spas-tic presenters then Arumba should be topping your list of ppl to watch. (FYI: I have no affiliation w/ Arumba nor do I know him, I’m just a fan making a recommendation)","February 15, 2015","true","500.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game is such a fun mix of history/alternate history, intrigue, state/empire building, and ruler simulator. The possibilities available (with all the DLC) are so numerous that during the 400+ hours I’ve played I’ve barely scratched the surface. Wonder what would happen if the Vikings had conquered, held, and integrated Italy into the Swedish or Norwegian kingdoms? DO IT. Getting tired of the Catholics attacking you when you play as the Umayyads (muslim rulers of the Iberian peninsula)? Holy war all the Catholic countries, take their territory and convert their populations to Islam; Rome the center of Catholicism? Not any more! take it from the Infidels and make it Sunni (or Shi'a), or if you're not muslim then convert it to Norse or any of the multitude of diverse and historically accurate religions .  The possibilities for epic, "world" conquering and non-historically accurate shenanigans are nearly infinite.  Let your inner history nerd free, and mess with the world in a fun, engaging, and often very personal way. Another important aspect of this game besides the world conquering/state building is the character aspect.  Instead of just playing a country you are actually an individual (a count, duke, king, or emperor).  Individuals have traits which affect (positively or negatively) their stats which in turn affect the functionality of your state.  There are thousands of unique events for your character to “interact” with, adding an aspect of role playing that is not merely a side thing but a full fledged and fleshed out mechanic.  All the possibilities and outcomes an individual character can experience keeps the game from being just another conquer the enemies territory and “take over the world” (brain) game and elevates it into a unique class of it’s own. There are only two negatives to this game, both of which ultimately don’t affect it's enjoyability. First problem is the price of the game and all it’s DLC. To get the best (and “real”) CK2 experience you really do need all the DLC and when it’s not on sale this game can cost $150+. Lucky the game goes on sale frequently and I’ve been able to (over some time) acquire all the DLC for much, MUCH less than $150. I don’t know exactly how much but it’s probably only like $40/50. Buying the "complete package" at the start when on sale costs $40 and is definitly a perfect deal.  Le'ts just say that despite not paying $150+ for the game I've definitly gotten WAY more than $150 worth of fun from it. I'm glad I didn't pay that much but now that I know how good the game is and if I had to go back & pay the full price I wouldn't hesitate.  The second problem is the learning curve. Being a grand strategy game there is a MASSIVE amount of stuff to learn.  I’m not the sharpest tool in the shed so it took me a good 50+ hours before I was confident enough to say I fully knew how to play.  The 50ish hours I spent learning were fun but I didn’t realize how amazing this game is until I actually got fluent in the game (around 100+ hours in).  Now though that i’ve “mastered” how the game is played I struggle to name a game I’ve enjoyed playing more (ok I know: The Binding of Isaac/Rebirth).  One way to help speed up learning the ins & outs is to watch tutorial/let’s play videos. There is a youtuber named Arumba who is not only extremely entertaining but is also a CK2 master.  Watching his CK2 content really helped accelerate my enjoyment and understanding of the game. I fully recommend watching some tutorial/let’s play videos while/before playing the game, it’ll help alleviate some of the frustration/insurmountability and intimidation the first time you boot CK2 up.  I can’t recommend this game strongly enough, it is gigatons of fun. I also recommend Arumba if you like LP’s and funny/entertaining yet not idiotic/spas-tic presenters then Arumba should be topping your list of ppl to watch. (FYI: I have no affiliation w/ Arumba nor do I know him, I’m just a fan making a recommendation)","February 15, 2015","true","500.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I had two sons, eldest of which was to be my successor, but who had such personality quirks that I really didn't think he would be the right heir. I preferred the younger son. So I sent the eldest on the most dangerous assignment I could - collecting taxes and hoped for the best (or worst). At the same time I noticed that I had good relations with France and the king of France happened to have two daughters (princesses) in the ripe age for marriage. I tested my luck and offered to wed the other and my eldest son could wed the other. Luckily the king accepted my proposals and there I was, married to a french princess.\n\nNot long after the marriage I decided to start fooling around with the other princess as well, because you can't go wrong with two french princesses and as my son was all the time fetching taxes, you had to give some warmth to the lonely french woman in another country.\n\nNot long after I got good (bad) news that my son had been killed on his taxation trip and I managed to get the right son to be my lawful heir. I kept the princesses though to myself naturally. At this point I noticed that the french king had an heir, son of age 8 or so. This wouldn't do because I wanted to get France for me as well so I put some plans into work and decided to assassinate the brat. I went a bit over the top though because I invested so much money into the assassination that it had approximately 300% success rate and indeed, after a while I got notice that he was at the same time thrown from the balcony, put into fire and shot with a crossbow. But if you want to get rid of a french king-to-be you better make it right the first time, can't be too careful!","March 18","true","2.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","0"

This game has a steep learning curve, and honestly I hated it to begin with, but after I started to figure out how to play the game it became extremely fun.  After playing this game I have found it almost impossible to go back to playing the Civilization series, a series which I loved, because this game to me is a lot deeper and more interesting  than Civ. The multiplayer in this game is also very fun, if occasionally a little buggy.\n\nI highly recommend this game, just try not to give up right away if you get frustrated with it.","June 5, 2014","true","554.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

So far it beats every strategy name I ever laid my hands on and I only have 200 hours in it as of yet.\nThe learning curve is long and painstaking, but it's definitely worth it.\n\nMany people complain about the immerse amount of DLC's that should be included in the vanilla, but once you grind your teeth and decide to buy some of them, (besides they are on sale rather frequently) you won't regret it as each one of them give something to the game that you otherwise would have missed. For instance (dlc's I have so far):\n\n- Legacy of Rome: Retinues and the Byzantine Empire\n- The Old Gods: the struggles of tribal people, conquering your way to feudalism/republics, also, raid europe to pieces\n- The Republic: start out slow and have huge armies, even as a single county ruler... or even just as a patrician vassal\n- Horse Lords: it's bloody hard, still just learning, but the hordes you can recruit are amazing\n- Charlemagne: another +100 years of (IRL) gameplay + tons of new tribal characters\n- Sword of Islam: another take on feudalism, plus roughly 1/3 of the map unlocked to play with\n- Way of Life: all the character focuses and the events they generate give the game so much more... the Seduction focus seems to be hated by the community, but it's fun, especially when you play with your friends. :P Also, don't be surprised if you die of syphilis.\n- Sons of Abraham: Jewish characters unlocked and some extra gold to be borrowed in times of need\n- Conclave: Your own council becomes your worst enemy, imo makes the game slightly harder\n\nAll in all, a great game, the only thing I could see it being better is if Paradox made multiplayer more stable, my friends often complain they've lost control over their troops and the game client needs rebooting, also whenever someone drops from the host, everyone has to reboot the client, as the multiplayer button is greyed out. Now this wouldn't bother me much, except sometimes you have to do it multiple times in a row until everyone can play again.\nSo for me, single player 9/10, it's almost flawless, but for multiplayer it's only an 8/10, still a great experience (the other day we were laughing our ♥♥♥♥ off on a lunatic character's horse councillor, then I murdered it), but some fixes need to be done to make it perfect.\n\nI'd definitely recommend if:\n- you like sandbox strategy games\n- you like history and want to be part of it\n- you'd like to know more about medieval hierarchy\n- you'd rather lead a dynasty rather than a nation\n- you just want to watch the world burn","February 22","true","253.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

In game you basically have to choose dynasty and play till you die or till the game itself ends. And it's really ♥♥♥♥ing difficult. You might get kicked out of your throne and die poor with no heirs or you can survive and be emperor of whole Europe.\n\nThis game is great fun because:\n1) It is really hardcore\n2) The map is quite big, so variety of dynasties to play is really decent\n3) Things go quite different every time you play, so it doesn't become repetitive\n4) There are some quite competitive achievements in game, for example restoring Roman Empire or sample\n5) It is quite historically interesting, you can watch how things changed around 1000 years ago\n6) Nice graphically made landscape\n7) It's not just about having wars. It's about being a ruler. You will have to do a lot of things there, from starting and ending wars to marrying your offsprings\n\nWhy this game isn't flawless:\n1) Some really stupid and unrealistic things might happen. For example, Russian kingdom turning to catholic religion or black-skinned king of Britain (This is what I had only, most noticeable things)\n2) There are really many DLCs and getting them can sometimes be worthy, the most significant ones are like 8$\n3) Some DLCs are really stupid, for example the one with Aztec invasion. It's just plain idiotic.\n4) This game might be sometimes TOO hardcore. You won't be able to play it normally before you complete tutorial, so bother yourself with that. And it's gonna take you a lot of time to start playing good. I actually started becoming good at this game after 100h only and still would sometimes get ♥♥♥♥ed.\n\nOverall, this game is a great fun if you want some good time-spender, if you want some historical interesting events, if you're tired of real-time strategy games or if you just crave some difficult gameplay and not-so-stupid games. This is what you have to get then.\n\n9.8/10, would play again and again","August 12, 2014","true","244.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","9"

Something you'll need to be (apparently) unless you don't want to be pre-warned about getting your save-games dicked. Of course there is plenty of warning about the available DLC in-game, but that takes precedence over anything else I guess... Great game, terrible update model. Extremely upset. Removed from my heart and /common file. :(\n\nEDIT: I gave the game a second chance and progressed well until receiving a sudden and inexplicable error message forced that game to a close too. I could not find any information online about what was happening so I signed up to the Paradox forums themselves and left a post in the relevant location asking for tech support. It has been viewed but gone unreplied to for the past two days. I guess you're scrwed whether you join the forums or not. In conclusion: don't purchase the game and don't support the developers. All in all a very frustrating experience playing (?) and dealing with their half-♥♥♥♥♥ performance in the gaming industry. Not good enough.","July 14, 2015","false","243.1"," 38 of 70 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","38","70","0","4"

Since Rajas of India, the game went downhill.\nWhile I can run the game normally (not as before, but still), some people that once could, cannot run as they used to due lack of optimisation.\nAnother problem Paradox have with their DLCs is that they do not acknowledge, or even accept failures even when most of the players are against the features. While the game has been patched up to deal with bugs and problems the last major patch has brought, they still maintain their decision not to take away things that were and are not well-welcomed since the beginning, even before releasing.\nThe last patch(which came with Conclave) brought with it Coalition and Shattered Retreat, features known to EUIV players and many CKII players were against them and just some liked (not counting the fanboys every game company has).\n* Coalition was something that could be considered a joke - a system that when you grow, even against those against your faith (ie, Christian expanding over Muslims), can bring every realm, including those similar to you against you. It has been patched, but it's still rubbish. So if you are Jerusalem and expand over the Fatimids, expect Rome to go against you.\n* Shattered Retreat was a bit more welcomed but it still doesn't make a lot of sense and was considered broken.\n\nThere are many more problems from patches from other DLCs, but as since I don't play much since Rajas and when I do, it's just with mods, I'm not really aware of them. But yet, Paradox seemingly does nothing to -really- deal with them.\nIn the past I could recommend this game, and would say it's one of the best I've ever played, but at the moment it's not really pleasant without mods. The way the game is today, I can say I have more fun playing CKI than playing CKII.\n\nIf you have never played CKII before or a game like it, you might enjoy as you won't see the difference from what it was at the beginning, but know that when it was released, or at the time of Old Gods, it was a much better game than what it is now and that is really a shame. CK2 is reaching its end, but if you're new to Paradox, be careful with your next deals as they might be just the same, now more than never.\nI won't be buying anything from them any longer, at least until they stop doing what they are doing not only to CK2, but to EUIV, hence I expect the same from the new titles, such as HOIIV.","April 5","false","785.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Yes, it is mostly watching the map and sometimes giving orders (which means clicking 2 or 3 buttons). But if you want a medival simulation as realistic as possible, then this is the game for you. Just do not expect a lot of action going on. Also do not expect a real-time or turn-based strategy game. This game is not about conquering the world (Europa Universalis IV might be more your game then...), it is about simulating the feudal system. Therefore, there are mechanisms in the game, such as inefficient taxation when you own too many provinces or the gavelkind succession laws that splits your realm between your children when you die. While these might look like huge fun-blockers for an average gamer, they perfectly make sense in this game. Again, this is a feudal simulation and it excels at this.\n\nRecommended DLCs: The Old Gods, Sons of Abraham, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome.\n\nFor long-term playability: there is a huge amount of mods, including some total conversion mods that put you in the world of Middle-Earth (Lord of the Rings) or Westeros ("Song of Ice and Fire" aka "Game of Thrones").","December 31, 2013","true","134.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If your ruler has no heir, it's game over. Duke, King, and Emperor are all well represented here. The base game starts in a pretty historical 1066 (the Old Gods expansion pushes it back to 876). However, once you unpause it, history is thrown out the window. Everything can change from there on out.\n\nOnce you are familar with the UI and pretty much all the features of it, which can take a while as Paradox's tutorial is not extremely helpful in that regard, you are ready to start a real campaign. You set the campaign goals, forma  specific empire or Dutchy, make your dynasty last to the end of the game, 1453. It's up to YOU.\n\nControling the leader is a nice change of pace as well, becaus eit adds an RPG like mechanic to a strategy game. Many things can happen to your character, and ultimatly death, and then you take control of his/her heir. The mechanics are fleshed out and deep. They feel meaningful. You need to have a reason to declare war, and a good portion of the time you only have claims to one province at a time. This makes conquest difficult, but rewarding a little more realistic than other Paradox games.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good for a strategy game of this nature, where you are essentailly staring at a map waiting for things to change. The Clauswitz engien does well in that regard. All the artwork ingame is beautifully done and looks marvelous.\n\nIn the end, the only thing that truly bugs me is the amount of DLC. Many of it is purly cosmetic and is not needed to fully enjoy the game, but they do add to the atmostphere. If you are to get any of the DLC make sure to get Sword of Islam, The Republic. The Old Gods, and The Legacy of Rome as those are the meaty expansion type DLC's. If you want a very ahistorical scenario pick up "The Sunest Invasion" to have the Aztecs bid for control of Europe as well in an alternate history scenario.\n\nOverall I give Crusader Kings II a 9/10.","May 29, 2013","true","67.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've owned it for nearly two years (ignore my playing hours, I actually have two copies of CK II; one from gamersgate, and one on Steam I picked up off the humble bundle), and I LOVE it. It's stunning in depth and complex like few other games, yet I found it easy to pick up and learn. Anyone who likes royalty, strategy, or family politics will love this game.\n\nGraphics are great; beautiful even. Very few strategy games I've played have such beautiful graphics in every area - character portraits, interface art, maps - normally something out of those lets you down. To mention it comes with its own, original music - beautiful, fitting classical pieces.\n\nI've found it to have infinite replay-ability. Not only because there are so many different characters you can try out (nearly anyone in mainland europe, and with DLCs all of India and the middle east), but because it has a great AI that always makes the world different each time. In the footsteps of real medieval europe, inheritance can change the map fundamentally. Play historically and rebuild the empires of a dynasty, or just conquer a whim - both are fun.\n\nThis game is also constantly updated. Paradox has a great DLC policy where you get nearly every bit of content without the DLC just in the updates - all the DLCs do are to make characters playable, introduce new starts and new interface themes. So if you don't want to pay, you don't have to; you still get most of the experience, and you won't be left behind if you want to play multiplayer with others. There is no DLC wall. Not to mention DLCs can be easily turned on and off via the launcher.\n\nSo much content has been added since I began playing, and the game is always getting better - just recently they doubled the map size, an enormous amount of work for Paradox, nearly 2 year after the game came out.\n\nMy ratings?\nMusic - 9/10\nGraphics - 8/10. Only thing that could be improved is player portraits might be higher-res.\nGameplay - 10/10\nReplayability - 10/10\nUpdates - 10/10\nSupport - 9/10\n\nOverall - 9/10.","May 21, 2014","true","126.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game will feel familiar to those that have played other games from the developer, Europa Universalis etc, yet will be refreshing and worthwhile because of its focus on intrigue and dynasties rather than trade and nation level politics.\n\nCrusader Kings II is one of the best, if not the best, grand-strategy game of recent years. The game offers hundreds of hours of gameplay (especially if you have the expansions) because of the vastly different experiences the various religions, cultures and ranks of nobility offer. The RPG elements and focus on your personal dynasty add another layer of depth with the micromanagement of every marriage, alliance and well placed dagger in the unfortunate cousin's back. The game is full of events from restoring the Roman Empire to building a flying machine, which add a lot of flavour and keep the playthroughs interesting and amusing.\n\nThe game also has a very good modding community, with mods ranging from the small ones that bring alternate flags and portraits to the total conversion mods such as:\n\n'A song of Ice and Fire' mod:  Game of Thrones [forum.paradoxplaza.com]\n'Elder Scrolls' mod:  Elder Kings [forum.paradoxplaza.com]\n\nThe mods, especially the total conversions, add a lot of value to the game.\n\nThe game is not beginner friendly, not by a long shot. Despite being more simple than other games in the genre the information overload will be a lot, especially for new players. If you're willing to take the time to learn the game, it will be an amazing experience.  I recommend the game to anyone who's interested Game of Thrones-esque intrigue.","January 9, 2014","true","222.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You choose an initial character and then navigate feudalism as his/her descendants. There are no goals in the game per se, which means that you are free to play the game in whatever way you wish: role-play, try to convert Catholicism to Protestantism via the Lollards (Google it), or crusade against Islam. That last option raises an important point: any crusade you undertake will probably be of your own initiative, since in roughly 150 hours of play I have spent about 45 minutes on official crusades: this is a game of feudalism, not crusading. And a massive game it is too: there is a wealth of land to squabble over, diplomacy options to mess around with, intrigue to slither through, and larks for all. And digital larping for all as well, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThe first thing you will encounter is a cliff-like learning curve. Watching an online tutorial, reading the game manual carefully, and doing a "test playthrough" should teach you the basics in a few days. When I say test playthrough what I mean is regard your first game as an experiment, and do everything that you can: declare war, marry, assassinate, fabricate claims, etc. Click every button and see what the results are while expecting to fail. Don't let initial frustration at "losing" keep you from this fantastic game! After a while, you will be so usewd to the interface that it will seem strange that it was ever confusing.\n\nOnce you have the interface down, you can enjoy the meat of the game. There are tons of things to do, events to experience, and wars to fight in medieval Europe. Try starting as a count for a smaller game with plenty of intrigue, or play as a king and change history with sweeping invasions. The options really are endless, and well supported by the clean, detailed interface and map.\n\nOn the DLC side, there are some excellent expansions for the game available. I personally recommend purchasing The Old Gods, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome, and The Republic, if you want the full experience. The other DLC (i.e. Charlemagne, Rajas of India, Sunset Invasion, and Sons of Abraham) are okay, but not really amazing. Consider them only on sale, in my humble opinion.\n\nOn a side note, this is a great game for historians such as myself, and a good way to learn a little something about pre-modern European history.\n\nNow that the gushing is over...\n\ntl;dr\ngood soup. hot. warm feels.","March 1, 2015","true","89.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Gameplay is strategic and chaotic. It's one of the most fun things I've done in quite some time and I did start to really get into my character and their families.\n\nFor example,  One of the Nordic Kings sieged my castle in Dorset while my army was away helping an allied king, imprisoned my pregnant wife and then after she gave birth to my first son (while I had Agnatic Primogeniture Succession laws), held HIM hostage, took my wife as his concubine - and then continued to siege my lands.\n\nWhen my army finally returned to the de jure Kingdom of England to take revenge, I was faced with 10 to 1 odds and no allies strong enough to make a difference.  So I decided I would have the Nordic wife-stealer killed in his sleep. My (now technically) ex-wife was MORE than happy to contribute to the plot and he was killed in a carriage while travelling. My involvement was discovered and the Nordic King's son was ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I could not diplomatically persuade him to free her.\n\nSo I tried a DIFFERENT plot against the son, except now I couldn't get anyone to back the plot. Even my ex-wife had moral qualms - she was free of her concubinage and had nothing personal against the 12 kid who we had thrust onto the throne. But I wanted my son and wife back.\n\nI couldn't use brute force, I lacked the numbers.\nI couldn't use diplomacy, I had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off the Nords too much.\nI couldn't use Intrigue, no one shared my vision.\nI couldn't use Religion, I wasn't pious enough.\n\nSure enough, the 12-year old Nordic kid grew up to be a more terrifing fighter than his dad and decided to take his revenge by once again sieging Dorset.\n\nI was eventually thrust right back into the familiar postion of Elodie - except instead of a dead lumen mother, I had a dead duke dad. A young girl with no allies or experience needed to fight her enemies.\n\nExcept where Elodie had magic powers and a kingdom's resouces, I was a poor muggle countess. It didn't end well.\n\nSo I started a NEW game where I took particular note of the original Nordic King I was fighting and what he did and I have managed not to draw any attention to myself thus far.\n\nI am LOVING this game, but it was incredibly expensive even during the Summer Sale where everything was 75% off or more. That is perhaps the main problem with this game, although it has not deterred me.","July 4, 2014","true","197.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The game will feel familiar to those that have played other games from the developer, Europa Universalis etc, yet will be refreshing and worthwhile because of its focus on intrigue and dynasties rather than trade and nation level politics.\n\nCrusader Kings II is one of the best, if not the best, grand-strategy game of recent years. The game offers hundreds of hours of gameplay (especially if you have the expansions) because of the vastly different experiences the various religions, cultures and ranks of nobility offer. The RPG elements and focus on your personal dynasty add another layer of depth with the micromanagement of every marriage, alliance and well placed dagger in the unfortunate cousin's back. The game is full of events from restoring the Roman Empire to building a flying machine, which add a lot of flavour and keep the playthroughs interesting and amusing.\n\nThe game also has a very good modding community, with mods ranging from the small ones that bring alternate flags and portraits to the total conversion mods such as:\n\n'A song of Ice and Fire' mod:  Game of Thrones [forum.paradoxplaza.com]\n'Elder Scrolls' mod:  Elder Kings [forum.paradoxplaza.com]\n\nThe mods, especially the total conversions, add a lot of value to the game.\n\nThe game is not beginner friendly, not by a long shot. Despite being more simple than other games in the genre the information overload will be a lot, especially for new players. If you're willing to take the time to learn the game, it will be an amazing experience.  I recommend the game to anyone who's interested Game of Thrones-esque intrigue.","January 9, 2014","true","222.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You choose an initial character and then navigate feudalism as his/her descendants. There are no goals in the game per se, which means that you are free to play the game in whatever way you wish: role-play, try to convert Catholicism to Protestantism via the Lollards (Google it), or crusade against Islam. That last option raises an important point: any crusade you undertake will probably be of your own initiative, since in roughly 150 hours of play I have spent about 45 minutes on official crusades: this is a game of feudalism, not crusading. And a massive game it is too: there is a wealth of land to squabble over, diplomacy options to mess around with, intrigue to slither through, and larks for all. And digital larping for all as well, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThe first thing you will encounter is a cliff-like learning curve. Watching an online tutorial, reading the game manual carefully, and doing a "test playthrough" should teach you the basics in a few days. When I say test playthrough what I mean is regard your first game as an experiment, and do everything that you can: declare war, marry, assassinate, fabricate claims, etc. Click every button and see what the results are while expecting to fail. Don't let initial frustration at "losing" keep you from this fantastic game! After a while, you will be so usewd to the interface that it will seem strange that it was ever confusing.\n\nOnce you have the interface down, you can enjoy the meat of the game. There are tons of things to do, events to experience, and wars to fight in medieval Europe. Try starting as a count for a smaller game with plenty of intrigue, or play as a king and change history with sweeping invasions. The options really are endless, and well supported by the clean, detailed interface and map.\n\nOn the DLC side, there are some excellent expansions for the game available. I personally recommend purchasing The Old Gods, Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome, and The Republic, if you want the full experience. The other DLC (i.e. Charlemagne, Rajas of India, Sunset Invasion, and Sons of Abraham) are okay, but not really amazing. Consider them only on sale, in my humble opinion.\n\nOn a side note, this is a great game for historians such as myself, and a good way to learn a little something about pre-modern European history.\n\nNow that the gushing is over...\n\ntl;dr\ngood soup. hot. warm feels.","March 1, 2015","true","89.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However that was instantly replaced by rage and confusion as soon as I realized that my character had died "under suspiscious circumstances", and that I now had to deal with an astronomically awkward inheiritance.\n\nThere are also many ways to challenge yourself though the game as you can choose to play either as a christian, muslim, viking or slavic nomad ruler - most often carving out a place in the world for yourself and your dynasty through conquest, murder and marriages. Every gameplay feels meaningful depending on who you choose to play as because every place and every situation your happen to find yourself in present new obstacles to overcome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fallacyboy/recommended/203770/","Fallacyboy","Valn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fallacyboy/","175 products in account","If you know of this game you've probably heard it refered to as a "sibling murder, incest, warmonger, and religious intolerance map simulator" or something of the like. While this is a humurous synopsis of the experience - and mostly true - it's not very helpful if you're trying to decide whether or not to dump copious amounts of cash into this thing. I mean, just look at all the DLC. It's at least 160 something odd dollars for all of it. So, is it worth it?\n\nThe short answer: maybe. I know that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short answer, but hear me out. This game is niche. Very, very niche. It's unique certainly, but that does not change the fact that you could very well absolutely hate it. For starters, if you're thinking of making this purchase and have not played other games like this one (Europa Universalis etc.) then go watch Arumba's guide on how to play it. Also, pay attention to the fact that it's 22 videos long of about 18 minutes each. Granted, they are very in-depth, but this does not change the fact that understanding how this game works is not easy. It's an experience, and you will have to put time and effort into this game to get any sort of rewarding feeling for playing it. However, once you reach that point it becomes something very fun. Suddenly your son dieing of small pox leaving your daughter the only one to inherit becomes a challenge, rather than a guaranteed game over. Your neighbor converting to a different religion becomes an opperunity, not a reason to cower hoping that they won't declare war. The Pope becomes your "friend" rather than the guy that excommunicates you so your neighbor can steal your ♥♥♥♥. It goes on and on.\n\nNow, I like this game. I want that to be clear. However, this is not a game for everyone. It's not a game made for everyone either, hence the price point. This game in itself is a bit of a hobby, and while the price is stupidly high, it's about 6 or 7 expansions of decent content and a butt load of not so decent penny grabs. However, playing without all the dlc is very different from playing with all the dlc, and the game with dlc is objectively better most of the time. It's got more content, a bigger map, more events, religions, etc. As such, if your on the fence about this game, I'd suggest waiting until it goes on sale - as it does usually every so often - and pick up the whole thing for about 25~30ish dollars. At that price I'd hands down suggest this game to anyone with even a remote interest, but whether or not it's worth the full 160 is your decision, and you might regret it.\n\nOnto what this game actually is. In essence, you play as a family, not a single character. You do play as one person at a time, but you are survived by your children or relatives. You build power through war - which is not as exciting as it sounds - and intrique - which is. This game is not about the combat. It matters, yes, but playing a warmonger is only fun for about the first 80 hours put into a dynisty before you own all of Europe and are expanding into uncivilized lands. It is - above all - a game about the sibling murder, the incest, the bribing, the corruption, the intrigue, the homosexuals, the lovers, the concubines, the children, the murdering of the children, the arranged marriages, the raiding, the power struggles, the underlings -  the dirty, dirty unloyal underlings - the castle building, the character improvement, the ruling, and - above all - the characters. This game has no story, and yet the best story of any game I've ever played. Everything that happens is your legacy. You murdered the duke and stole his titles, well that's now part of your family legacy. Married into Royalty. That's there too. The whole game is about building your own alternative histories where the Scottish get invaded by the Moors and become Muslims, where Russia is formed early and fends off the mongols, where the Viking Pagan Empire stretches from Iceland to India. It's about doing whatever the hell you want, and it's glorious.\n\nThis game is fun, and half of the fun is figuring out why it's fun. But for the love of all that is watched over by Zun, don't spend 160 bucks on the thing if you're unsure it's your cup of tea. It might be the best tea you've ever had, but wait until it's on sale.","April 21, 2015","true","453.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Basically, the goal is to last as long as you can, its over when ether you lose your last piece of land, or if your ruler dies without a heir. Its very complex, but so worth it once you get the hang of it. I mean really, how many games come along where you can say you had the Pope assassinated? Unlike a lot of strategy games, its not so much about build this and conqure everyone, its more about surviving and the political intrigue of the times. People will try to fabricate claims on your land, your second wife may try to have a son you had with your first wife assassinated so that her child will become the rightfull heir. You can start in Ireland and work your way up from count, to king, then conqure Scotland and England to form the Empire of Britannia. You can stratigically marry off your daughters to prestigous people of other countrys, then their sons will have claim to those lands. Theres different rules too, which you can change so that daughters can inherit, or that women can even inheret on the same grounds men do. There is a LOT to the game. The DLCs add even more, such as being able to play as pagens and sacrificeing your prisioners, if thats more your thing.","February 17, 2014","true","191.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a rich, complex, and brilliant game, and I have loved every minute so far, although I have mainly played as pagan rulers. To fully enjoy it, I reccomend that you look around the map from time to time, and see what happens. One of the most interesting things I have seen happened in my Sudreijar save, in which Axum, a small african kingdom, captured Mecca and Medina, which led to various wars, culminating in an independent muslim king reigning in Mecca. During that same game, I challenged my heir, which was my cousin, to a Holmngang, in which he killed me. The kingdom was then divided between him and my sons, and I set about uniting it again in a series of bloody wars. CKII is unlike any other game I have ever played, and everyone should try it.

I played multiplayer with my cousin and then married my cousin.\n10/10 Best cousin marriage simulator. Good for the whole realm.\n\n\n\n\nBut for real, this game is absolutely incredible. I remember when I first saw this game. It was about three years ago and I totally thought this game looked like an overly complicated piece of junk. And boy, was I half right.\nAfter totally brushing off this game I started getting really into Civ V. I really loved how immersive the game was and how it wonderfully wove together culture, technology, and history. Eventually, after 200 hours of gameplay, I grew tired of that game and moved on. I moved on to Warband and played over 200 hours of that wonderful game. Yet I still grew tired of it.\n\nSo I looked online for more strategy games and I came across this game again. At this point I was desperate for a strategy game that could also immerse me in a beautiful world while also giving me something I would take pride in fighting for. So I gave this game a chance and after 500 hours I am still playing this game. Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing grand strategy game that puts you not only in charge of a realm, but in charge of your family's house.  The goal of the game, if there is one to be found, is to bring as much glory to your realm and family name as you can. This can be attained by many different means and that is one of the things that makes this game great. You are put into a position of power in the Middle Ages and destiny is yours to write. However, this game can throw terrible twists your way. Your great genius leader can be killed in battle leaving your young daughter to take the throne in a world that hates female rulers. Or maybe you will find yourself hoping your King-Jeoffery-of-a-son dies so that way your strong, attractive, and genius son can take the throne. Or my greatest nightmare: You can be playing as an Eastern European nation and the Mongolian Hordes begin to knock on your door.\n\nCrusader Kings is one of the greatest games I have every played. It is wildly complex and can take over 50 hours to master. But don't let that stop you from giving this game a try. Because once you get a feel for how the Crusader Kings 2 world works, you can let your ambitions run free and carve out a glorious realm with characters that somehow manage to create a story that seems like it could have happened.\n\n10/10 would have my vassals revolt against my 16 year old female ruler during a Mongolian invasion for Poland so I can inherit France and the HRE again.\n","March 13","true","618.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While not very graphically impressive, the game makes up for this lack by having highly detailed people and places, and is about as historically accurate as one can get.\n\nIt's really more of a Dynastic/Kingdom sandbox simulator than a game, and really lets you experience what it would have been like to be Emperor, King, Duke, or Count. Critical thinking, and long term strategy are essential to surviving (even your own children you groom to be your heir may try and murder you if you don't pay attention, or have an inept spymaster.) You're more or less just living a story as you decide to tell it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fallacyboy/recommended/203770/","Fallacyboy","Valn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Fallacyboy/","175 products in account","If you know of this game you've probably heard it refered to as a "sibling murder, incest, warmonger, and religious intolerance map simulator" or something of the like. While this is a humurous synopsis of the experience - and mostly true - it's not very helpful if you're trying to decide whether or not to dump copious amounts of cash into this thing. I mean, just look at all the DLC. It's at least 160 something odd dollars for all of it. So, is it worth it?\n\nThe short answer: maybe. I know that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ short answer, but hear me out. This game is niche. Very, very niche. It's unique certainly, but that does not change the fact that you could very well absolutely hate it. For starters, if you're thinking of making this purchase and have not played other games like this one (Europa Universalis etc.) then go watch Arumba's guide on how to play it. Also, pay attention to the fact that it's 22 videos long of about 18 minutes each. Granted, they are very in-depth, but this does not change the fact that understanding how this game works is not easy. It's an experience, and you will have to put time and effort into this game to get any sort of rewarding feeling for playing it. However, once you reach that point it becomes something very fun. Suddenly your son dieing of small pox leaving your daughter the only one to inherit becomes a challenge, rather than a guaranteed game over. Your neighbor converting to a different religion becomes an opperunity, not a reason to cower hoping that they won't declare war. The Pope becomes your "friend" rather than the guy that excommunicates you so your neighbor can steal your ♥♥♥♥. It goes on and on.\n\nNow, I like this game. I want that to be clear. However, this is not a game for everyone. It's not a game made for everyone either, hence the price point. This game in itself is a bit of a hobby, and while the price is stupidly high, it's about 6 or 7 expansions of decent content and a butt load of not so decent penny grabs. However, playing without all the dlc is very different from playing with all the dlc, and the game with dlc is objectively better most of the time. It's got more content, a bigger map, more events, religions, etc. As such, if your on the fence about this game, I'd suggest waiting until it goes on sale - as it does usually every so often - and pick up the whole thing for about 25~30ish dollars. At that price I'd hands down suggest this game to anyone with even a remote interest, but whether or not it's worth the full 160 is your decision, and you might regret it.\n\nOnto what this game actually is. In essence, you play as a family, not a single character. You do play as one person at a time, but you are survived by your children or relatives. You build power through war - which is not as exciting as it sounds - and intrique - which is. This game is not about the combat. It matters, yes, but playing a warmonger is only fun for about the first 80 hours put into a dynisty before you own all of Europe and are expanding into uncivilized lands. It is - above all - a game about the sibling murder, the incest, the bribing, the corruption, the intrigue, the homosexuals, the lovers, the concubines, the children, the murdering of the children, the arranged marriages, the raiding, the power struggles, the underlings -  the dirty, dirty unloyal underlings - the castle building, the character improvement, the ruling, and - above all - the characters. This game has no story, and yet the best story of any game I've ever played. Everything that happens is your legacy. You murdered the duke and stole his titles, well that's now part of your family legacy. Married into Royalty. That's there too. The whole game is about building your own alternative histories where the Scottish get invaded by the Moors and become Muslims, where Russia is formed early and fends off the mongols, where the Viking Pagan Empire stretches from Iceland to India. It's about doing whatever the hell you want, and it's glorious.\n\nThis game is fun, and half of the fun is figuring out why it's fun. But for the love of all that is watched over by Zun, don't spend 160 bucks on the thing if you're unsure it's your cup of tea. It might be the best tea you've ever had, but wait until it's on sale.","April 21, 2015","true","453.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Everything was going great, I was kind, very religious, a brilliant tactician,  and a skilled warrior. I declared holy war against the Hashshashins and defeated them and was able to take their mountain redoubt. I joined in the Crusade in southern Spain, gaining the title of "Crusader" and finally, I putted down a couple of rebellions in Hebron. Yes everything was going great when one day, another rebellion broke out in Hebron and I led a massive army against the rebels.\n\nDespite everything, I died (probably from a stray arrow) and the throne passed to my son - a 1 year old son - and that's when everything went to s**t. My uncle decided to usurped the throne and declared war against me, then the Kingdom of Antioch called me a worm and invaded my northern borders bringing along with them their friends from the Byzantium Empire. Then the Fatimids and Zangids decided to call in jihad and invaded both from the Egypt and Damascus.\n\nGame over right?\n\nWrong.\n\nDespite suffering heavy losses from the rebel armies, and both Christian and Muslim invaders I managed to defend Jerusalem using what little knights I had in the form of the seriously OPed Knights Templars and Knights Hospitallers who were bolstered by what little troops I had left. I fought them all to a standstill for four years (I assumed it was my steward who was directing the war) until fate intervened in my favor and France answered the call for a Crusade against the Muslims. Unfortunately, everything went crazy and my once beautiful kingdom became a free-for-all battleground ala Warhammer 40k.\n\nIt was then that Antioch and the Byzantiums switched to sides and decided to help me fight the Muslims but uncle, who had his greedy eyes on the throne, wouldn't budge in his rebellion (and for good reason since he had a tremendously large army at his side). So after nine years of perpetual war the Muslims finally called it quits and my uncle managed to take the throne and throw me in prison.\n\nThen fate once again intervened and through a law called succession or something, they voted that I was the true heir to the throne and my diabolical uncle (whom they now called "the Usurper") was a pretender. Yaaay!\n\nThen I contracted typhoid fever and died.

The game is a complex sandbox where you play as nobility in the real world, trying to forge your dynasty into every corner of Europe, Arabia or India. You can play anyone from a lowly count, up to the emperor of the medieval roman empires.\n\nIt has happened that I've devilishly laughed with great geniune delight as I expanded my kingdom of Burgundy deep into the HRE, wondering for just a moment why I don't have any friends. However that was instantly replaced by rage and confusion as soon as I realized that my character had died "under suspiscious circumstances", and that I now had to deal with an astronomically awkward inheiritance.\n\nThere are also many ways to challenge yourself though the game as you can choose to play either as a christian, muslim, viking or slavic nomad ruler - most often carving out a place in the world for yourself and your dynasty through conquest, murder and marriages. Every gameplay feels meaningful depending on who you choose to play as because every place and every situation your happen to find yourself in present new obstacles to overcome.

I really loved how immersive the game was and how it wonderfully wove together culture, technology, and history. Eventually, after 200 hours of gameplay, I grew tired of that game and moved on. I moved on to Warband and played over 200 hours of that wonderful game. Yet I still grew tired of it.\n\nSo I looked online for more strategy games and I came across this game again. At this point I was desperate for a strategy game that could also immerse me in a beautiful world while also giving me something I would take pride in fighting for. So I gave this game a chance and after 500 hours I am still playing this game. Crusader Kings 2 is an amazing grand strategy game that puts you not only in charge of a realm, but in charge of your family's house.  The goal of the game, if there is one to be found, is to bring as much glory to your realm and family name as you can. This can be attained by many different means and that is one of the things that makes this game great. You are put into a position of power in the Middle Ages and destiny is yours to write. However, this game can throw terrible twists your way. Your great genius leader can be killed in battle leaving your young daughter to take the throne in a world that hates female rulers. Or maybe you will find yourself hoping your King-Jeoffery-of-a-son dies so that way your strong, attractive, and genius son can take the throne. Or my greatest nightmare: You can be playing as an Eastern European nation and the Mongolian Hordes begin to knock on your door.\n\nCrusader Kings is one of the greatest games I have every played. It is wildly complex and can take over 50 hours to master. But don't let that stop you from giving this game a try. Because once you get a feel for how the Crusader Kings 2 world works, you can let your ambitions run free and carve out a glorious realm with characters that somehow manage to create a story that seems like it could have happened.\n\n10/10 would have my vassals revolt against my 16 year old female ruler during a Mongolian invasion for Poland so I can inherit France and the HRE again.\n","March 13","true","618.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I then decided to burn England again, sacrifice the mother to the Allfather and leave the kingdom filled with B A S T A R D S, my B A S T A R D S.\n\nCrusader Kings 2 is by my opinion the best game from Paradox. If you really love to play games that makes you think or you love conquering land then there is no better choice than this.\n\nWhat makes this game so good?: The fact that you take your own choices that will effect the future so much. You can start as the Holy Romans and form Prussia, or you can lose all and have to play as a small kingdom far east. The basic game is simulated to act the historical events, but you can change them and make your own history.\nThis strategic simulator will conquer more of your time than it will of Europe.\n\nThere are problems of course, handling your vassals, defending your kingdom and keeping your dynasty alive. But the worst thing is that you have to buy expansion moduels to play as other charakters or different religions. So buy the expansions, but only when it is sale on them.\nIf you are still holding back from buying it, then ask yourself.

To fully enjoy it, I reccomend that you look around the map from time to time, and see what happens. One of the most interesting things I have seen happened in my Sudreijar save, in which Axum, a small african kingdom, captured Mecca and Medina, which led to various wars, culminating in an independent muslim king reigning in Mecca. During that same game, I challenged my heir, which was my cousin, to a Holmngang, in which he killed me. The kingdom was then divided between him and my sons, and I set about uniting it again in a series of bloody wars. CKII is unlike any other game I have ever played, and everyone should try it.

Same developer who made other great games like Europa Universalis 4, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 3 and Stellaris. This game is based on Middle Ages to start of renaissance, where EU4 starts. Without DLC starts around 1066, but if you have dlc\'s like Old Gods and Charlemagne you can start it on 700\'s.\n\nHowever before saying this game is all about invading other lands like Civ and Total War, no. Because this game is unique. You rule your dynasty and lead it through the age. You have to control your family by marrying other people for example Holy Roman Empire\'s princesses. Then you extend your family and realm. Same time there is world map, where you can invade land, like in every strategy game. But only land available is Europe, North Africa and part of Asia.\n\nThere are many events in this game. I\'ll explain hordes, rebellions and crusades in this review. There are many hordes. For example Mongols and Abbasids. If you have Sunset Invasion DLC, Aztecs are gonna invade Europe too. Hordes born quickly and rise by invading all neighbor realms. They are hard to defeat but they collapse easily with rebellions. Rebellions are events where claimer of duchy of puppet state declare war on country and try to switch government or get independece. That\'s why you see all rebellions threats on your intrique menu, so you can prepare at threats or plot to kill threats. And last, crusades. If you part of catholic or orthodox religion, pope or archbishop might declare crusade to invade Jerusalem, Anatolia or any lands where real life crusaders were. You don\'t have to join crusade but if you join and get most points you\'ll gain all lands that were invaded in crusade.\n\nFamily relations are pretty important as your sons that have bad relation with you might try to kill you or start rebellion. And affairs are just gonna anger your wife and your children. However having family member in countries like Holy Roman Empire might help you make alliance with them, so that is useful. On my game, I just spammed my every daughter on big countries, HRE, England, France and Byzantium.\n\nCombat works really well, but units are pretty hard to make and army levies might rise too big.\n\nOverall this game is great and I had alot more fun with it than with Civ or EU4. I recommend it!","June 1","true","91.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are some scripted historically accurate events but other than that you aare free to do as you wish.

To date, I haven't played another strategy game like it, and it's likely there aren't any. This game can make somewhat similar games, like Civilization, feel quite disappointing.\n\nThis game is all about your family, politics, your characters, your religion, your culture... there's a lot of depth. And after you've played for a few hours, you should have a story worth telling to someone. Stories that alter history. It easily beats out almost every other strategy game I've played in this way.\n\nThis is one of the few games where it's okay to kill your wife, your brothers, and your uncle's 2-year-old child, all for the sole purpose of aspiring to be even greater than they were.\n\nBe warned, this game can be very frustrating: You learn more through your failure than your success, and sometimes there's something big you've overlooked for the last day (or month) you've been playing. I highly recommend you try the demo and watch some people play this game online (Youtube, for example) before you're determined to buy it.\n\nIt also has some of the best modifications out there for any strategy game, including a Game of Thrones mod that's well acclaimed and probably the best Game of Thrones game out there.\n\nAs a sandboxy medieval European story simulator, this game shines. You will giggle at the death of little boys and marrying their sisters as you inherit land and claims for war. Very rarely do I feel like I waste my time with this game. There's no grinding. And Paradox tries to improve it with patch after patch, which is nice.\n\nThe only downside, in my opinion, is the way the DLC is released, with song packs, skin packs, etc. however, the higher priced DLC is worth buying for the most part - just read what it's about before you buy it and you should be good to go.\n\nThis is, by far, the best game Paradox has to offer, and one of the most worthy games on Steam to buy.","November 29, 2013","true","194.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you are into strategy games I can definately recommend this one. It´s not the easiest to learn, in fact, after fifty games you will still learn more about this game, and with the continuous supply of DLC you will not get bored of this game quickly.\n\n\nNow, why is this game so great?\n\n+ A big map that gets expanded occasionally. You can start of as a viking king in Norway and eventually rule India, or start as a Russian Slavic pagan and become emperor of Europe. And who knows what Paradox is preparing to add next?\n\n+ A hundred of options with a thousand of choices. Whether you start off as a viking or a muslim, you will encounter similar problems. However, every religion, culture and country has it's own way of solving those. And as your character develops he will unlock (or block) other options. You'll never stop exploring these options.\n\n+ Easier and harder gameplay is possible, so whether you are new or experienced you will always find your challenge\n\n+ Great multiplayer, especially with friends. Whether you like PvPing or play versus the computer, a good multiplayer match will always keep you interested. Connecting to other players has been made easier (compared to how it was in the past), and is easily done via steam.\n\n+ Events and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold.This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.\n\n+ You can create your starting king with the ruler creater DLC\n\n+ Loads of DLC that add new and interesting things to the game. When playing multiplayer, only the DLCs owned (and activated) by the host are available. If you play with friends, have the person who hosts most often get some DLCs, so the others won't need them.\n\n+ Starting date can vary from 769 to 1337 (there currently are six bookmarks, respectively the Early Middle Ages (769), the Viking Age (867), the High Middle Ages (1066) , the Alexiad (1081) the Age of the Mongols (1241) and the Late Middle Ages (1337).\n\n+ No game will every be the same. After a hundred years into the game, you will notice considerable differences in each game.\n\n\nA game would not be realistic if not without flaws, so here are some of the downsides\n\n- Event and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold. This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.\n\n- Multiplayer can sometimes be unstable, especially if you play with more than 5 people. Desyncs will happen every now and then (usually you can play for an hour or two), and you have to restart your game to properly solve it. This is less common if you play with less player and if the internet connections are good. (If you have good internet, and so do your friends, this is MUCH less likely to happen.)\n\n- At first, this game might be very complicated and confusing. I recommend playing with someone with experience, if possible.\n\n- Once you get to a certain size, you will become quite unstoppable (although there are a few big armies coming to Europe, like the mongols, that might make you lose lands again).\n\n\n\nOverall I would easily recommend this game. Once you grasp how this game works, you will be able to spend hours and hours of your time into this, exploring the near unlimited amount of options, and seeing how every game is available. If you play with friends, get a co-op game going.\n\n9/10","June 12, 2015","true","583.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

A full-blown character development and dynasty system gives incredible richness to the world and the player's attachment to character, family, and kingdom.\n\nThis is fantastic game for single or co-op play.  It takes a long time to learn and master, but once you've got it the game becomes very fun and satisfying.\n\nMy primary complaints lie in the underdeveloped economic side, underdeveloped religious system (especially for non-Catholics and non-Norse) slow casus-belli capture-one-county-at-a-time conquering system, and multiplayer instability.\n\n\nNote: The developers have consistently released new content for the game, which is incredible.  A lot of the key additions are also given for free for vanilla users.  That said, there are some DLC expansions that add important new systems or create additional depth to existing ones, which therefore should be purchased with vanilla.  If on a tight budget, I would definitely pick up Old Gods.  All other DLC at your discretion.","December 12, 2015","true","245.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Make sure to keep your vassals and court happy to avoid revolutions or any sort of a turmoil. I have enjoyed the game so far. In particular, I liked the random events that take place throughout the game. For example, your son’s wife can get possessed by a demon and slay half of your family or your younger son will decide to assassinate you and all his older brothers to inherit the crown. Equally, sometimes you are that very person who coldly murders most of your family while being driven by hunger for power. In any scenario, you will have plenty of fun while rewriting world’s history. It feels like a game with a storylines alike Game of Thrones – intrigues, assassinations, betrayals, seduction and other joys of life.\n\nI would personally advise to play this game on Ironman mode only, as it forces you to embrace all the chaos you have caused and all challenges that have emerged in the game, forging your mind to be more strategic next time and also not trust anyone.","January 9, 2015","true","117.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"Strategy" games are more akin to simulation games in essence. You plan your course of action through dangerous circumstances to achieve the best victory possible. Strategy is knowing when to fight, where to fight, how to take advantage of your situation for long-term benefits, and other similar questions. Tactics is "how to fight" and this game does not cover that. It is a question of logistics rather than tactics. Do you have enough troops, rather than are your troops fighting at optimal efficieny. Do you have the defensive high ground, rather than whether or not this unit happens to be in good terrain at any given time. Do you catch the enemy army off guard, rather than using flanking to decimate part of the army.\n\nIf you expect a Civilization-esque game, or something like Total War. Check your expectations. Go online, and watch gameplay before buying. You are probably in for a surprise.","December 28, 2014","true","707.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

A full-blown character development and dynasty system gives incredible richness to the world and the player's attachment to character, family, and kingdom.\n\nThis is fantastic game for single or co-op play.  It takes a long time to learn and master, but once you've got it the game becomes very fun and satisfying.\n\nMy primary complaints lie in the underdeveloped economic side, underdeveloped religious system (especially for non-Catholics and non-Norse) slow casus-belli capture-one-county-at-a-time conquering system, and multiplayer instability.\n\n\nNote: The developers have consistently released new content for the game, which is incredible.  A lot of the key additions are also given for free for vanilla users.  That said, there are some DLC expansions that add important new systems or create additional depth to existing ones, which therefore should be purchased with vanilla.  If on a tight budget, I would definitely pick up Old Gods.  All other DLC at your discretion.","December 12, 2015","true","245.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

To be honest, it's more like a review for myself than an actual help information but forgive me for being egoistic this time. Not the last time though.\n\nThat day I was the ruler of some small territory in Ireland. My name was long so I preferred to call myself Ua which is actually a part of it. I was 47 years old with a wife and a few kids. They all were very talented siblings with good education except for the last one named Dub-da. I decided to experiment a little with him so he ended up not having a guardian and betrothed to a dumb woman. People of my tribe knew me as 'the sloth with good strategic skills". My treasury was almost empty but I decided to invest last coins in some risky business opportunity. Some oversea lord invited us to his country for a business discussion!\n\nIt was a question of whether or not we should buy some merchant's ship or hire bandits to capture one. We hired bandits and were readly to sail off. Some priests catched up and asked to join us. 'Sure sure come in feel yourself like in the Heavens'. After a few days of sailing priests declared that they haven't seen the crew which was fully consist of thieves and bandits.\n\nWe finally arrived at the castle of our potential business partner. Feeling ourselves a little uncomfortable we realized that we forgot something important - a gift. Thankfully, on our ship we had: a dozen of good breeded horses, some rich cloth and a pouch of herbs. So with a smile on his face, Ua presented the pouch as a gift and it was the moment which started a long friendship.\n\nThe oversea lord invited us for a dinner. My brother was a barbarian just like me as you probably figured out already so he was very hungry and ate the food with his bare hands. The lord noticed that and asked me to do something about it because YES it was an issue. I replied 'What?! I'm hungry too!' and with a cavemen cruelty I attacked a nearby roasted rabbit, punching it before eating. It was already dark outside when the atmosphere in the throne room suddenly changed. Excusing  everyone I ran off the room then up the stairs disrobing as I go and finally standing completely naked on a balcony in front of the full moon howling 'aaaAAAAAOOOOOOooooo'. The guards found me soon.\n\nNext day some of my priests started a discussion with the Lord about something important but I just witnessed it from the ground next to them. It was our last day there.\n\nAfter sailing off to our lands I had a signed trading contract between our nations for two years!! #OOhYEAH! #contracthype\n\nAfter coming back some events took place such as:\n\nI woke up and noticed that my garden looked wild with tall weeds and fibres everywhere on the walls and statues so you can't pass without a good sharp sword. So i decided to clean it up and to do it myself! That was the moment when people stopped to call me a sloth but instead started to call me a gardener! Who would think that at the age of 48 I'll become a gardener?\n\nOne year after I recieved a book of poetry. I digged through it twice or so and discovered a great sympathy to this craft. So here and there I started to white poems and verses. I didn't consider myself a poet and thought that all this was just a fun hobby. BUT WHY anywhere I go I hear people singing and reading MY POETRY??!! Who would believe that at the age of 49 I'll become a poet?\n\nSomebody sent me a bird. It was an eagle-kind and I took it with me for a hunt! The bird was brilliant! We came back to the big house with lots and lots of rabbit corpses! Who would imagine that at the age of 50 I'll become a falconer?\n\nAfter these events my friend, Koyori, who knows about this game more than I'll ever know was impressed and called me 'Master of Hobbies'.\n\nSo it seems like my point is: it's not important to know how to win in this game because just playing it is a lot of fun!","August 7, 2015","true","26.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

If you are into strategy games I can definately recommend this one. It´s not the easiest to learn, in fact, after fifty games you will still learn more about this game, and with the continuous supply of DLC you will not get bored of this game quickly.\n\n\nNow, why is this game so great?\n\n+ A big map that gets expanded occasionally. You can start of as a viking king in Norway and eventually rule India, or start as a Russian Slavic pagan and become emperor of Europe. And who knows what Paradox is preparing to add next?\n\n+ A hundred of options with a thousand of choices. Whether you start off as a viking or a muslim, you will encounter similar problems. However, every religion, culture and country has it's own way of solving those. And as your character develops he will unlock (or block) other options. You'll never stop exploring these options.\n\n+ Easier and harder gameplay is possible, so whether you are new or experienced you will always find your challenge\n\n+ Great multiplayer, especially with friends. Whether you like PvPing or play versus the computer, a good multiplayer match will always keep you interested. Connecting to other players has been made easier (compared to how it was in the past), and is easily done via steam.\n\n+ Events and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold.This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.\n\n+ You can create your starting king with the ruler creater DLC\n\n+ Loads of DLC that add new and interesting things to the game. When playing multiplayer, only the DLCs owned (and activated) by the host are available. If you play with friends, have the person who hosts most often get some DLCs, so the others won't need them.\n\n+ Starting date can vary from 769 to 1337 (there currently are six bookmarks, respectively the Early Middle Ages (769), the Viking Age (867), the High Middle Ages (1066) , the Alexiad (1081) the Age of the Mongols (1241) and the Late Middle Ages (1337).\n\n+ No game will every be the same. After a hundred years into the game, you will notice considerable differences in each game.\n\n\nA game would not be realistic if not without flaws, so here are some of the downsides\n\n- Event and results are random. You'll never know what happens, for you could be killed by bandits during your hajj to Mecca, or you could suddenly get an extra 100 gold. This can be very frustrating, or very interesting.\n\n- Multiplayer can sometimes be unstable, especially if you play with more than 5 people. Desyncs will happen every now and then (usually you can play for an hour or two), and you have to restart your game to properly solve it. This is less common if you play with less player and if the internet connections are good. (If you have good internet, and so do your friends, this is MUCH less likely to happen.)\n\n- At first, this game might be very complicated and confusing. I recommend playing with someone with experience, if possible.\n\n- Once you get to a certain size, you will become quite unstoppable (although there are a few big armies coming to Europe, like the mongols, that might make you lose lands again).\n\n\n\nOverall I would easily recommend this game. Once you grasp how this game works, you will be able to spend hours and hours of your time into this, exploring the near unlimited amount of options, and seeing how every game is available. If you play with friends, get a co-op game going.\n\n9/10","June 12, 2015","true","583.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

To date, I haven't played another strategy game like it, and it's likely there aren't any. This game can make somewhat similar games, like Civilization, feel quite disappointing.\n\nThis game is all about your family, politics, your characters, your religion, your culture... there's a lot of depth. And after you've played for a few hours, you should have a story worth telling to someone. Stories that alter history. It easily beats out almost every other strategy game I've played in this way.\n\nThis is one of the few games where it's okay to kill your wife, your brothers, and your uncle's 2-year-old child, all for the sole purpose of aspiring to be even greater than they were.\n\nBe warned, this game can be very frustrating: You learn more through your failure than your success, and sometimes there's something big you've overlooked for the last day (or month) you've been playing. I highly recommend you try the demo and watch some people play this game online (Youtube, for example) before you're determined to buy it.\n\nIt also has some of the best modifications out there for any strategy game, including a Game of Thrones mod that's well acclaimed and probably the best Game of Thrones game out there.\n\nAs a sandboxy medieval European story simulator, this game shines. You will giggle at the death of little boys and marrying their sisters as you inherit land and claims for war. Very rarely do I feel like I waste my time with this game. There's no grinding. And Paradox tries to improve it with patch after patch, which is nice.\n\nThe only downside, in my opinion, is the way the DLC is released, with song packs, skin packs, etc. however, the higher priced DLC is worth buying for the most part - just read what it's about before you buy it and you should be good to go.\n\nThis is, by far, the best game Paradox has to offer, and one of the most worthy games on Steam to buy.","November 29, 2013","true","194.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And it is excellent.\n\nMultiple aspects of this game elevate it to its status at the pinnacle of its genre. First of all, the deciding factor for me that makes it better than other Paradox games is the added RPG element. No longer are you simply commanding a country and desperately trying to stop inflation. Now you also feverishly work to impregnate your barren wife and secure an heir while assasinating your cousins left and right. If that doesn't sound like fun I don't know what does.\n\nThere's also the great open-ended freedom of this game. Unlike Civ, which is simply a race to dominate, Crusader Kings allows you to do whatever the heck you want. Feel like taking on the Golden Horde as King Kazimierz of Poland? Give it a shot.

And it is excellent.\n\nMultiple aspects of this game elevate it to its status at the pinnacle of its genre. First of all, the deciding factor for me that makes it better than other Paradox games is the added RPG element. No longer are you simply commanding a country and desperately trying to stop inflation. Now you also feverishly work to impregnate your barren wife and secure an heir while assasinating your cousins left and right. If that doesn't sound like fun I don't know what does.\n\nThere's also the great open-ended freedom of this game. Unlike Civ, which is simply a race to dominate, Crusader Kings allows you to do whatever the heck you want. Feel like taking on the Golden Horde as King Kazimierz of Poland? Give it a shot.

Well, you continue playing as your heir!\n\nThe easiest way to think of this game is like a slightly more historical Civilization but with elements of The Sims (The family planning) because you are not only ruling your kingdom, you are spending time with your wife, marrying off your daughter, plannings feasts, etc.\n\nThere are endless of replayability in this game since everytime you play you and all other AI characters wont stumble upon the same problems, or victories. One game you might marry a cute blonde, have a genious child who later conquers half of Europe, but in the other you might not even get a kid cause you apparently are sterile and your incompetent brother inherits your kingdom, throwing it into a decade long civil war!\n\nYou'll have to look after your faith, your family, your kingdom and your destiny!\nWill you end up in the glorious battles of the Crusade, or will you fall to instant death after your\nwild son "by mistake" pushed you from your balcony while inspecting your capital.\n\nThis is probably one of those games which I really never will stop playing, not only are the possibilities endless, but the creators are still adding content to the game even after 2,5 years, and I shouldn't stop there!

One fever-sick night, the king is struck by a sudden apparition: a strange man stands before him.\n\n"King Bohemund, my name is David, ruler of England, ♥♥♥♥er of pigs, leader of the Conservative cult and the first of his name. I bring grave news"\n\nBohemund looked into the darkness through weary eyes, but even his plagued mind could distinguish otherwise. "Thy mistakes himself sir, a fellow norman, William, rules England."\n\nDavid gave Bohemund a smug nod of the head. "Perhaps in your time, but I rule many centuries from now. I have travelled through time to bring you warning of what's to come."\n\nBohemund coughed, his body shook. At first he appeared not to hear, but then he said "What hath gone so terribly asunder that thee hails me upon my deathbed?"\n\n"You are not to die yet, king Bohemund. It shall be you that saves Christendom itself."\n\nBohemund's eyes widened. "What is this task thou sets before me?"\n\n"The year will be 2016, the moral authority of Christ is failing throughout Europe, and greivious heresy has spread through the kingdoms. Yet the unstoppable tide of Islam advances." David regarded Bohemund sincerely. "Once again the Caliphs wage Jihad before us, yet no Christian coalition can muster."\n\n"Good God." Muttered Bohemund.\n\n"Instead the defence of the realm is left in the hands of a corrupt and oppressive puppet regime of Islam that goes by the name of: "The EU."\n\n"Blasphemy! These be-eth lies thou puts before me!" The king cried.\n\n"Alas, not." Assured David. "What's more, a terrible heresy known as "Socialism" has rooted itself in our lands, and it is the work of Allah to be ascertain." David paused, Bohemund looked at him with awestruck eyes.\n\n"Together, the scourge of the EU and socialism have led our once great nations to surrender before The Jihad and allow open borders to the heretics."\n\n"But you, sir. Thy claimeth the king of England, surely you must lead the Crusade if no one else!"\n\n"Not king, no, but I won't go into those details." Said David. "I am but a vassal of the tyrannous EU. They subjugated my once great nation near on half a century ago."\n\n"Alas. Alas." Bohemund resigned.\n\n"But all is not aloss..." David permitted.\n\n"How so?"\n\n"You, Bohemund. You must lead the Christians, as king of Sicily conquer all of Africa and crush the self proclaimed "Fatimid Caliphate". Only through your actions can the Dark Ages of the socialism heresy and tyrannous puppet empire of Islam, "The EU" , be avoided." David began to fade before Bohemund's very eyes.\n\n"But David, how do I-"\n\n"Do not fail me Bohemund. Do not fail your Christian brothers. You will know when the time is right."\n\n"But David, David wait!" But David was gone, and Bohemund was left alone in his chamber.\n\n\nAnd king Bohemund followed his call to arms. Great swathes of Africa fell to Sicily, and it seemed that the terrible fate of 2016 was never to be. Alas, Mighty Allah stood by his subjects, and used the vile sorcery known to many as "War ended inconclusively (Casus Belli no longer valid)."\n\nIt would be five years before Sicily's armies be ready to strike again, yet in that time much would change. The wrath of Allah did not end there, the "Deus Vult" driven Bohemund was struck down by "natural causes," and history was doomed to the present which we see before us.","April 4","true","141.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","71","5","7","7","0"

After patch 2.5 the gameplay is more tedium and frustration than it is fun or interesting, and CKII has become so buggy that it's borderline unplayable as certain government types.\n\nThis game has been progressively worsening for a quite a while now, but conclave has absolutely broken the experience.\n\nWhy?\n\n-The council exists only as a gameplay obstruction as opposed to an interesting feature on it's own.\n\n-Managing anything larger than a small kingdom will now result in endless revolts to increase council power, with very little the player can do to avoid it.\n\n-Defensive pacts are an interesting idea, but ultimately don't play nice with the game mechanics and aren't very historically accurate. (For an excellent example I played as Carloman Karling and I had the invasion of Saxony event fire, due to my previous war to press my claim on West Francia almost every independent slavic pagan declared war on me to defend the Saxons. Which by the way, makes absolutely no sense and results in an almost unwinnable conflict.)\n\n-Shattered retreat suffers from a similar problem mechanically while being a good idea in theory, it simply doesn't work well in game and makes some conflicts ridiculously difficult or just pointless.(holy wars and prepared invasions are the best examples of this)\n\n-The new education system makes creating a decent heir mostly reliant on rng as opposed to a chosen guardian's existing traits.\n\nDespite all this I would still say this is a decent game, but I can't honestly recommend it anymore. If you're going to buy CKII, get it on sale and avoid some of the dlc. Also roll back to a patch prior to conclave for a better experience.","March 29","false","104.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Similarly, if your family reunions make you wish you could speed up time and exert exacting control over who everyone in your family marries, this game will really blow your hair back. And finally, if you like playing The Sims but wish you could invade your neighbor and burn their ugly house down, well, I count myself fortunate to not be your vassal.\n\nThe gameplay really nails a humorous historical blend of strategy, simulation and role playing. The user interface is packed with information that can draw you in for hours, once you master the very steep learning cliff. The graphics are fairly minimal, but honestly just right for the game.\n\nUnfortunately, so many of the extras that you wish you had control over are fairly pricey DLC, for what they get you. Want to tell your uppity heir to shave his stupid moustache? $4.99. Tired of everyone looking the same, wearing the same 5 outfits or having historically inaccurate ethnicities? $1.99, $0.99 and more for each part of the globe.\n\nThey have expanded the game several times, and the features continue to be added even if you don't by the expansion. From this standpoint, you can get many hours of new gaming experience out of it.\n\nHowever this makes for an unpredictable experience. I bought the game to enjoy multiplayer with my wife. While the added features are great, the stability of the game has its ups and downs. Recently, the Mac version of the game has been very difficult to enjoy. Crashes to desktop and out-of-sync errors become more and more common as our conquests abound and demense expands. Any more, we can't reliably go for more than hour without one of us suffering a setback and having to fully reload the game.\n\nAnother common problem is that the game will protest that we have different versions when setting up the multiplayer server. This requires us to fully reload the game again.\n\nI love the game and wish I could play it more. I'm not opposed to paid or free expansions and feature additions, but given the choice between a rock solid, unchanging game and a buggy, evolving game, I'll choose the former every time.","June 13, 2015","false","284.4"," 22 of 41 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","22","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepsychiatrist/recommended/203770/","thepsychiatrist","Victor Blackthorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepsychiatrist/","125 products in account","Really not my sort of game, despite me trying my darndest to enjoy it, for I have friends who love it. Thirty hours in and it still only makes limited sense to me (and no, I'm not a complete and utter idiot). Far too much seems dependent on luck, for a start. Event pop-ups occur where you can make some rather limited decisions, and there will be cases of 'fourty-percent chance something you don't want happens, sixty-percent something you do want happens'. Quite a lot of cases of that, in fact. If that makes for enjoyable gameplay for some people, then have at it - I'm not stopping you. For me on the other hand, constantly saving so that I can reload if I get buggered over by RNG isn't what I'd consider to be fun (or I guess you could play ironman mode and let fate take its toll, though I rather play the slots at a casino than this all day, for they offer about the same level of entertainment and cost the same, what with this game's ludicrous amounts of DLC).\n\nMost of the game seems to consist of waiting. Wait for your piety and prestige stats, both of which are doing some very subtle things you probably won't realise at first due to the tutorial mode failing to teach you much of anything. You can speed things up, but then I suppose it's just a case of waiting for the things you want to happen but faster. Apparently there's strategy involved, but if you can make sense of it you're doing better than I did. Infantry units get combat bonuses when standing on certain terrain for example, but good luck telling what sort of terrain you're on as it's pretty damned hidden away - I only figured out how to tell about twenty-five hours in. If you do realise what's going on, good luck telling if that bonus is ACTUALLY having an effect and isn't bugged, like a lot of things in Crusader Kings 2 seemingly are.\n\nThen there's the fact you have no actual goal to achieve presented to you. Some people love that, apparently, take Minecraft's success for example (though even Mojang decided to add an 'end boss' to their game). I personally just sit there and wonder "why did I pay for something that's telling me to make my own fun?". If you have any hobbies, I'd go do those instead. You could say that you should aspire to take over the world - well, okay, but is it actually enjoyable? Only if you're a particular sort of person, it seems, as I'd be bored to death by the time I manage it; most of the game involves nothing but waiting. The game just isn't fun - I tried the multiplayer, and when it wasn't "desyncing" (which was a CONSTANT issue, desyncing being tantamount to a crash as you had to exit and restart the game when it happened to someone) for half the game I was tabbed out and talking to people on Skype, as the only convenient way to play multiplayer is on the slowest setting - after all, having people pause when they need to is impractical - and thus the only 'gameplay' I was experiencing was, yet again, waiting for stuff to happen.\n\nI'd like to try and deconstruct the individual mechanics of the game from my limited understanding of them, but really, there's no point. If you're not already playing Paradox's "grand strategy" (a genre I'm pretty certain they alone make games for) games, chances are you won't enjoy this. I'll end this on something objectively bad about the game - its DLCs, or more aptly put its micro-transactions. Multiple, tiny and worthless 'infantry packs' for soldier units you barely pay attention to and multiple 'portrait packs' for the already rather poorly rendered ruler images. Then there's the DLCs that actually add gameplay content - supposedly, they come with free patches that add content even without you purchasing the DLC when they're released. That sounds great and all, but then you hear that those patches have a tendency to come with a host of game breaking bugs and it apparently takes Paradox forever to fix anything. Great. Though I haven't actually purchased any of the DLCs, I have experienced them via my multiplayer escapades, and they seem extremely limited - essentially, think if you modded Super Mario Bros, for example, so that you're running around as Peach instead of Mario. That to me is what the DLCs appear to amount to, what with them consisting of apparently exciting new features like "new start dates" and new rulers to play as, or then you have the Way of Life DLC, where you pay for about five-hundred words or so packaged into event pop-ups that are just more of the same RNG nonsense as before. I suppose that's all great if you already enjoy the concept, but where the game's appeal originates from I cannot even fathom. I never felt like I was applying much strategy (though I suppose you do with extreme patience), I was never having much fun, and I think my friends enjoy the game more than they would otherwise because of their apparent interest in history (which this game pretends to have a lot of, that being historically accurate gameplay, which is also a complete lie as you'll never truly play the lives of infamous rulers, the game simply isn't even nearly sophisticated enough to achieve such an experience). If you want to learn history, great - but read a book, don't play this game.","February 17, 2015","false","33.3"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","26","49","2","15"

It's multi-layered and complex, but the core is you playing as a feudal lord in Medieval Europe beginning in 1066. How you decide to define your goals is entirely up to you, and the interesting elements of the game has more to do with the relationships between your lord, your family, and the competing families, duchies, lords, kings, and emperors that populate the land.

It takes place in a historic medieval setting, incorporates strategy, role playing and simulation elements, and puts you, the player, in the center of a huge world full of dynamic AI individuals and dynasties.  In spite of knowing CK2 contained all of these elements, I did admittedly have a hard time penetrating the game at first.  It took me a few hours of watching let’s plays to figure it out, but once I did so the numerous strategies and activities available became easy to access and execute.  Having said all of that, I’d like to move forward with this review by conveying why this game might appeal to someone not typically interested in grand strategy titles (of whom I count myself one).\n\nMy disinterest in grand strategy games stems from my preference for micro-level strategy, role playing, and simulation.  I enjoy games where you control a single person thriving to prevail in a larger community of likewise minded characters.  I’m not a fan of god games because I don’t want to have control over everything.  I prefer my character to be bound by the same rules as everyone else living in his or her world.  By the same token I don’t particularly enjoy empire building because it seems too detached from the individuals involved.  I like to know my character, understand their traits and motivations, and help shape who they are.  This is EXACTLY what CK2 offers.  In many ways it is a deeper role playing game than just about any I have played.  Characters can have genetic, personality, earned, and ascribed traits of numerous types.  Some of these you acquire through decision making and others by chance or through “breeding.”\n\nBeyond the exceptional role playing and subsequent investment in one’s character(s) in CK2 are numerous other features that make it appealing.  As I’ve mentioned, you only really have direct control over your character but you have indirect control over your court (including your family) and your vassals.  This isn’t to suggest they’ll do whatever you say.  Remember, CK2 places you at the whim and mercy of rules and laws just like every other AI (or human) controlled player.  This is where the strategy comes in.  Should you change a law in your realm to give you more control over vassals even though it might upset some of them and lead to a rebellion?  Should you betroth your daughter to a powerful neighbor and form an alliance even though her children may inherit a claim on your titles?  These are some of the routine decisions you’ll have to make in CK2, and they constitute what I would probably label as “social strategy” – others might prefer to simply call this intrigue.\n\nI could go on, but suffice to say CK2 is nearly the perfect game for someone like me who enjoys simulation, role playing and strategy in a dynamic living world where you are not the hero or a god – just another actor trying to get ahead.  You’ll go through cycles in your games.  I’ve been on top as a king only to fall to invaders and become the vassal of a hated enemy.  I’ve had an amazing ruler followed by a fool, having to struggle to keep my vassals happy.  Your characters won’t live forever, but their dynasty can earn a name for itself in history.  All of this happens on a grand scale but is viewed through a microcosmic lens of an individual that is part of a family.  Yes, it IS a medieval soap opera, and it’s amazing.\n","March 14, 2014","true","286.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game by itself should be in the bucket list of every Strategy gameplayers.  Gameplay, strategy, actions, reality are great. BUT (yea it is a huge but) with lots of DLC without knowing which one I need for core which ones are secondary, it creates a huge consideration buble in my mind.\n\nOn the financial perspective you should not buy this game nor support the studio, because there is no need for extream number of DLC's like Train Simulator. We had a economic crisis. You have customers with limited budget because you actually develop this game for niche (Strategy Game) players. If the studio wants to make more money they should release less DLC more main game content. So from my point of view, game is must but with this marketing/sales strategy it deserves to be on hold list till they release "Game Of the Year/Legendary" full content package with a 75% discount.\n\n6/10 because of studious sales/development strategy.","December 9, 2013","true","55.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I don't remember my conquests as much as I remember the time that a once-favored cousin in Ulster managed to grab a piece of Italy through marriage and immediately defected to the Holy Roman Empire, leading to a massive war as I attempted to bring my wayward vassal to heel and left me managing a motley crew of dissatisfied Italians who now owed fealty to a distant Irish liege.","April 2, 2012","true","99.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To say that it is one of my favorites would be an obvious given.

With all of the expansions this can also be extended to the mid east and Indian subcontenant.  The game continues to evolve with each successive addition to add more and more variety between governing types, religions, cultures, and even lifestyles. I would not call it high action, though it has its moments, but a game that can be paced and simply enjoyed in terms of strategy.
