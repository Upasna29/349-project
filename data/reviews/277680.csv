This is a puzzle game. It is not a platformer. You can't even jump. There is no story. There is no timer. You can't die, but you can get stuck, and then you need to restart or undo your last moves. Each level fits on a single screen, no scrolling.\n\nYou guide two black dudes, love and hate, and they can pull or push other dudes around and step on them and on each other to reach the big red button. Since they can't jump and can only climb one step (unless they find one of these updraft hats and position it just right), this usually requires careful planning. You get to meet different "others" as the game goes on. Yes, it's a mobile port, which is why you don't move your dudes directly, but the pathing is fine -- all you need to do is to click on where you want them to go, and they will, if they can. If you misclick, there's undo.\n\nThe first 10  levels are the tutorial. It looks like the art changes after every 20 levels, for a total of 4 "worlds", so there are some 80 levels total. (I think there used to be 70, and they added 10 when the iPad version came out.)  The difficulty of the level varies quite a bit; they take me anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes to solve, so let's call it easy to medium diffculty.\n\nI would love for the PC version of this game to have bigger levels, an editor, and Steam Workshop; what is has right now is a small price tag (I got an 80% off coupon for owning Tiny & Big), and enough of a challenge to justify it.\n\nSo the question is, how long to beat it? Well, that depends on how smart you are. As I stated up front, I have  beat 50 levels so  far, so the game should be good for 3 hours at least. Is the game inspiring me to beat it? Not really. I think the logic pathways of my brain that can solve "move boxes around" type of games have been exercised plenty before, by games as complex and inspiring as Tetrobot; and that the part of me that wants plenty of small puzzles when I'm bored is still in love with Lyne and its originality (do get Lyne on a touch device).\n\nI like puzzle games, I got this 80% off, I certainly didn't regret getting this game, it's a solid puzzler.

The idea is pretty simple: you control Love and Hate in an attempt to get from point A to point B.  You click where you want them to go and they go there.  Love has the ability to influence Lumps towards him while Hate has the ability to push Lumps away.\n\nLike most puzzle games, the puzzles start off simple and get progressively more difficult.  I haven't played this game too much, but I've already come across a couple good Head Scratchers in terms of difficulty (or maybe I'm just not good at puzzle games).\n\nIn summation, this game is a fun, casual puzzle game if you're looking for one.  The controls are simple but the puzzles get progressively more difficult.\n7/10","December 12, 2014","true","1.0"," 50 of 63 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","50","63","0","1"

In fact, it's a very good puzzle game - it may have the looks of a platformer, but just like Toki Tori, to which it shows some resemblances, its not. The developers are the four guys of  Black Pants Studio, a German indie development studio who have given us the amazing Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftover/ in 2012. With this second game, released late 2014, they have really established themselves as a studio to watch.\n\nControlling two small cubes, representing the two characters love and hate, the player can alter his surroundigs to a certain extent by influencing the position or behaviour of "the other ones". This in order to get to the "red button", which has to be pushed to move on to the next level. An amazingly simple and original concept, almost executed to perfection. Almost, since the difficulty of the 80 levels rather varies a lot: the first ones are, as they should be, very simple, but the more difficult ones are not only found towards the end, but also quite early on. This may discourage players looking for a very relaxing session, but its only a very minor quibble. Some may even find it an advantage. Otherwise, this game offers the perfect amount of casual gameplay, to be taken in as short snippets as one wants since most levels can be completed in a couple of minutes or less.\n\nThe visual style is spot-on too, with four different worlds offering the necessary contrasts yet staying within the same basic concept. A few cutscenes offer some cute, silent storytelling, where the two minimalistic figures even manage to convey some emotions. Great!\n\nOverall score: 8,5/10","February 28, 2015","true","3.6"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","4"

It starts off very simple but it slowly increases the difficulty. So far up to level 41, none of the puzzles were annoying but they do ramp up in difficulty as I played which I find a good sign in a puzzle game. You can take back moves and restart at any time so no complete backtracking was needed if I misclicked when almost done with a puzzle.\n\nThe graphics are charming and the appearance and voices of our two protagonists fit them well; Love is round and has a flower on his head with a loud friendly voice while Hate is sharp and harsh with a hissing voice that sounds like hate indeed. The cast of characters so far fit the atmosphere and the only negatives I can really say is that it took awhile to get a larger variety of characters in the puzzles.\n\nPuzzle games are not my main style but some are quite good and this is certainly one of best.","December 13, 2014","true","2.9"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

It is a puzzle game that focuses on you alternating between two characters and using their special abilities of pushing and pulling blocks to complete puzzles. The game is fairly slow paced and doesn’t really ever reach a level of difficulty that makes you want to slam your face on your desk and give up like a good puzzle game should. You will quickly burn through 30 levels and wonder when you’re going to get to the actual meat and potatoes of the game.\n\nThe way this game was designed feels like a game that was designed with mobile platforms in mind as the levels are something you could easily accomplish while waiting in a line or going to the bathroom, not necessarily the kind of game you would want to binge through on your home PC. As you progress through the game, it does continually introduce interesting gameplay mechanics to attempt to maintain some level of freshness to the level design, such as teleporting, blocks that make you fly, and (literally) dead bodies that act as immovable walls, however; the lack of difficulty remains prevalent throughout which hardly makes the game worth a second run through once you complete the level.\n\nThe game is charming and you can easily sink about 3 hours of gameplay into it before you’ve had your fill and decide to move on to the next game. At an asking price of 6.99 this may be a steep premium to pay for the number of hours you will invest in the game, however be sure to double check your inventory for a coupon that knocked the game down significantly lower to $1.40 which at that price you might as well pick it up and test it out.\n","December 15, 2014","true","2.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

This is not a puzzle platformer. This is a game about solving puzzles. The developer has described it correctly. I did not read the description with enough attention before I bought it and started playing it.\n\nI disliked this game a lot within the first twenty minutes of starting it because I thought I was going to play a smooth puzzle platformer with cool tricks up its sleeve. This game is quite far from what I expected it to be. The characters move in a slow and deliberate manner. Adding to my dislike of the game, I found the characters annoying, what with their slow movements and repeatedly saying "I HAE-CHEW" (I hate you) and "I LOOOOVE YOU!"\n\nI quickly wrote it off as a bad purchase and a bad game. I came back to it a few weeks later. This time I knew what I was getting myself into (a puzzle game, not a puzzle platformer) and I had a lot of fun solving its puzzles. It's interesting how changing ones perspective of what to expect changes other things as well. I stopped finding the characters annoying when I looked at this as a puzzle game.\n\nAs a puzzle game with no level editor, it has almost no replayability.

Its not incredibly difficult from what i have just played, but it is a very nice feeling to have when the game encourages you and supports you. The beggining levels take you through the gameplay swiftly and even though i have only seen one cut scene so far, it was very comical and lovable. Alot to like about this game, doesnt seem like it will take that long to complete but as i said, wonderful to see a game with alot of player encouragement.

Some puzzles also seem mildly broken, I've had several instances where I didn't have to use some of the given puzzle objects, though most puzzles tend to make you require them all. The game takes a sharp difficulty spike near the end with some tougher puzzles that I don't feel the previous levels quite prepared the player for, though nothing is too terribly difficult overall. It's a fun little puzzle game, though maybe not worth the full asking price on steam, especially since there's apparently a mobile version available for $2, which is... a more reasonable price for the game, I feel. Especially considering the utter lack of music and fairly simplistic (though cute enough) graphics.","December 14, 2014","true","4.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

I love puzzle games.\n\nPair puzzle games with a cute art style and I'm set. A couple levels later on did stump me for a bit, which was a surprise. Overall, it was pretty fun!\n\nAbout Love, Hate & the other ones surprised me. I found myself getting stuck on multiple levels (not for very long, but I still got stuck!) and having to reset more than once. That pretty much earns a recommendation right there, but let’s explore for a bit.\n\nPros:\n- With this game, not only do you get somewhat of a challenge (depending on how quickly you can figure out puzzles), but also an incredible art style and adorable little characters.\n- Cute concept – Hate, as shown on the right in the picture above, can force the other ones away by interacting with them, and Love, on the left, can bring them toward him. Love and Hate have to work together most levels to reach the button, which then advances you to the next level.\n- I was stumped on a few levels and had to take a break before being able to solve them.\n- 4 total scenes for this game – cave, castle, machine, and ice mountain – that provide a good contrast to the same basic structure.\n\nCons:\n- A bit short – not enough levels/range of difficulty for me.\n- I’d say this is only an easy to medium ranged puzzle game. If you play it straight through like I tried to do, it may get more difficult.

I admit that in a puzzle game this isn't crucial, but it just would have been nice if you hadn't to spend so much time watching your characters walking over the screen.\n-ridiculously long loading times: seriously, why does a 2D one screen level need about 8 seconds to load (yes, I timed it)\n-sound/audio: unless your deaf you won't be able to finish this game without turning the audio off.

It later turned into a headache, though. It really isn't a BAD or HORRIBLE game. It simply stops being fun, way too soon.\n\nThe game has a simple concept which is easy to grasp, It's basically a puzzle platformer where you have two buddies - Love and Hate, and you have to make one of them push a button. That simple. The way is lined with obstacles, of course, or we'd have no game, right?\n\nThe trouble is that the game is not done too interestingly, and while being a good port of the mobile game, it really fails to feel "fun" all the way through. I've finished most of the levels but at the very beginning I felt I'm playing it just to finish the game, really.\n\nAbout Love, Hate and the other ones gets too boring, too repetitive, too tedious, and too soon, unfortunately. There are some challanging levels but most are really not (except for the very last 10-15 levels, maybe).\n\nGenerally, not much was done too keep us entertained and intrigued. Leaving the gameplay aside, the graphics are OK but nothing special, there are barely any sound effects or any effects at all (except for the "I love you, I looooooooove you, I hate you" you'd keep hearing over and over and would probably want to mute eventually). There's no story whatsoever. There's nothing much, in short.\n\nThis game is pure casual stuff, which is not necessarily bad, but here it simply doesn't work that well.\n\nThis is not a bad game, not at all, but it really isn't anything too good. It's probably nice to beat a level once in a while, once in a week or so. But for games like this, I'd say to just keep them in the smartphone. Otherwise it gets pretty tiring.","September 26, 2015","false","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The characters do look rushed though\n- There is an "Apply" button in options that doesn't do anything.\n- Music is the same 15 seconds looped over and over again.  I don't love it, I hate it.

The art style is appealing enough and it's a simple puzzle game that can have a little bit of enjoyment.\n\nMy gripe with it is that the music gets old after a little while, constantly hearing "I HATE YOU" and "I LOVE YOU" with every click on a obstacle quickly grows old. Speaking of click, it's nearly all click based, while this isn't a bad thing I certainly don't like it, you can easily mess up, which leads me to believe that's why they put the undo option in, but that subtracts from the difficulty of any puzzle, which makes me think this game is more suited for a younger audience.\n\nI give it a 3/10 I don't necessarily hate it, nor do I love it..

For those looking to find endless gameplay, achievables, customization, or anything of the like, this is not for you!  However About Love, Hate and the other ones brings a friendly, quirky take on the indie puzzle genre to a point, that I myself quite enjoyed for the price.  I am a little over halfway through the total number of levels, but the difficulty and challenge is starting to ramp up as well.  I imagine that those with a good mind for puzzles could beat the game in about 2 hours, less skilled individuals would possibly take no more than 3.5-4.\n\nIf you're looking for something mildly fun to kill time, look no furthar.  However I would wait until this title goes on sale for the amount of gameplay you will actually receive.\n\nThe experience was fun, and rewarding, but for the low amount of content and the price, I would not purchase at full retail.\n\nPros - (Mechanics, Music, Great thought provoking puzzle designs)\n\nCons - (Price in relation to content)\n\nRating (Disregarding Price) - 7/10","December 14, 2014","false","1.5"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","4","17","0","0"

In that regard, About Love, Hate & the other ones, is a brilliant example of its genre.\n\nYou control two different characters, Love and Hate, both having unique traits making them need to work together to solve the puzzle of each level. Movement is done by clicking the mouse on the screen that - in effect - works as a grid of possible positions - so not the usual stepless movement most abundant in platformers, but it works really well, and as you click a new position for your character to take, their movement towards it is beautifully animated and paced just right.\n\nBackgrounds and cut scenes add to the aesthetic appeal of the game. Surprisingly, even at level 30, the repetitive spoken words of the characters still hasn't got on my nerves. I think it would have done had not the gameplay been appealing and enjoyable.\n\nSo far, puzzles are not extremely challenging, but they are fun, making for a nice, relaxing casual puzzle game.\n\nIn short, for anyone who likes puzzle games in general, and puzzle platformers in particular, I'd highly recommend this one.","May 9, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has some good characters, simple and understandable design, single mouse button interface.  I found most of the puzzles easy to medium to solve and only got stuck on 2 which had me scratching my head.  Nice to dip in and out of.  Would recomend it to anyone who enjoys puzzle solving.","February 19, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both 'things' send out little pulses which have the pull/push effect on whatever they hit. The concept is simple but well done.\n\nGood:\nThe puzzles are well designed and challenging\nThe art style is fantastic\nDespite looking like a mobile port, it feels like a PC port (settings menu and everything)\nThe pathing algorithm is fantastic and automatically guiding a 'thing' is very easy and accurate\nNot really a fan:\nThere isn't a story (slight personal annoyance)\nSome of the angles are hard to predict\nSome of the ending levels become chores as you have to do a very specific thing in the beginning which cannot be easily predicted\nThere isn't any music\nOverall, it was fun for a little time waster. It only took me around 60-90 minutes of serious playing but I don't want to play any more of it.","July 12, 2015","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Im going to tell you about the prons and cons about this game. NOTE! Do not buy this game if you dont have patience because you are not going to clear all levels just by your first try. The game is pretty, it has the soft forms that makes you feel relaxed and calm. You may not always stay calm when it gets harder and you come deeper in to the game. So this game is about to solve puzzles, where its all about thinking. You control 2 small black "blobs" Wich the other one is Love and the other one is Hate. You can control "the other ones" "other blobs" through the map to get through the level and hit the button that takes you to the next level. It all gets more complicated when more stuff comes up. Im stuck in level 21 so far and still enyoing the game.\n\nPros+\n\n+ The game looks Pretty\n+ Cool design\n+ You can play this game without a beefy computer\n+ The puzzles are great but takes its time\n+  Its an unique puzzle game and not like others ive played\n\nCons-\n\n- The soundtrack gets a little annoying when you have played the game a while\n\nI still recommend this cool little puzzle game!","June 6, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is easy enough for kids to play but also good enough for adults that don't have a lot of time to play long levels, since they are mostly just short puzzles that can be solved each within a couple of minutes.","May 25, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Starts off easy, but you'll come to hate some of the later levels. That is until you beat 'em and rediscover your love for the game all over again.

I haven't reached anything challenging however I did only play until level 51. With the undo button its very forgiving when mistakes are made. I found the game to be a nice introduction to puzzle games. Probably a game I would recommend to a younger audience with very little puzzle game experience.","October 10, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
