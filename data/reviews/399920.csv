It's just not that amusing of an Angry Birds-esque game.\n\nBTW, the game is 100% free for Android on Google Play linked above. I'm not sure why you would pay $2 for it here, when it is Free on Android. You can play on PC via an Android emulator if you really wanted.","January 15","false","3.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

A great mobile game, which for me ports really well to pc, with nice achievements, hats, beards, clothing ...  to boot !! The soundtrack was a supprisingly well put together from freely available elevator music. Picked this up in a bundle, but I wouldn't be upset if I had paid the non sale price.","September 26, 2015","true","30.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Hit around a blowfish, get stars, and then play blowfish pachinko and decorate it with ridiculous outfits. 10/10 Best game of the year.\n\nWarning: Absolutely not for you if you hate death by mine, death by sea urchin, and restarting levels over and over and over and over.... If you'd like a random procedurally generated darksouls for clicker addicts with ridiculously cute graphics and music so bad it's good and Michael Bay explosions via blowfish and blowing up boxes that are literally filled with junk? Then you'll love this.","February 9","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Simple; pull fish tail and release to shoot fish forward, grab goodies, avoid baddies with a lot of achievements and extras to collect.     Not much else to say... good, casual game for a few minutes at a time...","September 30, 2015","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Clearly designed for mobile, but I had no problems playing it with a mouse.  Gameplay is simple: you drag and launch a blowfish through an obstacle-filled cavern divided into stages.  Along the way, you may optionally collect stars.  100 stars earn you a try in the game's version of a pachinko machine, where depending where your fish lands you can earn silly outfits.  In a pleasant touch for the casual gamer, many common obstacles aren't lethal (urchins are, though).","September 30, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I appreciate the creative effort that went into the comedy and (surprisingly) deep gameplay, in that you can use seaweed to hang from the ceiling for a better vantage point, among other things. That accompanied by the goofy music and sound effects make it well worth $2, though I'd probably have paid 5.","September 25, 2015","true","0.1"," 13 of 77 people (17%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","17","13","77","3","0"

I saw this game "blowy fish" I thought it would be a dumb game that I would quickly refund. But, Blowy Fish isn't just a game...Its a work of art. If you are smart enough to pick up this game...watch out for the motifs hidden in the plot. Trust me, by act 3 you will never be the same. So overall I would have to rate this game...this masterpiece. A solid 10.5/10. This game will go down in history.","September 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 16 of 87 people (18%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","18","16","87","30","3"
