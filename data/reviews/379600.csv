Gameplay is quite similar to the "Dash" games. Clients walk into the shop, usher them to a table and proceed to take orders. Difference is the bikers, taking up valuable table space while not paying for their meal you want to get them out of the diner asap. How you ask? By feeding those manly men chilli.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_jOykPSzRI\nProgress through each day rewards cash which can then be spent on store upgrades. Other ways to gain cash include increasing reputation enough for the townsfolk to run charity days that invest in your store and playing the mini games between service, which in-turn increase your daily profits since you have special meals to sell. Diner Mania contains 4 different stores that require upgrading, each has their own different themes, menu items and background music. Upgrades included better quality meals, drinks, deserts, tables for more customers and plants that could be placed to increase tip profits.\n\nSurprisingly decent 2.5D artstyle, almost clay animation. No rebindable controls but the entire game is mouse driven with a clean UI. With many customers in the store I still found it easy to click on the right people and orders. One great feature is the ability to queue commands up. Able to click on customers, have the chef prepare orders and set your pathway for delivery all while the game is still processing the first move. Not sure how many moves could be prepped ahead since there is no visual indication but it worked rather well.\n\nNot bad for the price overall, worth checking out of you enjoyed the Dash series or time management games. Casual by nature but more then enough to stay interesting and keep you on your toes. Cheers folks. :)","June 28, 2015","true","1.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","1"

Graphics are fine, sounds ok. Gameplay is annoying to the extreame. The AI is rediculously stupid. Comand clicks aren't registered half the time. So you just have to keep telling the waistress over and over. It's a pain in the b*tt.

Just like in Cook, Serve, Deliciou! you will be going on a clicking frenzy.\n\nI think the most awesome feature this game has to offer however, is you can load up a long queue of actions for your waitress to fulfill, and she will remember each and every task perfectly making the game play so much more fun.\n\nIt definitely has simple mechanics, but it's still challenging enough, but not overly for a casual game. Given the amount of content and stuff you can buy/ unlock as well as the minigames and virtually endless levels, I think there is great replay value here, especially if you're looking through your Steam library and have no idea what you're in the mood for. This game is colourful and fun with insanely cute graphics and smooth animations. Watching all the little people eating their meals is fun in itself, although you won't find yourself idle for long! The music as well is perfect and cheerful, and all of the little sound effects are all appropriate and helpful.\n\nOverall this is a high quality casual game which is simply a great pleasure to play. My only problems with it is sometimes clicking the little circles to make stuff is a bit tedious at times if you're trying to speed your way through, and I also think there could be more place settings on the benches to store more dishes, but overall I give this game an:\n8/10","June 27, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Seat patrons, see what they order, get chef to make and serve when ready. Spend earnings on upgrades such as on more tables and food items.\nGangsters come in, add chilli to whatever they order so they leave.\n\nVery easy, non complicated gameplay, it's the kind of game you play to pass the time or if you're not sure what to play. It took me only  5 hours to complete everything as in get all stars for all 4 restaurants.\n\nOk for $1 but not worth anymore than that.\n\nIt's a rather average basic game I'd rate it 5/10\nI reccomend it as it's ok and I don't hate the game.","February 19","true","5.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

This is not for a quiet relaxing gaming zone-out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/niftys/recommended/379600/","niftys","Nifty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/niftys/","453 products in account","Diner Mania is a game where you are given the task to run a restaurant, serve customers and try to get gangsters to leave the business. With the money you earn you can upgrade your restaurant and get new dishes to serve. Eventually you save enough money to buy three more restaurants and you should try to earn the full three stars in each restaurant to finish the game.\n\nThe game has a good pace, and can get quite difficult at times when you are swarmed with customers. Thankfully you are able to switch restaurants in the game, so it never really gets boring (until the end, when I was trying to get the three stars in the last restaurant, and no upgrades left, that was a bit tedious).\n\nOver all, I don't really have any complaints with the game. The mechanics with gangster customers you have to get rid off is a fun twist. I finished it in less than 6 hours, so I think that it's worth the price if you like these kinds of games.","July 2, 2015","true","5.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For one, there are some customers you're deliberately trying to get rid of.  Some things don't make a lot of sense...like why individuals who look like bikers are referred to as "gangsters"...when I think gangsters I think tommy gun-wielding cousin Vinnie.  Perhaps they meant "gang members".  At any rate, gameplay is pretty fast...though some like myself may still consider this to be relatively casual as the mechanics aren't hard to grasp.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPT4Oj87NRA","June 26, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Golly it's so much fun.  Mindless fun. Like playing the slots. Your mind goes blank and you just keep pulling that leaver and , oh wait, pushing that button and pushing that button.  (I dated myself, last time I went to Vegas they had arms on machines and they used large tokens or silver dollars). Anyhow this game won't put you to sleep and it's WAY better than some of the under $5 dreck out there. Buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Andreille/recommended/379600/","Andreille","Omega Flowey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Andreille/","121 products in account","Diner Mania is what it sounds like, a combination of Diner Dash and Cake Mania. As far as content goes, Diner Mania is bare bones, offering only the most minimal of content a game of this genre can present. The storyline is fairly straightforward: A string of family friendly restaurants are driven out of business by rowdy bikers who vandalize, terrorize, and refuse to pay their bill, leaving only the owners of the Italian restaurant in charge of helping rid their town of the biker plague and put their neighbouring restaurants back in business. Despite this endearing storyline, this game itself is anything but endearing,\n\nThere's no dialogue, written, spoken or otherwise, and the character models are terrifyingly plastic with dead expressions and no personality. The only thing you get from the sparce selection of patron models are grunts and coughs of which there are only about three or four total.\n\nThe coding is shoddy as attempting to take seperate orders from a single serving station results in the primary order being dropped from the queue and the waitress taking only the second order, resulting in botched orders and ultimately waisting time and cash. The spice rack also oftentimes presents incorrectly, showing me full spices at the beginning of a new restaurant, only to go into a game with missing spices.\n\nThere is no real challenge to the game with only bikers as primary enemies. They serve only to take up space and waste food.\n\nIf you're into these click frenzy games, it certainly delivers as the game can get terrifyingly hectic and at its worst, can definitely help pass the time, but with only a few hours or gameplay, the replayability is deathly low. It's only marginally worth its normal price, but certainly won't make you regret purchasing it for a dollar.\n\nPros\n- Fairly relaxing music\n\nCons\n- bad coding\n- bland content\n- ugly character models","February 17","false","8.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
