THIS IS NOT THAT GAME!!!!!!  I cannot stress enough how this is totally different from the from version of this game.  Cutscenes are gone, visual controls are garbage, all robots, vehicles and buildings appear as being black so it is very hard to tell what is yours and what isn't.  Pyros shoot nothing just a flamethrower sound and I can't speak for most of the other units in the game because your technicians won't capture the fort in the beginning of the first forest level and basically the game can't proceed. This game is major leage broken and an absolute crap remake of a really good original.","August 2, 2014","false","37.4"," 50 of 74 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","50","74","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BenjinKabat/recommended/275510/","BenjinKabat","Benjin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BenjinKabat/","382 products in account","NOTE\nI'd like to say, first of all, that most of the negative reviews for this game are very out of date; most are from 2014, immediately after the game was released. Most of the complaints about the cinematics/cutscenes have been addressed; you now have the good old, funny, comic-styled cutscenes in between chapters and briefings again.\n\nINTRO\nThe original Z: Steel Soldiers was released back in 2001. The version that has been released here on Steam is a remaster of the original. While there are a few lacking features from the original Z: Steel Soldiers (a game which I loved), such as multiplayer, I am glad that this has finally come to Steam as my old copy had broken some years ago, and that the game is now easily accessible to purchase and play. I am also glad that , despite this game not being that popular on Steam since release,  they are still working slowly on re-implementing the skirmish mode and improving the gameplay, as seen on the news section. It shows that the developers truly are dedicated to delivering a good game experience.\n\nREVIEW\nThe graphics in this game have been improved considerably since the old version, mostly for the better, as it is no longer looking so out of date at first glance, especially to someone who has not heard or seen the game before. However, I will admit that I feel some of the visual charm has been lost from the old game due to the graphical changes; colours are less vibrant and the sense of scale on the units has been skewed a bit through the changes, but that's just my opinion.\n\nThe game unfortunately does have issues with its user interface and its controls. For example, the mini-map is sometimes replaced with a PIP-window, so sometimes you won't be able to see your map, therefore taking away some of the control and situational awareness for a short period of time. My suggestions, to make the game that much better, would be to see an improvement to the things I mentioned above; return the original visual style for old times sake to preserve the work the original developers had done on it, and the user interface could be made to not be so clunky and slow by making the UI transitions instant to speed up micro. The controls would benefit from having the option to use WASD to pan the camera up/left/down/right. The PIP-window, alerting you about certain events, needs to have its own window, or at the very least have a toggle on/off option.\n\nDespite these issues, it is still pretty fun and presents itself very well; the voice acting is top quality and the cutscenes/briefings in the campaign are hilariously well written. Some of the missions do present quite a challenge at times. There is a sense of satisfaction in wreaking havoc across the battlefield; infantry, vehicles and buildings all cause explosions. The bigger they are, the bigger the explosion.\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you are looking to kill a few hours in a strategy arcade game, I highly recommend you buy it. At this price, it is dirt cheap and well worth it for what it offers. If you're still not convinced and slightly wary of parting your money, buy it during a sale.\n\nUPDATE 22/05/2015\nSkirmish has now been implemented, rejoice!\n\nUPDATE 18/08/2015\nThe devs have listened to the players and there has now been some changes to the balance of units. A bug with the Disruptor unit, which was present even in the original version, has now been fixed.\n\nUPDATE 09/11/2015\nMassive update has added quite a few new features which were not a part of the original version:\n• Visual FoW system added - Previously, you had to click on units to see how far they could see. Now, at a glance (as in most RTS games), you can see the extent to how far all of your units can see portions of the map without having to click on each one.\n• Higher resolution options - Some resolutions were not working before, now they do.\n• Cinematic Mode - Can press F12 to enter a cinematic / no HUD view mode (good for capturing videos / screenshots)","May 17, 2015","true","24.9"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

Sounds are a little glitchy, if you have the music too loud you can hear the music loops. However this again will be smoothed out in later builds.\n\nAI pathing (to me at least) has been improved but again a few glitches here and there to work out. Again this is only the first build.\n\nA leaderboard is there so you can still compare your scores and times with that of the global community as well as your friends.\n\nAll in all, not bad for the initial build of the game, a few improvements, the addition of multiplayer, and skirmish mode, and this game will be my favorite right up there with the original, which I still play, and on multiplayer for that matter ;) I highly recommend the game while it is on sale, and even when it goes off sale, still buy it, it is a great game, with great improvements on the way, and you will enjoy it just as much as I have and did!","August 2, 2014","true","3.8"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","44","67","0","13"

It is a fairly standard old skool RTS, unlike the first one, which was more about just holding zones. Now you can choose which buildings and zones to invest in. The humour is still here and the units are varied. The AI can be frustrating at times, for instance I lost several units as they destroyed the bridge they were standing on trying to shoot at a lone Psycho! If you adapt your play style to this though you can soon avoid embarrassing losses. The graphics have also been updated enough to make them look acceptable by today's standards. The comic strip cut scenes were removed but have been put back, which I am also glad about. This is a fun game with nostalgic value but also a good RTS for younger fans.","October 11, 2014","true","4.2"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

Had better sound track for some reason in this one you can hear the looping of the music, its far too noticable and dosnt seem to change for me on game states. For example in the original the music changed when a squad of men were under attack but now the music is just stuck on repeat for me.\n\nSecondly what happened to the robots, they used to look like military robots, robots that actually fitted in with what u would expect to see in future combat situations, now they look like gimped out crash dummies?\n\nMy advice to anyone is try and find a copy of the original and get it if you can. Otherwise wait for this one to get its problems sorted. Its really great trying to bring the Z series into the new era of gaming i hate to be critical of an old friend of mine but i only want to see it do the best it can and it can do so much more. Please dont give up and take this onboard as constructive criticism i want to see Z steel soldier reach the levels it is capable of.\n\n-Update- Dev has replied and has told in comments this is a known issue and is getting sorted will remove from review when it is-\nOn playing further - the bunkers in the game do not take damage.

This game makes no pretentions, it is a stripped down RTS, but it is stripped down in a good way. The map is divided into territories, holding territories increases your income, denying territories to your opponent denies them theirs. It's all about moving tactically between these zones and defending your command centre. You have land, sea and air units, it's all quite simple and that is basically the  (very addictive) game.\n\nAs for the story: it is very zany, comic book style and darkly humorous. It's a sci-fi storyline which is told between levels in cutscenes (and also via radio chatter while you're playing). Now the game is story driven in a very simple way i.e. cutscenes set up the level and your objectives form a part of the overall storyline. You could skip all the story without really affecting the game, but it's worth watching if you get the humour.\n\nThis is a remastered edition but don't expect AAA graphics, it's the simplicity of this while remaining challenging is what makes it an enduring classic for me. You can just pick it up and play, you don't need to invest time in learning how to control it. An absolute classic, great for scratching a quick strategy itch. Well worth getting this remastered edition for this sale price.","July 7, 2015","true","0.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Now this game has updated visuals which I like, looks more modern, still has the same music/sounds and plays like the original. The main difference like many have said, no hotkeys/shortcuts, cutscenes, skirmish and online multiplayer, main menu is different, plus many other features missing, now remember this is the first build and not the final, the devs have said the features, mainly cutscenes and skirmishes will come in updates in the future.\n\nI am only about 4 missions into the game and like I said above, I am enjoying playing this, I am currently waiting till the cutscenes are added so I can enjoy watching and follow the story. I am grateful of the devs to bring this out so I can finally enjoy this game hassel free and finally complete it, I own the original 2001 release, PC at the time (Win 98 with basic hardware) made the game lag really bad when you get about halfway of the story, my WIn 7 laptop played it but with recurring crashes, and now my current Win 8 just seems to crash before I get to the main menu.\n\nOverall I like the game, nice start with updated visuals with more features to come, if you concerned about the missing features, can wait till the updated version and see what others think, or you are a fan that doesn't mind the changes or lack of content (like me) then go for it.","August 4, 2014","true","7.4"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","17","24","0","0"

Unfortunately unlike its  predecessor, the modern version has no gamma correction and in many cases the graphics are too dark. The GT630 is more then capable of dealing with this modern version, but cannot tweek the gamma. There is a problem with the units as well, there are no individual lables to signify which soldier you selected, I am having trouble telling the difference between a tech-unit and a psycho, I have to listen to the audio to know who I have selected. In a fire fight you have not got the time to zoom back in in order to select individuals, then zoom out on the map to see where the skirmish is and select reinforcements to the area quickly.\n\nThe previous version in many cases has certain advantages over its replacement, you know what you are selecting and where you want to put the units at a moments notice; even when you have zoomed out to see the bigger picture. Without scratching your head in a firefight, wondering if you have selected the right unit or not. A gamma correction in the game could make all the difference in detail between winning or losing and seeing who you have selected. If these problems can be resolves, it would be a great game. I played the previous version dozens of times before  and after XP came out, and I never get bored with it. For people who love strategy games, this is still my top favourite no matter how old it is.","September 3, 2014","true","3.2"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I didn't see any difference in difficulty from Easy AI to Hard AI.   Other RTS games which have AI settings have noticible changes in difficulty, currently the player is at a serious dis-advantage in Skirmish when the AI can easily capture multiple zones, attack and defend all at the same time when the player can only do one of these at once.\n\nPromising, but needs some re-balancing and a few patches.","June 12, 2015","false","2.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

I appreciate the improved textures and FX, but the bots have been redesigned and have lost much of what gave them personnality in the first place.\nMy biggest complaint is the absence of skirmish and multiplayer modes.

The keywords here are at this moment of time.\n\nYep, this game does feel a bit like Early Access. There are some bugs and glitches here and there, most frequent of them are invincible bunkers (protip - bring some Pyros, their attacks ignore terrain at all) and targeting glitch, which makes your cursor think it's still on enemy building (it made me fail mission 12). Other bugs include units being stuck in buildings, units being unable to enter buildings (makes mission 18 unwinnable), untis reacting weird when under attack (I once had psycho running halfway around the map to retaliate to a guy who just popped up from nearby bridge), and minor non-gamebreaking bugs.\n\nCompared to original, graphics have been improved (original units looked like voodoo dolls of low-poly models; i could count polygons on those on my fingers), howerver there is a problem with bloom sometimes, plus bump mapping on some models look a bit over the top. Some units have been changed in their look, like Toughs now represtent robotic heavy weapons guy from TF2, only armed with homing missile launchers instead of machineguns, and mobile radar jammer now wheeled vehicle instead of tracked one it used to be. Generally, robots look more human than they were supposed to in original game concept-art, and some buildings feel like they've been enlarged and rescaled (worst case with robot factory and air hangar - the former feels a bit bloated, the latter has huge control tower).\n\nMy major complain so far is the interface. It's horrible, feels console-ish, and does not present some vital infromation, like balance of income and expences, timer in timed missions, unit count and upgrade levels.\n\nBut as far as gampelay goes, it still feels like i'm back in original ZSS: grab a handful of psychos, take as much of the flags on a map as you can, build up a strike group and go wipe the map with your enemies. Or, watch them wipe map with your troops, if you've miscalculated something. The latter however right now is entirely your fault, since there are no difficulty setting, and AI is somewhat clueless on what's it doing (however, on mission 14 AI tried to drop a light tank and two pyros on my command center via transport heli - never seen AI doing that in original).\n\nMultiplayer and Skirmish modes are missing so far, and i can't get clear understanding if devs will impliment them anytime soon/late.\n\nFinally, the sounds are taken right from original Z:SS, as wel as music tracks (and projectile models, save for Laser's - it's much brighter than original one was). However, currently there is a problem with music: it stucks in a loop and never ends. Even "mission successful" music. So, i dunno, pop your favorite epic techo playlist while you're at it? :D\n\nSo, as i said: get this if you're either hard-boiled Z:Steel Soldiers fan, or if you're Z series fan and don't mind game being a bit raw at the moment. Or if you like buying raw games and then complain on forums. Otherwise, wait.","August 18, 2014","true","8.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Below are my thoughts about this remastered version...\n\n- The developers have kept almost everything from the base game intact but have updated the game with new visuals, new models, UI etc. to match that of, for example, the older C&C Generals games instead of keeping the very old and outdated graphics from 2001.\n(By the way, all sounds are that from the base game.)\n\n- The devs are constantly updating this game, some features from the old classic game wasn't compatible with newer systems and so the devs are working around the clock to roll out updates frequently, just about two days ago the old cinematics were re-added to the game.\n(Skrimish is due around this month.)\n\nBased on my own personal opinion i recommend this game, the only flaw i've encountered is that some of the later Campaign missions are extremely difficult but aside from that this is a solid return of an old classic!\n\nZod is back!!!","August 8, 2014","true","7.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I think the developers know that there has still much to be improved and it's great that they listen to the community. I love RTS games and this is not a bad one.

Their utter failure of making this game relevant is sadly apparent even in the options menu or lack of display options available.\n\nThe controls are not re-bindable and for a RTS that is a big over sight. The control issues in the game do not help this matter any. In between a resources system that forces your play mode into high rush style combat along with buildings and summoning of troops which take you out of the fight due to the  poorly laid out UI these two things fight against each others very nature. The game is filled with controls which make the game more of a chore to play than a challenge.  Along with a mini map that is next to worthless.\n\nIt has no skirmish mode nor any way outside the campaign missions to play the game. Their addition of  a leader board system does not help the game out for it adds nothing to the actual play ability of the game.  The game is more of a hassle than a worth.\nFor more details, see the linked video review, as this is a basic summary of\nwhat I cover in my video, I am a YT'er not a Blogger.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","September 21, 2014","false","2.1"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","12","23","0","0"

Aside from one patch that helped with animations, very little has changed since my initial review. Therefore, I can't say that I still recommend this game, and would instead recommend tracking down a copy of the original. It hasn't aged well graphically, but the gameplay is superior to this port.\n\n\nFirst thing out of the way- the only thing in this game right now is the campaign mode, the same from the original SS.\n\nIt's definitely a work-in-progress. I just popped my old copy of SS in and played it, and then played this version. It's much more touch-friendly for touch devices since it was just released on Google Play (and maybe the App Store?) very recently. This is very evident in the UI. Being able to scale the size of the game would be very helpful, as for having a 1080p monitor I should be able to zoom out far more.\n\nKeeping in mind it's a work-in-progress, here are my observations after having played through the first world of the game:\n\n---\nPros:\n\n+ Same great gameplay from the original.\n+ The cutscenes are back, as are the original voices. None of that has changed.\n+ Campaign now "rates" you out of 3 stars (a la Angry Birds) for your performance. It has no effect on unlocking campaign levels.\n+ Textures look much nicer. Not all of them, however (see below)\n\nCons:\n- Skirmish is not here (but coming, as the developer has announced)\n- not optimized for large displays (the icons are huge, perhaps for touch device friendliness?)\n- No MP (yet)\n- Can't customize controls as far as I've seen so far\n- Music has very noticeable looping\n- Can't use Build Repeat on buildings\n- Too many unnecessary animations in the menus (hiding loading times, perhaps?)\n- Textures are updated, which means a very different art style. Others have likened this to looking like "crash dummies" and for some parts I would agree. I personally prefered the older art style because they looked more like off-the-line robots rather than things with personality (which the hero units should have!) but to each their own.\n- Units run on the air. Or at least, that's what it looks like. Their feet and shadows don't line up and it looks really odd.\n\nOther thoughts:\n\n= I would really love it if the developer could also include the nice build animation from the original (or something like it!) because it was really cool to see the lines slowly build and the "walls" slowly form on buildings. It's a much more jarring animation now but is still in stages. A decrease in the animations for "right-clicking" on units would be great, too. It just seems like it makes it take more time than it needs to.\n\n= The menu background graphic is kind of odd- I'm not sure why it's there, as it doesn't really have a lot to do with the game's setting.\n\n= The globe is nice for giving a sense of perspective for where the battles are taking place in the campaign, but it's HUGE. Seeing all the levels/making the transition better would be cool.\n\n= PLEASE try to find a way to bring back the old economy UI! Being able to see your income differential was much better than just having a ticker with how much money you currently have.\n\nBugs so far- Bunkers having HUGE amounts of health/it not being hit properly; units climbing up cliffs when they should not be able to jump that distance; Units not being able to be hit when standing next to (but not blocked by) a building.\n\nIt's also hard sometimes to select certain units in a group. At times units will clump up and then you can't ever select one, it selects all.\n\n----\n\nThat all being said, I still do enjoy the game. Is it as enjoyable as the previous incarnation? Not yet. Hopefully it will be! I'm looking forward to seeing how things turn out. I don't regret purchasing this *yet*, but I'll check back in a couple of months to see how it's progressed.\n\nRecommendation: YES, though be prepared to be disappointed a little, especially if you expect the exact same game with a facelift. The developers are sincerely looking at feedback and that's reassuring.","September 6, 2014","false","1.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
