Part of the charm to this game is that it mimics the original Dragon Quest games in color, menus, maps and even the feel of the towns. If You've played Breath of Death VII, you've played this.\n\nAfter each battle, each party member gets restored to full health, including dead characters. Even if you escape, you get full health. This makes the game streamlined and easy even on normal (medium) difficulty. To compensate for this, the game balances out by powering up the monsters after each round. Their attack strength keep going up by 10%. It puts pressure to finish the fight fast. There is also no run, but instead its relegated to a magic skill given to one character. One of the biggest enjoyments that I get out of the game is the ability to chose one of two bonuses every time a character reaches a new level. Do you chose this spell or that spell? Do you want +20 Max HP and +20 strength or +10 Strength + 10 Willpower +10 Magic +10 Vitality? Even at level 40, the game still had choices for me.\n\nThe challenge is in your MP / mana. You will get some back after each battle, but outside of an Inn or a save point (you can save on the fly too). You won't be able to refill your magic. On the surface, fighting and button mashing makes quick work of enemies. Deeper into any dungeon makes fighting difficult without using magic or techniques (both cost MP / mana). While battles are random, the dungeons have specific numbers of battles before the random battles get down to 0. So if you fight 20 random battles, you won't have any other random battles to fight. This works well, because you can go deep into a dungeon, have no mana left and need to walk back out of the dungeon. Having 0 remaining random battles ensures your survival. Since there is no sort of easy teleportation. A few dungeons force you to beat the boss and walk back. Luckily there is a sprint button to speed things along..\n\nSpells get upgraded by your choices when you level up. A lightning spell can go from X damage to Y damage when you select it maybe ten levels after you've earned the original lightning spell. There is a full heal spell that will not only give a character full health, but revive them as well. Making it easy if a character dies that you're trying to heal, well they're just resurrected! There aren't any items, but there are potions. You can't buy these, you need to find them in caves. They resurrect and give full health to any character. These are necessary if your lone healer dies. There is a health regenerating zombie though and a vampire sort of attack with another character.\n\nYou can find 1-Ups that let you retry a fight that wiped out your party. I was a fan of this and I remember it from Final Fantasy Legend 2. You still get a choice whether you use it or just accept a game over and load a save file. There were plenty of times that I chose a save file over replaying a fight. You can save on the fly and there are save points that will do it for you. Usually before boss battles.\n\nYou start out with the legendary Cthulhu, a squid monster with the power of darkness. He has a bold, comically evil personality that is one of the joys of the game. To balance him out, you'll come across six others that will join you. A happy healer named Umi that has a crush on Cthulhu. A talking sword named Stabe that offers some sage advice and wisdom. A necromancer / hot chick named October with a whip and damaging spells. I won't spoil the rest, but you get a sense of how quirky the game's personalities are. They each have input no matter how silly. The only catch to having a party of 7 is that only four can fight at once and you always need Cthulhu in your party since this is his game. If you ever get stuck deep in a dungeon with no mana, you can switch out your characters on the fly. The inactive characters still gain experience with the active ones.\n\nThe humor really fit better with this game than Breath of Death which relied on video game references. Cthulhu Saves the World felt like it had its own jokes that fit with the personalities of the characters. Some were good, others weren't, but they still fit what the game is. I'm never a big fan of story even in role playing games, but I felt like what I did read was enjoyable.\n\nThere is a combo system which I find it useful. Every attack builds a combo. There are special combo boosts and breakers that when used will multiply the damage by the combo, but reset the combo to 0. It would be more useful if these specials weren't already the highest damagers in general. You can keep using them to kill the enemies quickly without having to build a combo. Even the bosses felt like pushovers and I can tell I was underpowered for the bosses when each of my characters would level up twice with some bosses. Its just a testament to how easy the game is on normal difficulty. After playing through Breath of Death on hard, I didn't want to make that mistake again.\n\nFor equipment, Cthulhu Saves the World is bare bones. You have a weapon and armor. No headgear, no accessory. Towns don't have more than a couple weapons and armor for your seven characters. Each character has one type of weapon and armor. None of these types get shared, so if you get a sword, you know only Cthulhu can equip it. If you get a Tome, only October can equip it as armor. There are a few treasures here and there in dungeons. Treasures do feel more rewarding to find in this game, because a lot of treasures in Breath of Death were jokes. There is no interaction with anything outside of talking to townspeople. Nothing hidden in book shelves and dressers, just jokes about what's really in them.\n\nThe world itself feels big enough. There are around 15+ dungeons and 4+ towns. You won't get to travel the oceans or visit far off lands, but the dungeons are the real maps. Each dungeon feels big enough. There are mostly underground areas, a forest and the ruins of giant towns. You can tackle them pretty openly. I found myself wandering deep into an overpowered dungeon and I couldn't get out. I had to one by one grind through the limited fights hoping each fight would be easy enough for me to overcome. I didn't know that I wasn't supposed to be there at my level. Of course grinding through that made everything else a cake walk.\n\nThe graphics are bright and beautiful and feel like they would fit in with the Super Nintendo era. Cthulhu goes the extra mile with what I can only describe as comic cut scenes going into certain sections. You still have traditional dialog beneath, but there are beautiful 16 bit style pictures over pictures that add to the jokes. The music itself also adds a lot to my enjoyment of the game.\n\nFor those that complete the game, there are bonus modes. One new mode lets you replay the story on level 40 and another mode that lets you replay the game with different characters, dialog and bosses. It makes me want to replay the game in a new way. There is even a developer commentary (written) that you can chose to have on. It gives a lot of insight and rational. I found myself reading them more than I paid attention to the dialog.\n\nIf you don't want to get too involved with a 40 - 80 hour RPG, Cthulhu Saves the World could be for you. With saving anywhere and refilling your HP after every battle, that makes for an easy game. Some people like easy! $3 is a great price for the content in my opinion. It also comes with Breath of Death VII in a combo pack for the same price. I feel like I got my money's worth with just this game alone.","February 12, 2015","true","8.8"," 77 of 79 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","77","79","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/107310/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","When first playing the game, the best aspect makes it's appearence quickly: The humor.\n\nCthulhu is a real anti-hero who grumpily tries to save the world and he has a lot of funny dialogue throughout the game. The fact that he looks so uninviting also leads to a lot of awkward situations amongst the townsfolk, resulting in a lot of clever jokes. Along the way, he will also make allies who contribute in their own way, such as his obsessed groupie that sees him as the most charming person ever while he couldn't care less.\n\nDuring the combat, every monster has their own description with some funny line added to it. Townsfolk will usually react to whoever you chose to bring along. The dialogue between the characters are also my kind of tea, with lots of arguing and misunderstandings.\n\nThe sprites in the game are for the most part well done. They can get somewhat repeatetive in the dungeons, making it a bit hard to remember exactly where you are. The rooms can look way too samey at times, so I have gotten lost in many dungeons, unable to find my way back to the outside.\n\nI thought the music was very good. It has the right atmosphere for each and every part they take in. I especially liked the male choir chanting inside the dungeons, adding a mysterious atmosphere to them. The town music is very calming and relaxing to listen to.\n\nI like that the dungeon chests actually contains good items. In other games, you literally risk your life for a potion that doesn't even restore half of what you lost to get to it. Here, you can get impressive upgrades and lots of money. It made treasure hunting worthwile and fun.\n\nThe armor and weapon menus could definately have been polished. Comparing items is quite clunky, with you being unable to compare stats side by side. Anytime you buy an armor or weapon, the shopkeeper says "Thanks!" and throws you back to the option whether you want to buy or sell. It would have been better to be able to stay on the page you just purchased something.\n\nThere is one huge flaw with this game unfortunately. And it is the combat system.\n\nAnytime the party has taken a turn, whether damaging the enemy or healing themselves, the monsters gets an increased percentage of damage. This number is quite high, around 10%, which builds up extremely fast. This forces you to use your strongest and fastest abilities, as otherwise you are going to end up in an endless die/revive loop where the monsters will get stronger while you can't keep up reviving your party members that gets slayed within one or two turns.\n\nIt also leads to making many spells and abilities useless, since you don't have time to use them. One of my characters has so many spells that she never gets time to use. And it's not just one or two, she has about 6 different spells which basically spells "Game over" for me if I even concider using them. Their damage output is just too weak to compete with the monster damage output. So each and every fight, I am constantly casting the same powerful spell.\nIt unfortunately leads to a lot of scrolling in the menu, as usually these spells are learned much later. So you have lots of useless abilities and spells clogging your menu, which you have to scroll through each and every time you want to use an ability or spell. I haven't found any way to sort the abilities and spells, which would have been greatly needed.\n\nAs the combat is completely text based, there is also a huge lack of action on the screen. The monsters will just implode on themselves when they die and there's not even a picture of your members on the combat screen. Only when you make the choice to attack do you see their faces. Then the monsters just flashes when they take damage. The combats are very boring to watch, though thankfully you can scroll through the combat text quite quickly, ending some battles in seconds.\n\nAfter playing this, I understand why they have a system which fills your characters HP to max afte every encounter - otherwise they would never survive in this game! The game really shows you no remorse once the monsters have taken a couple of turns.   Forget being tactical, you simply don't have the time to waste. Forget about wanting to use a different spell than the fire one. If fire does 200 more damage than ice, you have to stick to fire. Each and every encounter.\n\nTo me, the combat system feels like a filler into a very short game. I love the humor, I love advancing through the story and reading the dialogue. But at the eight hour mark, thinking about combat makes me groan. Same old spells over and over. No thanks.\n\nAfter eight hours of the game, I only enjoy it due to the humor and dialogue. But at this point, the combat system is so offputting that I am literally forcing myself to finish the game. So I honestly wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It all boils down whether I would recommend the game based on the story and seeing as the dialogue only happens after encounters, then it will be a no.","December 3, 2013","false","10.1"," 145 of 202 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","145","202","0","6"

Did you just read it wrong? You might think, what the f*** is that? The answer is simple really, it's a name of the game you definitely should own.\n\nWhere is the logic? Who cares, the game gives you so much more ( except the logic bits of course). This is by far the funniest game I have played, which is also so cheap. For the first 4 minutes I couldn't stop laughing. It wasn't just the character lines, but also the art. You don't get to fight a crab or seagull often right? As soon I got laughing at Cthulhu and his jokes I started playing the game.\n\nControls for the game are very easy and all you need to do is run forward, find treasures and kill enemies, thus saving the world. Since this was the first time I have ever played anything like this, I really enjoyed the level up system, you get to decide what's better, a skill or a stat.\n\nThe other thing that I personally enjoyed was music. God, I thought I was watching an anime from 90s. It's just so good. Sound effects are nice too, I mean you can't over do them in this kind of game. The graphics... I am not too sure what to say here. The graphics are understandable from the first glance, so I think that's a very good point.\n\nThere were some problems thought. I had a few crashes on my windows 7, but none on XP. Crashing without a save would mean that you need to start where you left off. Thank god, this game supports steam cloud, unlike some other high end games. Also, there was this one time when I ran another game while I was playing CStW, I am not too sure how that happened.\n\nIn overall, I would highly suggest that you get this game. To some it will be a new experience, but to most it will be quite nostalgic. And common, wouldn't you want to fight a dolphin or kick some arrogant hero's ♥♥♥? I'd say that the steam price for this game is quite fair!","March 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 55 of 63 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","55","63","0","2"

Authors used this setting to make hilarious and remarkable moments. Cthulhu is loveable character; he just wants to destroy the world, to do so he must become true hero.

Stripped of his powers by a mysterious spellcaster upon yonder cliff, Cthulhu must set out on a quest in order to become a true hero so he can regain his powers and destroy the world after he saves it. Sounds crazy, right? Well, if you're interested in the premise, then it is well assured that the rest of the game is even better. I'm here to analyze the game and give my personal opinion on it, so if you're looking for a serious review, you've come to the right place. Let's start by looking over the story.\n\nStory:I'm going to just give you the Cliff's Notes version of the story: Cthulhu rises from R'lyeh to destroy reality. Sorceror robs him of his powers. Narrator tips off Cthulhu that he has to become a hero to destroy the world. Cthulhu begins quest to save then destroy world. After that, Cthulhu goes from town to town saving the populace from stuff, such as Nyarlathotep-controlled zombies or a demon-dragon in a volcano. While the title says that Cthulhu saves the world, he never really does so until the final dungeon, making the game more like The Adventures of Cthulhu the Hero and Friends. CStW's story has nothing connecting the various events that occur together, but since this game is a parody of JRPGs, it's just enough for a person to not question it.\n\nCharacters:While the story of Cthulhu Saves the World may be a loose string of events that barely constitute as a plot, the characters can kinda make up for this. As per Zeboyd Games standard, the characters are rather creative. In the party you're stuck with throughout the game's course, there's the hero himself, Cthulhu, who is on a quest to restore his powers; The resident Red Mage, Umi, who has a crush on Cthulhu after he saves her from two slime monsters; Sharpe the living sword, who is only there because Cthulhu wants a huge sword like every other hero; The angsty Black Mage and gothic necromancer, October; Cthulhu's old alien cat friend, Paws; The senile White Mage on the brink of madness, Dacre; And the reformed demon-dragon, Ember. They're all wacky and provide the game with most of the humorous dialogue, but are the ones given most of the characterization, since they appear more than once in the game. Besides them, there's those three hero guys who only pop up twice and the chapter bosses who, besides Ember, who joins your party, only appear once. It's kinda unfortunate that nobody else gets any real characterization besides being a stereotypical NPC. However, the characters that do get some focus make the game much more enjoyable.\n\nGameplay:Cthulhu Saves the world's gameplay is a refined version of Breath of Death VII:The Beginning's gameplay. You can choose to battle at any time and there are a set amount of encounters in each area of the game, like in Breath of Death. When you engage an enemy, you can attack normally, use magic or physical skills, use a Unite skill with another party member, or defend/dodge. As each turn goes by, enemies grow 10%, giving you a psuedo-time limit. When you win a battle, your health is fully restored and you get some magic points back. Despite sounding so simple, it's a welcome departure from the battle mechanics of other RPGs and makes for a fun, albeit repetitive, experience.\n\nMusic:CStW's music is really good. Each track fits the feel of the situation it plays in, from the relaxing town themes to the action-packed boss themes, Cthulhu Saves the World's music is certainly notable among other RPGs.\n\nGraphics:Cthulhu Saves the World's graphic are an homage to the graphics style of early 16-bit era JRPGs like Final Fantasy IV and other games like that. However, they still manage to be well-detailed to the point where enemy recolors always have something besides palette that sets them apart from the opponents that came before them.\n\nAll-in-all, Cthulhu Saves the World is not for everybody, but it provides hours of fun with its various references, fun gameplay, and unique charm overall. If I had to point out any major flaws, however, I'd have to criticize the lack of coherent and fluid story in addition to lack of characterization for non-party members. However, if you like classic JRPGs like Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Breath of Fire, etc. then Cthulhu Saves the World will not disappoint.\n\nScore:7/10 - Good\n\n\n\n\nCthuhu's Angels Extra Mode Kinda Review\n\nCthulhu's Angels is an extra mode of Cthulhu Saves the World added in for the PC release of the game. It features October as she goes on Cthulhu's quest for him with three other (female) party members because... Hey, octopus/dragon/demon gods are generally lazy. Now, before anyone asks, I call this a "kinda review" because I'm not giving it a score, but I am going to go over the altered story and added characters while giving my opinion. That being said, let's get on with it.\n\nStory:In Cthulhu's Angels, October the super-angsty necromancer has fled to that place where Cthulhu washed up in CStW because everybody in her hometown mocked her for studying the arcane art of necromancy. There, she finds a holographic projecter that Cthulhu contacts her with,telling her that he was stripped of his powers and needs her and three other ladies to become heroes for him because he's off doing who-knows-what in who-knows-where. Along the way, the Narrator keeps messing with the party, doing things like bringing a bridge to life as the boss that replaces Star Terror, the second boss of CStW. And, yes, I said "replaces". This is because the story is a rehash of CStW's, and a poor one at that. But hey, this is a parody game. Keep that in mind throughout the whole thing.\n\nCharacters:Now, Cthulhu's Angels adds some new characters to the party. First, Elona/Elonalina from those random hero group replaces Umi as the first party member, and is a rehash of Dacre gameplay-wise. Then, Umi replaces Sharpe as the second party member and is a direct clone of him in terms of gameplay. And by the way, this isn't the Umi you all know and love, this is her silvery-haired evil side brought upon by her trying to wield Sharpe, who is now her weapon, and a cursed sword. Kinda like what happened to the Masamune in Chrono Cross, the "sequel" to Chrono Trigger. The third and final party member, Molly the Were-Zompire, joins where October would've, and is a replica of Paws in terms of gameplay. She's from one of Zeboyd's other works. Now, in terms of other major characters, Cthulhu becomes mission control, the Narrator just messes with the party, Ember doesn't do any fighting and is just there as a means of flight, October is left unchanged, Paws is killed right after he says one sentence, and Dacre... I won't spoil what he does.\n\nMy Opinion:Cthulhu's Angels feels like a poorly-done ROM hack of CStW, with characters being replaced left and right. It follows the exact same path as CStW, and just feels like a boring rehash. However, the ending was one of the most insane twist endings in any video game I've played, so there's some redemption to be had there. But in all seriousness, this extra mode left a somewhat bitter taste in my mouth, with only one dungeon changed, all the bosses altered in some way, and if it isn't already blatant enough that Zeboyd just took CStW and changed it slightly, I dare you to try entering the first bonus dungeon before visiting the first town. See what Umi, who isn't even in your party at the time, has to say. All-in-all, I felt like I was just playing an amatuer's attempt at a ROM hack. But please, don't let my opinion on an extra mode keep you from buying this game. The main game itself is well made, and this mode is just an extra unlocked after you beat CStW. So if you don't think this mode seems interesting, don't play it. You've still got a bunch of other modes to mess with besides this one.","December 1, 2013","true","16.9"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","56","65","0","0"

This game has a humorous spin, having Cthulhu being a “good guy” makes for a fun story. I also must praise the fact that they introduce an RPG mechanic that literally EVERY RPG should have: once you beat X amount of enemies in an area (and it’s always reasonable), you can turn off random encounters for that area. It’s brilliant, and alleviates one of my pet peeves.

To get his powers back, he must become a true hero. So, you must go around and generally be a good guy, and maybe, one day, you'll get your powers back so you can finally destroy this puny world.\n\nAs you can probably tell by now, the game is really silly, but in a good way. It's pretty straightforward, too.\n\nIt's a casual RPG, without crafting, bactracking to visited cities/cleared dungeons, even without grinding (at least on normal and easier difficulties).\n\nBasically you just clear dungeons, go to the next city, buy some gear, listen to other people's problems, and help them, by clearing dungeons. You also have a few optional dungeons, but It's probably wise to play them anyway as they commonly contain some good loot that you can't find anywhere else.\n\nBattle system is alright for the most part, you have a certain number of random battles in most places. When that number reaches zero, enemies stop attacking you so you can finally explore the dungeon in peace. (You can also use the "Fight" option from the menu if you'd like to level up some more).\n\nAs for the fighting,you have some status effects that you can cast on your enemies (silence,blind,poison,even insanity that makes them more vulnerable to damage and also changes their sprite. Neat!) You regenerate all your health at the end of the battle, so no need to bring hundreds of potions/hamburgers/stimpacks on your journey. What you don't regenerate at the end of the battle, is your mana points, so don't waste them all on some magikarps that attacked you, because you can immediately get bonked by a pack of gyaradoses not long after, you know what I'm sayin'?  (you regenerate MP in towns and in special places in dungeons, so don't worry)\n\nStill not convinced that you should buy this game? Well, how about I tell you, that you can play as a walking giant sword? Or as a demon dragon? OR as a green cat-like alien? If that didn't convince you,then I don't know what will.\n\nSeriously though, buy this game. It's cheap, it's commonly on sale with an other similiar RPG in pack, and it has trading cards, so you can make a badge out of them, and possibly get an emoticon of a happy Cthulhu. How cool is that?\n\n\n\nPh'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn...","August 14, 2015","true","9.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","6","6","3","1"

This one in particular has some elements that all RPGs should have. One of the biggies is random encounters. There is nothing more frustrating than trying to explore an area to its fullest and having to fight with monsters every few steps to do so. THIS game has a limited amount of random encounters. Hit that limit and there are no more tedious battles in that area. And if you're like me and love to level level level, there's a fight option in your menu so you can battle with enemies as many extra times as you want. I read some other reviews and some people were complaining about the fight option in your menu. Really??? It's a GREAT option and if you don't want to use it, then don't. Another nice feature is that after every battle, your health points are restored. Only a few magic points are restored so you have to strategize when using skills/spells but MAN it's nice not have to worry about healing after every battle. This game is also cleverly written. I have laughed (loud) more times than I can count. It pokes fun at common RPG elements and the characters in the game are great and hilarious. One word of advice, play on easy or prepare to spend a lot of time leveling. All in all though, this game is super fun and since you can save pretty much whenever you want, I can play it here and there when my schedule allows.

You have your party and you explore dungeons, towns, and the overworld. As with most JRPG’s you can find a wide variety of armour and weapons, each with their own special abilities. The only feature that separates this game from any other JRPG is its combat. It is turn based, with the unique twist; after each turn the monsters slowly get more powerful. Ultimately all this normally does is forces you to use the spells that cause the most damage, and subsequently use up the most of your magic points. After the battle is over your characters will regain full health and a portion of their magic points back. This at first is pretty fun, however after a few hours you will only be playing this game for its storyline, as it is pretty repetitive. Also, each area has a predefined amount of monsters you can fight, which for me really encouraged exploration as I wouldn’t have to fight endless enemies. I would definitely recommend turning on the developer commentary as it is always optional to read, and is usually funny/insightful to read. 6.5/10\n\nSound- Really not much to say here, some catchy little tunes and mostly generic sounds. 5.5/10\n\nGraphics- They are stylized to look retro and I believe it works out pretty well for the most part. The overworld and towns always look pretty good, and handcrafted. The dungeons on the other hand look all pretty similar and boring. The monster sprites however are beautiful. There are many, many monsters in this game and they all are unique and awesome! 7/10\n\nStoryline- This is what makes this game rise above other similar games. This is an epic tale describing Cthulhu's struggle to regain his powers, and to do so he must become a hero. This is a very original idea, and was wonderfully delivered. Cthulhu is a great anti hero. All the side characters are well thought out and enjoyable. This game is funny, and is able to remain so for the entire game. This is by far the greatest aspect of the game. But I do feel as if the combat and exploration sometimes was not broken up enough by story bits. Honestly I would have preferred a shorter game that focused much more on the story than anything else. 9/10\n\nSummary- What a wonderful little gem, and an addicting one at that. Despite the generic gameplay, the storyline rises this above most of its competition. The graphics achieve what they set out to do, as does the sound.\n\nPros\n+Story\n+Art Style\n+The Developer Commentary\n\nNeutral\n-Sound\n-Majority of the Gameplay and Combat\n\nFinal Score- 8/10\nRecommended Purchase Price-  Full Price (At the time of this review only $3.00!)","October 18, 2014","true","7.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

And now after having finished it, I would say "No".\nIn general this is a little RPG, resembling the old SNES-RPGs or games from the RPG-Maker, in terms of gameplay and graphics. You wander around, engage in some random fights (which become pretty repetetive), go through dungeons and level up. The Main Character is Cthulhu who wants to have his power back and the only way to achieve this is to become a hero (instead of destroying everything, which would be what he is used to normally). Well this sounds funny and some of the dialogues you will encounter are funny too, but I never really laughed about them and at some points the jokes seemed a bit forced. Well the humuour mostly is nice, some clichees of games are ridiculed and your companions will sometimes drop some nice one-liners too. And "nice" pretty much sums up this game: it's just nice, overall mediocre. Besides the original starting point of the story the game isn't special in any way.\n\nMaybe if you happen to be one of the rare cases of people who really do not have one single game left to play, you may pick this one up and play it. I started it and as a result finished the game. I didn't have a bad time playing it, but the 7 hours could have been spent much more wisely.","June 7, 2014","false","7.3"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","28","48","0","0"

Having wanted this for a very long time, this game is a surprisingly pleasant pi ss take on the both the Cthulhu Mythos and the RPG genre in general.\n\nIn Cthulhu Saves the World, you play as none other than the Elder God of Madness himself, Cthulhu. Having all of his powers taken away by a powerful wizard, Cthulhu sets out on a journey to become a true hero and save the land in an effort to regain his powers, so he may use them to destroy the world.\n\nThe game plays very similarly to that of Final Fantasy, Pokémon or Shin Megami Tensei, so people who are familar with those games, or turn-based RPGs in general will feel right at home playing this.

It tries to be fun, tries too hard sometimes.\n\nIf you can bear with the spoiler amount in the title itself, I can summarize the topic as an evil thing loses its powers and tries to regain them by trying to be a nice guy once in a while. A santa with alzheimer, A mermaid with legs, A kitty who is actually an alien, and a hovering sword comes to his help. I did not finish the game yet, I am about to, but I dont think the other characters will be exceptions in terms of weirdness of the cast. Not really well thought or something, and mostly just interesting for the sake of being interesting. The story revolves around our hero, there are some 4th wall breaking moments etc. But actually let alone a few interesting lines in the graveyard, writing gets dull too easily.\n\nDo we need such a title? Parody is basically a thing which is pointed towards too overrated things. At least that is what I am used to. Lovecraft is one of the milestones for western horror genre, if not one of the founding fathers. Nobody reads him too much, nobody mentions him too much, and in gaming, in movies, in books etc, actually if there is a thing, it is underrepresentation. So what is the point of taking a demigod from his book, and ridiculing him? I am not sure.\n\nI am playing this with developer commentary. He seems like a fun guy. I enjoyed my time with him. And I actually think that this notes could be included in Narrator versus Cthulhu dialogue lines. A missed opportunity.\n\nMusic is mediocre. Good for a while, gets repetitive too fast. Does not get annoying. Nothing to shame upon, nothing to praise.\n\nOkay, so what about gameplay. I am not that familiar with this kind of RPG titles, so my comments would be coming from a rookie in this genre. But I seriously dont think that having an algorithm as simple as the following for winning is a good sign:\n\n-Press enter repetitively until all of your enemies die or one of your guys get about to die.\n-Heal, if there are more than half remaining, nuke two or three times.\n-Repeat.\n\nRPG side is  a bit lacking. With each level, you choose an ability out of two for each character. The maximum level is 30. So There are 2^30 "setups" for each character. This is not as good as it sounds, since most of the upgrades are just basic stat upgrades. Mechanics of the game is not well explained, I still did not understand what is making them insane is doing. I dont know whether water attacks work more against fire-like enemies. I am not sure what each Stat is doing, but I am only guessing. And enemy explanations are nothing more than "witty-oneliners", so there are a lot of missing things here.\n\nOther than that, getting interrupted by random encounters is just too disorienting for my tastes. I played Pokemon before, so I know that this is WAD, but I think experiencing this to the point of forgetting where was I in levels with labirynthine designs  with no minimap, remembering it in some 10 seconds, then getting disrupted again... Till getting angry, is no good design.\n\nThere are potions. They resurrect or fully heal your party members. Especially for the Ape Princess, use of it is definitely needed. There are enough weapon finds out in the wild, so I did not spend almost any money.  Imbalance? I think so.There is a 1UP mechanics which helps u to ressurrect at the same point....But I did not use it as well. Since it basically works like an autosave feature, but a limited one, so instead of using it, I just kept saving and reloading (savescumming) almost infinitely. Since most of the fights were pressing enter repeatedly, not saving does not help the feeling of thrill, only frustration. So 1up was a mechanism which is meaningless. Items were kinda ok, and they allowed flexibility in pressing enter countlessly strategies.\n\nMost of the boss fights were just holding on type wars. Nothing is different except they got 20000 HP this time. Have 1 or 2 healer, nuke until done. A dumb but sadly a valid strategy for almost all of them.\n\nIf I were not obsessed about finishing the games I started, I would ve abandoned this borefest waaaay too earlier than this. I pushed myself to enjoy it, I am at about 8/10 of the game now, and I guess I will finish it in 1-2 days time. But I wanted to warn all fellow gamers that, times have changed, and being retro is not a virtue of its own. So I am writing this review after I became sure that this will continue like this.\n\nWriting may be interesting for some, but if I want to read a good story, and only that, I should not be using Steam for that.","May 2, 2015","false","11.9"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","5"

Do you like stories that poke fun at the trappings and cliches of their genre while reverently following those cliches, for good or ill? Did you think Shrek was a fun ride but could have name-checked 1930s horror literature more often?\n\nIf so, Cthulhu Saves the World has plenty to offer. Otherwise, you probably don't have to keep reading, since the game lives and dies on its gags.\n\nIf you're looking for more cerebral references to Lovecraft's work, you won't find much to work with here: the inspiration is pretty surface-level, beginning with town names and ending with boss battles with (twee parodies of) shoggoths. It all adds up, essentially, to one long schtick contrasting the Final Fantasy atmosphere and plot with the Lovecraftian setting elements, seasoned with JRPG lampshading.\n\nWhile the jokes are shallow and unambitious, there certainly are a lot of them -- this is a game where every bookshelf has an amusing book to examine and every NPC has a snippet or two of tone-appropriate dialogue.\n\nThe actual gameplay is standard turn-based material, with the extra wrinkles of an "insanity" status effect that invites good or ill depending on who it affects and a gimmicky but engaging combo mechanic, which, combined, provide a little thought to the usual "buff-debuff-sword-fireball" litany and carries you from one comedic scene to another.\n\nIf you've read this far, you can probably already tell that Cthulhu Saves The World has something to offer, and at this price point, that means I can recommend giving it a shot.","June 11, 2015","true","11.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It's a steal at such a low price!\n\nI didn't expect much from what seemed like a budgetware rpg title, no matter how infamous the titular name was. But believe it or not, there's some real meat and potatoes to this rpg. Essentially, Cthulu is trying to be a hero to undo a spell cast upon him. Due to the curse's weakening effect that is preventing him from destroying the world, he must redeem himself as a hero to get the chance to be his old self again. He soon meets up with other allies, such as a groupie of all things concerning the ocean, a talking sword, and so on.\n\nThe story is surprisingly funny and well written. There's not an over extending amount of dialogue, but enough to get the point across and there's some very amusing chatter by Cthulu (who plays a pompous windbag of an elder god if there ever was one) interacting with his party. The towns are all named after Lovecraft locations and there's numerous references throughout the game that will appeal to fans of his work.\n\nCombat is decently tough. Each round, the enemy does more and more damage, while you can build combos and similarly thrash them. Either way, you must win fights quickly. Cthulu and his party recover after battles quickly, but they can't take a lot of punishment during. Fortunately, you have a fairly wide array of chosen abilities, including the ability to make your enemy insane, so he fights poorly against you. I enjoyed the strategy needed to win some random encounters, although you can certainly just blow through some of them. It can get grindy at times, but it won't be the sort of thing that requires you to spend hours simply leveling up.\n\nThere's higher priced RPGs out there on Steam that might look fancier and come from bigger names, but they've got nothing on Cthulu!","April 7","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its reasonably short about 13 hours to complete, although I think I didn't complete all the side dungeons so that might lengthen the game a bit.  There are also harder difficulties as well as different game modes. One mode which I just started has a similar storyline but with a different person as the main character. Therefore the game does have some replayability. This game plays like a classical Jrpg game but it also makes fun of a lot of cliche moments and game structure issues that you may know of if you have played a few jrpg. The storyline is basically a comedy having Cthulhu save the world so he can just destroy it later, but with the combination of comedy as well as the characters the game does seem to motivate me to keep playing at least for the first play through. Also you only had a certain amount of random battles per dungeon which was a nice touch.\n\nWith this said, the game does have its faults. I played the game in normal mode but before this I played in hard mode. This mode was very difficult even at the start of the game, and not difficult in a good way. The random battles were incredibly tough and I found myself losing a lot. I felt like I could have played it on hard mode even with the difficulty level but the grind just seemed that much more tedious even with the random battle restrictions. Every battle just felt like it took so long and you were continously saving because of the chance that you might lose the next fight. When I started playing in normal mode the game got a lot easier but even still, especially about half if not more into the game the random battles got pretty difficult which I didn't like. I was hoping for difficult bosses which I did get at the start of the game but I actually found as the game went on the bosses got easier. Maybe I was over levelled I am not sure but the last boss seemed like a breeze even though I was have troubles with random battles before getting to the last boss, so that was annoying. You did get 1 up items which basically allowed you to restart a battle which was nice but still didn't help the difficulty that much. Overall I think the difficulty should have been more directed towards the bosses and not so much the random battles.\n\nOverall, the game was good short comedy rpg that I found myself laughing out loud a few times. Besides the difficulty issues I didnt find much else that was wrong with the game. Some advice, if you want to get some extra laughs turn on the commentary option at the start of the game.\n\n\n","August 9, 2014","true","13.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Is that bad? Absolutely not. This game will you provide with so much fun and hours of gameplay, that it is well your money.\n\nThe main thing that makes this game infamous is the amount of randomness. This game has hilarious dialogue, from breaking the fourth wall to references to just random insanity. At first it seems a bit akward, having Cthulhu talk to the narrator. But trust me, that is only the beginning.\n\nThe story also makes zero sence, but for a game like this it doesn't matter. Cthulhu basically loses all of his powers, and to get them back he needs to be a good guy and save the world. Strange considering Cthulhu his goal was to destroy the world and now he's doing the complete opposite.\n\nCharacters will join you, most of the times for no apparent but hilarious reason. Those characters reign from a skeleton to a flying sword to a girl who, for some reason or another, fell in love with cthulhu. Makes sence? No, but this game doesn't need sence to be awesome.\n\nAnd now you might think, is this game only randomness and does it fail on other mechanics? Actually, no. The gameplay will remind you of the classic RPG's which is, in my opinion, still a very great mechanic up to this date. And Cthulhu Saves the World does not dissapoint with this mechanic. The music isn't bad either. To be honest, the normal battle theme sounds suprisingly good.\n\nI would advice this game to anyone, even if they are not a rpg lover. This game has 4 different difficulties and several unique modes. 1 gameplay of the game already gives you several gameplay time, reigning from around 6 to 10 hours, so just imagine how much time you will spend with all the modes included within this game. And you know the very best part of this game? Look at the price.\n\nHow do you even? All this content for only that price?

Overall, it's well worth the money for any fan of the Lovecraft genre looking for a funny new take.","February 26, 2015","true","4.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is a standard JRPG built around humor, Cthulhu, monsters, satire, irony, whatever you want to call it, it can only go so far, but if you're making players walk through lengthy mazes that aren't challenging, but time consuming, then the game time isn't worth the cutscenes. I think if this were a little funnier I would be ok with watching a video of all the non battle parts of the game. The bosses aren't even fun.

It's hard to enjoy repeating battles over and over when that is all the game consists of. Perhaps if there were puzzles in the temples going on, it would break up and overlap with the turn based battles and make everything more fun, but you can make it through the whole game blindfolded, seriously just keep mashing A and keep walking in directions until you make it to the boss.\n\nThe game has some length, but if you don't care how it was made, don't turn the commentary on, it gets kind of annoying honestly.\n\nOverall score: 4.0/10 (Not that it's not worth my $1, more that it's not worth my 4 hours... :/ )","July 2, 2014","false","6.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If you haven't already, you should look at my (or any) review on Breath of Death VII by the same developers prior to this game. Cthulhu Saves the World does a lot to expand on that. For those of you who don't want to bother looking at that first... well get ready for this review then.\n\nCthulhu Saves the World has all your basic RPG stuff in it, leveling up, equipment management, going from town to town, talking to people, random encounters, spells, a four person party... all that good stuff. And the story, basically, is that Cthulhu has had his powers taken from him. In order to restore them, he must become a hero. Of course, being an evil creature such he, this makes for some goofy situations and banter between characters, the narrator, and Cthulhu himself along the way. So what makes this game stand out exactly?\n\nWell, if that premise of playing as a reluctant hero isn't enough, consider some of these things. The combat consists of a basic attack, technical attacks, and spells. Technical attacks and spells take MP. Using most moves will result in your combo going up, based on the number of hits. There are some moves that are very powerful or very useful, but may break this combo when used. There are also a few moves that are combo finishers. This means that the higher the combo, the more damage these moves will do. This is very useful to take advantage of on bosses. There's also a status effect in this game called insanity. Generally, moves that cause insanity will be quite powerful, and enemies that are insane may increase your stats a bit based on your passive skills. However, insane enemies tend to do more damage as well, so it can be a risky trade off. Another neat thing is that, upon leveling up, you can choose to select one of two available upgrades. They might be increased stats, new moves, enhanced old moves, passives, or any combination of the choices. This gives some good replayability and customization options. To really appreciate this game, you have to look at where it shines... convenience.\n\nThis game is clearly designed by people who know how annoying RPGs can be, and they have taken measures to try and lessen the natural burdens of the genre. One way is simply allowing you to move around faster at the push of a button. There's also the ability to teleport to any city you've been to at any time, which is really nice for fast travel. The fights can move along quickly, which is nice for grinding. Animations for attacks are short, enemies are still images, and the display gives you fast information. After a battle, you will have some MP restored, full HP restored, and all party memebers revived... provided that you won. This makes it very easy to keep moving forward. No need to hoard healing items, use up MP on healing outside of battles, or travel back to healing areas. But by far the best addition is how this game handles random encounters. You see, every area has its own set number of random encounters. This means you'll find battles randomly that many times in the area. Once you've fought that many battles, the number reaches zero and you will no longer encounter enemies there randomly. This allows you to focus on your exploring, which is super nice in the mazier places. However, if you wish to grind in an area even after all the random encounters are up, you can! Simply go to the menu and select the option called fight. Then you will get to find a battle immediately without walking around randomly. It's the best of both worlds and I really love this feature.\n\nThe art style is cool, basically a 16 bit type of representation, more or less. Colorful areas and monsters, plus I really like the neat attention to detail with the in-battle backgrounds that change depending on the area and terrain. A nice touch that made me get a little more into it. I can't speak for the music since I had the sound off while grinding and watching stuff... so sorry but... grinding. Some of the dialogue can be pretty funny at times. Sometimes not so much, but it depends. There's even a cool mode you can turn on to get little notes from the developer in the game about its development. It's neat! Also, I'd like to bring up that there are some fun bonus modes to try out here too. I personally really liked the Cthulhu's Angels bonus mode, which is almost a totally new campaign aside from many of the areas and enmies reused. New story and dialogue, not to mention new characters, made it well worth going through.\n\nHowever, there are some bad things about the game. The extra modes are among them. The higher difficulties are just more frustrating, as is highlader mode which only lets you use one person at a time to fight. These seem more like filler modes than actually being more conent, and for a game that's designed for the ease of use, making harder modes seems a bit counterproductive. But it's for more harcore players I guess. The other issue with the game is that, while it does try to fix the natural burdens of classic RPG design, it simply treats the symptoms rather than curing the problem. Basically, while it does make those aspects more enjoyable, it still has them.\n\nIn the end, Cthulhu Saves the world is a really fun RPG for those who like simpler RPGs and want a smooth experience with a classic feel. I can only seem to find it in a package with Breath of Death VII for 3 bucks, and even for just this game, it's worth it. If you want to know more about Breath of Death VII, check out my review of that (or other people's reviews) and see for yourself. It's basically the same as this, but smaller and a little less polished. I'd say that if you get the pack, play that first to really appreciate the changes in this one. It's a pretty good deal for what you get. Cthulhu Saves the World gets an 8/10 for being a solid classically styled RPG with some great innovations to make the old formula much more enjoyable.","January 21, 2015","true","18.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Perhaps the Last jRPG I’ll Ever ReviewGenre: 2D jRPG\nDeveloped & Published by: Zeboyd Games\nPlatform: Windows only.\nBusiness Model: Duo Pack Purchase\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Gameplay Thoughts\nCthulhu Saves the World is a game about Cthulhu, the great dark lord of the sith, a being so terrible that just being around him makes everyone go insane. So, how does one stop such unstoppable madness? Have a stranger zap his power away. Then make him become a true hero and his powers will return to him. Yeah, the plot is rather...unexplained. But that’s not important because we have madder things to deal with! Like groupies, heroes, undead monsters and Cthulhu saving the world. It’s a pretty fun and funny time, with plenty of references to go around. This is a 2D jRPG with a minimal upgrade system for armor, weapons and skills.\n\nCombat System\nCthulhu builds upon the combat system designed in Breath of Death VII. Refining the lightning-quick turn-based combat to a new level. Now, there’s a new system called Insanity. When enemies become insane via certain abilities you can use, they take and give out double the normal damage. It’s a tricky trade-off to make sure you don’t accidentally power up an enemy before you can strike a killing blow. There’s also retries to start a battle over if you messed up too badly and some tweaks to status effects to make them more useful.\n\nThere’s also a fairly basic upgrade system. Everytime you level up, you get a choice of abilities to select and hopefully improve your combat performance. (Though I get the feeling that the wrong choices could really hurt you without you knowing it). Weapons and armor can also be upgraded from the shop and loot found in the world. There’s usually only a couple of choices per weapon and armor “level” so it comes down to what stat you prefer the most.\n\nBoredom\nI found that after 10 hours, the combat system was becoming too dull to work through. Half the battles were a cakewalk and the other half the difficulty would seem to suddenly spike and I would die repeatedly. It didn’t help that there was a constant rinse-and-repeat of entering battle, select the same combo of attacks and win/lose. Which has made me realize that perhaps jRPGs as a genre aren’t for me anymore. I used to enjoy them a lot when I was younger. Now? I find the repetition tedious. It’s a case where minimal visuals may have worked against the game, because there’s no interesting eye candy to watch. It’s a trade-off.\n\nPC Settings\nCthulhu is very well optimized and won’t strain your system at all. Crashing and bugs should be rare as well. The devs clearly knew how to make a polished jRPG. That being said, the game only supports 1280x720 and 640x360 in addition to fullscreen mode. Frame rate is also capped at 60FPS. There aren’t any other visual settings to be found here. There’s also no mouse support but that’s largely unimportant. Remapping of keys is here as well as support for controllers. Separate volume controls exist as well. Largely bare-boned and mostly I just miss resolution options. Outside of that, it’s just fine.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI want to like Cthulhu Saves the World. I really do. But I think CSTW has indicated that the jRPG genre might not be for me anymore. The premise of Cthulhu stripped of his powers until he becomes a great hero is very amusing. But the game’s dry combat system is simply too boring for me to enjoy it. Especially when I take the experience grind into account. That all said, if jRPGs are your kind of genre, Cthulhu Saves the World is well worth checking out. Especially since it’s a combo pack with the other well done jRPG, Breath of Death VII: The Beginning.\n\nA Paladin’s Steam Review: Breath of Death VII: The Beginning\nRead the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","May 29, 2015","true","11.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/107310/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Celebrating its very-well received outing on Xbox Live Indie Games, Zeboyd Games has given PC gamers the chance to enjoy its lighthearted RPG, Cthulhu Saves the World, with a number of gameplay tweaks and some new features.The Cthulhu Saves the World is a very enjoyable romp with an appeal that spreads across the RPG spectrum thanks to its retro graphics, finely tuned battle system, and well-written humour. One of a number of games that hark back to the retro days of gaming, Cthulhu Saves the World is very easy to pick up and play. Players take control of the mighty Cthulhu himself, but unfortunately a wizard has sealed his powers and the player must help Cthulhu get them back. Doing so requires Cthulhu to become a true hero, and thus he embarks upon a very tongue-in-cheek quest that ultimately leads to him saving the world, picking up a number of entertaining allies as he goes. The controls are simple and work equally well using either the keyboard or a gamepad. Players will find their time split between the first-person, Dragon Quest-esque battle screen, and the standard top-down view when exploring dungeons, towns, and the world map.   The battle system is a fairly simple turn-based affair at first glance but contains a surprising amount of depth. Enemies gain strength with each passing turn, meaning that players will need to consider the most efficient ways of winning battles. Simply grinding out basic attacks is rarely an effective tactic, and players will be required to use the full array of abilities that Zeboyd Games has provided. In addition to the various damage-dealing attacks, players can inflict various statuses, attempt to draw enemy strikes onto specific characters, or link up with special Unite moves. The party, which consists of up to four characters, is fully healed after each battle and returned a small amount of MP, allowing the leeway for these random battles to employ tactics rather than being simple distractions. If the party should get wiped, players do have to option to retry a battle, provided at least one of the 1-ups that perform the same function they do in platforming games is in the party's possession. Being able to retry battles, along with saving anywhere, combine with frequent MP restoration points to give players feel little frustration at an unlucky wipeout or a simple misjudgement. Dungeons themselves are generally good fun to explore, although they do have some flaws. Most have a large number of paths, so those who enjoy investigating will find plenty. The flip side of this, however, is that dungeons often just feel too long and winding, not helped by the lack of indicators that progress is being made until one is almost staring it in the face. There's not too much in the way of puzzles outside of route-finding, but this is a point in Cthulhu's favour as any extra tasks would easily become bothersome in the current dungeon designs.Random battles take place in both dungeons and on the world map, occurring at a steady enough rate to keep things mixed up without becoming an annoyance. Each dungeon has a limit to the number of random battles that are faced, allowing those who want to find all the loot to do so in peace.  The underlying story itself isn't anything particularly noteworthy. Plot points are often skipped over and the game really could have used more content in the story, plus more fleshing-out of the world. It is pretty clear, however, that the story is not intended as one to be taken especially seriously, with the fourth wall easily dismantled within the first thirty seconds. This is all to Cthulhu Saves the World's benefit, as where the game shines through is in its humour and tongue-in-cheek references. The well-written humour fits nicely into the dialogue and descriptions to ensure the game remains light-hearted and entertaining.After completing the game players can play it again at one of the other levels of difficulty or try out one of the bonus modes, each of which adds something extra to the core game. Players' choices include a score attack mode that rewards players for defeating bosses while underleveled, a go-it-alone mode, and finally the Super Edition also includes the Cthulhu's Angels mode, which sees Cthulhu delegating the world-saving to an all-female party with new dialogue, characters, and abilities.  Naturally, the visual quality is limited by the sixteen-bit format, but Zeboyd Games has done a very good job of making the artwork attractive. Dungeons are all unique and interestingly designed. The various characters and enemies share in the variety and have clearly received a lot of love, taking differing degrees of inspiration from other sources, but all giving their own little twists to breathe a bit more life into the world of Cthulhu. On the music front, a very good job has been done that complements the retro graphics, adding further to the charm introduced early on. The tracks all do a great job of livening up the dungeons, world map and battles, and never become grating even when repeated. While limited in number, the sound effects also do a nice job, notably those in the battle system that augment the satisfaction of a highly damaging attack. Even before considering the ridiculously low price point, Cthulhu Saves the World is a very enjoyable game. While there is obviously some room for improvement, the humourous retro appeal negates any impact the flaws might have made quite well.","February 19, 2014","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you're not, read on...\n\nCSTW is a light-hearted homage to both the classic JRPG's of yesteryear as well as H.P. Lovecrafts work. In this game, you play as Cthulu, cosmic horror supreme, who undergoes a bit of a dilemma: rather than destroying the world, Cthulu is tasked with saving it (hence the name.) Along the way, Cthulu encounters many different characters and locales, many of which are pulled straight from Lovecraft's stories. Some help and join you, while most just want to fight.\n\nAs for the core gameplay, it's traditional turn-based RPG fare. You choose your options, watch everything unfold, and go for it again. There are plenty of characters to mix and match for your active party, all of which obtain their own unique skills and abilites. The level-up system from BoDVII is back, giving players a choice in how they want to build their characters upon gaining a level. Simple, but it adds a nice sense of strategy. The good ol' "stand next to a save point and grind out all of the battles in an area until they're gone" strategy is still the best way to break the game, so that's nice.\n\nOverall, the game is fun and quirky. It's not very deep, and especially with the Diablo III's and Skyrim's and WoW's out today, CSTW might seem a little too simple. But RPG's started somewhere and this game does a fine job at looking back lovingly.\n\nIf you're a fan of either classic RPG's or Lovecraft, this is a solid buy.","January 31","true","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It sort of reminded me of Pokeman in a way that you would get random battles when trying to get to the next place. That was somthing that made me not like Pokeman so much. How ever ever dungon has a set amount of these random battles witch prevents farming to the next boss and helps so your not OP for the boss or not to low. This also helps becuase if you have not found the exit to the dungon by the time the battles are done you need a break. Over all its a nice game to play though dont buy it if you want a world where you can spend 100s of hours in. If you want 7-12 hours of fun this is the game for you.

It sort of reminded me of Pokeman in a way that you would get random battles when trying to get to the next place. That was somthing that made me not like Pokeman so much. How ever ever dungon has a set amount of these random battles witch prevents farming to the next boss and helps so your not OP for the boss or not to low. This also helps becuase if you have not found the exit to the dungon by the time the battles are done you need a break. Over all its a nice game to play though dont buy it if you want a world where you can spend 100s of hours in. If you want 7-12 hours of fun this is the game for you. The the battles can get a little stale sometimes after about 25 of them (in one dungon) but other than that this game is very good.","August 27, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The actual 'Lovecraftian' references are pretty thin, and the gameplay falls prey to the same mechanics it tries to make fun of, though thankfully only near the end of the game; namely massive HP creatures that require a damage/combo race to beat. While it makes a stab for being replayable with different game modes, I can't say it really stands as a replayable game. Still, for its price, it makes a great gift and at least improves on the style of game it attempts to emulate save for the aforementioned.","July 12, 2012","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like, now.\n\nPros;\n+ Soundtrack is fantastic\n+ Story is good, considering it's a game poking fun at JRPGs\n+ "Narrator"/character interaction plays well\n+ Fantastic dialogue (I laughed really hard at many points)\n+ Excellent art for the style, vibrant and varied\n+ Good level design for a 2D JRPG mockery\n+ Streamlined interface/mechanics (i.e. levelling up gives you a choice of two bonuses, usually a trade off between a weak group/ stronger single target spell or upping some stats in place of others)\n+ Multiple character art portraits for different moods in dialogue\n+ You're a cutesy 8-bit Cthulhu\n+ You can search stuff like bookshelves/drawers in that typical JRPG style, often with funny results\n+ Enemy variety is pretty high\n+ Lovecraft references EVERYWHERE. The Dunwich Horror, The Rats in the Walls, Miskatonia/Miskatonic University, Nyarlathotep, The Cats of Ulthar.... you get my drift. They're organic and clever references to boot!\n+ Battle counter shows how many battles are left in an area. At 0, you won't be attacked any more in that area, which is good for exploring, but you can still choose to fight via the menu\n+ Contoller support\n+ Multiple difficulties\n+ Varied spells and attacks\n+ Combo building and combo finisher mechanics add another layer of combat depth\n+ Insanity mechanic makes for interesting battles. Enemy art also changes when insane, which is cool.\n+ Plenty of Fhtagn\n+ Some side quests/optional areas with optional bosses\n+ Nods to JRPG tropes (*cough* RESCUEMANBOY *cough*)\n+ Multiple weapons/armor, at an easy to manage 1 weapon/1 armour per character\n\nCons;\n- It'll end at some point.\n- Maybe not for those looking for a hardcore experience.\n\nSo there you have it. Buy it now and become the true hero you've always wanted to be: The Lord of Insanity.\n\nCthulhu/10 would (and will) Fhtagn again.","January 24, 2015","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The additional Bonus modes give it some replay value.   The game offers great flexibility in building your party.   If you play it without grinding (clicking FIGHT button to max out experience), and play on Hard/Insane you will find many of the fights challenging because your level will be well matched to your current location within the game and this will make you use a variety of party combinations for certain situations as well as combination of skills.  If you choose to grind you'll find yourself ahead of the game and it loses some flair.\n\nAt the island in the middle of Ocean, with the final battle with the four chars I was about level 60 and used Cthulhu, Sharpe, Dacre, Umi as I found the latter two's damage prevention skills served the situation best, but that party combo was not the main one. I played (Cthulhu, Sharpe, Paws with Shotgun focused on Strength, Umi) was probably the most common).\n\nOverall very good game because of how well balanced it is, and the manner that it makes you play around with party construction to win battles .\n","February 14, 2015","true","24.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very much a loving tribute to both Lovecraft's fiction and the classic RPGs it follows so closely, and the game itself is really rather great. Combat is turn and menu-based and unlike some games in a similar vein once you get the hang of it the combat is capable of being very fast-paced, a big bonus given that no one wants to spend an entire game just being bogged down by unreasonable or agonizingly slow random encounters. This is furthered by the combo system in combat which makes for an interesting mechanic, and generally made more engaging due to the branching levelling system for Cthulhu and his party members with which the player can to some level customise the character's builds shaping their role in combat. Some of the dungeons can be a little confusing to navigate (the alien spaceship in particular is rather horrendous), but it is an RPG after all. Of course the main appeal of Cthulhu Saves the World over other RPGs is the story and the sense of humour, and pleasingly it's a riot. The sense of humour is very self-aware and totally unafraid to ridicule itself, the source material and the genre it lies in, with narrative quirks and violations of the fourth wall all over the place. This is also apparent in the developer's commentary which can be enabled, in which the devs are refreshingly frank, honest and frequently as funny as the story's  dialogue, making it well worth turning on. The Cthulhu's Angels bonus campaign meanwhile re-uses the vast majority of the main game elements essentially treading the same path, but the differing narrative and cast of characters remarkably manages to make it seem like a fresh experience all the same. Essentially this title is an engaging little classic-style RPG wrapped in an aesthetic and sense of humour that makes it all its own, and is more than worth the miniscule price tag for both this and Breath of Death VII in a double pack.","July 22, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

This alone not only makes the game worth it but worth beyond the value it sells for. This game is complete perfection and I highly recommend to any classic rpg gamer.","December 23, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The reason why I think it's one of Steam's better RPG's are because it's not just kill this thing, talk to that npc, leave the town. It has story, sometimes harder to find then what most RPG's give and I like it for it. Most of the bosses tie to Cthulhu in some way, may that be rivals, enemies or the most random things that're possible. Another good thing about this game would be the comedy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphyBear/recommended/107310/","RaphyBear","♥BonBonBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphyBear/","122 products in account","To start off, just wanted to point out that this is my first review so apologies if it won't be as in-depth as probably other reviews but I'll try my best. c:\n\nTo take in consideration:This game was bought by me when this game was in a bundle with Breath of Death VII. The people who created a game decided to make a sale which was the lowest sale they have ever done on their games. That being said, I did purchase this game for €0.24 ($0.26 & £0.17) and I will make reference to it in the review.\n\nStoryline condensed by me:You play as Cthulhu, a fictional deity created by H.P. Lovecraft in his story appropriately named: "Call of Cthulhu." In this game, Zeboyd Games (the creators) took a different approach for this character and with Cthulhu being basically the lord of insanity instead made it so that his powers have been relenquished and for him to obtain them back he must become a true hero which plots you into an epic quest in an open world where you meet characters to help you on your journey, dungeons to explore and towns to visit.\n\nPros:    This game had very hilarious and witty dialogue that did very excellently at what it was marketed for. (a parody RPG)                Various references throughout the game which would give a throwback to those familiar with old-school RPGs will make you chuckle and enjoy the game even more. That being said, you don't have to be an old-school RPG gamer to understand the references but the game will become more enjoyable in a writing standpoint if you are.\n\nThe game had very polished visuals that truly did take you back to old 8-bit to 16-bit 2D RPGs such as Final Fantasy, DragonQuest, Chrono Trigger, etc. For a new game to use this style, it'd truly fit in to the library of the genre no matter past, present or future.\n\nThe soundtrack was excellent and tracks are highly memorable, catchy and is a true tribute to 8-bit to 16-bit RPGs. As well as that, the soundtrack is kindly provided onto Zeboyd Games's website listed here: http://zeboyd.com/2011/01/11/cthulhu-saves-the-world-free-ost-release/\n\nThe gameplay is the traditional turn-based combat and depending on how you take a stance on that, it may be a pro or con for you. The game is even better though in the gameplay as it gets rid of most of the annoyances from other old RPGs that people would have issues with such as back-tracking, grinding, EVEN saving or any other minor annoyances by adding different capabilities such as being able to save any time, not being required to grind as much (although you could) and even having a random-encounter system whereby if you defeat a certain number of enemies in random-encounters, it will eventually stop and therefore you can explore even more.\nCons:    Considering this is an RPG, and an old-school styled one at that, it will most likely not greet players new or those who dislike this genre because it is as what it's written. This game and the gameplay still has the traditional random-encounters, turn-based combat system and is true to that sense and considering the game throws a lot into the mix, a lot of players will be put off had they bad experiences with these games or plain dislike them.\n\nLike other RPGs, especially JRPGs however, the same problem lies in that the game is a bit too linear. Getting to and from places seems too quick although given the game, it's price and it's stance. This is not so bad.\n\nThe difficulty is quite high and impressive. This game is definitely suited to fans who are more oriented towards this game genre and newer places will have a difficulty with playing even perhaps at Easy difficulty. This won't be so bad if you do have prior knowledge with RPGs but it does cause quite a problem when it comes to newbies.\nIn conclusion:This game holds up and will hold up in the forseeing years to come and I only wish that Zeboyd Games would get more publicity with their games because they are quite good especially for those who love turn-based old-school RPGs. Heck, the only reason why I found out about this game was from it being a sale and it definitely needs much more publicity. I'd hate to see it stay an underrated great game. I loved the game and am now cordially introduced into the amazing developers that are Zeboyd Games and are excited to see the other additions they give out and their other titles.\n\nThis game receives a rating of: 8.5/10 for those familiar with the genre, especially the old-school RPGs.\n7/10 for those who want to try a new RPG genre that can be compared to other RPGs and a starter to the genre. If you can get past the repetitive nature of the turn-based RPGs and enjoy the genre as well as the story, dialogue and soundtrack within this game then you will definitely enjoy it.\n\nThank you very much for reading my review, please give me feedback if any and happy gaming.\n\n~Raphy <3 c:","April 26, 2015","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

However this is mixed with more modern design elements to proved an improved, compact, experience. Battles can move very fast with minimal time wasted on attack animation and a very quick and responsive interface. There is also the combo system to add an extra layer of depth to your decisions in combat. Plus each area in the game limits the total number of random encounters, so you won't be stuck in an easy area forever if you have bad luck (There is also includes an option to force encounters in case you feel the need to grind past the limit).\n\nThis parody RPG is filled with humor in its dialogue and enemy/monster description which will keep you entertained between battles. The game will only be around 5-7 hours for a normal play through, so if you want a classic JRPG type experience but don't have the 50-100+ hours to spend on a more traditional game, this is a great alternative. However, if you want to keep playing there are several alternate modes such as the score attack mode to test your skill, or the Highlander and Cthulhu's Angels modes to provide different experiences.\n\nIf you liked Breath of Death VII you'll probably love this, and even if you didn't, you may still enjoy Cthulhu Saves the World due to its improvements in mechanics and visuals.","November 26, 2013","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However this is mixed with more modern design elements to proved an improved, compact, experience. Battles can move very fast with minimal time wasted on attack animation and a very quick and responsive interface. There is also the combo system to add an extra layer of depth to your decisions in combat. Plus each area in the game limits the total number of random encounters, so you won't be stuck in an easy area forever if you have bad luck (There is also includes an option to force encounters in case you feel the need to grind past the limit).\n\nThis parody RPG is filled with humor in its dialogue and enemy/monster description which will keep you entertained between battles. The game will only be around 5-7 hours for a normal play through, so if you want a classic JRPG type experience but don't have the 50-100+ hours to spend on a more traditional game, this is a great alternative. However, if you want to keep playing there are several alternate modes such as the score attack mode to test your skill, or the Highlander and Cthulhu's Angels modes to provide different experiences.\n\nIf you liked Breath of Death VII you'll probably love this, and even if you didn't, you may still enjoy Cthulhu Saves the World due to its improvements in mechanics and visuals.","November 26, 2013","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has story, sometimes harder to find then what most RPG's give and I like it for it. Most of the bosses tie to Cthulhu in some way, may that be rivals, enemies or the most random things that're possible. Another good thing about this game would be the comedy.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphyBear/recommended/107310/","RaphyBear","♥BonBonBear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaphyBear/","122 products in account","To start off, just wanted to point out that this is my first review so apologies if it won't be as in-depth as probably other reviews but I'll try my best. c:\n\nTo take in consideration:This game was bought by me when this game was in a bundle with Breath of Death VII. The people who created a game decided to make a sale which was the lowest sale they have ever done on their games. That being said, I did purchase this game for €0.24 ($0.26 & £0.17) and I will make reference to it in the review.\n\nStoryline condensed by me:You play as Cthulhu, a fictional deity created by H.P. Lovecraft in his story appropriately named: "Call of Cthulhu." In this game, Zeboyd Games (the creators) took a different approach for this character and with Cthulhu being basically the lord of insanity instead made it so that his powers have been relenquished and for him to obtain them back he must become a true hero which plots you into an epic quest in an open world where you meet characters to help you on your journey, dungeons to explore and towns to visit.\n\nPros:    This game had very hilarious and witty dialogue that did very excellently at what it was marketed for. (a parody RPG)                Various references throughout the game which would give a throwback to those familiar with old-school RPGs will make you chuckle and enjoy the game even more. That being said, you don't have to be an old-school RPG gamer to understand the references but the game will become more enjoyable in a writing standpoint if you are.\n\nThe game had very polished visuals that truly did take you back to old 8-bit to 16-bit 2D RPGs such as Final Fantasy, DragonQuest, Chrono Trigger, etc. For a new game to use this style, it'd truly fit in to the library of the genre no matter past, present or future.\n\nThe soundtrack was excellent and tracks are highly memorable, catchy and is a true tribute to 8-bit to 16-bit RPGs. As well as that, the soundtrack is kindly provided onto Zeboyd Games's website listed here: http://zeboyd.com/2011/01/11/cthulhu-saves-the-world-free-ost-release/\n\nThe gameplay is the traditional turn-based combat and depending on how you take a stance on that, it may be a pro or con for you. The game is even better though in the gameplay as it gets rid of most of the annoyances from other old RPGs that people would have issues with such as back-tracking, grinding, EVEN saving or any other minor annoyances by adding different capabilities such as being able to save any time, not being required to grind as much (although you could) and even having a random-encounter system whereby if you defeat a certain number of enemies in random-encounters, it will eventually stop and therefore you can explore even more.\nCons:    Considering this is an RPG, and an old-school styled one at that, it will most likely not greet players new or those who dislike this genre because it is as what it's written. This game and the gameplay still has the traditional random-encounters, turn-based combat system and is true to that sense and considering the game throws a lot into the mix, a lot of players will be put off had they bad experiences with these games or plain dislike them.\n\nLike other RPGs, especially JRPGs however, the same problem lies in that the game is a bit too linear. Getting to and from places seems too quick although given the game, it's price and it's stance. This is not so bad.\n\nThe difficulty is quite high and impressive. This game is definitely suited to fans who are more oriented towards this game genre and newer places will have a difficulty with playing even perhaps at Easy difficulty. This won't be so bad if you do have prior knowledge with RPGs but it does cause quite a problem when it comes to newbies.\nIn conclusion:This game holds up and will hold up in the forseeing years to come and I only wish that Zeboyd Games would get more publicity with their games because they are quite good especially for those who love turn-based old-school RPGs. Heck, the only reason why I found out about this game was from it being a sale and it definitely needs much more publicity. I'd hate to see it stay an underrated great game. I loved the game and am now cordially introduced into the amazing developers that are Zeboyd Games and are excited to see the other additions they give out and their other titles.\n\nThis game receives a rating of: 8.5/10 for those familiar with the genre, especially the old-school RPGs.\n7/10 for those who want to try a new RPG genre that can be compared to other RPGs and a starter to the genre. If you can get past the repetitive nature of the turn-based RPGs and enjoy the genre as well as the story, dialogue and soundtrack within this game then you will definitely enjoy it.\n\nThank you very much for reading my review, please give me feedback if any and happy gaming.\n\n~Raphy <3 c:","April 26, 2015","true","15.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Lovecraft. It's funny. It's weird. It does what it sets out to do very well but it doesn't hold up quite as well when viewed simply as an RPG. Repetitive battles are to be expected but the combat does start to feel very sloppy as you progress through the game and realize that most of your moves will become obsolete. The story also does not do a lot to drive the player forward through the adventure. RPGs are time consuming... So in order to be worth your time investment, all the elements of an RPG (the combat, the characters, the story) need to work together to enrich the experience. Cthulhu Saves the World provides bits and pieces of fun but never really delivers a full and satisfying game. For a memorable retro RPG experience, it's best to look to classic titles such as Chrono Trigger and Super Mario RPG.","March 11, 2015","false","5.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The music is quaint and reminds me of the "good old days" as do the sprites; however, the combat is thought-provoking and well done. It inspires you to win in as few turns as possible by increasing monster difficulty as time wears on and increasing rewards the faster you win. Dialogue is generally funny, cheeky, and satirical.\n\nPros:\n\nAwesome mechanics like teleporting out of dungeons, tactical combat, and anytime fights\nGreat dialogue and characters, found myself laughing regularly\nGreat character progression by choosing how you level up\nComplex dungeons\nOut-of-the-box Controller Support\n\nCons:\n\nIt's an oldschool RPG, so it takes a certain type of player\nSprite graphics\nRepetative (although good) music\n\nFresh and fun oldschool RPG. Don't expect to take it seriously though. This comes in a dual-pack with Breath of Death VII. Although the games share similar mechanics and motifs, something about Breath of Death didn't give me the same charm that Cthulhu did. I'd recommend playing Cthulhu first and if you really liked it to then go through Breath of Death for more of the same; however, if you can only play one of the two, this is it.

Cthulhu Saves the World is a turn based RPG where the legendary Cthulhu gets stripped of most of his power and has to get it back and destroy the world. This sounds like a pretty good concept. The game works slightly like Earthbound and Final Fantasy. The menu oddly reminds me of Earthbound and the way you find enemies remind me of Final Fantasy. The game's graphics are in a 16-bit-like environment. To me, the music sounds good but I feel like it doesn't fit the graphics. Overall, the game is ok, the graphics are great, the gameplay just feels good, the controls feel good, the price tag isn't that bad for such a slightly long RPG, but the music doesn't fit the environment. The final score is: 8 out of 10.","March 30, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Certainly brings back a lot of the fun of 16-bit RPGs, but includes a lot of nice additions that many of those older games did not such as being able to save anywhere at any time, conveniently placed restore points (especially before boss battles), ability to "one-up" if you die and want to try a battle again, free inns, able to warp to any town at pretty much anytime (even from dungeons), limited number of random encounters, and a run button.  I wish all those older games had these features as it pobably would have saved my parents from yelling at me to hurry up as I'm trying to fight my way back to an inn just to save my progress.\n\nCSTW is really geared towards the fun aspect of these older RPGs.  Combat is overall simplistic and I found myself settling in on the same attacks over and over.  This may turn off some players but I didn't mind it too much.  There are some attacks and "team-up" attacks that I did not use at all or maybe once.\n\nSome parts of the game aren't explained very well such as the "insanity" mode that some attacks will cause.  When I used it, the monsters caused more damage, but also took more damage from player attacks.  Apparently this mode can also unlock special attacks from certain monsters.  The monster's picture will also change slightly to show that it is "insane".\n\nThere were a couple of nit-picky items that did not affect gameplay a whole lot but I thought were a little annoying.  First of all, the animations during the battles was very minimal.  The monsters did not move and only flashed when hit.  You can see your character's attacks in the form of a swipe or some kind of spell effect, but that was about it.  Also, some indicators on character status during fights would have been nice to show if they were poisoned, stunned, etc.  The game will tell you in the text box if a character's status is impacted, but its so easy to just click past these messages from habit that its easy to miss.\n\nOverall this is a good game that took up about 20 hours of my time.  There were still some optional dungeons to complete and I may still do those.  If you like old-school RPGs or want to take a break with something more casual, then I would recommend this game to scratch that itch.  Plus you can get it on sale for less coin than what you probably have clinking around in your car's cup-holder.","June 15, 2015","true","22.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The jokes are usually poor, the whole concept of character knowing he is a part of game/movie/novel/etc. has been used for too many times already. Jokes in the names or descriptions of monster remind me of high school times - in this case it's not a 'pro' feature.\nThe characters are plain and one dimensional.\nThe world of the game is absurd, not necessarily in a good way. It's a mix of Cthulhu Mythos and fantasy worlds (with goblins etc.), there is a concept of insanity, but other than that the mechanics of the fight and magic is D&D-like - nothing really specific for the CoC.\nThe gameplay is very simple - you walk, find loot, fight in all too many random encounters (which are tiring, not bringing any fun). The dungeons are boring and involve lots of walking (probably so that there is enough time to fill the game with random encounters), There are some puzzles, but the main puzzle is to find yourself around in these mazes (thank devs for the 'run; mode).\nBattles with bosses require some thinking and are interesting.\nMusic is decent, but too repetitive.\n\nSo why the 'thumb up'? As I've said earlier, I'm a fanatic, so if they made a Tic-tac-toe and named it 'Cthulhu Riddle' I'd probably recommend it.\n\nAlso keep in mind that this game comes in a package with 'Breath of Death VII'. From what I have senn both games are very very similar, so there is really no need to choose the lesser evil.\n\nIa R'lyeh.","December 30, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The levels are designed to make the player get lost, probably to extend the short playtime, if you want to find the right way, take the path that looks the least like it will lead to progress.\n\nOf course, the graphics are also nothing noteworthy, they go for a "retro" pixel style, but this is just an excuse for being lazy with the graphics since they are nowhere near actually good looking detailed pixel art like: http://i.imgur.com/buH9JjF.gif\n\nThe gameplay is one good aspect, you are often in danger of dying and all of your HP get's refreshed after each fight, even if a party member dies, thus making even a victory with only one fighter left standing worth it. The only thing to look out for between fights is the MP count, since it isn't completely replenished. This game also makes buffs and debuffs useful, even in non boss fights. You still have a lot of skills you rarely or never use though. The danger of loosing is sadly undermined by being able to save anywhere, although this might not be the case on harder difficulties.\n\nLike any jrpg though, fighting get's tedious after some time and since there is little else worth looking at in this title, I suggest you avoid it.","May 7, 2015","false","3.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Sure, the idea is funny and maybe the story is interesting. But that's it! The combat is boring, tedious and repetitive.

Pretty much every dungeon is exactly the same, big sprawling maze with random encounters and the occasional chest. The hardest thing about the game is finding the next level of the dungeon, really. Mobs generally aren't too tough and it's easy to be overpowered in this game. The bosses are kind of a joke; even the final boss took practically no effort at all. The story kind of stops caring about a quarter of the way through the game and there's no sense of atmosphere at all. It's not even that f funny, either. There's some jokes but they're far too infrequent for it to really be a comedy game. The last dungeon has a big difficulty spike which is a bit unwarranted but even then, hopping into an optional dungeon and then back into the last dungeon basically destroyed all the challenge I was having. It's just... bland. I don't like RPGs in general and only got this in a bundle, and it was short enough for me to not get bored of it, at least. I wouldn't call it "bad" for what it is, but I certainly can't say it blew me away or anything.","October 6, 2014","false","6.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Cthulhu Saves the World is one of the few on Steam, and it's great. The price is stupidly low (it's like 3$ for two games), and you'll easily get 6 or more hours out of it. The game plays like an old Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy. You traverse an overworld, find towns, dungeons, etc, etc. The game itself is fairly linear, with a couple of side dungeons spread over the world. What makes the game unique in mind is the battle system. While it may look like nothing special, it's actually quite unique. Each turn that goes by the enemies all have their attack increased by 10%, what this means is that you'll quickly be overwhelmed. This means you have to stratgeize how to defeat the monsters in the quickest way possible. You won't be mashing 'attack' throughout the battles in this game. Dungeons can often be really maze like, which is a pain, but it's not a major problem.","February 4, 2012","true","8.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Lovecraft's famous monster, Cthulhu. There's a lot I don't like about RPGs in general, but this one manages to correct a lot of the most frustrating aspects of other RPGs:\n\n-Allies are fully healed after battles, rather than leaving you barely limping along only to be killed in the next random encounter. (Battles are still quite hard though! MP is not fully restored after each battle, so use it wisely.)\n-Only a limited number of random encounters will occur in each area before they are "turned off." You have the option to manually begin a battle with monsters if you still want to fight in a "finished" area.\n-You can save any time, anywhere! (Outside of battles of course.)\n\nGood humor, entertaining characters, and a bizarre plot that manages to make sense despite how odd it is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/songoffall/recommended/107310/","songoffall","Wintermute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/songoffall/","246 products in account","Cthulhu Saves the World is a game that plays and feels like Final Fantasy Mystical Quest. Well, except that it brings its own innovations to the table - the Unite attacks (which are awesome) and the round-based combat system (which pretty much limits the amount of turns you have to defeat your enemies). You'd expect a bland plot and forced humor; this is not the case. It's an amazing game with surprising depth in the gameplay; not just a tribute to the old JRPG games but a good game on its own - something the guys at Ubisoft should take note of when making something like Child of Light, a game that looked fantastic yet lacked in every other department.\n\nLimiting the amount of random encounters (after some fights they become optional) reduces the padding combat that plagued early Final Fantasy games.\n\nAnother unexpected strong point is the soundtrack - a mix of JRPG-inspired 8-bit tunes with 80s heavy metal sounds just epic.\n\nI definitely recommend this game to every fan of the classic JRPG genre and Lovecraft mythos who also likes to have a good laugh. Well done, Zeboyd Games, well done indeed. Luckinly, I also have Breath of Death VII in my library to play after I finish this one.

I can hear folks asking me. "Wouldn't a game by the same developers as Breath of Death be similar?"\n\n\nAnd the answer is a resounding 'YES' to both. Both games are nearly identical when it comes to level design, character progression, combat mechanics and funny/corny dialogue. I think the only difference is me - I'm clearly suffering from some sort of comedy RPG overload.\n\n\nThis game has been sitting in my queue, unfinished, for at least a year now. And everytime I try to pick it up again, I am immediately turned off by the repetitive combat, grossly oversized dungeons and scarce loot. I am just not ready for more of the same.\n\nHowever, I still think the purchase of the bundle is COMPLETELY worth it. Maybe if you play Cthulhu Saves the World first, you'll have the experience I had playing Breath of Death (Read about it here: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989795433/recommended/107300/).","December 3, 2015","false","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Overworld graphics are tolerable.\n\nCONS: I'm shocked to see how many people are praising it for its humor and story, and then I remember the current state of the film industry. I could not tolerate any text that popped up in Cthulhu Saves the World; It is the 9gag of video games. The dialogue is complete and utter trash. I've never been subjected to a more hideous form of unfunny. Every line of garbage uttered by the protagonist and the insufferable mary-sues following him made me writhe in discomfort.\n\nOVERALL: My health issues coincidentally took a turn for the worse around the time I bought this game.

So if you're into retro 2D RPG games, this review won't be to your liking either.\n\nGameplay is pretty simple and the story does show a lot of fun. However, battles are overly simplistic and get rather repetitive pretty quickly. Story wise it's not very interesting. There is some funny interaction between the characters but I get the feeling it's merely the required minimum. The game is praised for it's humor. Let's get this straight: it's not hilarious. I didn't laugh, I didn't even snicker. It's just amusing. That's all. And not good enough to keep my attention/interest after the battles failed to do that as well. I guess it's similar to the situation when one types "LOL" constantly without really "Laughing Out Loud".\n\nBottom line.\nIf you're not into retro 2D RPGs you'll get bored. If you're into retro 2D RPGs maybe, just maybe and if you have pretty low expectations from a cheap game.","May 25, 2014","false","7.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This is from the perspective of a man who has been PC gaming since 2002 (was 10 y/o) and is just introduced to this type of RPGs.\n\nIt's very difficult to give a good game a downvote, but even if everything else is done great, if your main mechanic (the combat) is done poorly, then the game loses all it's value and becomes bad and frustrating.\n\nLet's begin with the praises first:\n\nAs I mentioned, most aspects of the game are done great, we will start off with the:\n\nVisualsThe art for the characters is great, when you see emotion, the picture changes according to the mood of the character. There is lots of variety between most of the monsters and you don't feel like fighting a different version of the same creature over and over again, even through some are just re-skinned and re-colored.\n\nSoundGreat ! Music is awesome and the sound effects while fighting vary from each-other.\n\nStoryAgain, great ! I love how you are a hero, but also not. You want to be evil, but you have to do good things in order to be able to do bad things. I know, right ? Mind=blown. The ending is very disappointing though, I really hoped that the opposite of what happened to happen.\n\nControlsOh thank you, thank you, thank you for adding a sprint button, also thank you for making the "attack" command to be the default one. That helps with spamming ENTER in order to get out of the garbage fighting system as fast as possible.\n\n...and now the bad...\n\nLengthI wish it wasn't this long honestly. Every dungeon frustrated me and I blitzed though it as fast as possible. I am so glad I chose the easy difficulty, otherwise I had to spend a lot more time planning my moves and forget where I was going by the time the fight is over.\n\nThe other and most annoying thing is how the combat worksWhenever you are in a dungeon (or outside one, doesn't matter) you will constantly get interrupted by random encounters. For some it's possible to spam the ENTER key in order to pass them fastly, but for the later ones that option goes down the drain.\n\nPicture this: I am happily strolling down a dungeon, thinking of how to reach the end, I see the layout and think of the best path to take.... and all of a sudden.... BAM! A RANDOM ENCOUNTER. These things can take 5+ minutes. You have to concentrate, think of your best powers to use, look at your MP, HP and stats, look at the monsters' stats and so on. You get so involved it the fight that when you finish, you completely forgot where the hell you were going and forgot your plan completely.\n\nSo you set off again, walk a bit, find the way and BAM! AGAIN A RANDOM ENCOUNTER. This repeats 30 times, making you walk the same path 30 times, seeing the same thing over and over and over(x27) again. This is not fun, it completely ruined the game for me. Exploration is out of the question in this game. I cannot enjoy the look of the dungeon even, if the gameplay constantly gets interrupted by random encounters.\n\nThat is why I don't recommend the game and I am sorry I bought it (only for 31 cents, but even free I wouldn't have played it if I knew how bad it was). It's a shame really because the game does everything else fine.","March 4, 2015","false","6.1"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The fact that people give this game mostly posative reviews must mean its eather one big troll or people have really lowered there standards.\n\n0/10 Dont buy this horrible game.\ncons:\n-the level of detail reminds me of the old rpg maker vx\n-gameplay is long slow and sluggish\n-storyline is broken\n-dull coloring and to badly pixled\n\npros:\n-controller suport\n-reminds me of games i want to go play other then this one","January 21, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Even though you never see your charathers in the battle, its still pretty involving, with stat buffs and debuffs as well as mana preservation, although it isn't quite as stressful as the games it's actually based on.\n\nThe game helps you along with some major streamlining, especially in the inventory and telling you where to go next, although you can sequence break if you are willing to overlevel a bit.\n\nAlthough if this is the first time you've played one of these in a while, the game will probbably seem monstrously difficult, especially with its unique health refill feature giving them an excuse to use a set monster encounter rate.\n\nIn all honesty, I think you should use PSN, GoG, wiiware, xbox arcade,  ceirtain indie releases, a compilation game (I can think of several sega genesis sets that include three phantasy star games, not to mention other awesome things in other genres) to experience this sub-genre in pure form.","November 4, 2014","false","3.1"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

They've also improved the graphics a little, but the story and characters just aren't as good as Breath of Death's.  Wandering around a quirkily rebuilt post-apocalyptic world with a girl ghost hopelessly enamored with a mute depressive skeleton was more fun than this game's cascade of pop horror/cat owner references and boring protagonist.\n\nAs with Breath of Death, there are a lottttt of pointless battles and exploring that are a pain to get through.  But my biggest gripe is that while Breath of Death's boss battles were fantastic and the one really enjoyable part of that game, Cthulhu's bosses are lame.  It's very easy to build one set of characters for disabling/aoes (for trash mobs) and another set for groups heals/combo builds (for bosses), which (at least on Medium) made every single fight in the game a breeze.","April 26, 2012","false","11.4"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"

I got it, expecting it to actually be clever, but soon found myself wallowing in misery and disappointment. It's supposed to be humorous, but the humor boils down to making silly faces and putting Cthulhu into only mildly ridiculous situations. There's a bit of fourth wall humor, but it's far from adroit. In addition, his out of character reactions only left me cringing. This is a god who makes people insane just by being seen, but here we have him idly chatting with mermaids. It's not funny, it's a failure to draw comedy from an emasculated creature of pure destruction. It's saddening that the only way they could conceive of a Lovecraftian comedy was to completely change the very fabric of what the elder gods are. The only relation this game actually has to Lovecraft's works is in name alone. You could name all of the characters and places differently, it would still be the same game.\n\nGameply-wise, it's as bare bones as an RPG can get. There are no mechanics we haven't seen since the 80's. Every battle can be won by mashing the fight button, and there's a good chance you won't have to grind either. Some of the maps are too long, and the encounter rate will have you groaning over the tedium of having fought this same enemy fifty times in the past twenty minutes. I explored most (I say most because toward the end I just wanted to finish and be done with it) of this game's maps, and there are very few secrets to encounter. In fact, there's very little to the game besides the main quest. There's a few game modes to unlock, but I haven't bothered playing them because of how soul crushing the main game is.\n\nIf you're an appreciator of Lovecraft's work, or if you think comedy should be witty, or if you like innovative RPG mechanics, this is not the game for you. You're better off spending your money on a hamburger, at least it won't leave you starving and depressed.","February 14, 2014","false","8.6"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","6","23","0","0"

Which is the point, sure, but it just doesn't add up to much these days, unfortunately. The quirky humour occasionally hits its mark and the characters are, at first, a bit more interesting than the usual JRPG trope characters. However, there doesn't seem to be any more to them except the very superficial quirkiness.\n\nGameplay is the usual old-school JRPG stuff. That is grind. Lots of monotonous grind. In the most baffling design decision I've encountered in a while, your party is completely healed after a won battle, but your mana is not restored. It might not sound so bad, until you realise that without Techs and Magics, your party is consistently and constantly getting beaten. So now you either:\n\nA) have to backtrack to a place where you can restore your mana or\n\nB) win fights without using mana. Which is not happening, not after the first area or so.\n\nGranted, the ability to save anywhere and start random fights almost anytime from the party meny are appreciated, but in the end you still feel like you are wasting your time. The jokes, characters and settings are interesting enough to hold your interest for an hour or two, but eventually the monotony of the gameplay and the frustration of the difficulty curve eat away at your enjoyment.","December 30, 2013","false","10.6"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

I sort of expected that from the price and screenshots but I thought I would give it a shot anyway and I was sourly disapointed. I got to level 20 by spamming the enter key during all fights, speaking of the fights they have tried to do the same thing as Pokemon (And I'm sure a lot of other RPGs) Where all you need to do is walk to find a fight. But who wants to spam the enter key 50 times, every 30 seconds of playing a game? At least in Pokemon you had to walk in long grass... All the dungeons look exactly the same and the whole layout of everything (Menus, battlescreen layout and anything that you need to interact with at all really), are a mix of pointlessness and confusion. I mean, why is "Chat" an option on the main menu? It would make sence if it was an online rpg, but all it triggers is the same conversation with an npc/party member, over and over again. Don't get me wrong I could never make a game at all and for that i respect the efforts that must of gone into this game, but it just wasn't fun to play. At all. I disliked the whole half an hour that i played this. I wanted to find quality in this game but when I couldn't I decided to look into other games of the same producer and I found that "Breath of Death" was almost exactly the same. The same layouts, the same everything with an exception to a few different enimes and npcs. I was pretty much playing the same game, so it gets a strong No from me.

The writing is certainly fun, and the pixel art graphics have a certain nostalgia and neat style to them.  For the most part, the actual combat is uninteresting; I never got into the old school RPG games that featured combat like this (where you can't see any combat animations, and attack/damage is displayed through text boxes) so I didn't feel any nostalgia for it, and it wasn't really doing it for me.  But then, the game is only 7-9 hours long, and features everything else you could want out of a short-form old school RPG experience.  If you feel like a little nostalgic RPG runthrough, but don't want to dedicate 50+ hours, this game will do just fine.","February 1, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There's even a second quest with an all-new storyline once you've completed the first.\n\nI'll admit I'm not very well-versed in Cthulhuian lore and felt the humour was a bit too forced and goofy at times as a result. Where Breath of Death was sharp and witty, Cthulhu was brazen, outlandish and downright silly. Like a teenager trying to impress his friends with useless and mundane "skills".\n\nThe music is still unconventionally memorable (hard rock cave music?) and nods to Zeboyd's history are strewn throughout the game. As with the first game, the optional developer's commentary is enlightening and entertaining and fits perfectly within a game unafraid to break the fourth wall.\n\nCthulhu Saves the World is a bit of an enigma however, while I enjoyed it less than Breath of Death VII, I'm willing to admit it's probably more to do with my lack of understanding of the source material. I ended up playing this game nearly two times longer than I did Breath of Death VII and enjoyed most of it. Chances are if you've played the first game, you'll want to help Cthulhu Save the World too.\n\nUm... hurry?","November 10, 2012","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, it's not without problems.\n\nThe plot is quirky and the dialog full of one-liners and bad puns.  The game is strongest during dialogue, with back and forths between the main characters and the narrator.  There are also plenty of lines when examing bookshelves and chest of drawers that will make you chuckle too.\n\nThis game has great music (just had to make sure I mentioned that).\n\nThe main problem I had with this game was the random encounters on places that weren't the world map.  These areas are giant labyrinths and you end up wandering around, lost, while getting pestered with battles.  After a while, you're strong enough that there's no great risk to these battles (although to be fair, I only played on Normal difficulty so other ones might be better in this regard) so you end up sighing, mashing Return and waiting for the damned battle to finish.\n\nA few hours into the game, I ended up working around the too frequent random battles by going to the start of each new area and selecting 'Fight' from the menu (which forces a new random encounter), getting all of them out of the way one after another.

The grinding was surprisingly fun(I listed it as a con because a majority of people dont like grinding), and the amount of spells leaves you constantly looking for better ways to defeat your enemies, although a lot of spells become obsolete, some spells you get early on can still be used at end-game for enemy ailments(such as Blind or Stun).

There's even a second quest with an all-new storyline once you've completed the first.\n\nI'll admit I'm not very well-versed in Cthulhuian lore and felt the humour was a bit too forced and goofy at times as a result. Where Breath of Death was sharp and witty, Cthulhu was brazen, outlandish and downright silly. Like a teenager trying to impress his friends with useless and mundane "skills".\n\nThe music is still unconventionally memorable (hard rock cave music?) and nods to Zeboyd's history are strewn throughout the game. As with the first game, the optional developer's commentary is enlightening and entertaining and fits perfectly within a game unafraid to break the fourth wall.\n\nCthulhu Saves the World is a bit of an enigma however, while I enjoyed it less than Breath of Death VII, I'm willing to admit it's probably more to do with my lack of understanding of the source material. I ended up playing this game nearly two times longer than I did Breath of Death VII and enjoyed most of it. Chances are if you've played the first game, you'll want to help Cthulhu Save the World too.\n\nUm... hurry?","November 10, 2012","true","25.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Zeboyd's first game was more of a genre parody of JRPGs, while Cthulhu feels like a Lovecraft parody that happens to take the form of a JRPG - and not a very strong parody at that. It's silly Lovecraft, and not a clever overturning of Lovecraft's themes and conventions (like Breath of Death was for JRPGs). But that doesn't mean it's not funny and enjoyable. The fast levelling and combat did a good job of keeping me engaged, and the game is that kind that's short in a good way, so that it doesn't overstay its welcome.\n\nFull review here: http://postlaunch.blogspot.ca/2013/09/cthulhu-saves-world.html","June 19, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cthulhu Save the World is very well made.  Graphics are a throwback to SNES era graphics.  The sound is forgetable, but catchy and appropriate.  Gameplay is similar to other SNES generation turn-based RPGs.  In all aspects, Zeboyd Games showed massive improvements since Breath of Death.  The story is fun, well paced, and memorable.  Standard story mode takes around 7-10 hours to complete and you still have several bonus modes to keep you occupied afterwards.\n\nBottomline: Cthulhu Saves the World is a must-have for any fan of the RPG genre.","March 29, 2015","true","17.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hello, I'm Waffle King. And welcome to Waffle King presents: "Waffle King Reviews Cthulhu Saves The World".\n\n\n\n\nYou may remember me from such reviews as "Life: Why NOT Just Kill Yourself?" or "If This Is So Wrong, Why Does It Feel So Good? - One Man, One Jar of Peanut Butter, One Screwdriver".\n\n\n\nHave you ever thought to yourself "I wonder what's really out there" or "Is this all there is to the world"?\n\nHave you ever wondered if you could comprehend everything out there?\n\n\n\nWhat if I told you that somewhere out there, there's a great being that would cause your brain to melt just by being there?\n\n\nThat out there, there's a creature so mind-boggling that you'd go mad from the mere revelation that he existed?\n\n\n\n\nYes, The Great Old One, Cthulhu!\n\n\nPh'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!\n\nPh'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!\n\n\n\n\nEveryone loves and fears Cthulhu, the Great Old One, He who slumbers below the waves of the sea. He will awake someday from His slumber, and He will bring ruin to the world. And now, in Cthulhu Saves The World, you can play through that great event whenever you want.\n\n\nCthulhu Saves The World, or rather Cthulhu Saves the World: Super Hyper Enhanced Championship Edition Alpha Diamond DX Plus Alpha FES HD – Premium Enhanced Game of the Year Collector’s Edition (without Avatars!) which is the official name, is a retro-style RPG available on the Xbox 360 and on Steam.\n\n\nWell, it's not so much an RPG as it is an RPG parody. A spoof of the role-playing games of old, like older Dragon Warrior/Quest or Final Fantasy games.\n\n\nCthulhu Saves The World is quite possibly the stupidest game I've ever enjoyed playing.\n\n\nCthulhu has arisen to destroy the world, but has his powers sapped. And the only way to regain them is to become a true hero. And so, Cthulhu sets off on a quest to save the world in order to destroy the world.\n\n\nYou'll have to enlist the help of a colorful band of allies, including an alien cat and a talking sword. Cthulhu even enlists some pretty female characters, which I'm 100% sure were put there purely in hopes of someone R34-ing it.\n\n\nI mean, that's what I'd do if I made a game about Cthulhu.\n\n\n\nIf the premise of the game isn't goofy enough, it's sure to drive the punchline home within the first few seconds of the game. Before you can even take control of Cthulhu, the fourth wall is pretty much obliterated. And it stays that way for the entire game. Cthulhu and pals will pick fights with the narrator, point out the glaring "RPG logic" plot holes in the story, and reference the fact that they're in a game multiple times.\n\n\nNot that it's a problem by any means. It's actually the highlight of the game.\n\n\nThe writing and dialogue in the game is hilarious, stupid, and sometimes even witty.\n\nEach enemy will have a short description when you get into a fight. Something like "Wizard - Fun at birthday parties" or "Ghost Knight - Totally not a palette swap". They can range from incredibly witty to stupidly nonsensical, but are entertaining nonetheless.\n\n\nI found myself talking to every NPC, investigating every bookshelf and cupboard, and pretty much searching the entire game for anywhere that may contain more juicy bits of text. The writing is definitely strong, and anyone with a sense of humor and a love of retro RPG's will definitely be able to appreciate the subtle references and jokes.\n\n\nJoke games can usually go either way though. If too much emphasis is on the humor to the point where the game is unpolished or unplayable, it won't get too far based on the humor alone. Laughing at a game and laughing with a game are too entirely different types of entertainment.\n\n\nLucky for Cthulhu though, we're laughing with him.\n\n\nCthulhu Saves The World has your standard retro RPG setup. Turn-based combat, dungeon-crawling, random encounters for experience and gold for leveling up and getting better equipment. All of that is there, with a few twists.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest twist has to be that Cthulhu doesn't have amnesia. Or brightly colored hair. But his skin is green, though. That's close enough.\n\n\n\nThe battles seem to encourage the idea of speed. Of striking hard, and striking fast.\n\nWith tentacles.\n\nEnemies will grow stronger each turn, meaning if you're too slow they'll eventually double or even triple in strength. Enough to kill your entire party in a few hits. You have a similar feature though. A combo meter that will build up with every hit, which will boost damage on certain combo finisher moves.\n\n\nEven the items in the game are short and to the point. In fact, there's really only two. And only one of those you can freely use in battle. Unlike a standard RPG where you'd be weighed down with Phoenix Downs, status recoveries for every possible ailment, and all sorts of stuff you need to stock up on but rarely ever use.\n\n\nYou'll have 1-ups to revive your entire party if you fall, and Potions to fully restore an ally. That's pretty much it.\n\n\n\nThere's a number of features like this to make the experience smoother and quicker. You can save anywhere, and your party heals all HP and a bit of MP after each battle.\n\n\n\nBut most importantly, probably the best idea out of this whole game, is the random encounter limit.\n\n\nEach dungeon will have a set amount of battles. Roughly 20-ish for most. But after you've defeated them all, you're done. You can casually explore as much as you like after, and nothing will pop up and attack you. The choice is still there if you'd like to fight; there's a button on the menu that will trigger battles for you if you'd still like to grind more. But at that point, you'd be pretty much as strong as you'd need to be anyway.\n\n\n\nLike any retro RPG, it does seem to drag on at times. It can get pretty repetitive and grindy towards the end, especially after you've read every funny monster description and just mash the button to kill things. But it's definitely a solid RPG game.\n\n\n\nFor those that find it to their liking, they'll be pleased to find a number of bonus things to do after the game is over. Multiple bonus modes to play, and collectibles to unlock.\n\nYour party members even have crude "skill trees" as they level up. And by that, I mean "You can choose to make Cthulhu a physical attacker or a magical attacker". Not anything as fancy as modern RPG's, but it gives you a bit more to play with every playthrough I guess.\n\n\nIt even has a pretty nice soundtrack, like any RPG should.\n\n\n\nCthulhu Saves The World is a great RPG and definitely something to check out. Colorful, humorous, and full of tentacles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's how I like my women.","February 21, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An indepth leveling system combined with luscious 2D pixel art go well with the tongue in cheek styled humor of the antithetic Cthulhu who has been placed in the titular role as a "true hero" (against his will, of course). Along the way, he'll come across unlikely allies that will join him in his journey to save the world...only to destroy it with madness upon regaining his stolen power.\n\nI bought this in a bundle with Breath of Death VII for only $3. However, that deal may expire soon. Even still, this game is well worth the asking price of a measly 3 bucks and a true treat to any that yearn for a RPG that doesn't take itself too seriously or wishes to go back to the 90's, if only for just a little while.","July 19, 2011","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're playing as an ancient evil out to destroy the world.\n\nThe graphics are delightfully nostalgic.  Simple 2D sprites that immediately brought me back to the old Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy games.\n\nThe combat mechanics, also, hearken back to those classic games.\n\nBut the humor is delightfully fresh.

The game is in the style of the old Final Fantasy games which for me does have some nostalgia value since I remember playing FF 4 or 5 on my old Gameboy Color.\n\nBut the game itself is pretty entertaining. The story is amusing, I've had a few good laughs throughout my playthrough so far. The aesthetic is fairly good if you like the 16 bit style. I've had a couple problems with the UI but nothing major after I got used to it, my biggest complaint is that the game doesn't seem to want to let you Alt-tab out of it.\n\nOne thing you DO NEED TO KNOW is that if you lose a fight and don't want to spend a 1-up to try again, hitting backspace to quit will force you to reload your last save file. So save frequently and if you're thinking about quiting out of a fight consider how long it's been since your last save. :P\n\nThe dungeons are maybe a bit too large and somes feel convoluted, I definitely got lost a time or two. And due to the nature of exploring through being constantly attacked with random encounters this can mean the game can drag on a little. Personally I've enjoyed the game enough this has not bothered me, but if you're expecting this to be a quick little experience you may find otherwise. So far I've played probably around 8 or 10 hours on Hard difficulty and I still haven't reached the ending.\n\nSpeaking of difficulty, I found the game a bit too easy on Normal so I had to stick it out through Hard even though at the start MP management is a pain (mana points). Now that's almost disappeared as a concern since all my characters have over 100 MP and some even over 300 and the spell costs didn't really grow in proportion, but I consider that a good thing. Some dungeons are still long enough that I'm starting to run out of MP near the end, for a couple I've even had to go back to town and come back to refill on MP. It can be a bit tedious but Normal difficulty just felt too easy. Though if you just want to blitz through the game just for the story, then going on Normal or Easy is probably the way to do so.\n\nThe character development in terms of combat is interesting because it genuinely does feel like it's possible to have your characters fill the role you wish them to, at least to a certain point. For example your first party member Umi at first seems like a great mage but I think she's actually a better fighter/support and should focus on Str which will really come into form when you pick up Thor's Call somewhere above lvl 20. As she levels you can try to push her down the mage tree but I honestly don't think she'll ever be as good as October. Similarly it's possible to try to make Cthulhu a mage, but I don't think he'd do all that well either, and for both characters I feel this is mostly due to a lack of spells. October gets the access to the full wizard toolkit, while Umi and Cthulhu can only really pick up the occasional spell. And unfortunately it seems once you make a level up choice there is no way to alter your choices, so later on you may regret spending points in one direction or another.\nGenerally most characters feel useful in some capacity or another, except for maybe Paws. He has extremely high Agility, can toggle the enemy group's insanity on or off, and that's about it? He just seems to be lacking any combat skills to make him effective and even when he gets a couple they don't really do enough damage. The insanity bit is interesting but I don't see a reason to bring him along when Dacre can support much better, both Umi and October are better Mages, and Umi, October, and Sharpe all do way more damage. He's a sort of Jack off All Trades, Master of None in that he can do a bit of just about everything, but all of it is kinda weak. I think he'd have been better if he had been more focused on something.\n\nOverall I would say the combat is competent, which is fine since I think humor is meant to also be a large part of the attraction and in my opinion it works. And I do like the fact you can skip through all the combat text if you so desire, so combat only takes as long as you want it to. Though some of the harder fights did require me to pay attention.\nThe Insanity mechanic is pretty interesting in that you can get buffs from enemies being insane and it looks funny/cool, and I know the devs intended for it to be a double edged sword, but I tend to find the edge that cuts back at me is a bit too sharp. It's fun seeing October cast Void on an insane group and do 1400 dmg in aoe to a massive crowd, or seeing Cthulhu Dark Strike an insane enemy for like 3k dmg, but it's not so much fun when the enemies start throwing their insanity buffed nukes at you and party members start dropping like flies. All in all I've found it better to avoid turning most enemies insane and just mess around with it from time to time rather than trying to rely on it.\n\nSteam says I have played 12 hours but it's really more like 8-10, but I still haven't finished the game or tried the extra game modes so I hope to be entertained even more by the mighty Cthulhu as he strives to be a true hero.\n\ntl;dr version: A funny, quirky game in the style of oldschool RPGs like the early Final Fantasy titles. Not perfect but it's fun enough to kill a good few hours and has a generous amount of content at a generous price, so imo well worth effort.","March 8, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love RPG’s,  I love comedies, I love this game!\n\nIt is silly without being obnoxious, challenging without being cheap, and despite being a comedy it also feels like an adventure where you and your heroes grow and save the world. The progression of difficulty and your own development is in perfect sync.\n\nTrue, some characters are more forgettable than others and some are just plain satirical RPG stereotypes, but the game itself is so solid, especially if you remember the old school 16-bit days.\n\nAnd the soundtrack is SO.

You play as Cthulhu, stripped of his dark powers by a mysterious foe. The only way to regain them? Perform great heroic deeds. So begins the misadventures of Cthulhu and his colorful band of misfits you pick up (or groupies as I took to calling them).\n\nThe game itself is not demanding on your hardware, as one might expect from a retro RPG.\n\nThe combat is fluid, simple, and rewards your choices - on higher difficulties it can be utterly unforgiving, reminiscent of much older games.\n\nAnd as I’ve said, the game has a great sense of humor about itself. Personally, I found myself compelled to continue playing solely to see what the next joke may be.\n\nGrade: B.\n\nA solid game that will last you anywhere from 5 to 9 hours on the first campaign, with a few extras to boot.

The battle theme is great for setting the tone of the encounter and the town themes are quite varied. The music aside, this game really is quite funny without forcing humor. It plays on the already ridiculous concept well and just has fun with it.\n\nIt's nice to see the old style of RPG back but what makes it better is how quick the battles go, in terms of the action boxes. I'm not saying the battles are easy, oh god no. Enemies can hit like semi trucks and knock you flat before you realize what's happening. There are plenty of attacks/spells/combos/what-have-you to pick through so to make a play style that works and is personally appealing.\n\nThings can get super tricky, though. The HP restore at the end of each battle is amazing but the lack of potions purchase can  really throw a wrench into the works. I see how the game could be too easy if you could purchase them considering how potions work but it's the last thing that matters when running out in the middle of a fight. The slow MP restore after every battle helps too but it means you have to be careful when using your favorite MP-using attacks. Thankfully, there's a MP restore/save point before every major boss battle so it's not like you'll go into a tough-as-nails battle completely unprepared for it.\n\nI'm almost six hours in (up to Kingsport) but I'm loving this game to death. Can't wait to see where it goes.","July 21, 2014","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only way to do this is to become a hero by traveling around the world map, visiting fantasy towns named after Mythos locations, and laying the smackdown on your Great Old One brethren. Along the way you pick up several party members (one of whom seems to represent some kind of cameo; the game certainly seemed to expect me to recognize her).\n\nThe combat is full-on Dragon Quest. The enemies line up in front of you and you ATTACK / DEFEND / MAGIC / ITEM etc. The combat system is tweaked to be more user-friendly than similar games from the 1980s, and there are other conveniences (like being able to save anywhere) that eliminate most of the frustration factor.\n\nThe only downside is that this DOES make the game pretty easy. Completing it unlocks another mode called Cthulhu's Angels, where the title character stays on the sidelines but you start with three party members. I didn't play that far in this mode, but it seems significantly more difficult (and, bless, features its own separate story traversing the same locations).","August 1, 2011","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cthulhu Saves The World is an excellent, quiet well designed game that is a definite throwback to 'old-school' RPGs while being quite accessible to new players. I certainly enjoyed it, and if you can get in the double pack alongside Breath of Death VII it's a steal. Only problem I found was that the dungeons were far too long and confusing, and you might be put off in trying to complete some of them. Still, the particular mechanic of having a limited amount of mandatory dungeon battles is practically a(n old)godsend as it allows gamers of different types to approach dungeons how they wish, to a certain extent. If you can take your time with the game, it will reward you. The director's commentary is always a nice treat as well.\n\nPros: Solid Humor, references to RPGs and Lovecraft aplenty, large world to explore, good variety of foes\nCons: Long, somewhat steep difficulty, dungeon design confusingly, MADDENINGLY tedious.\n\nOverall: 4/5","November 21, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the combo system along with the insanity and unite mechanics and a huge variety of characters to pull different combinations of moves, I found that just simply changing tactics and experimenting what works and what doesn't, is much better than tedious grinding most RPG's pit you up with.\n\nI've beaten the final boss on level 36 in insanity mode, the hardest difficulty, on my first real playthrough and believe me when I say insanity mode is hard, the hours I have don't lie. If that isn't a testament to how the gameplay is set from other traditional RPG's, I don't know what else will convince you.\n\n\nIf you're new to RPG's and/or just want something different to the mix, you owe it to yourself to pick this game up.","August 30, 2015","true","46.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
