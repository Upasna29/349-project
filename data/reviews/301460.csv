Michael Todd keeps to the platformers roots and doesn't swerve too far away from what made the origional Electronic Super Joy so great. Sticking with the same music compser (EnV) leaves the game with the same lasting musical impression of absolutely nippletastic beats. Groove City does however feel MUCH harder than the original which is a good thing for all you who want a very rewarding platforming experience. Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoyed the first one and just in general to anyone who enjoys a game with great beats and a great challenging platformer experience. 9/10\n\n\nIf you prefer impressions in video format, have no fear I do that as well!\nhttp://youtu.be/sB3rUYftJuM","June 5, 2014","true","9.0"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","77","82","0","0"

What’s next? To the strip club!\n\nLet’s not beat around the bush, Electronic Super Joy was flipping amazing! A high intensity platformer fueled by an addictive electronic soundtrack, it chewed me up and spit me out, and I loved every second of it! Taking a cue from Giana Sisters: Rise of the Owlverlord, Groove City is a mini-sequel spanning slightly more than a dozen levels, as you and the pope embark on a quest to save Groove City from a giant robot stripper who’s gone on a rampage because her laser nipples have been stolen!\n\nWith Groove City, Michael Todd has managed the rarely achieved feat of taking something great, and making it better. The levels are tighter designed, the soundtrack seems to get more amazing with each track, the backgrounds are more sparkly; it’s a smaller, more focused experience that fits perfectly in its role as a spinoff sidestory sorta sequel, because more ESJ can’t possibly be a bad thing!\n\nIf you were not previously indoctrinated by the painful joy of the first game, it’s worth noting that Groove City is just as brutal (if not more so) as its predecessor. A large part of this comes in the form of the new self induced torture of the black stars, which upon collection summons a homing missile with your name on it. It’s a clever ploy to add even more challenge to an already difficult game for those that want it, without being as rigid as traditional difficulty settings.\n\nIf there’s anything to fault Groove City for, it’s that this is still only a half step toward a full sequel, and will likely only last you a little more than an hour. This isn’t to say the game isn’t worth picking up, but playing it made me realize how much I’ve been missing ESJ and can only hope a full sequel is in the works (and not too far off). I’m not typically so brief with my reviews, but there Groove City is such a no brainer for fans of the original that I can think of nothing more to say than buy it. If you were not infatuated with the original, this isn’t going to change anything, but those ready to cry more tears of (Electronic Super) Joy can rest assured nothing has been lost in its transition to a smaller package.\n\nNow go get that stripper’s nipples back!\n\nFull disclosure: Groove City was reviewed using a copy of the game provided by the developer. You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal.[kritiqal.com].","June 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","49","53","0","2"

With that said, I don't think that ESJ:GC is a terrible game, just unfinished, and its current content is more like what you'd expect in a minor DLC or free update for the original game.\n\nBut first, let's start with the good parts. The soundtrack ranges from good at worst to amazing at best, which isn't surprising as the composer is the same as the first game's. The story and one-liners are about as quirky as in the first game, and you may or may not see that as a good thing, although for me personally the novelty of butt jokes, battlepopes and robot strippers has worn off a bit. Most of the few levels present were decently designed, with some skillfully timed jumps required at parts.\n\nNow we get to the bad parts. One thing that I noticed right off the bat was that the ability to ground pound had been removed. Considering the original game had 4 total moves (left, right, jump, ground pound), this change is pretty significant. There's no way to get rid of missiles now, you can only jump around them, and the screen can get ridiculously cluttered with them unless if you purposely suicide after each checkpoint. I also found myself taking too long to fall at times and dying because of it, where in the original game I could have just ground pounded downwards.\n\nSome platforming elements from the first game are either used only a few times, like the sticky walls, or not at all, like the wings. There's only one "boss", and all you have to do is avoid his attacks for around a minute. There are only a few varieties of enemies present, you could probably count them all on one hand.\n\nThese are all minor problems compared to the main issue, however: the game is just too short. I'm not particularly good at platformers, and even though I died several times, I was able to beat the entire game in slightly over an hour, getting all achievements in my first playthrough. There's no replay value at all. There is an included level editor, but this seems to be the dev's way of saying "this is all I'm doing, you finish the game". It seems to me like the dev didn't want to release these levels as free DLC for ESJ like he has in the past, but instead slapped a level designer on it and called it a new game.\n\nI can't really complain about the price personally, since I bought this for 27 cents, but I know there are people who will want to buy it at full price. My word of advice: don't. It's basically a small level pack disguised as a sequel. Ask yourself if you think $5 is worth an hour, tops, of entertainment. You can make your money go much further than that on Steam. Of course, if you have a coupon or it's on sale, feel free to go for it if you want to burn away an hour of your time.\n\nIn conclusion, ESJ:GC has the potential to become just as good as ESJ if more (free) content is added, but as it is now, it's just a skeleton of a game that happens to have great music.\n\nIf you scrolled past all that just looking for a number, here it is: 4/10","September 26, 2014","false","1.2"," 73 of 100 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","73","100","0","4"

Not a whole lot has changed since our first outing in the acid trip that is Electronic Super joy, but several much appreciated improvements and changes were made for this miniature adventure.\n\nA healthy number of checkpoint flags and notable lack of those damn screen filling rocket segments dot the game. But unlike the majority of the first adventure, you're missing your downward snap attack, meaning you'll just have to avoid any rockets that come your way. And they will, along with sadistic bunnies and star throwing ninjas.\n\nNew to the sequel is the inclusion of a points system, as opposed to just the timer in the original. While time is tracked and slowly ticks away at your overall points, the biggest contributor will be the all new collectibles, big and small, hidden and not so hidden, that will add to your score. And in true sadistic fashion, these collectibles are often hidden behind some devious enemy or primed to force you into an early confrontation with a blessing of rockets.\n\nGroove City benefits from a much more rounded difficulty curve, with only a handful of wtf moments pitter-pattering their way into the game. The fine progression in difficulty may be the result of having only just over a dozen levels in the game, but what's here works really well, and serves as an excellent 30-45 minute excursion into platforming Hell bliss. If you enjoyed the original, there's no reason you won't enjoy Groove City. And even for newcomers unknowing of the original, the often crass humor alone makes Groove City worthy of a playthrough.","June 6, 2014","true","1.2"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

The way the camera snaps when your character reaches a certain part of the screen, rather than always following you with smooth scrolling, has caused so many deaths that would have otherwise been avoidable.\n\nThe camera will often snap sideways at vital points. It is especially frustrating when it occurs in mid-jump, right before reaching a ledge. It adds an unnecessary level of difficulty to an already difficult game that just should not have been there in the first place.\n\nBecause of how the camera system has been implemented, and with how often you have to repeat small sections of the game due to failure, this is one of the only games that has managed to disorient me and cause motion sickness. It may not happen to everyone but because of my unfortunate experience I just can't recommend a game that works against the player in such an absurd way.","December 12, 2014","false","0.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Finding our hero in a position needing to save Groove City, we set out with the help of Pope Boris to stop the evil Dr Swinger.\n\nIf you've played the first game in the series, Electronic Super Joy, you should feel right at home with the controls. The game plays like a standard platformer with your actions being move and jump. Don't let this turn you away, though, since Groove City offers plenty of challenging platforming and a number of hidden areas including two whole secret levels. Jumping and movement are extremely tight, leaving you in total control of your character. Compared to the original, I found Groove City to be a fair bit harder and demand more precise jumping. If you're up for a challenge, this game is for you.\n\nThe smooth gameplay isn't everything that Groove City offers either. Boasting incredibly flashy visuals, silly humor, sulty sexual sounds, and a heart-pumping electronic soundtrack by EnV (the genius behind the music of the first game), your eyes and ears will not be disappointed as you traverse this unique world.\n\nGiven 15 levels to explore, 2 of which are secret, Groove City gives you plenty of opportunity to show off your skills. If you're the type to shoot for high scores, the game offers optional challenges to make the game harder and give you extrta points. A new addition to the series, the black star, causes a rocket to spawn and follow you around the area making platforming more difficult while rewarding you with more points. Collecting every black star in a level and being able to complete will definitely not be an easy feat. There are a number of secret areas and levels to be found while exploring this lively world as well. Finding secrets give you addtional chances to earn some points in sections that can be a bit more difficult than the main portion of the level. Do you have what it takes to find and complete them all?\n\nWith the promise of two additional chapters and new modes such as a level editor and minigames, Groove City is definitely worth the cost of admission. The current content is enough to scratch any platforming itches and get you hyped for the future content.","June 6, 2014","true","2.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

If you're returning,  this still has more of what you have come to love, plus a level editor, but finishes a little prematurely (insert checkpoint moan here)\n\nESJ: Groove City keeps its great platforming and has another set of killer tunes. It is about half the length of the first game, the levels, although possibily easier to speed run than the original, are absolutely more punishing (and rewarding) for those that are completionists, striving to get each star and finding the sometimes devilishly tucked away hidden rooms increase the difficulty significantly. It also has a level editor, so you can create and play custom levels, where you can really extend your play time.\n\nSadly Groove City does not have the double jump or smash abilities used in this game. This can make the game feel more focused, but after having them in the first, not having them in the second hurt the game I felt. I also LOVED seeing the short potions where color was implemented instead of the monochromatic style used primarly in the game.

Groove City has been rebuilt by the Boogie Brothers, and everything was wonderful until Dr. Swinger stole JoJo the Robot Stripper's Laser Nipples. Here, we enbark on a journey with Pope Borris the Super Sexy as we take down Dr. Swinger and retreive the Laser Nipples.\n\nThe platforming mechanics are really spot on. If you come here from an intense Electronic Super Joy background (You played the first game), the controls make you feel right at home. Even though it is shorter than the original Electronic Super Joy, I find the difficulty much harder than the original (Ol' Ball and Chain ain't got nothin on this). I find myself missing the "Slam" ability, because I use it for much more than taking out enemies. I use it as a stablizer when I'm going to fast, or to immediately land on a platform. I miss this mechanic, but the game itself is wonderful.\n\nEnV is back with his amazing soundtrack, and I have to say, I can't stop playing this game to listen to the music. Sometimes I just launch the game, sit on a certain level, and listen to the music and not move. It's that good.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this game is that it's too short.\n\nSpeaking of soundtrack, the store description describes of including EnV's new EP and the game OST in the game. It was actually a marketing text mistake, for the EP realeases in several days as a separate DLC. Do not let that throw you off, haha. It already thrown a lot of people off.","June 6, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It combined excellent level design, punishing yet fair difficulty, an amazing soundtrack, and an absurd amount of fun to make it an excellent addition to anyone's Steam library. As a fan of the original, any sort of worthwhile sequel or add on or DLC would have been more than welcomed. Electronic Super Joy: Groove City is, unfortunately, none of those things.\n\nUnderstandably that is a high bar to live up to, but Groove City doesn't even come close to trying. It is sold as its own game,  and described as a sequel but it really isn't either of those things. Groove City is thirteen separate levels (with a couple of additional "hidden" levels), the entirety of which can be completed within thirty to forty five minutes. This would barely feel like a full length DLC package, and the fact it is sold as its own game seems misleading as there isn't nearly enough here to consider it its own anything. It would be like if an ice cream shop sold the sprinkles separately and also told you they were totally ice cream, just trust them on this one.\n\nBrevity is not always a bad thing, but the main issue here is the levels themselves just aren't that good. The levels in Electronic Super Joy were extraordinarily designed, with this brilliant and wicked challenge that kept you coming back for more. Here, everything is decidedly more ho-hum. It feels like this was a pack of levels deleted from the first game for not being up to snuff, packaged together here as a sort of "lost levels" kind of deal. The original game was brilliant in its design. Here everything is obvious. There are no clever, memorable levels along the way, and there are only one or two here that would really feel in place with the original game.\n\nSo the game suffers from being short, and then what is here really isn't worth the price of admission. Not everything is bad. The ending couple of levels are entertaining and the music is still bonkers off the charts excellent, but those things alone don't save the game. If you're looking for more Electronic Super Joy to play, just go replay the original again as more fun is to be had that way. This is neither super nor joyous.","May 19","false","0.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game offers about an hour of gameplay and to me it didn't really feel as challenging or rewarding as the first one. If you are looking for a game like this I would recommend playing the first ESJ before this. I prefer the leaderboard system in the first game where top times were your goal and not so much getting a ton of points.\n\nThe level design didn't feel as fluent as it did in the first game and I feel like a lot of the stars where just placed randomly with no real reason behind it other than getting more points. This is my personal opinion and I won't say it's a bad system but I simply found trying to get got times and top spots in the first game more fun.\n\nYou should only really buy it if you loved the first one, but just as a warning, don't expect to get that much real gameplay  out of this one unless you like collecting stars. You will most likely get all of the achievement fairly easily and beat the game in just one sitting.\n\nAs a conclusion I think the music is still as groovy and perfect as it was in the first one and there has been a lot of updates to the visual style but the lack of new mechanics and the short time that it takes to complete it brings it down. Nevertheless, in the end I did enjoy it because I love these kind of games :)\n\n- Liam","September 27, 2014","true","1.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

There is also a level editor, but I didn't bother with it.\n\nIf you liked ESJ for its humor and music or you want to mess around with the level editor, this is worth buying.

With good music, once you turn the extraneous sounds off, this game still doesn’t really sell me. The game is challenging and if you know that going into it, that softens the blow. The levels are well laid out and planned to be tough while looking very simple. I don’t know how to properly rate this game. Like I stated before, Electronic Super Joy: Groove City is a solid game with a fantastic soundtrack that I can get behind after taking out all of the crap that the devs felt necessary to put in as a theme for the whole game. I know, it’s a choice thing, but it’s not completely my bag and it really turned me off. When you get down to the pure essence of what Groove City is, there is a greater game behind the curtain.

Namely because I wanted to get it over with about 10 minutes in. This isn't like the last game at all. The music is fine but not as good, you don't have an attack anymore and all the levels are hard for the most wrong reasons possible. They're filled with kaizo trap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and it's all the more noticeable because of the rapid fire missiles and enemies that you can no longer smash.\n\nand just like any other kaizo trap ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t there's a part in the game that is almost literally impossible to complete because of assumptions it makes about people's refresh rate and relative FPS. You can work around it by enabling vsync or forcing the framerate to cap at 60. Too bad most of the options in the menu don't work (as in you literally cannot toggle them). I was able to force vsync via my GPU control panel though. Too bad you can't force the ghosts off.\n\nAnd that damned ghost. Let me tell you. It was what made me give up and quit during the boss fight (which itself pales in comparison to the epic fight with the wizard in the last game). It's on by default and since the options don't toggle it's there forever. So throughout the game I was continuously being distracted by replays of someone on my friends list doing the level themselves. Given how many times they were dying (and then jumping in place repeatedly, then just standing there hopelessly) it's clear they were hating it as much as I was.\n\nSince the ghost is a less opaque copy of your own sprite it's very easy to get it mixed up when trying to do split second timed jumps and this was a continuous problem for me.\n\nI don't recommend buying it.

It's not a good mix.\n\nThe gameplay sums up to very basic walking and press sensitive jumping.  You don't get any new skills or mechanics that add to gameplay whatsoever throughout it. You go through what I'm assuming is a collection of the worst possible obstacles there can be in a platformer - trial and error segments, slow moving and seemingly random homing projectiles, unavoidable trash pickups, screen corners of death, you name it. If you've hated it in a platformer, it's probably in this game.\n\nThe graphic design is l̶a̶z̶y̶ ̶a̶n̶d̶ ̶u̶n̶i̶n̶s̶p̶i̶r̶e̶d̶ ̶p̶i̶x̶e̶l̶ ̶a̶r̶t RETRO style. All segments containing actual gameplay have all elements (characters, homing missiles and landscape) painted completely black with a few exceptions of a couple white pixels and trails. This makes for incredibly confusing distinguishment of elements on screen and becomes frustrating as friendly characters are aesthetically similar to characters that murder you and so on, so forth for everything else.\n\nThe soundtrack is a selection of a few generic trance music tracks. They all sound the same and become unsettingly repetitive after a while if you ever do get stuck at a segment and having to listen to it loop - and watch as the 2 frame background characters bob their heads to it.\n\nThe game also suffers from the "thinks it's funny" syndrome. It randomly pops up background characters being vulgar and other lowbrow tactics to get a laugh out of people. While I am a person who would very much laugh at the Pope being into Strippers and Scientists yelling over nipples and everything in between, it was far too obvious it was just trying to seem random to get easy laughs for ratings.\n\nOverall this is a very poor game that seems like it was coded in a few days over a couple bottles of vodka. I've played tons of platformers and can safely say this one lacks severely in every aspect. There's no penalty for dying and overcoming the bullcrap obstacles renders no satisfaction whatsoever as they're not difficult as some just demand patience or dare I say luck.\n\nWhat angers me the most about it is not the poor taste humor or bullcrap gameplay, but the fact that someone out there is laughing because he got this crap on here and is charging money for it.\n\n\nIf you've come this far, here are a few platformers that are easily superior to whatever this can offer, along with being free:\nPause Ahead[games.adultswim.com]\nSHIFT[www.newgrounds.com]\nLevel Up[www.newgrounds.com]\nMeat Boy (original flash version)[www.newgrounds.com]","September 27, 2014","false","1.5"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","9","23","0","0"

I do not recommend paying the $5 for this game. I wouldn't even pay $2 for it.\n\n\nThe only reason I bought this game was so I could get EnV's music, and it doesn't even "come with" it. It's all in the game files and I can't listen to them sepparately.\n\n\nThe level and game design are poor. Far too many times did it introduce a new concept, obstacle, or enemy, without any form of tutorial or explanation and I would die and be set back and have to replay the annoying parts of the level.\n\nThere seemed to be no point in collecting points. They just got in the way, and obstructed the game for no apparant reason.\n\nEverything on the level is either black or white. So it is far too difficult to differentiate various objects on the level. Far too many times did I run into an enemy not knowing they were there, or jump past an object I should have landed on.\n\nThe menus are practically non-existant, and what is there is ridiculously clumsy to navigate. There's no way to quit the game, I had to press alt+F4.\n\nWhat jokes I did see didn't amuse me at all. The constant moan whenever I respawn or walked past a checkpoint meerly served to infuriate me and to encourage me to avoid them altegether (punishing me in the long-run). The constant reference to sex, and various other "adult themes" came off as purely imature and as a result it felt like the game was targetted at 12 year olds.\n\n\nI get the distinct feeling that the developer(s) didn't even play the game before releasing it, let alone have it tested.\n\n\nPerhaps the reason I'm not enjoying this game is because I haven't played the previous game.

Unlike the previous entry, the game is very much your basic platformer, and does not have any buttstomping, gravitational changes, or the like. However, this helps refine the game itself, and the challenge is not nearly as daunting yet just as enjoyable.\n\nOf course, Groove City is every bit as challenging, but the challenges are purely of platforming prowess, and there are plenty of secret areas that once completed can unlock further bonus levels with even more kick than the main missions. It's not that hard to miss a lot of them, and at a little less than two hours I have finished all the main levels, found a good few secrets, and only managed to unlock two of what I believe is a possible secret levels. That and the now implemented score system adds a lot of replayability for those who don't find the game hard enough.\n\nOn top of all this, Groove City comes packed with a level editor, and if you're the soul who loves ESJ and wants even more, you can make to your heart's content. The level editor is fairly well contructed, and it did not take me too long to construct a few basic levels, so definitely check it out if that's you're thing.\n\nAll in all, Groove City retains all the charm of its predecessor and adds a lot in exchange for what was taken away. Definitely pick this up if you're into the immense charm and challenge that this series offers.","December 14, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The base game was good, but I found that the problems that it presented could have been stomped out in this DLC. Overall, it's basically the same game but scaled down, basically to the point where it's just a new added-on world. What I love is, of course the music, everything else really falls by the wayside, like if your favorite songs got put over the original Mario game; the great music is what supports the tired, punishing game. It got to the point about halfway in I just wanted to keep playing just so I could get more of the music- just like ESJ itself. If I was you I would skip it- get the soundtrack.\n\nBUT...WHY????\n\nWell, I'll tell you why- the game is pixelated- you must know it is all about that sweet moosic PUSS! If you really want to get it, do it, if you enjoyed the slow pacing of the original (because you get instakilled by anything that hits you harder than a mild gust of wind), have it, and if you liked the music, the EDM music, mind you, you'll also like this. I just found it disappointing the dev didn't make the game more engaging, and the music will get tiresome after a while, because when you think you escaped- NOPE! MISSILE!\n\nWHY DO YOU HATE THAT? THAT'S WHAT MADE THE GAME SO ENDEARING!\n\nWell, now more annoying enemies, from (slightly swastika-shaped) knife throwing baddies, do little foot high charging idiots that mess you up (naturally). And plus, now missiles don't explode anyway when you give them enough time, so at one point I was trailing about 20 of them around the map. So good luck getting a prefect death count on a level.\n\nSO?\n\nWell, in conclusion, I liked the main game, but it had some problems that got dragged kicking and screaming into it's first DLC. Good music, boring repetitive gameplay, annoying instantkills, and some rather worn-out humor (unless Laser Nipples are your kinda thing!) round out this very meh game.

The main thing that killed the game for me, however, is how short this game was, and how limited your abilities were in this game. In the previous, you could 'smash' enemies or double-jump or fly for some levels, but in this one it's just jump and collect all the stars.

It's about a city named 'Groove City' being destroyed by a giant robot stripper named JoJo, she is mad because a guy named Dr. Swinger stole her laser nipples and you go on a quest to reclaim them... yeah, I'm not joking.\nIt's really short, you may complete it in under 2 hours AND unlock all the achievements even tho it is very difficult. But the comedy in this game is better, well, lets just say the jokes are ''not good'', but you'll still laugh at them for an unknown reason. There is a scoring system also, and getting the points can be very difficult, you either have to find a secret area and dodge enemies and there are also points that you can pick up, but they'll launch missles at you, which is a nice twist. The really good part of the game which not many people notice is that there are patterns, you don't just go through your obstacles and hope for the best, no, the game is too hard for that. There is no random generation after going through a checkpoint, so you can get to one place, try one thing a few times, if it doesn't work, then you go try to find another approach at the obstacle, but if it does work, then you can stick to doing it every time until you find the other step and finally get through the really hard obstacle you spent hours trying to go through.

Electronic Super Joy: Groove City is not.\n\nIt's basically more of the same - which is to say that it features tight, responsive controls, a brilliantly energetic soundtrack and a kooky sense of humour - except they've added in sections in which you have to jump JUST before you hit the ground. And when I say JUST before, I mean that the timing window is literally a fraction of a millisecond, otherwise it's back to the checkpoint with you. This would be only barely tolerable, were it not for the fact that you need to execute these jumps multiple times in a row. Never EVER before have I seen a timing window so utterly ridiculous. I am normally inclined to rise to the challenge of tough games but this is not an unduly tough game so much as it is an insane game mechanic amidst an otherwise reasonable challenge. This does not provide a cohesive sense of difficulty in the way that something like Dark Souls does, which accentuates the frustration when these appalling jumping sections occur.

It was a game I've played (almost) to full completion, and one that I will undoubtedly return to many times.  Groove City was such a disappointment by comparison. Simply put; the game is too short (as many are saying), the music doesn't sound as good as the first game, and...well I just didn't enjoy myself.  There's something big missing from this game as well: the abilities.  Something I had wished would come back was the smash.  I begged this game to give the smash back but I didn't even get a glimpse of it.  And in combination with how short this game is, it's too easy, making the game even shorter.  The only thing I even remotely enjoyed was the new enemy type; the black star, which was a somewhat clever kind of enemy.\n\nThis doesn't feel like a a sequel to Electronic Super Joy, this instead feels like a poorly done prequel.   I cannot give a recommendation for this game, it's inferior in every way to the first ESJ.  The first had my head bouncing up and down, covered in a dumb grin the entire game.  I couldn't get into Groove City no matter how much I wanted to; I just looked at my screen with a blank stare, wondering where the fun disappeared to in this disaster of a "sequel".","September 15, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep in mind that, while it IS cheaper, and it IS a sequel, it is a LOT shorter. There are barely any levels. There are only 8 achievements and they are all straightforward and easy to get. BUT, there is more content on the way, and very recently (as I am writing this review) a level editor was released. This is good. Level making/sharing = endless fun.\n\nThis game is a lot like the first one: bright colours, sexual noises and jokes (there is still a PG mode), head-explodingly-good music, and... MISSILES. There is one big difference though: You can't smash. Which means a lot more dying to the missiles. But this change is also good because it lets you focus on "proper" platforming, just you and your jumping against the world, no way of defending yourself.\n\nThere are only 15 levels (including the two secret levels) but they are well made, challenging, and all unique (there are no worlds like in the original). And of course, the music is awesome. There are 7 new songs (I think) and one or two of the best from the original game have been re-used.\n\nAnother difference is that you get a score for each level, based on how fast you finish, whether or not you did it without dying, and how many stars you collect. These aren't like the stars in the original game, there are lots of them, and they give you 10 points each. If you are someone who likes getting high scores, you will spend a long time replaying levels to get a better score. There are also black stars, which award you 69 points (it's true) and then spawn a missile.\n\nAnd of course, there are normal missiles. Sadly, they still exist.\n\nThere are also several small secret areas, with large rainbow stars which give you a heap of bonus points. Most of these are concealed in walls that look slightly different or suspicious. There are 2 secret full-length levels as well.\n\nAt the moment, there is a lot less content here compared to the original ESJ. There is also no endless mode. But the new level editor means that you could potentially have endless levels to play, and if you like making your own levels, you will have even more fun.

So far I'm probably about half way through and it's rock hard. I'd say compared to the original game, it's a step up in terms of difficulty.\n\nI will say that there are some differences between both games, and the original seems to be a lot better in terms of its platforming. Groove City is a lot less smooth and fast, it doesn't move as constantly as the first game, perhaps due to the difficulty. Seems like it's far easier to get stuck on obstacles. On the other hand, it's a real challenge and for the most part, I feel it's pretty fair.\n\nThe gravity seems a little off in this game and as far as I've played, I haven't seen any powers (e.g. double jump or smash) which is a little disappointing. There is also a few parts that seem a little unfair, basically there are two of these 'chase' enemies on either side of a platform, very close to each other and you must jump between them and tap the jump button before you land to jump before they hit you. This seems to be completely random as to whether you make the jump or not. Even so, all obstacles I've encountered so far have been solved with enough practice.\n\nThe music is great as usual, amazing stuff, very cool to bounce to.\n\nI like that it does try to innovate and introduces mechanics not seen in the first game, for example the stars, secret rooms and alternate paths through some obstacles. The black stars that produce missiles are a pain but then, missiles are going to be a pain regardless, especially without the stomp ability.\n\nConsidering the extremely fair price and the enjoyment (and at times, frustration) it provides, it's definitely worth picking up.","September 28, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was a game I've played (almost) to full completion, and one that I will undoubtedly return to many times.  Groove City was such a disappointment by comparison. Simply put; the game is too short (as many are saying), the music doesn't sound as good as the first game, and...well I just didn't enjoy myself.  There's something big missing from this game as well: the abilities.  Something I had wished would come back was the smash.  I begged this game to give the smash back but I didn't even get a glimpse of it.  And in combination with how short this game is, it's too easy, making the game even shorter.  The only thing I even remotely enjoyed was the new enemy type; the black star, which was a somewhat clever kind of enemy.\n\nThis doesn't feel like a a sequel to Electronic Super Joy, this instead feels like a poorly done prequel.   I cannot give a recommendation for this game, it's inferior in every way to the first ESJ.  The first had my head bouncing up and down, covered in a dumb grin the entire game.  I couldn't get into Groove City no matter how much I wanted to; I just looked at my screen with a blank stare, wondering where the fun disappeared to in this disaster of a "sequel".","September 15, 2014","false","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bought this the day it came out. It is very challenging and if you haven't played the original, the quick jumps in difficulty can be quite jarring, to the point that the game is no longer enjoyable. However, if you have played the original, you will LOVE this. Expect lots of deaths. Beware the Black Stars. Don't be afraid to jump for a star that floats above nothingness, it might be a secret, or a shortcut.\n\nMy only compliant would be that it wasn't just a bit longer. The levels are very well made though, and I believe that the Quality makes up for how short it is. (especially if you die a lot) It was also a bit surprising that it wasn't a DLC for the original, but its only 5$ so I'm not complaining.","June 11, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Electronic Super Joy: Groove City is not.\n\nIt's basically more of the same - which is to say that it features tight, responsive controls, a brilliantly energetic soundtrack and a kooky sense of humour - except they've added in sections in which you have to jump JUST before you hit the ground. And when I say JUST before, I mean that the timing window is literally a fraction of a millisecond, otherwise it's back to the checkpoint with you. This would be only barely tolerable, were it not for the fact that you need to execute these jumps multiple times in a row. Never EVER before have I seen a timing window so utterly ridiculous. I am normally inclined to rise to the challenge of tough games but this is not an unduly tough game so much as it is an insane game mechanic amidst an otherwise reasonable challenge. This does not provide a cohesive sense of difficulty in the way that something like Dark Souls does, which accentuates the frustration when these appalling jumping sections occur. It's a pity that this one piece of awful, awful design had to spoil the other 99% of stuff which was just fine.","October 6, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They changed the formula of the whole game to a score-attack game instead of a platforming challenger, and in my opinion this ruined the fun. However, this probably appeals to more old-school gamers, so this might be for you. The main thing that killed the game for me, however, is how short this game was, and how limited your abilities were in this game. In the previous, you could 'smash' enemies or double-jump or fly for some levels, but in this one it's just jump and collect all the stars. I much prefered the other, origional game with it's focus on platforming challenges and extra abilities to break up what little monotony there was.","November 13, 2014","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay revolves around a very simple jumping mechanic that are generally used to platform and dodge things. You basically do the same in every level, only difference being the amount of things coming at you, and in a few levels you`ll have to hurry up. The game is also super short with only 13 levels. Its in fact so short that when I were done with the thirteen levels, I started looking around for a place to continue the game in a second part. In my first playthrough I finished the game in a good hour/hour and a half.\n\nAll in all its a very short game with basic, repetitive gameplay, along with good graphics and music. With such a small price tag I`d say the game is worth the money.\nIf you`d like a cheap platformer to kill some time with, this game is a good bet. Otherwise its a game you won`t mind skipping.\n\n*EDIT: Seems like this game isn`t very playable in 60 fps.

I wanted to love this game more than reality, but it fell far short of that.  The visuals are improved but tend to be repetitive at times. The soundtrack holds up the standard which is always a good thing. They added secret areas and new enemies. The good stops there. They took away everything that made the original so fun. The smash was removed. This resulted in some of the worst gameflow in a 2D platformer I have ever played when going straight from the original. The worst thing that somehow made it into the game is when you hit your head on a wall, you stick to it for a while. This even more interrupts the gameflow. It is harder, but in very cheap ways. The enemies just go faster and there are more of them. The controls are extremely unresponsive at points. It just felt like it was made cheaply and pushed to meat a deadline. It is short among all things. About 13 levels that only take time because the controls are unresponsive. It has the WORST hit boxes and level designs I have ever seen in a 2D platformer. 3/10","October 3, 2014","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're always getting in my damn way when I'm trying to get to a damn checkpoint! I mean seriously, why do there have to be so many rockets? You'd think okay, one, two, maybe even three rockets...but not like, more rockets than that! Anyway, aside from those minor annoyances, 'Groove City' is still a fun platformer that is worth playing through to the end.\n\nBut still, those damn rockets, I hate them so much! I go to jump onto that platform over there and boom, hit by a rocket. What a shocker! Granted, this game is incredibly short; thirteen levels to be precise, but the journey is still worth taking. For a low low price, that is. I mean honestly, you can beat this game in about an hour. Maybe even less if it weren't for those damn flying air missiles.\n\nAside from the rockets though, with the great soundtrack, the 'pope has a big wang' jokes, and the tight controls, this is a fantastic little platformer to lose your hair from due to rocket anxiety. Seriously, this game has some of the most obnoxious jumps that you will encounter on any platformer ever, so be warned.

Fantastic.\n\nIf you enjoy challenging platformers, you should absolute get this game (and the original Electronic Super Joy). It's difficult, but still manages to be accessible once you get the rhythm of the game down.\n\nThe soundtrack is phenomenal. It fits the game really well and I find myself listening to it at work on a regular basis. Because this is a game where you'll probably die a number of times, the made the right choice to just let the soundtrack play in the background rather than restarting if you fail or finish a level.\n\nIf you've ever wondered how raunchy a 2D platformer can be, the answer is very. Yeah, you and the Pope visit a futuristic techno strip club in this game. And just when you start to feel safe there, some guys start throwing shurikens.\n\nI like everything about this game.

The gameplay revolves around a very simple jumping mechanic that are generally used to platform and dodge things. You basically do the same in every level, only difference being the amount of things coming at you, and in a few levels you`ll have to hurry up. The game is also super short with only 13 levels. Its in fact so short that when I were done with the thirteen levels, I started looking around for a place to continue the game in a second part. In my first playthrough I finished the game in a good hour/hour and a half.\n\nAll in all its a very short game with basic, repetitive gameplay, along with good graphics and music. With such a small price tag I`d say the game is worth the money.\nIf you`d like a cheap platformer to kill some time with, this game is a good bet. Otherwise its a game you won`t mind skipping.\n\n*EDIT: Seems like this game isn`t very playable in 60 fps. Certain parts are nearly impossible unless your refresh rate is 30 fps.","April 29, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

ESJ was, and remains, one of the tightest platformers I've ever played, and challenging enough that I'm still going back to work on the bonus levels. That said... what happened?\n\nThis game is frustratingly short, and can only claim difficulty on par with the first game by the metric of dying in the same place a bunch. Most of this game is a breeze compared to even the earliest of ESJ levels, but you'll still die because this game is so floaty. The slam mechanic in the first game kept platforming quick and skillful, allowing you to get back to the action faster by trading speed for time to line up jumps. You were likely to die, sure, but if you didn't, you had precious seconds that weren't wasted falling. Now, there is no slam, and every drop feels too long. The other powerups seem to have disappeared, and the level mechanics of old are practically unused. A handful of sticky walls, a couple of irritatingly placed max-length jumps... nothing like some of the platforming challenges of ESJ.\n\nOf course, the game needs to feel long, because as I said, it's frustratingly short. 100% completion clocked me at 77 minutes, and that's mostly the time I spent trying to get Black Stars before I realized that they count whether you live or die. The rainbow stars are interesting, but ultimately pointless as well. Meanwhile, I have 13 hours and counting in ESJ, and I'm nowhere near 100%, just on the overall time achievements alone, much less beating the bonus levels.\n\nThe music is the saving grace, as good as ever. But honestly? If you played ESJ and want more, you're better off replaying the first game and maybe just layering this soundtrack over the top to make it feel slightly different.

After playing it, I can honestly say the only thing this game has going for it is the music.\n\nThe poor level design, frustrating jumps and the removal of the pound ability just adds unnessasary difficulty (at points) while absolutely killing any enjoyment that could've been had from this game.\n\nDon't pick up this piece of garbage even if it's on sale.\n\n2/10","December 29, 2014","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
