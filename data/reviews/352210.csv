There isn't an "endgame" to it, which fits this type of game very well, you just try to beat you and your friend's highscores. I got it a little cheaper, but i'd say it's worth the full $4 if you like time killers while waiting on whatever. Also, give the credits a view for some cell facts.","July 1, 2015","true","8.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

It's fairly casual as far as being able to hop in and play for a while without too much learning.  The graphics and sound are very polished and the gameplay has kept me interested.   4 Dollars is a fair price.","June 24, 2015","true","4.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Whatever. Little Hemorrhoid Donuts is a game where you rub two same colored one-eyed hockey pucks together to make them disappear. It has a wonderful art style and a motif that rivals Dr. Mario. It's also a one-handed, mouse only game, so if you're looking for something to do when you can't be bothered to get more than one hand involved, this could be the game for you.\n\nThere are three colors in total and any two differently colored cells that bump into each other will create another cell. Based on that alone, you would think you can just randomly throw the cells around and get a high score, but that's not the case. If a cell bumps into too many differently colored cells, it will die and you loose a lot of points. So kudos to the developer(s) for forcing the player to actually put some effort into it. A cell can also die if has been alive for too long. If it dies in this fashion, it will become a virus which will infect any cells that bump into it, and those cells will become viruses too. If too many viruses are on the screen, the game is over. It's a concept that is super easy to learn, but very difficult to master.\n\nAnd that's pretty much where the praise ends. What makes Little Cells so difficult to master is the fact you simply can't win. You WILL lose each level. Period. The longer each level goes on, the faster new cells die and become viruses. As more viruses fill the screen, the darker it becomes which makes it very difficult to tell what color each a cell is, and even if it's a cell at all and not a virus.\n\nThere is also no objective, other than try to rack up as many points as possible before your inevitable failure. WHEN you lose a level, all of those points are dumped into upgrades. You get the first upgrade pretty quickly. After that Little Fails immediately turns into a MASSIVE grindfest. I've only been able to get the first two upgrades, the second of which was just an extension of the first and seemed completely ♥♥♥♥ing useless. I'm not saying all upgrades are useless, I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case.\n\nWhat's really disappointing is it just seems like Little Smells is incomplete. It has a good enough gimmick going for it but not much is done with it. There's only one map, only one game mode, only one objective, only one reason to keep playing. The entire game is just one level you keep playing over and over and the only way to beat it is to quit and uninstall the game. There are tons of games with one very simple game mechanic, but they work with that mechanic to get the most out of it. Little Cells just gave up too soon.\n\nBut none of that is why I'm giving it a negative review. Nope. I'm giving Little Cells a negative review because I saw almost everything it had to offer in the first 5-10 minutes. I had to force myself to keep playing, at least long enough to get the second upgrade, and I was bored to death almost the entire time. I spent a dollar on it when it was on sale and I honestly still feel like I overpaid. Little Cells has potential to be so much more and I hope one day the developers will see that potential, too.","January 3","false","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While I don't think is a great PC title, do consider playing this on your mobile device as it is a much better fit there.","July 6, 2015","true","2.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

In other words, even if I click on a cell to move it, just as often as not, the cell will not move, as if the game refuses to register the hit. I've had to click a single cell multiple times to get it to register, and many times, it never does, only to turn into a virus.\nThe second reason is some of the sounds, at least to me, are VERY sad and depressing. Through the game, there's a sound that reminds me of a dog, or even a baby, crying, and this makes me sad. And game sounds basically NEVER make me sad. Only a few games, that I've ever even heard of, have sounds like this, and this game is very much one of them.\n\nNot to mention that at any time during a game, things could cascade and the game could end very quickly, with nothing that can be done to at least try to from this.\n\nMy suggestions:\n1) Get rid of, or replace the sad sounds with something not so sad.\n2) Have the cell under the mouse cursor shimmer some, before it's even clicked, simply by being under the cursor. That way you know what will happen when you click.\n3) Improve the mouse cursor hit detection.\n4) Add some more variety in levels, etc. You could vary the color of the cells as well.\n\n","January 5","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
