It's a simulator based on simulating one thing, controlling the PATH train. There actually is a career mode, but it's not in the sense of career mode most people are used to. It's called 'Shift Duty' in this case. You can play any time-table of which I'd assume was the PATH schedule back in that day with three different types of cars. The camera angles are limited but, hey, it's a simulator, you're suppose to be driving a train, not go ape-♥♥♥♥ wanting to view the doors open from the outside, you're suppose to be in the cab; plain and simple.\n\nI must admit though, the game is definitely not worth the $19.99 at this day in age. They do have other versions, not sure if released on Steam though, Vol 2 in Berlin and Vol 3 in London I believe. They also have a Vol 4 coming that would feature the (7) line in NYC.\n\nBy the way, I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro with no issues of crashing like other users are experiencing.\n\nPlain and simple, if you want a pure simulator operating a train and just doing that, go for it. If you want to only view the trains from exterior views and have fun watching doors open from the outside, this train simulator may not be for you.\n\nJust remember, this game came out in '09. Not '14.","November 9, 2014","true","2.2"," 32 of 35 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","32","35","0","1"

Which is a pretty sweet feature.\n\n\nI recommend World of Subway's 1 - The Path for newcomers to train simulation, remember the controls are hard but you can bind them to whatever key you want on your keyboard, so it can be a bit easy for you.","January 8, 2015","true","2.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Yes, it's quite old but the graphics are what I expected, but surprisingly good. I love the Manhattan backdrop (pity it isn't HD) but it does give you that immersion driving the train in the open.\n\nI was also happy I discovered at least partial XBox360 controller function, admittedly the analogue sticks and triggers don't work, but you can map the trains main functions to the buttons.\n\nYou will need to assign some of the keyboard commands, such as the announcements and you can switch to the mouse for the added look around, so basically for the price, and functionality and just charm I am happy with this little game.\n\nOne thing though, it's such a pity you cannot move the UI which just bunches itself in your view. Being able to move the sections within the screen would have been good, as I just turn them all off once I set the destination.\n\nThis game allows me to relax, it's small enough to do a few runs without losing interest, and I even crack a few smiles at the voice overs for the announcer who sounds like he has a rather nasty cold.\n\nYou can max out everything and even force FXAA from nVidia's CP for added look and feel.\nI hope the devs revisit New York and a big thanks to them for daring to develop a game as I guess a very small team with the C4 engine.\n\nI will definitely make the leap to WoS 4 (Line7) and look forward to more great innovative developments in the future.\n\nI did suffer pink/black graphic anomalies, but unchecking fullscreen seems to have fixed that, and as a note to anyone reading this, even with fullscreen unchecked and the game running in windowed mode, it's only the main GUI that is windowed and once you start a shift, or take a route, the gameplay is in fullscreen, albeit with the windows taskbar, which is forgivable.\n\nBig thumbs up.","April 9, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You can't open the train doors unless the camera view is in the driver's cabin, so you can't see the doors opening and closing, or passengers boarding.\n\nIt's a very basic sim, there's no career mode or any of the usual things you find in  games. It has an indie "pet project" feel about it for sure!\n\nIt might appeal to someone who is familiar with this actual line in real life. If you've lived in NY, this sim might be interesting, but even then it's still niche.\n\nTrain Simulator 2015 has an excellent feature where you can move the camera from the front to the back outside the train, and zoom in and out and around, and still maintain control of the train. World of Subways has nothing like that. TS 2015 is a lot more expensive though, so the comparison isn't entirely fair. But now you know what you're in for.\n","November 5, 2014","false","0.8"," 25 of 54 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","25","54","3","2"
