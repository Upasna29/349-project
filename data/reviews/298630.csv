"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xhuis/recommended/298630/","xhuis","Xhuis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xhuis/","77 products in account","Overview\nThe Escapists is a game about escaping prison. You play as one of the prisoners in a variety of different prisons. Despite its initial appearance, the game has an extreme level of depth and even the prison listed as Very Easy (Center Perks) is hard enough that I have yet to escape.\n\nSpeaking of escaping, there are many methods of doing so, but almost anything you do can be traced back to you by the guards. You can steal plastic knives from the cafeteria and cut the vent open in your cell - but they'll trace it to you. You can climb onto the roof - but you'll get sniped by the guards in the towers. You can dig a tunnel towards the outer fence - but you might leave dirt lying around and the warden will have the hole caved in.\n\nYou can perform favors for other prisoners to get money, which can be used to buy things from other prisoners. Favors might involve beating down another inmate or taking an item. Many items are illegal (red name) and you will be sent to solitary confinement if you are found with one or one is found in your desk during a cell search.\n\nLife in The Escapists is all about keeping the guards off of you, and to do that, you must follow prison routine. In the morning is roll call - you must attend this or the entire prison will be put into lockdown. You also have a job that you must do. The following is the routine on the first prison, Center Perks:\n\nMorning Roll Call\nBreakfast\nFree Time\nLunch\nWork, or Leisure if unemployed\nExercise\nShowers\nEvening Meal\nEvening Free Time\nEvening Roll Call\nLights Out\nYou also have skills that can be used. Speed determines your attack speed, strength your attack damage, and intellect is your crafting smarts. You find crafting recipes through notes you can buy (or steal from others), and these stats can be raised in different ways but degrade over time.\n\nBut this review is getting long, and I don't want to explain every aspect of this game, so let me list off some pros and cons.\n\nPros\nVery in-depth; great variety of items\nLarge variety; many ways to escape\nFlavorful; lots of chatting and makes the prison seem real\nComplete feeling; feels like a full game even in early access\nCons\nBuggy; sometimes there are bugs, like guards shouting at you to get to work while you are at work or people you can't interact with whatsover, i.e. infirmary staff or the warden\nSolitary; if something is traced to you, you go into solitary regardless of current position or state - basically instant, with no opportunity to escape it\nUnclear; the game only has a vague tutorial and you must learn on your own, which CAN be fun\nLet me tell you a story.\nI was a prisoner at the first prison. During the first three days, I made quite a hideout. I made paper mache out of toilet paper and super glue, which I made a fake vent cover out of so I could freely climb up and down the vents without fear of leaving it open. I had a massive storage of illegal supplies, a bludgeoning weapon made out of a sock with soap inside of it, and an outfit with metal plates beneath the cloth. Most of the inmates liked me, and I constantly went around bruising people for pay/\n\nOne night, I decided to explore the vents more. I left a dummy made with pillows under the covers of my bed to fool the guards into thinking I was asleep. WIth some floss, I cut through slats in the system and saw a stash on the other side of a vent which I could not bypass. I figured I could cut through the vent and go across.\n\nWrong.\n\nI fell into the infirmary office. The door was locked, and I hadn't had the foresight to make a key from a mold. In other words, I was trapped, and the infirmary staff always lock the door when they came in. I searched all night for a way through the vent, started chipping through the walls with a screwdriver (which broke), and as the sun rose I resigned to my fate and hid in the supply closet. After morning roll call, the prison went on lockdown. As the confused inmates reported to their cells, I received a notice that the military was on their way to the prison.\n\nAfter a minute and a half, I was found and thrown into solitary.\n\nFinal Score\nVery in-depth, great fun, and feels complete though in early access. However, it has some standing flaws and errors which interfere with gameplay.\n\nI rate The Escapists 8/10.\n\nJune 6, 2015 update: I still recommend this game. There are a few DLCs which I haven't got around to playing (like the Alcatraz DLC) and it's still quite enjoyable. I'm personally burned out on it, though, and it doesn't offer much outside of the same thing over and over for its price. Wait until it's on sale and it's great value - otherwise, I would skip it.","December 22, 2014","true","17.4"," 913 of 949 people (96%) found this review helpful 115 people found this review funny","96","913","949","115","19"

I'm playing with press access. No matter what route you decide to take, a man of the block prisoner or an educate one, your objective is always the same, escape. There's no wandering for 30 years. Don't let the art style fool you, it is light-hearted but it's challenging as heck. Just like in reality you have to carefully make all your moves and stick to the plan. If something fails you're off to the solitaire, items confiscated and your plan ruined. Fortunately you can load saved games.\n\nPros\n- crafting items, and there's a lot of choices\n- save games when you return to the cell at the end of the day\n- you just don't run out of things to do, the game encourages you to keep moving\n- it's damn challenging\n- play it your own way\n- it's damn funny watching all the incidents during the day, prisoners will interact with each other\n\nCons\n- the music is repetitive, I had to turn it off and pick my playlist\n- no customization, I would like to customize my character other than the name","June 20, 2014","true","189.1"," 660 of 724 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","660","724","0","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odatruh_/recommended/298630/","Odatruh_","Odatruh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Odatruh_/","79 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAh, The Escapists. Such a great game. Where do I start? Let's just do the old pro's and con's.\nPros:\n+AMAZING gameplay.\n"Simple" objective (escape the prison) and there are sidequests that you can do for your fellow prisoners.\n+Character Deveopment.\nOk, this might sound weird, but this game actually has its own way of a character development. Let's say that you do some sidequests and give away items or cash, then the prisoner(s) that you gave away items to or did sidequests for will have a better opinion on you. That's actually very important. If the prisoners rate you a good opinion (50+), then they will never attack you, give you more money for quests, and give you information when talked to. If the player recieves a bad opinion, then the prisoners that view you that way will attack you, say really useless or mean stuff to you, and give you less money for sidequests. Wait, one more thing, you can buy things from prisoners, and if they like you, then you get a discount. If not, more money. Also, there are 3 skills that your character can learn. Intellect, strength, and speed. Intellect allows you to become more smart at get higher paying jobs. Strength determines how much damage you can take before passing out, and how much damage you can deal. Speed is, well, how fast you can move. (striker311111)\n+Realism...kinda\nThis game for the most part is somewhat realistic. You're in a prison, and you have to escape. You scout around the prison and see what there is to be seen. However, time goes by really quickly (one hour in the game feels like 1 or 2 minutes). Oh yeah, and you can get money in prison. How neat is that?\n+Different prisons\nThere are different prisons, each one being more easy or more difficult  than the others. I'm telling you, after you beat the easiest prison, you go to another one, it's gonna be really really difficult. The two problems is that the easiest prison gives a bad impression to the future ones, and that the harder ones are impossible if you DON'T use a guide. (There you go SweetJesus)\n\nCons:\n-Navigation\nSince you're in a prison, this should be pretty obvious, but still. I have to warn you, you get so little time to move around and explore, that this game is a ton harder than it should be. You try to escape, but you see a guard in a place that you never knew about and then you get sniped and lose all of your stuff. I know it's realistic, but the player should be able to explore more of the prison.\n-Items\nNow, I'm only talking about hard to get items. You somehow manage to knock out a guard, and steal his key. You better escape within a short amount of time, 'cause he's gonna wake up soon and you'll get taken in again. Now, there are different keys. Each one opening a specific amount of doors. And you have no idea how to get the keys, so those items that you see in the isolated hallway is gonna be impossible to get to, and that weird room with the generator is a no-no.\n-Time\nOne hour in this game literaly feels like a minute. I know you're not supposed to play a game for 12 hours straight, but it all feels so fast. So much you have to do in so little time, that I think it's a little stressful and intense for players who are new to this game.\n-The first prison (easiest)\nOk, this is kind of a weird con. But I think it's appropriate that I place this here. The very first prison, the easiest one, gives a terrible impression on how future prisons will be. You do all of this work to escape, only to figure out it's really really easy. You expect the next one to be slightly harder, but no. The next prison after that is very, very hard. I still have a lot of trouble to escape it. The first prison should give the player more of a challenge. All you really gotta do is lure a guard near a door, knock him out, steal his key and go. The next prison, I didn't even know how to escape it for a long while.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty neat game. Not bad at all, only I would recommend looking up a beginners guide first to get an idea of things rather than just charging in. I rate this game a 7/10. The replay value is amazing, the concept is really nice, but there are some things that could make this game a little better.\nI hope this review helps.","November 29, 2014","true","16.2"," 343 of 383 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","343","383","5","7"

I'll say first that I've done two years behind bars in the U.S. and almost four in a community corrections facility.  This game immediately started a mild and pleasant sympathetic nervous response (i.e. fight or flight/adrenaline/epinephrine) because of the very simplified, yet somewhat accurate representation of incarcerated life, with its rigorous, paramilitary lifestyle.  I was immediately reminded of the intense cleaning rituals, endless card games, terrible smells, awful food, and the overall lack of privacy and respect from guards and other inmates.

It puts you in one of numerous prisons with the simple goal of escaping. But it isn’t as easy as you think, the point of a prison is to keep you in your place, which is what this game does.\n\nYou get the choice of one of numerous characters who you can rename, a prison, and the option to name your prisoners if you had a friend you wanted to be with during your life sentence. When it comes to content the game is incredible, there are many different items you can get hold of from soap to post cards. That’s not even all, you can combine items to make more stuff to help you escape; paper mache for fake walls, nunchucks for attacking, key molds, Dummies, glass shanks, fake grates, posters, grappling hooks and so much more!\n\nThis game requires lots of planning, you can’t just beat up a guard, take his keys and leave. You need to spend some time exercising to get strong, you need key molds to keep keys or else you get time in solitary, there are guard patrols everywhere and even clogging the toilet with dirt from the hole you’ve been digging. You need to plan how you’re going to escape and balance you actual escape attempt with the prison timetable; eating, sleeping, free time, work and roll call. If you don’t fill your work’s quota then you get fired, complete the quota though and you get money to bribe other prisoners or buy stuff from them.\n\nThe actual gameplay itself is really well done, everything is quite solid and the game is most definitely playable. You can choose from many ways to escape, through the vents, underground, through the front door or even starting a riot. The graphics is designed to look 8-bit, a nice look for many games that is also fairly easy to make. The audio in the game is very well made, and if you like the music playing in the background you can get the music from the game’s steam folder.\n\nIf you enjoy playing games that require work and planning for you to play and succeed then this is the game for you. I rate this 10/10 in its current Early Access state, it’s a solid game worth the cost to buy it. When it leaves Early Access I don’t think there’s a rating system high enough to grade it… or at least that’s what I think will happen when it leaves Early Access anyway.","January 6, 2015","true","32.9"," 140 of 144 people (97%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","97","140","144","13","2"

I saw it on Steam just a few days after it'd come out for Early Access (20th of August) and I thought it looked really cool. I bought it and wow... My brain just exploded with delight.\n\nIf you've ever played Prison Architect, like me, you'll sorta understand how to play this game. But of course you're not building the prison this time, you're ESCAPING IT.\nIt has a lot of cool mechanics already implemented into it. I won't give you any hints on escaping except you can use screwdrivers on vents.\n\nYou can even take your clothes off...\n\nGuards beat you up for it...\n\nBut there are a few bugs:\n\nI know I have a bad computer, but this is a Pixelated-Art-Style-Kind-Of-Thing game. Framerate is a bit of an issue for me.\nThe guard AI can be a bit annoying aswell. Only a bit. Sometimes, when doing Morning Rollcalls, they'll have a lockdown because I didn't get there within five seconds. Then I have all my illegal items taken ;-;\n\nAll in all, this game is worth it. DayZ has bugs, but everyone loves it. Minecraft has bugs, but it has grown to be one of the most "Let's Play"ed games out there. I really think if you like the idea of this game and it's style, you should get it.\n\nIts price will go up later too. Do you really want that regret?","August 26, 2014","true","6.0"," 175 of 196 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","175","196","9","8"

Escape. Easy huh? No. Not even close to easy. I have had so far 13 hours of gameplay and have not yet come even close to having the beggings of an escape plan.... And I'm on the very "easy" map. Though extreemly chalenging it is a extreemly fun and addicting game, you have to follow the daily prison routine. 1. Morning rollcall. 2. Breakfast. 3. Morning free time. 4. Work. 5. Workout. 6. Showers. 7. Lunch. 8. Evening free time. 9. Evening rollcall. 10. Lights out. While sticking to this routine you must find the time to gather recorses, Make friends, make tools, defend yourself from guards and other prisoners and put together and make your escape. You can do little jobs for your fellow inmates doing things from finding a pack of mints to shanking a guard. To escape you can climb through vents. Dig under your cell, Even mine through your cell wall with a plastic fork! All in all it is a great game. Though it is early acsess with only 3 or 4 maps trust me.... You will only have just completed the first by the time this game is completed. Best £7 I have ever spent. 10/10 game and I would honestly suggest to anyone. For all you PC gamers check it out on steam. Watch the videos and look at pics. If your up for it buy it! You will really enjoy the game.","October 30, 2014","true","36.8"," 106 of 113 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","106","113","0","0"

YEAH I DO!\n\nThe Escapists is a game where you are thrown into prison. You must escape the prison, and believe me, that's not easy.\nNow, I'm going to be honest and give my pros and cons:\n~Updated Review~\n\nPros:\n- Lots of prisons, and cheap extra prison DLC.\n- Devs listen to us (community)\n- Amazing art style.\n- Challenging, you have to be smart to escape, as it isn't easy.\n- Lots of items and tons of item combos.\n- Lots of favorites for inmates.\n- Map editor + submission to workshop.\n- A semi-realistic prison feel.\n- Soundtrack is great! There are new songs during free periods.\n- Inmates speeches are pretty funny. (personal pro for me)\n- Multiple ways to escape. (Ex: first prison has about 3 (+) ways to escape!)\n- Custom inmate names, and choosable skins.\n\nCons:\n- Lots of waiting, and can get very boring if you're not patient.\n- Cops / guards catch you easily. This makes a challenge, though!\n- Gets repetitive once in a while, but DLC makes up for it.\n-\n\nSo, if you like prison games and have a lot of patience, then this is for you. My old review can be seen below, and I decided to update it as the game has updated a lot since then.\n\nFinal Score: 8.5/10\n\n~Old Review~\n\nPros:\n- Great art style. (32 bit?)\n- Soundtrack is great. Every prison has their own free time song that plays.\n- Challenging.\n- Tons of items.\n- Multiple, and I mean multiple escape routes. The first prison has over 3 escape routes!\n- Favors are really easy to do.\n- Inmates' speeches are pretty darn funny.\n- Developers actually listen to us (the community)\n- Each prison offers new items and layouts, and gets tougher each time.\n- Map Editor!\n- Has a realistic prison theme.\n\nCons:\n- None, go buy the game! (If you haven't.)\n\nThat's my short review.","April 19, 2015","true","46.1"," 127 of 142 people (89%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","89","127","142","16","4"

So when i first saw this game i was thinking "Oh wow this is kinda neat, i might get it" so i looked up some gameplay videos to see how good it would be, and i was blown away, now i reccomend you watch Lets Play's and other gameplay videos if you get this because if you don't, you won't escape the first prison, there are so many things to keep in check and so many things to do, i just highly reccomend it, so now on to the review portion...\n\nGameplay - The gameplay is very fun, for those of you who need to know specificly what the game is, its basically a prison escape sim, your set down in a prison, you have to scout out where to escape and how, get the tools for it, get the stats (Strength, intellect and Speed) and wait for the moment to strike, now to be more specific, in order to escape there are three main way you have to use in order to escape (Most of the time) you go low (Digging) you go high (roof tops) and right through the center (Breaking walls and cutting fences) so for example with digging, you can use easily broken plastic spoons from the canteen, a trowel you find on fellow inmates, or a shovel you made, if the guards see the tunnel the trace it back to you and get your stuff taken away, so cover it up, and you also need wooden braces to keep the tunnel from collapsing, now the center, in order to get through the walls you need 3 types of items, a plastic easily broken fork from the canteen, a crowbar, or a pickaxe, once again if the guards see a broken wall they WILL catch you and take away your stuff so you have to make a fake wall block, or get a poster to cover it, and finally the roof, to get to the roof you need to get to a ladder and to get to a ladder you need to break a wall, so in the roof you need rope to get to every where, if the snipers see you on the roof they shoot you, if they see you on the roof with a guard outfit, you have limited time to do your stuff before they recognise your not a guard, but if its night the snipers are gone. Overall i rate the gameplay a 9.5/10\n\nMusic - The music is very well composed 8-bit style music, not much to be said, overall its an 8/10\n\nProgramming Bugs - Theres just about no glitches in this game, overall i found about... four? and none game breaking, permanent or effecting gameplay. i rate it a 10/10\n\nCommunity - Now every great game isnt what it is without a community pointing out bugs and what it should have in it, and this community is full of smart innovative people, thanks to them we can have a prison editor and multiplayer some time in the future, they also love to point out bugs and glitches. i rate it a 10/10\n\nFinal Thoughts - When i got this game i just couldnt stop playing it, the overall score is 9.25/10","February 13, 2015","true","74.0"," 85 of 87 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","85","87","5","5"

Then I learned about jobs, storing items in a vent, prison takeovers, wrapping people in a rope so you can steal their job, and things like that!\n\nI think something that should be added is more abilities for NPCs. As of now, if an NPC has contraband in their desk, and they are called for a cell search, nothing happens.

Noticing instantly that this was some sort of prison simulator, of which i am very fond of, i clicked it and instantly loved it. Not having any money at the time i desperatly searched for ways to get this game for the following days, finally while looking through my inventory i noticed a $ 10 CSGO weapon skin and proceded to sell it without hesitation. I purchased the game and quickly downloaded it (Very quickly) and began to play.\n\nI was hooked.\n\nIt was something i had wanted for a while but could never find, a prison escape simulator, where all the knowledge i had mustered from watching prison movies came in handy. Shortly after starting i grabbed some plastic spoons and started digging, i hung some sheets over the cell bars to stay concealed, and within a few nights, i had been sent to solitary when the guards discovered my uncovered hole.\n\nSo.\n\nI started again.\n\nAfter an hour of seemingly doing the same thing again and again i still wasn't bored and found new features at every turn.\n\nI love the pixelated graphics, the game gives off a light vibe but it is very hard.\n\nAlso the new POW camp prison is awesome and i have put 3 hours into it already.\n\nWith the constant updates and the way the devs listen to our ideas this game is definatly worth the money.\n\nI won't give it a rating yet but this game certainly has my attention.\n","October 19, 2014","true","6.4"," 103 of 128 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","103","128","0","0"

However I must say when I was escaping prison number 2 the guards always found out that, on the night I was planning to leave, I was busy digging a tunnel. probably because of Steve. that Guard lover always warned the gaurds in the middle of the night while he was pretending to sleep.

The game is all about trying to escape a prison. While that might seem like a simple task (because it's a videogame, not real life), it's actually quite challenging. The game has a surprisingly deep strategy behind it, as you have to plan many things while maintaining a varying prison schedule. It has many tense moments that grasp the player into a deep concentration and fills him/her with excitement and anxiety that only this kind of game can produce. The developers have also confirmed a level editor where you can create your own prisons and support for multiplayer. However, one should, if he/she plays the game blindly, notice the brutal learning curve, as this game can barely be played without help from a video or a wiki. But, that doesn't stop me from recommending this game to one of my peers.  If you can, buy it now, and you'll see how it's definitely worth the money.","February 16, 2015","true","28.4"," 59 of 65 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","59","65","7","0"

Great tutorial, good music, fun and extremely immersive gameplay.\nAccessible as heck, but with depth.\n\n======================================\nPros+UI: Great layout, simple, intuitive.\n+Graphics: Who doesn't love some nice pixel art? Great light/shade/colors.\n+Sound: A bit chunky, but good, retro, immersive.\n+Gameplay: One of the most immersive games I've played\n\nCons-None so far!\n\nNeutral+/- Settings: Only so many, and sliders can't be dragged! Nbd for me.\n\n======================================\nSo The Escapists is essentially a time management/prison lifestyle sim. This game is a delight! The graphics are very good, and serve their purpose well. Areas are distinct, everything has light, shadow, and a suitable color. The pixel art is very well done. The sprites are cute, and some of them realistic for their size. Also, every object is distinct. The UI is 100% serviceable, with distinct colors and objects of its own, and just the right amount of polish.\n\nThe tutorial, also, is amazing. It's quick, easy, and gives you a nice step by step introduction to the world with a step by step instructionset, without spoiling the deeper elements to the game such as crafting recipes. The gameplay is equally as accessible, everything being a simple tap, right click, or left click away...and maybe a few alternating keys. You can customize the controls, but I'm not sure why you'd ever need to! It makes me think of the Sims, except you are playing the character, and you choose what to do. There is an ASTONISHING amount of freedom in gameplay. You can blend in, you can sneak off, you can build your stats, or trade contraband with the inmates. Start fights. Steal. Do favors, or EVEN your job! The list goes on!! But your primary goal is of course to escape, and on that note, the AI is responsive, so you better be ready. I've encountered no bugs so far.\n\nThe music is serviceable, and that's about it. It isn't intrusive, it isn't bad, but it isn't amazing. It works for the setting and I definitely like it, but I don't completely love it. The sound effects are basic and perhaps slightly jarring at times.\n\nThe only issues I've had with the game are the lack of resolution settings, and some desks not wanting to leave my arms easily. The RNG can create some unforgiving wait times, but it also makes things a bit intense and there's a lot of anticipation. This game has actually made me feel anxious, and gotten my heart beating at times!\n\nThere are all kind of custom maps the community has made, which can offer a unique flavor or new twist or challenge, which is nice. On a related final note, the difficulty is present, with the game leaving it up to you how you want to escape, as well as how to do some of the things required to do just that, but once you figure it out, the prisons difficulty scales quite nicely.\n\nAll in all, I've never so quickly felt so at home in a game.\n\nNow if only I could find that dental floss... ;)\n\n======================================\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","June 17, 2015","true","6.3"," 89 of 121 people (74%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","74","89","121","12","12"

The "levels" are the prisons.\n\nI like the old-school pixel graphics. The GUI is incredibly fast and responsive. Controlling the little guy that tries to escape is a fun challenge. I like how you have to think out a plan and can bide your time to execute it. The independent lives of the other inmates is fun, and they can also give you missions and objects to use.\n\nThe mouse-clicking for moving objects can be a bit finnicky, I would prefer the option of using the keyboard for everything. Also knowing which things can be crafted into what (like a bar of soap + sock = a weapon) could be more discoverable in-game.\n\nIt's a pretty polished and fun game.","May 22","true","1.0"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","43","48","3","1"

Once you have opened the game you get the usual intro of about 3 logos or so, real fast, then you're on to the main menu. Start a new file, pick a prisoner, name that prisoner (optional, default names are provided), then, just like a snap of the fingers, you're in prison for whatever reason. You have one main goal: escape. You have many ways to escape the prison/camp, but each prison/camp varies in difficulty. You can tunnel out most prisons, cut through them, and. if so you wish, take some nunchaku (NunChucks), knock out every guard and just walk out the place.\nThere is more to the game than meets the eye. Under the nostalgic 16-bit graphics, you have a complicated, yet easily understandable game. There are very many crafting recipes, and yes, I know what you are thinking, "Oh no, another clone trying to rip off the ol' MineCraft crafting mechanic..." But that is not how the crafting works. Sure, you collect items to make something new, but you're not making furnaces or desks, or even beds. You are making your means of escape. After you have made your contraband through the detectors, to your room, or wherever, and make your items, you have to hide them. Cell shakedowns are very common and happen on parameters I'm not sure on yet. Once you have everything you need, its time to move. You have to have impeccable timing skills to escape properly without detection. It took me forever to escape my first prison and that happened only a few days ago. I tried doing it the difficult way, and that only messes you up further.\nThere are relationships between the prisoners (friendship wise), and you need some of them to like you, too. Especially your roommate if you have one.\nLet's talk graphics. They're simple, yet elegant, and you can tell what the group of pixels are supposed to be. That is how you do 16-Bit graphics, my PC Master Racers.\nI whole-heartedly recommend this game. Now, on to the original review!\n"I vote this game 10/10.

And it isn't really a "bad" game. It just has too many issues for me to reccomend it. If there were a "meh" option I'd pick it. I have two major issues with the game.\n\nOne being you aren't given a lot of important information. Metal Detectors can find everything on you that you DON'T wear. You can have nunchuks and a metal plated uniform and it won't detect it. But if you have a nail file in your pocket you instantly go to solitary. Lots of weird recipes where you might have an idea of something CLOSE to what you can do, or maybe you have part of the items you need, but you won't ever know unless you get luck finding the recipe note.\n\nAnd two, RNG is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I spent roughly 4 days in the 2nd prison with three key moulds. I had gotten nunchuks and made metal plated prisoner armor. I had accumulated a bit over 150 dollars and I spent four whole days just stuck. I needed to make a key to progress, and I was missing a lighter. I searched EVERY inmate's desk multiple times every day. I checked every inmate store. This continued on and on. Eventually I just pulled a chuck norris and attempted to beat down all the guards. Which did barely work. But felt very unsatisfying.\n\nI don't mind slow progression as long as I can make actual progression. But when I'm stuck sitting doing nothing for days in game because I am not getting an item I need the enjoyment just becomes massive frustration.\n\nThere's also some kind of irritating small things, like how if a vent if missing from the roof of your room a guard will INSTANTLY notice if he walks by. I'm not sure how many guards stare at ceilings, but it seems a bit silly. Not to mention you can't seem to frame other inmates which is VERY disappointing. It's basically flavor text. You can be told they are about to search the room of so and so, and throw a glass shiv in his desk, but the guards will not give a ♥♥♥♥. They only throw you into solitary.\n\nThe game has a lot of great ideas and is close to what I want, but there are some serious underlying flaws in the game. I'm not sure I'll come back, very disappointing.","January 5","false","3.6"," 112 of 163 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","112","163","8","7"

Ironically for a game about being imprisoned, this game provides true freedom;  Freedom to piece together your own unique plan of escape.\n\nThe game is quite robust in terms of replayability, very stable (no crashes or bugs so far in my playthroughs), and requires very little by way of system resources.  It will, however, tax your brain, your wit, and your reflexes, in the best way.","March 6, 2015","true","5.6"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","32","34","9","0"

I have a dual core cpu that runs at 1.65 Ghz no where near the recomended 2.4 Ghz and it runs flawless for me. This game could probably be ran on a a single core processor.\n\nIf you like building prisons in the amazing Prison Architecht you will love this  game! It might look like a childish/retro 8-bit game, but think again. In this game you are forced to use your brain to the brink of it's processing power. Along with escaping you have to make it to roll call's 3 times a day, eat 3 times a day, exercise 1 time a day, shower 2 times a day, and work once a day if you have a job. If you do not manage your time wisely and are able to keep with the schedule you will not escape.\n\nThere are more ways to escape then I can count. You can dig, use the vents and roof, cut through fences, break through walls, steal keys and more. You usually have to use multiple different things out of those to be able to espcape.  There are tons of items also that you can craft to help you escape. Along with these items you can only craft them if you have a high enough intellect and in order to get and keep it up you have to work out your mind each day.\n\nYou have to be super sneaky or the guards will catch you off guard and throw you into solitary. If you get thrown into solitary they will search all your stuff and take any contraband and you will have to start over which at times comletely screws you up and can be esier to start over.\n\nThis game is full of stuff to do and has hours upon hours of gameplay and it's only in early access! I just barely escaped for the first time! It took me 15 hours! This game is complex and amazingly hard which gives it that super fun experience and the amazing feeling of accomplishment when you finaly escape!\n\nI reccomend this game to anyone and say it is 100% worth the price!

Well, hopefully nobody finds contraband in your desk now, because if they do it's a one-way-ticket to solitary without you being able to do anything against that. You get a message and bam. Try again. Stole a key from a guard? Oh yeah. As soon as they wake up they know it was you and they also instantly know where you are. To the solitary!\n\nI also just dug a tunnel. Over 50 tiles. Took me more than 3 ingame weeks and required ♥♥♥♥ ton of duct tape. My only problem was the electrical fence. So I dug to the generator room. counted tiles. I wait for the night, want to dig up to shut down the generator. But nope: As soon as my hole is open I get a message that a tower guard spotted it and that I have to go to solitary. Yeah. Thanks. Do they have X-Ray vision and are able to look into ♥♥♥♥ing buildings?\n\nStuff like this really ruins the game, as it really restricts you in what you can do and it doesn't even make any sense the way they did that. Why not let the guards order a shakedown when they notice a key is missing? Search every cell and prisoner. This would at least give you some time to maybe frame another prisoner for stealing it or give you the last few seconds you need to escape. And it would be more realistic and less annoying. The way it is it feels more like an adventure with the solution predetermined by the developers. If I want to dig a 100 tile tunnel to escape you should at least honor that I did that instead of throwing me into solitary with a ♥♥♥♥ing message.","February 23, 2015","false","20.6"," 197 of 315 people (63%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","63","197","315","29","20"

Let me just say that this game is awesome! The attention to detail is great and you can get lost playing this game for hours. It's challenging but not frustrating. I haven't even escaped from the prison currently in the game but I still can't wait until they add more. The only things I don't like about the game is that the AI prisoners walk around too fast so it's hard to click on them and they just mindlessly walk around (unless they have a job). During leisure time I'd like to see the AI go to their cell to take a nap, go to the library to read, etc. Other than that, this game is awesome.

Each day has a schedule which you will need to follow including rollcalls, mealtimes, worktime and freetime in order to keep the guards off your back. Whilst following the daily schedules you have the ability to do favours for other inmates earning money and boosting their opinion of you, workout or read to increase your skills (making you a more proficient fighter or able to apply for better jobs and craft better items), or plan your escape. You can choose to keep a low profile and gather the items you need for your escape or you can beat the crap out of everyone who looks at you funny and spend half your game in the infirmary,\nThe game already has a variety of features such as crafting, basic skill building, various jobs, legal and contraband items, fatigue levels and 'friendship' levels with other inmates. There seems to be various different way to escape and in the 4 hours i've played i've not been bored once which is always a good sign for an Early Access game.\n\nI think the game is worth the small price tag, and even if you don't plan on buying it yet, 100% keep your eye on it, its truly a game with great potential.","August 21, 2014","true","13.3"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","2"

The many different items you can acquire(or steal)allow you to escape in your own way. The increasingly difficult prisons will make sure you always have a challenge(even the "easy" prison will give you a hard time if not done correctly). And with a built-in map editor, you can create your own prisons, and share them on the Steam Workshop. You can also download other people's prisons to play at any time, so that you never run out of prisons to play.

But overall it is tense and so far i havn't figured out a way to escape and you can in see my time above (i will edit when i have beat and at what time) i havn't been able to leave the easiest prison which is the only one but i expect will add more as they have said so in the description. so far this game is exactly what i have expected of it and so far ive loved every secound! edit: they have now added a 4th job within the first couple of weeks which i hope is a sighn of the devs reliability to continue the escapists so i can enjoy this game further.\n\nedit: More prisons have been added aswell as a tab for custom prisons (steam workshop lets hope) meaning the replayability has just sky rocketed. *Tiny spoilers* Some things seem to be a bit harsh for example i filed a vent out in someone elses cell and it was unnoticed for 3 days then all of a suddone it was noticed linked to me i was in solitary and all contraband was taken away, i also dislike how you are instantly caught if you are in a vent or underground so there is noway avoid it (i would like to think this is just because certain elements havn't yet been added like gards underground or in vents). still believe it's worth the money and a written tutorial (instructions) have been added and i still havn't escaped.

Hours of fun to be had.\n\nEach prison appears to have a well defined strategy, although alternative methods can be carried out (e.g. beating up all of the prison guards, molding gate keys., etc) Different prisons have a different routine to follow and it is vital that you get to know this routine in order to plan your escape successful. For example, a 10am rollcall must be attended to ensure the guards don't get suspicious that you're upto no good.\n\nClearly a lot of thought went into the crafting system. Items can be combined to make new ones that you will need in order to escape from the prison of choice.\n\nI completely love the whole 8-bit vibe that The Escapists has going on. Old school graphics and old school sound effects help set the tone very well.\n\nThe only bug I've personally found in this game is when getting my intellect to 100 by browsing the internet at the computer in the first prison, the achievement did not unlock for me.  I did get the chance to mention this to Chris, so I'm hoping this will get sorted out soon, if it hasnt been addressed already.\n\nAll in all, buy this game if you like challenging, stategic thinking and are looking for a game that will keep you engrossed for ages!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neuronwake/recommended/298630/","Neuronwake","Neuronwake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Neuronwake/","157 products in account","Dammit, I bought another game that was in early access and I feel screwed. I bought it after the "Full Release" though, so why do I feel screwed? Because this game does not feel like it should have been moved to "Full Release" yet.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I love the idea of it and the degree of freedom it gives in terms of strategies you can come up with. I love the 8-bit semi-goofy guards, inmates, and general prison life. I love the interactions with your peers in crime and the routines of the day that you can end up using to your advantage. I love what they've done with it so far -- and while that is something okay to say about an early access game, it is not okay to say about a Full Release.\n\nYou see, none of those things feel fully fleshed out. Sure the NPCs have funny dialogue, but by 2-3 in-game days of play, you've heard it all. Oh, someone ate all the cream custards again? Or stole the warden's toupee? Shouldn't he have that glued on by now? And the amount of times your hear about an inmate's wife leaving them or dying is just not possible in a monogamistic society.\nYou can do favors for your fellow inmates but these are a selection of 3 different types of "Quests" with random targets: you're either going to find them an item, distract the guards at a specific time, or beat up someone they don't like. They get pretty repetitive shortly, and sometimes they play out ridiculously -- you beat someone up, notice they have a quest item on them for a quest that they gave you, take it from them, and then give it back to them to complete the quest. Some people think that's quirky and funny but to me it's an incomplete system. Why can I give someone their own pillow and complete a quest for them? And it would be cool to see other quest types, too, like an inmate asking you to plant evidence in another inmate's cell, or have them invite you to their escape attempts or vice-versa.\n\nOne of the biggest things that seems unfinished are the so-called "Instabusts". When you break a vent, dig a hole, steal a guard's key or do anything else "escapy", even when no guard is in sight or would otherwise know, you are almost intantly discovered unless you do something to cover it up. It makes sense to make a fake vent cover so a guard strolling by later won't notice anything suspicious, but they notice RIGHT AWAY, relying only on their psychic guard powers. They know it was you whether you're breaking a vent in the bathroom or have dug a hole in another inmate's cell, too. Sneakiness is out the window. Plus, the second that they detect you, you're thrown into solitary. They don't start sweeping the cells or climbing into the vents, you're just caught. With a note from the Warden saying "Nice Try", of course.\nI can practically hear a meeting between the developers where one of them said, "And then we'll have the guards start a search or line up everybody for inspection," but they just never implemented it. It's a game mechanic where something more should happen but doesn't, and it feels incomplete.\n\nWhen you put all these things together, you realize that the game's promise of "Think up your Own Escape Plan" doesn't really let you do all the strategies you may come up with. Want to conspire with other inmates to set up distractions or get supplies for you? Can't. Want to go to a seldom-patrolled part of the prison and climb into the vents? The guards will know anyway. Can you even make a key out of soap, one of the most used prison-break tropes? Nope.\n\nEven as I write this, I worry I'm being too hard on this game. It's not like any of these things make it unplayable or broken. It just doesn't feel like a Full Release. In the time I played I kept thinking of mechanics and details that it would be cool for the dev team to add, but it's not in Early Access anymore. The game is even fun to play for a while, and this review is sooooo close to a Recommended. But, in the end, the game doesn't seem to have enough polish to make that fun varied or lasting. They should have finished it first.","February 27, 2015","false","12.3"," 159 of 275 people (58%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","58","159","275","13","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ossafkcin/recommended/298630/","ossafkcin","kciN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ossafkcin/","387 products in account","I really wanted to like this game.  The concept is super cool, and the fact that it's basically a puzzle game is very interesting, but the gameplay itself doesn't have any soul.  It too often feels like work.  Very little of what you have to do is intuitive, specifically the crafting and how you are meant to interact with the environment.  Items have no descriptions to indicate their potential functions.  Characters are just pawns to manipulate, you can't really interact with them in a meaningful way to glean info on how the game works, what might be going on in your prison, or what you might be able to do with them (on top of them being personally indistinguishable from one another).\n\nI too often just had to look something up to see if I could do it, and if I could, how, because it was rarely obvious.  For example, I knocked out a guard and immediately tried what I knocked him out for: making a mold of his key using my soap bar.  Nope.  Or how about making the key using the correct mold - molten plastic?  Got a lighter and a plastic fork and - nope.  Plastic has to come from a comb or toothbrush, I discovered when I looked it up.  Alternatively, I could pay my character's money to use the payphone to get randomized hints about what to do, but why can't I just glean this info from playing the game? It is otherwise simply not there.\n\nThe stats for your character also feel like artificial blockades, and why they degrade I'm not really sure.  I don't want to spend 3 minutes clicking one spot in order to get smarter, or pressing the Q and E keys over and over to get stronger or faster.  It's just not fun, so why have it?  The worst part is you don't level these stats up in any other way besides the exercise task or the reading task, so you are forced to engage in these activities.  Increasing these stats based on what quests you complete would have been a good idea, or based on moving around the prison, but it doesn't work that way - you must exercise or read, which amounts to wasting time both in-game and in real life.  Nothing quantified how I feel about this game better than clicking the bookshelf and watching the "reading" meter fill up over the course of a couple seconds.\n\nWhen the game works, it works very well. Attempting an escape is thrilling and got my pulse going. It's just the process of getting there that is not fun. I don't want to have to have a browser window open when I can't figure out why I can't combine a pillow and a prison outfit to make a bed dummy, or why the entrance key won't let me out of the prison, and for that matter what these colored locks mean and why I have to actually obtain the keys to them before I can even see their names.\n\nThis game feels like it was designed by people who are very comfortable with having a browser window open in crafting and survival games, as though that's just the accepted reality of these games.  That's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ reality, man.","July 13, 2015","false","9.7"," 273 of 483 people (57%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","57","273","483","16","12"

Regardless of how boring it must look to see someone cutting through vent grates or digging under a fence, it had my heart pounding, especially if a guard just happened to wonder by me.

Very light-hearted humor, but it is extremely fun. The necessity to follow your routine to maintain your cover is great, and really adds to the drama of trying to escape. Hiding your tools, using fake walls, looting other prisoners when they get beat up - it's dog eat dog, and I love it.\n\nThe art style was a good choice, in my opinion. It's pixel art, which works great for this setting. Even with the limited tile size, the game manages to look good, I've never wondered "What is that supposed to be?"\n\nThe music is very catchy, though the only drawback I have is the transition between 'periods' feels disjointed. Going from, say, free time to lunch, for example, it's very noticeable that it's loading a new background song, as the first one just ends, and the other begins.\n\nThe gameplay is good. The controls are very tight, and the UI is intuitive. The cursor does a good job of telling you what it's currently doing, in terms of combat, using items, or interaction.\n\nDifficulty wise, it's got a bit of a learning curve.

Ever.\nIt took me only 27 minutes to beat it, and I beat it at lunch of Day 3.\n\nThe problem is everyone thinks of the most elaborate scheems ever to beat the game (through the vent, digging underground, etc.)  But this plan is simple, and I mean SIMPLE.  All you have to do is collect a few things:\n\n1. Tub of talcum powder\n2. Toothpaste\n3. Comb/Toothbrush\n4. Lighter\n5. Somewhat good weapon\n\nAfter collecting these things your going to require at least 80 intel so you can craft the tub of talcum powder and toothbrush into a wad of putty,  then use the lighter and comb/toothbrush to make molten plastic.  After doing so get at least 35 health (70 strength), and around 40 speed or so.\n\nNow that you've got all the hard work done, it's time for the fun part.  You're going to beat up gaurds until you have the one with a staff key, if he doesn't have the red staff key, don't take it.  When you find the one with the red staff key take it off him, and combine the key with the wad of putty.  and it is EXTREMELY imortant that after you make the staff key mold you put the real staff key back on him.  If you don't do so you will lose all your items.  Now you have a staff key mold.  craft the staff key mold with the molten plastic So you will get a plastic staff key.  Once you have this you're ready to escape.  All you have to do is when the guards are doing rolecall (So 3 of them are occupied, and 2 are guarding)  You run out the front door,  select the staff key,  click one of the doors with a red lock with you're plastic staff key, and  run out the unlocked door to freedom.\n\nIf you've read this far, thanks for taking the time to read this quick guide to win easy, and I hope it helps!","September 19, 2014","true","19.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

But as i played further, the game really lost its charm and became really boring. There are really no fun ways of escaping, and for the most part, escaping is impossible unless you google how to do it. If there was a way to organize an escape with other inmates, this game would be leaps and bounds greater. But of course the other inmates are pretty useless for anything other than items. You always see the same few jokes that have lost their novelty 1 or 2 hours into the game, and talking to them only gets your respect up. That respect doesn't translate into them helping you in fights or building a gang; it only makes their comments change to a happier tone. They don't give you tips on how to escape, you cant task them to do your dirty work... The disconnect between NPC and the player is so frustratingly low. I hate the fact that the game feels less like a prison and more like an endless challenge with no real satisfaction.\n\nTL;DR - the game is a great concept, but it lacks complexity that would make you really immerse with the world. The disconnect between player and NPC is so large, it is actually frustrating. Its not worth your money, honestly.\n\n3/10\nPS: I bought this game back when it was Early Access, but i have played the full release version.

Let me just say that this game was worth the wait. I am a big fan of 'pixel games' and this game is no exception. The game has captured the theme of living in a prison very well, making you want to escape from the dreadful prison!\n\nThis game very enjoyable as is both fair and difficult. Although it can be a real challenge to escape the prison, the general gameplay is simple and lets you choose how you want to play. With very simple guidlines and controls, you get a hang of the game in a flash. You can either escape through the vents, tunnel underground, obtain fake keys or now, with the new update, beat down all of the guards! The escaping part of the game is the hardest and very intense.\n\nThis game does currently have only 1 prison to escape from, but I am sure that there will be more prisons in the future as they are frequently updating the game. The most recent update allowed more ways to escape as well as new uniforms to enhance the way you play. The crafting aspect of the game is incredible. With countless things availiable to craft, you can either discover the vast diversity of crafting through crafting notes, or steam guides :). With the developers working on the game at an outstanding pace, there will for sure be way more crafting options, as well as new items, then there are now.\n\nGames with good AI are the ones that stand out for me, and this is one of them. The prisoners have their own way of doing things with there personal opinion on you. They may fight you if you have done things that they don't like which have stacked up, or join you in fighting guards if you help them enough. They have challenges for you which you can do for money, in which you can buy vital items you need to escape with. I'm am sure with the new updates that come that these inmates will continue to become more intelligent and my even try to escape from you.\n\nBeing a Prison Architect fan, the idea of being an actual prisoner inside the game itself was fasinating. This game really pulled it off well, as the gameplay, AI and content all added up to this game being a thriving success. This game will continue to get better and better as the updates continue to improve the game. It deserves more popularity that is has in my opinion.\n\nOverall Score 9/10","August 28, 2014","true","11.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The prison's get harder and harder (obviously) but you actually need to think of ways to escape and actually use your brain for this game. Try playing the game without using it. You won't succeed.\n\nAnywho. The controls for this game are hard to understand and are complicated at first glance but becomes very easy to use and understand afterwards. It makes learning a difficult process but makes the process worth it. Just try to buy the game, although I haven't seen any sales for it recently. I got it for $15 and I think its worth it.\n\nIts actually been a long while since a game has got me so tense when succeeding/escaping. It gives you chills or nerves when your about to escape and a guard comes by you. It makes the whole game a nervewracking worthness. Its put in a 32-bit like pixels although it could be 48-bit.\n\n9/10 Ducks","March 31, 2015","true","22.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","9","11","4","0"

The learning curve is of an acquired taste, and there's a lot of trial and soul-and-progress-shattering error but it's well worth it and is a better experience for it.\n\nSometimes you'll fail a lot just trying to work out the rules of the game and I can see how some would find that frustrating. But I still generally respect the decision to lean the design in this direction.\n\nIf you find yourself tempted to look up crafting recipes via Wiki's etc I would advise you to try not doing so, and simply allow yourself to be immersed in this fun little prison life sim and start putting ideas together just as I suppose you really would if you we're planning some kind of daring escape! Try things out and experiment, the recipes and working ideas i've discovered just by putting two and two together were incredibly rewarding, infact so were the recipes that you get out of finding and acquiring "crafting notes".\n\nThere's an immense sense of satisfaction in finally making your first escape after 28+ days of learning the game inside of the first prison. It feels very real and rewarding and triumphant in a way not many games can offer. Because of how open the game is, the plan you make is your plan and will in some way be probably quite different to everyone elses plan. I got very invested in my first escape when I finally committed to "making a break for it".\n\nIt's also jusssst accessible and forgiving enough, with _just_ stupid enough AI to make the player feel reasonably comfortable with experimenting and trying out crazy ideas. A very difficult balance to get right.\n\nAwesome game.","March 13, 2015","true","24.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

You are some random prisioner as you try and escape the prision you are in. Not just any old fashion escape. But the most unqiue escape you can think of, depending upon of course the prision you are in. Each prision offers it's own unique challenges that may seem easy. But it gives players that "false impression". It isn't easy. You have to plan it out, and with a little luck you can escape the prision with ease.\n\nAnd with a fun modding community. This game makes it so much better. The only little issue about the game is mainly the save points. You can only save it before you get some shut eye. Which makes sense. But in some cases players might want a "backup" save just in case something goes wrong in the perfect situation so that way they can go back and do something else.\n\nOther than that, if you enjoy these type of games then this one is right up your alley.

It is in-depth, difficult, and overall fun. Fun fact, I actually almost donated to the project almost a year before it made the Steam Greenlight. Actually, this was the first greenlight game i'd ever approved of. I bought it as soon as i had enough money.\n9.5/10\nPros1. Very in-depth.\nThe prisons you play in almost feel like a real prison.\n2.Good Developer\nThe developer is constantly adding to the game, this game is very well-kept. I reported a bug about your character literally not being able to get out of their bed if you loaded the game in the same session you already played in, and they fixed it within two weeks.\n3.Wide Variation of items\nI actually had to consult the forum to get some of these ideas! Who would've thought of molten hot chocolate? not me! This game has a surprisingly accurate crafting system as well.\nCons1. This game is still early access\nThis game is unfinished, so if you don't like changes being made to a game while you play, it isn't for you.\n2. The questing system needs work\nThe game has a well-implemented crafting system, but sometimes you get glitched quests that don't acknowledge when you complete them. This is an issue sometimes, as i'll beat up Officer David,  and then i won't get paid. Also, duplicate quests, (i.e. bob and joe both want officer cooper beat up), means that I have to beat up officer cooper twice, beating him up once only honors one request.\n3.The game has a massive difficulty spike.\nThere needs to be less of a spike between the first and second prisons. End of story.\n4.Duplicate Items\nA lot of items are basically the same except in crafting. For example, the screwdriver and the crowbar are identical in purpose and value. I would like to see both items work differently.\nThings i'd like to see1.Co-Op\nThis is the huge feature i'd like. Team up, or perhaps go against your friends to make escaping the same prison a new adventure.\n2.Prison Editor\nI'm aware this is a planned feature, but the sooner you add it the better.","December 26, 2014","true","53.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Tougher the security is in the prison, less options you'll have. The world is comedic, but you hardly see anything comedic, you only read them through text bubbles. The learning curve is abit steep, but the community has your back there, just check out the Guides in the Guide section on steam for any information you need.  the Ui design is abit " right in your face " and way too large. Everything you have can be taken from you upon death but you can also lose items if you have them. But that depends on if it's " contraband " or not. The maps sizes vary, but most of the maps have a huge ground to cover. The graphics help hide the real brutality which occurs alot in this game, like seeing 3 prisioners fight one another with 5 gaurds jumping into the brawl with nothing but batons. The "death" mechanic is treated more like "knocked out" in the game. But, getting shot by a sniper from a gaurd tower....kinda ruins the supension of disbelief even though the game wants you to think your just knocked out.\n\nAnnd...well, that's it. That's all I can say on this.\nThe game itself isn't much really. But, it's sure entertaining when you have a need to do a "escape" of sort.\n\nOhh, and my creditials are as follows:\nI cleared the tutorial, Center Perks, and Stalag Flucht during early access.","February 13, 2015","true","13.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It has a multitude of ways to escape which can vary alot along with the many tools to help you with that. The game makes you feel like you are actually trying to escape prison which makes you feel really worried/stressed if you nearly get caught (especially at night). This game is a new and exciting genre of its type that works perfectly when put into practice. Only negative comment is that some bugs/glitches can occur when getting caught for a few off reasons, but other than that it is a great game and I'm sure they will patch it (hopefully).

THEY'RE STILL UPDATING THE MECHANICS AND STILL GIVING OUT BIG MONTHLY UPDATES FOR BOTH THE MAIN GAME AND ESCAPE MODE! (EDIT: Escape mode doesn't seem to get any better. Buy it anyways for the awesome prison mechanics)\n\nThe game was sadly very promising before final release.\nThey had so many plans and promises. (I'LL SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST)\n\nWhat we got, was predictable AI with telltale signs of where they're going with numerous glitches.\nMost gamebreaking being guards switch which way they're heading when you enter and exit inventory or other menues and prisoners getting stuck in walls indefinetly. These glitches were precent in early versions of the game and has yet to be fixed.\n\nNo in-depth relation with prisoners.\nThey are basically a chest that needs money to give you things to dig out of prison.\n\nEscaping is not fun or original.\nYou do always have a shining sign with the message "EXIT HERE." You either dig your way under a wall, dig trough a wall with a fork or try to beat up guards with hot chocolate.\n\nIf you get caught THE ENTIRE MAP JUST RESETS! All your hidden stowaways are magically found, broken walls fixed and holes filled by the guards because they found dirt in someone elses toilet and "tracked" it back to you.\n\nDid I mention the glitches that will never be fixed?\nI mentioned AI already in the "Predictable AI".\nYour inventory lags in some weird way making you have to wait about 1.5 seconds between clicking anything when you try to spamclick 3 times per second.\nIf you get shot by snipers the star effect sometimes sticks, even when you save and exit.\nSome toilets make guards glitch when they try to unplug them. They're supposed to make that 8-bit alert sound once to signify that they have found something out of the ordinary. They're then supposed to check the contents of the toilet to make sure that no contraband is found in it and then just unplug the toilet and walk away. Instead they keep making that annoying alert noice every 2 seconds and just stand there until you quit.\nDirty spots and weeds stack on eachother and only count as one when you work as a janitor or gardener making you work extra, a thing you dont have time with.\n\nThe maps are plain and the "snipertowers" are sprites of guards surrounded by a 3x3 wall.\n\nAnd the absolute worst thing about this game, is that they have the guts to dare to shove lackluster DLC for this UNFINISHED game down our throuts. 5 are out already ranging between 1€-2€ with more probably incoming. These are just single maps. I would be ok with this in some degree if it wasn't for the CONSTANT reminder to "BUY THE DLC!!!1!!"\nI checked the game today before making my final verdict of the game and the first thing I see is a pop-up menu with all the DLC that i should buy. When I clicked out of it and clicked "New Game" i got a little red notification AGAIN to buy he DLC.\nSome special items are only usable in the DLC maps but they still show up in a normal DLC free save. Their paywall is even thcker than anything I've seen come out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of EA. Atleast their DLC mappacks containg multiple maps that are goodlooking instead of this piece of crap.\nI wouldn't be angry if they were honest about their plans for DLC, because I wouldn't have touched it.\n\nTL'DR: THis game is lacking in content, is glitchy, mechanics are not even scratching the surface for an "escape from jail" game and the devs are shoving crappy DLCs down our throuts. Buy "Prison Architect" instead!","December 23, 2015","false","29.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","1"

When you try to escape, you need to make sure every guard is gone. If you want to dig your way out, you need to have a tunnel short-term. Not having and underground tunnel long-term, because everything will be gone, even your other stuff you used to escape.\n- Crafting is very hard, your need to find crafting recepies and you need to higher your intellect or you can't craft stuff.\n- Your stats increase slowely, keeping your stats at the right place is hard and requires valuable time you need to have to escape.\n- Guards will dislike everything you do (Not being on the right place on the right time, standing on table's, looting stuff etc.)\n\nLet's dump all the negativity and move on with the pro's:\n+ Very well scripted, you have different periods (You need to finish your job, have meal, train, etc.)\n+ This game has humour\n+ Very addicting (Because you fail everytime, you want to try again :P).\n+ Community is ok. Some immature people, some nice people.\n+ Missions and different ways to earn money.\n+ Every thing you make or do, feels rewarding.\n+ A lot of items.\n+ Workshop, all these maps are amazing.\n\nOverall: 7/10, not for everyone. If you don't like 2D games I suggest to you that you won't like this game. The con's are the reason this rating has -3 points. The game is very hard, even in the most Easy prison available.","February 7","true","12.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Even on the easiest prison, every move you make must be carefully calculated. You're gonna need to make sure you keep an eye on your heat to make sure you take on the more appropriate jobs. Hunting down the people selling things can be a hassle, and doesn't always end with good results in terms of buyable products. You have to be extremely careful to leave no evidence, the guards find even a small chip in the wall and it's off to solitary and reset progress. It's important to find a place to store your contraband before you overstock on it. Schedules are important, miss a day of work and you're out of work.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiceywolf/recommended/298630/","spiceywolf","Spicey_Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiceywolf/","46 products in account","The Escapists is a puzzle and sandbox game which tasks you with escaping several different prisons (each getting harder than the last).\n\nI personally found this game to be very enjoyable, the game gives you plenty of ways to escape from a prison, giving the game a strong sandbox feel and high replay value. Don't expect to get out of prison on your first run fast though (unless you look at some guides), it takes a long time to find the right moment to take action, but you are rewarded with a strong sense of accomplishment once you leave the stone fortress behind.\n\nGameplay: The Escapists has a rich and deep system of ways to escape and content within the game. As stated earlier, there is plenty of different ways to escape from a prison. I like the way they incorporated your character's stats; you have to regularly train your character's ablities (going to the exercise room, reading, etc.) to improve your capabilites and keep your stats up high. It prevents simply maxing out all your stats and leaving the prison easily. The crafting system is complex and interesting, but I find it rather annoying that you have to buy the crafting notes from inmates (when one could simply use the wiki). Combat is rather boring, as it's simply a question of who is stronger/has a better weapon. This is easily forgiven though as combat is not the aim of the game.\n\nGraphics: The graphics is a simple yet charming 2D art style. You can really see the amount of detail that went into the art.\n\nTechnical: Much to my delight, I have had absolutely zero technical issues (framerate, crashing, etc) with the game so far.\n\nMusic: Simple and rather bland. Most of the time it just acts as an ambience. While it's not terrible, don't expect an amazing soundtrack.\n\nFinal Score: The Escapists is a rich and rewarding game that is defiantly worth your time, although it may be a bit pricey for an early access game, it defiantly already is at a stage of completion with a few small issues and improvements that could be made.\n\nEDIT: I am very happen to see the release of the prison editor and (extremely cheap) DLC for the game. Boosts my overall score to 8.8.\n\n8.8/10","March 30, 2015","true","9.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

You fight with guards, they'll remember and beat you up everytime they see you, until they've actually beaten you up (I think this is a glitch currently). Beat up other inmates, their opinions towards you decreases . Make their opinions low enough, they'll start attack you when they see you alone in a corner. do favor for the inmates, their opinions towards you increases, and you can recruit them to join you as a gang.\n\nIt feels like it's going to be a long run, not short game, as what you'd expect a prison escape simulator should be. You need to slowly build up your way in order to break out. Tools must be made yourself, and if you dig, you need to remember to flush out the dirt. And yes, there's no guarantee your toilet is functional, if you're in bad luck the toilet will just get clogged.\n\nI'm on day 24, and trying for a shawshank redemption breakout, playing cool with everyone else while silently solo planning on a breakout.

Figuring later on, they have the same color as the locks on the doors.. so meh.. they traced it back to me, regarding the fact I took the guards clothes, weapon and key so..\n\nAnyway, should definatly try it out. :)\n\n","January 21, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/streetsidepharmacist/recommended/298630/","streetsidepharmacist","Pharmacist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/streetsidepharmacist/","21 products in account","This is a review for version 1.0, I will be updating this as the devs update the game, respectively\nOverview In The Escapists, you play an unfortunate prisoner, who ends up in prison for doing simple things like murdering your family or eating all the cake in the town. As a prisoner, you go about your daily prison routine to avoid drawing suspicion from the guards, all while plotting your escape. You start out in the most luxurious of prisons, gradually advancing to crummier and more difficult ones as you escape each one. There are many different ways of escaping, and the prison life is well simulated.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10 A seemingly simple prison escape game that offers a lot of gameplay for very little hard drive space. It's a nice casual/strategy game to play to get away from the other games Steam has to offer. Although, like many relatively new games, could use some improvements.\n\nPrice:7/10 The original price of this game in Early Access was $9.99 USD, which is what I purchased it at. Since then, the price has steadily rose due to various game expansions and improvements the developers have implemented and has settled at a reasonable $19.99 USD. Even at $20, the developers are continuing to plan and add new features, making it well worth the price.\n\nGameplay:9/10 As I've mentioned before, this game offers a surprising amount of gameplay for the little amount of hard drive space it requires. So, in the game you play as a prisoner who has to follow the daily prison routines (rollcall, eating meals, shower, exercise period, lights out, etc). While doing so, however, you must also plot your escape, utilizing various seemingly ordinary objects (duct tape, socks, files, etc) to make the tools in which you need to escape (pickaxes, weapons, shovels, etc). You can gain those items by looting your fellow prisoners' desks or simply purchasing them with money (yes, they give money to prisoners!) There are also many methods of escape, which range from accessing the air vents, tunneling your way out, pretending to be a prison guard, and organizing a prison riot. All these keep a player entertained while enjoying the pleasures of prison life.\n\nLength: 9/10 In Early Access, there were very little guides. I had to figure out all the crafting recipes myself, figure out all the methods of escape myself, and spent many hours just learning the game. Now, in addition to the new content that the devs have provided us for the full release, you can easily rack up over 20+ hours just trying to escape all 6 prisons. That's not all, you can spend even more time trying to get the achievements, if that's what you do.\n\nStory: 4/10 In short, the stories and text in this game are mediocre. The reason I have it as 4/10 as supposed to a 1/10 is because of the witty banter. When you see a prisoner or guard or warden or staff, you often will see them saying a humorous line or two. Things like "I should drop you right here" or "My baton does the talking" or "Address me as your king" or even "Taking your wife out to dinner". I would suggest that each prisoner and guard have their own personal diary, and depending on the person and prison, they would each have their own backstory. I also suggest that you can have actual conversatiosn with other people instead of just clicking on them and having them respond. Maybe certain things you say would affect your reputation with them.\n\nGraphics: 8/10 Nice, simple graphics and animations for a nice, relatively-simple game. I suggest that the devs should implement more detail, though. If a guard is unconscious because you whacked him with a baton, a little blood on him wouldn't hurt. Little things like that will make this game better.\n\nMusic/Sound: 6/10 A lot of the sound in simple, and that complements the game well. More detailed sounds would be nice. Example: Steve pours molten chocolate on Officer Whitney. I would like to hear sizzling sound, or a scream, anything that shows that the chocolate is hot or the officer is in pain. As for the music, repetitive. I like how you have different types of music for different times of day. There's eating music, workout music, shower music, and night music. However, that gets repetitive, especially if you have to repeat the same daily routine over, and over, and over again. Have at least 3 tracks for each time of day. Also, having music unique to a specific prison would be nice.\n\nPerformance: 10/10 Performs smoothly, as expected for such a low performance-demanding game. Have found very little bugs in my time playing, which have all been minor, such as not being able to flood other prisoners' toilets, only mine.\n\nObjectives: 7/10 The main objective is good (escaping), is good for the most part. The devs are planning on adding more ways of escaping and I hope that they'll balance the methods out. For example, in the easiest prison, there are several ways of escaping, but it's not balanced at all. Method one: you just need a cutting tool and an easily crafted bed dummy to escape (which can be achieved on day one) Method two: You need to dig a tunnel until it extends past the fences (which can take many days!) See what I mean? Now, for the side-quests. In this game you can do tasks for your fellow prisoners in order to earn money. These tasks range from giving them a specific item to beating up a certain person. I'd like to be able to get another prisoner to do a task for me instead of slaving, for once. I'd also like to be able to trade items with them and sell items. It would make the system a lot more realistic and fair.\n\nWorld: 8/10 The prisons are unique in themselves, their layouts being different to provide a challenge to escapists. I like how you can explore between the walls of the prison and find loot. I don't like how you can just walk out of certain prisons and find no more landscape to challenge you or to explore. For example, Stlag Flucht, the second easiest prison in the game. You can simply walk out when you escape and find no more challenge. Where's the frozen tundra, or the frigid forest? That kind of detail in the world design would make it better.\n\nCharacters: 6/10 I'd like to be able to customize my inmate's looks and read their backstories and interact with them like an actual person. Give them a personality in conversations; don't have every prisoners say the same thing. Make each character unique; give them a dominant hand, give them a family that visits them, give them a gang that wants to rescure them from prison, give them body types. Example: Bob may be slightly overweight, but he can take a lot of guard tower shots. Bill may be slightly underweight, but boy can he run! Also, a very simple skill tree could enhance the game a lot. Example: a point in Sprinter would allow your character to boost his speed for a short period of time. Even your fellow inmates and guards could have skill trees to balance out the game.\n\nItem Variety: 7/10 This game has a decent variety of items, some people may disagree and say this game has a lot, but I'd say decent. There are sock maces (they exist!), powered screwdrivers, fake fences, plastic key molds, flashlights, dirt, deluxe toilet rolls and so much more. The weapons I think could use some balancing. Make each weapon have its own benefits. For example: A Super Sock Mace would have a range advantage over the Hammer, which has more damage.\n\nAI: 5/10 The AI is basic, needs many improvements in my opinion. Prisoners just walk around the entire period during free time. They don't try to exercise to gain strength or speed, or read books to gain intellect. Their stats should also degrade as well, which would give them some incentive to do so. Also, have them planning their escapes, too. I would like to see other inmates escape with me.\n\n","February 15, 2015","true","24.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Try to beat the guards up (no murdering tho, even if you shank them twice with your makeshift glass shank).\n\nYou start off in a prison, figure out the prison routine, and do things for a few days while you start digging holes, unscrewing vent covers, and so on.

Then update#2 happened, I saw the easier prison, and things started to click.\n\nIt's a game that lets you screw around however you want, but as time drags on you slowly start to formulate plans and ideas and start to recognize the weaknesses in the prison itself. Even though discovering things may take some time and you might be sent to solitary quite a few times, you start to understand what really matters and eventually you start to chip out ideas and plots of how you're going to escape. It's trial and error in a very pure form, and so far I'd say that this has me genuinely excited for where it goes from here.

You are able to chose from a variety of characters at the beginning to start off your quest to freedom. The aim of the game is to escape (incase you hadn't figured it out) and there are many ways to do this. There are no hints and tips in-game to get you out. you just need to use your initiative. You can go great escape, or steal the keys and hope you can out run the bullets. To do some of these tasks you need to buy equipment from the other inmates. This obviously requires money, which you earn by doing favours. While there are only a few different types of favours in the game at this time, they always seem rewarding, whether that be money or because you punched someone in the face during showers and outran the guards, i dont know. What i do know is the monotonous of buffing up is very.. well monotonus. It doesnt take just a few days to get your strength to a good standard where you can win a fight, same for  intelligence so you can craft certain objects. Other than this, this game has so much potential and i enjoy playing!","September 7, 2014","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

This game is an 8-bit simulation type. It makes you pick a character and gives you an insight in to prison life, as well as trying to escape the prison. You follow routines in order to keep the guards off of your back.\n\nI like this game as:\n1. It's original. I have never seen a game like this before and I tend to recommend original or uncopied games. The routines vary from prison to prison as well as the level of security so that not everything is a doppleganger of one another.\n2. I find this game oddly addictive unlike some other games I have come across. I always try to escap with no avail yet I am always trying and trying again showing no signs of boredom whatsoever.\n3. This game is in very early stages. There are some things I dislike about this game (e.g some items are too much of a challenge to obtain) but they will probably either be fixed or changed in later versions which means that most things that need fixing or changing will be fixd and changed by the time the game is finished.","January 3, 2015","true","62.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are prison guards etc. You can go in peoples cells and steal their ♥♥♥♥.\n\nOver all after 6 hours I got rather fed up. I will be playing more in the future.

From what I've  played it seems like the basis of advancing to a higher tier in game in which you are well situated and familiar with the prison is crafting which requires you to find crafting plans, guess, or look it up on a wiki (which makes the game reliant on external sources other than itself for its gameplay hence not self-sustaining). The "favors" or quests that you complete for other inmates are repetitive too as there are only two different types: A, beat someone up; or B, retrieve an item. However, there is a fun puzzle aspect to the game in figuring out how to sneak resources out from one of the three jobs you can pick as well as how to use these materials to access new areas and bypass locked doors. That being said, the worst thing in this game I would say is the leveling up system where you are literally performing menial button pressing over and over and over in order to level up and leveling up is essential as many jobs and crafting require you to have a minum level in the intellect area and you stand no chance in any type of combat (needed for the inmate quests) unless you have a high strength skill. It would be ok if you could achieve max level once and be done with it but it diminishes over time, not slowly either, so a signifigant portion of the gameplay is simply pressing q and e very fast or clicking and waiting. Being that this is an alpha build im sure these issues will be addressed, but untill then it is a decent game with some great roleplay features associated with a prison and some terrible features associated with a prison.\nOverall Rating - 6.75/10","August 26, 2014","true","9.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I guess it is like a RPG (role playing game), you have to grind all the time in the hardest prison which is bad but the game makes up for it by making you happy about escaping or finding the rare item that you need to craft something to help you escape which might make or brake the game for you. But you can't say its not a great feeling when you overcome something difficult. The art style is good for pixels, the top down point of view or POV is ok but not great. NPCs are cool with a like you meter as i call it it is a meter that tells you how much an NPC likes you and that will affect many things to how much discount you are given to if they will fight for you or look the other way if you beat someone up. If you do that the bar will go down a little bit they also make many references to a variety of movies, games, books and TV shows. Combat could use a better system because it is hit space and then left click once and you sit and wait it does not need to be a click click click to fight just like a power attack or quick attack would be fine and the layout of all prisons are great hugely different and detailed. this game gets a 9.0 maybe 9.4 for new update with building prisons but not many great ones yet hopefully in the future there is.

The 18+ hours showing on my review has been accrued in roughly a day and a half, despite my hectic schedule, my family's schedules and the additional game hindering chaos three kids provide. Despite my varied, somewhat conflicting, game library on Steam (which I share with my family, teen daughter included and yes, those are the anime VN novels in my library) I am generally a Fantasy/Sci-Fi RPG and FPS/RPG gamer (truthfully, it's story and a heavy immersion factor that I look for in a game) and yet I have become absolutely addicted to this fantastic little strategy game!  It reminds me of the simple fun games used to be.\nHaving been a gamer since the days of Amiga, Atari and Nintendo, it has become a rare thing, in recent years, for me to stumble upon a game that can hold my interest past the two hour mark...and this one certainly has.  I am now obsessed with figuring out all of the illegal contraband I can assemble from toothbrushes, wires, toliet paper, duct tape, super glue, etc., and am extremely, mischievously pleased when I can successfully beat a fellow inmate, for a favor or for an item I want, or when I beat a guard, take his key, imprint it into my putty, place it back on his person and get back to my exercise routine, no one the wiser but myself and my unfortunate victim...not to mention the ever-present goal behind all of my subterfuge and mayhem; escape!\nI still cannot believe this was only an 18mg download  o.O  ...and it's far more entertaining than innumerable games that take up far more voluminous amounts of space on my hard drive than 18mgs!\nAs this game is in its early access stage of development, I fervently hope that the devs only add and never detract a thing from this game. People may complain about the pixelated graphics, but in my opinion, it keeps the tone clear; this is just a fun, clever game...not American Me or Shawshank Redemption, (however, there are some references to famous jail break movies within the game. ;-)\nRemember the hour, day and week consuming fun of Earthbound or the original Final Fantasy & Super Mario Brothers, which always left you feeling frustrated, entertained and happy all at once?  Simple concept, tough to accomplish...so much to discover and do as you fight your way to the ultimate end goal of beating the game...The Escapists is so very much like those good old games of yesteryear.\nDo yourself a favor...Give this wonderfully entertaining and amusing game a try!  It's not flashy or on the cutting edge of gaming tech, but it is enormously fun, frivolous and entertaining...something video games once were and rarely are these days.","September 13, 2014","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But it is  wayyyy  harder than you think. You gotta be elaborate, intelligent, and clever to escape, so you're probably not gonna escape at first. But that's what makes it so addicting. You always try to find new stuff and initiate your plan, and as soon as you start...\n\nA guard or nighttower knocks you out. You're wake up with nothing you had equipped besides the stuff in your cell desk. You rage yet start again, finding out a new plan to escape or just go on with prison life.\n\nThat's what makes this game so enjoyable. There are so many different ways you can escape that once you find one, you stik to it until you fail and make another fail. It's like one big cycle that's broken once you escape. But the repeatedness isn't annoying.\n\nThe music is also great too, it sets a nice ambience for each activity in the prison, and kinda funny when you're trying to beat up a guard or something and the same music just goes on.\n\nOverall,  amazing  game (considering it's still early access) by Mouldy Toof Studios, and I'd really recommend getting it.

You play the game at your own pace, do what you want, when you want. The crafting system is great and simple, the favor system gives you things to do when your bored, or to make some extra cash. Jobs are also a thing, you can be a mailman, a janitor, and much more! You will earn a lot of enemies in prison, but maybe some friends along the way as well!\nThe only things that are cons for me are as followed:\n- It will sometimes take forever to get what you need, the things people sell are most of the time just useless for what you need.\n- When trying to escape, if the guards find you, you are automatically caught and put in confinement without a chance to fight back, I feel that you should atleast be able to put up a fight!\n- The jobs "Janitor" and "Gardener" are all based off of luck, if not enough spills/weeds are around the prison, you lose your job, and sometimes it is literally impossible to complete said jobs.\n- I dislike that you can find the same "Crafting Note" over and over again, making most "Crafting Note" purchases worthless.\n- Some people dislike the workout system, of having to rapidly press "Q and E" to workout.

This game is exactly like Prison architect, but from an opposing side in which you play as the prisoner keeping to their schedule and creating a secret plot to escape behind bars.\nOnly thing I have spotted whilst playing around with this game however, is that there is a "spare" (empty) cell in which I hope gets made into a way of developing Co-op into this game, or multiplayer. Having Co-op or multiplayer would be fascinating to experience prison with friends or strangers, in which it is more fun to trade and sell items to players, so that you can experience prison naturally, without AI wandering around.\n\n11/10 would recommend to anyone.","August 28, 2014","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It uses the classic 8-bit graphics combined with a top-down view and fantastic gameplay features of today. Believe me, you really should get this game. It's definitely kid-friendly, meaning that there isn't any foul language and the fighting that exists in the game is cartoony. Don't worry, though! It is still ridiculously fun (and funny) to play, and many adults play it.\n\nI'd suggest getting it as soon as you can.

It is a very challenging task as I, myself, still has not found a way to escape after 3 hours of gameplay. If you want an engaging game that you know that you will never get bored of for the next year or so, then I would recommend this game.

It's often not the fault of the game but just a bad marriage between game and gamer.\n\nSo it is with me and The Escapists. To be honest, I don't get it. There's no direction, the art style is best phrased as butt-ugly and the controls aren't easy. I'm forever getting stuck on the edge of doors because you have to be lined up perfectly to get through them. I don't find the gameplay very compelling.\n\nI know what I'm supposed to do - work on your stats, get into a job that allows you to steal the components you need to escape and then do so - but I don't find it very engaging. In that I know I'm in the minority. That's ok. I'm just not good at it. The side quests are simple, the other prisoners seem to be fairly faceless, the routine dull and just the whole thing for me falls flat. I haven't even been able to escape the first prison and to tell you the truth it's not really worth my time trying. I should like it - I'm a fan of strategy - but I don't.\n\nNow again, that's just my experience. But I also know I'm not the only one. A friend of mine also bought this and felt the exact same way. In the meanwhile the reviews are very positive, so I know and accept that I'm in the minority.\n\nYeah, if this sounds like the classic "it's not you, it's me" line, it pretty much is. I'd probably like the game much more if the controls were better, if the graphics are clearer and if the strategy was more robust. But it's not and I regret buying this one. If returns were allowed when I bought it, I would have done so. But they weren't and so it gets a thumbs down from me. YMMV.","February 16, 2015","false","2.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great concept, challenging gameplay and amusing dialogue from the guards and other inmates. You are dropped into the prison routine without much direction on how to escape. Read books, work out, build relationships, learn the map/routine and MacGuyver yourself some tools and weapons. There are different strategies and play styles for you to discover as you go along.

I'm totally immersed in the prison break atmos. Started digging a tunnel to freedom while everyone's working mwahahaha...balls! Guards are coming to check my room! Everything in my room is contraband!?!?!? It wasn't me!! Noooo don't put me in solitaryyyyy. If only triple AAA games put some of this effort into games.\n\nSome of the leveling up minigames are a little repetitive as they degrade over time, but the game would probably be too easy otherwise. It is an indie game so it does feel a little light in some areas, there's not a great deal of items but they are rare to come around, some of the logic is very dodgy eg, u can beat up a guard and take his gear but there isn't any harsh consequences. But it's great fun to hatch out an escape plan and literally chipping away, making sure yr timing is executed perfectly.\n\nAt current price I'd probably won't recommend if not for the devs adding a prison editor (not sure if free update or dlc). The prisons feel varied enough but once u've worked one out, replayability is left upto u to escape differently.","February 19, 2015","true","61.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Just started it a few days ago, reached day 14 without any progress and started watching lets plays.\n\nSome of the main tips I missed was:\n\n* be there at roll calls to know who is gonna get a cell search (if you don't want to lose everything and go in the solitary every other day)\n* forks can break walls, spoons can dig holes (makes escaping from earlier prisons much easier, when advanced items are harder to access)\n* roll of duct tape can craft you a LOT of things (poster, cutters, pickaxe, shovel, contraband pouch, tying guards, and many more things)\nAfter that and a lot of spoiling from let's plays I managed to escape the first three prisons in 5 hours. If you know all of that, it's just a matter of time and proper timing to finish the game. I kind of wish I tried it myself, but I can't even imagine how much time it would've took me if I tried to learn everything myself.\nSo I say don't feel stupid if you give up and want to read wikis on craft recipes and which does what, the game does not have that art style just to save on artist salaries, it is also a reminder that old games were hard as ♥♥♥♥ and didn't give you step-by-step on how to wipe your own ♥♥♥ and left you there wondering 'what the ♥♥♥♥ do I do now?'.

The gameplay is very interesting having you switch between "agressive" and "passive" mode for combat by hitting "Q", and taking up random favors for your fellow inmates ranging from finding a Paper Clip to beating the tar out of a guard to get his Uniform for the cosplaying Inmate.

This makes me feel like I have no progression because I want to start a new character if I end up hating the layout of the loot and how I've done on my current character and I always start from square 1 with the crafting stuff.\n\nThere is only one prison until you beat that first one, and beating the first one is a hell of a task. This means if you ♥♥♥♥ up on the first one 25 times and start to get sick of the exact same routines and level layout every time you are SOL unless you manage to beat it or play the other two, much harder prisons that are unofficial.\n\nThe fullscreen on 16:9 monitors is just the normal aspect ratio of the game stretched grossly wide, like an emulator set to stretch an NES game to 1080p that makes Mario twice as fat. It's really terrible and is the only option.\n\nThe emergent gameplay of the prison is minor and less deep than it seems at the outset. You can easily knock out any prisoner by hitting them once and then running them into a guard while they chase you, let them hit you once and then the guard beats them to unconsciousness. You can make people miss their quota for their job by beating them up a bunch during work hours and then take their job. You can plant contraband in their cells. You can make people hate you and then coax them into fighting you and use them to cause a distraction or go somewhere they wouldn't. These things are kind of cool. But not enough to base a game around.\n\nIf you fight a guard, all you can do is knock them out for 30 seconds, and if you take one of their keys they immediately game over you when they wake up. Also, if you run away after beating them up sometimes they just forget, sometimes there is no repercussion, sometimes they chase you around forever, and sometimes an unseen sniper in the corner of the map will shoot you in the face until you die. Which of these four things happens is decidedly random.\n\nEscaping, the whole point of the dang game, sucks. Digging is this awful minecrafty thing where you have pickaxes or pickaxe-like items that very quickly decay as you use them to dig through a foot of dirt, and then when they break you have to go get more. Tools you need desperately are either totally randomly found, difficult to craft with no way to figure out how the recipes work, which have some amount of sense, but, come on, paper meche = toilet paper & super glue? People who have played the early access version rattle off absurd, stupid crafting items like a "bed decoy" and 'fake vent cover" that just scream that the game's systems are buried so deep in their own BS that they feel the need to overdesign to cover their own flaws. Why build a game where you need three tiers of pickaxes and bed roll decoys and cell curtains and instant death snipers? Silliness.\n\nVital items are hidden in one-time random loot crates that disappear forever after finding them and can contain garbage or incredibly valuable things and the seed changes every time you load so you have to save scum if you want something in particular.\n\nOh and all the text stuff is all over the place in grammar and spelling, full of memes and nonsense most of the time, and you read it all within the first few hours. Sure there's some neat ideas but pulled off in a way that feels very mediocre.\n\nI still find myself coming back and might revise this review. It's kind of fun in some ways but just so frustrating.","March 9, 2015","false","5.3"," 28 of 54 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","28","54","2","0"

I kept chipping at the wall till it broke into another block of wall (This is impossable right).\nI put the wall block and thought of my escape even more "I need knives... Plastic ones", I rushed back to the canteen and grabed a few (It was lucky, all I need four for my daring escape).\nNext step, Make a bed dummy... mmm two pillows and a blaket, that will work, the guards here have a memory of a goldfish and a attention span of another goldfish after finding out he was born.\nOK... put that one bed, make a rope. All I need for that is two bed sheets Nice.\n\nThe cover of night fall.... Im Batman... Wait no, Correction.... The night rollcall of the annoying blasted bells rang of couse I get... no wait false alarm, I missed the shakedown, sod it its time to do the escape.\nI rushed to were the wall was broken.\nUp some random ladders,\nUsed Rope to get to ground,\nand.....\n\nDay 2: Used the knives on the fence till it gave away.\nThen I walked out like some kina boss man, acting badass after a meeting about cakes,\nI turned around and saw the guards making tea, I casually walked in,\nStole there donuts,\nand walked back out (Well I needed food for the walk I guess)\n\nEnd\n\n10/10 Would be put back into confiment agian\n...Wait a sec!!","February 13, 2015","true","190.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The thought of escape makes you nervous and excited. On the downside, there are lots of bugs, like if you have items in the toilet and then exit out, when you come back in, they are gone. Also, sometimes left-clicking on people with an "!" above there head doesn't do anything. It would be nice, as well, to be able to use the scroll bar to toggle through items in your inventory.

Only very few characters are available as of now. It would be cool to see different characters with special abilities such as an engineer or a tank.\nSlow down the deterioration of skills! Keeping all skills consistantly high and trying to escape at the same time is near impossible.\nWhat after? I understand this game is all about escaping, but what after? an outside world? or could you have a stand-off inside prison against outside forces?\nco-op or even   MULTIPLAYER  I'm certainly not the first or last to say this, but this game needs multiplayer.\nThis is a message to all modders and even game devolpers working on making this game better.","September 9, 2014","true","11.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The thought of escape makes you nervous and excited. On the downside, there are lots of bugs, like if you have items in the toilet and then exit out, when you come back in, they are gone. Also, sometimes left-clicking on people with an "!" above there head doesn't do anything. It would be nice, as well, to be able to use the scroll bar to toggle through items in your inventory. It would also be amazing if there was an online co-op where you and your friends could escape prison together.

With its pixelated graphics this game reminds me of retro games that people used to play at arcades. At first glance it looks like a small game and nothing special, however that is wrong... Once you dive into this well scripted game you discover it is filled with cool content, from crafting abilities right to "Dirty mags" found in inmates draws. The Escapists is worth every penny and I would strongly recommend this game to others. Great job!

There's a decent ammount of content as of now (and hopefully some more to come in the future), and i havn't encountered many technical issues yet, couple glitches here and there, but nothing that bothersome with maybe an exception or two. Considering this is an alpha, the ammount of bugs is quite low, and only few of them are actually impactful. You may mix up the controls as they can get a bit confusing at some points, but nothing broken, so it's fine. I had a few responsiveness issues, but it didn't bother me or alter the gameplay.\n\nThe Escapists feels pretty complete already, though more content, and a co-op mode wouldn't hurt. Seriously, a co-op mode would be incredibly fun in this, if it's done properly.\n\nThere isn't really any story in this but it's not important in this case, and the soundtracks as well as the art style (what do you expect, it's pixels) aren't very impressive, but they are not bad for sure, it's pleasant and fitting. The gameplay is the strenght of the game. Considering that it is an early alpha access, pretty much everything is subject to changes, so remember that.\n\nBe warned though, it can get a bit repetitive and/or frustrating if you are out of luck.\n\nOverall, a good mix of strategy, crafting, looting, earning money, pixel art, RPG, prison escaping, hidding mechanics, and a couple more things.\n\nIf the above sounds good enough to you, you may want to give it a try. I very much enjoyed it so far.\n\n7/10 would recommend still would like to see a MP mode.","December 22, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another good feature is that you can create your own crew in the prison if you complete missions from NPCs or if you give them some stuff, if you do this you will earn them confidence and you will be able to create a crew that can help you in beating cops.In Conclusion this game is so good for 15euro price and i hope the multiplayer will appear soon but good.Develpoers pelase take how much time you need to make the multiplayer good.","February 19, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a decent ammount of content as of now (and hopefully some more to come in the future), and i havn't encountered many technical issues yet, couple glitches here and there, but nothing that bothersome with maybe an exception or two. Considering this is an alpha, the ammount of bugs is quite low, and only few of them are actually impactful. You may mix up the controls as they can get a bit confusing at some points, but nothing broken, so it's fine. I had a few responsiveness issues, but it didn't bother me or alter the gameplay.\n\nThe Escapists feels pretty complete already, though more content, and a co-op mode wouldn't hurt. Seriously, a co-op mode would be incredibly fun in this, if it's done properly.\n\nThere isn't really any story in this but it's not important in this case, and the soundtracks as well as the art style (what do you expect, it's pixels) aren't very impressive, but they are not bad for sure, it's pleasant and fitting. The gameplay is the strenght of the game. Considering that it is an early alpha access, pretty much everything is subject to changes, so remember that.\n\nBe warned though, it can get a bit repetitive and/or frustrating if you are out of luck.\n\nOverall, a good mix of strategy, crafting, looting, earning money, pixel art, RPG, prison escaping, hidding mechanics, and a couple more things.\n\nIf the above sounds good enough to you, you may want to give it a try. I very much enjoyed it so far.\n\n7/10 would recommend still would like to see a MP mode.","December 22, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first point of business it has a wide range of tools and a new artistic design on graphics the graphics have been pushed to 2D wich in my opinion gives the game a unique style. The game is as it says in the title you have 5 (and two bonus prisons) wich grow increacingley harder in difficulty, the main aim is to go about the daily routine and in the spare time buy from other inmates the tools requerd to escape in multiple ways each distinctley with there own risks and rewards. The game is a fun twist on the life of an imaate and and entertaining way to waste away a sunday afternoon as you become stressed becauce you were so close to escaping when a guard discovers youre tunnel and robs you of youre tools or the patronising dicision to either wait another day and save or to risk loosing all of youre hard erned tools. however the game lacks in the lenth as each day can be a struggle as the ever repeating time table gets werey fast and for the most part yo must follow this. there is also recentley a map editoe wich gives the players an ability to make there own prisons on the steam workshop however fun this is this is just a beta and currentley has nimerus bugs and gliches but if you persevier it is well worth the effort.\noverall this game is worth a 7/10 this is becauce of the repetative timetable as it gets so boaring in the later stages thanks for reading my take and i hope i have helped you in youre decision to purchase this title. please comment if there is anything i have missed thanks.","April 12, 2015","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most of the game's systems are obtuse and I think the devs expect you to tab out to the wiki to figure out what combines with what.\n\nIt's neat if you want 20-45 minutes of prison sim, but it's not great at being a prison sim.

Yes there is a few weird things in the game such as you cannot craft a sockmace until your intelligence is twenty and also your skills will deplete overtime strength I understand but not intellect. The game would be better with some added things like riots, gangs and one thing that is kinda disturbing but um... Shower rapes seriously make it happen and this will be a full fledged prison sim. Now what would I rate this game out of a ten, ten being the best game I've ever played in the genre and one being the worst in the genre I would give this game a... 8/10 a very good game I reccomend you get this game especially while it's on the discount right now.","February 14, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The end of the day. If you attempt an escape at day, you'll be insta killed by all-seeing snipes placed everywhere. And this is Minimum Security? Anyway...\nMy plan was to get a guard outfit using a contraband bag, crawl into the vents use my plastic utility key and make my way to the roof. I'd use a bedsheet rope to scale down the ceiling, and cut my way out.\nThis is my first time playing this game, remember. I forgot to make a bed dummy, and the guards found my empty cell.\n\n\nSo, I had to do the whole day over again, or have to do the entire escape plan over again.\nThe whole day. So it ended up becoming everytime I found something useful for my escape, I waited for the end of the day so if I got caught, I wouldn't have to buy it from the RNG merchants again. Like, getting the contraband bag was huge hassle. The guards came after me, I got beat up and they took my bag. I had to spend two in game days trying to find a merchant to sell me the damn materials because they sell different stuff each time.\n\nAnyway! I failed my escape attempt, did the whole day over again. I went into the vents and was unscrewing the vent infront of the utility shaft to the roof. I would put down a stepladder to go back up and replace the vents so I wouldn't be teleported instantly to solitary confimement. (which is BS by the way. if they find anything wrong, you'll insta-lose and go to solitary and have to redo the whole day.)\n\nSo, I was unscrewing the vent, unscrewed it and BOOM insta-lose. There just happened to be a guard walking by and saw the vent go up. I just realized that at night, you can't see what's under the vents like you can at day. I had already tried this escape plan 3 times before. First time I got to the roof, but they discovered my empty cell. Redo the day. 2nd time I forgot to get my guard outfit because I had waited the whole day last time. Redo the day. Third time, a guard jsut happened to walk by.\n\nSo now, I have to hope that when I unscrew the vents, a guard wont walk by before I can replace it.\nOr else I'll have to redo the day.\n\n\nI AM SO SICK OF HAVING TO REDO THE DAY.\nThe day's are long and boring once your escape plan is in place. If you mess up, it just becomes waiting until night-time simulator.\n\nThis would all be fixed if I could quick-save. I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing noob at the game, and looking at walkthroughs for the "first day" escape or whatever is, in my mind, cheating.  Just let me quick save at night so I can try again. The people who are good at this game can do ironman mode or whatever but don't ♥♥♥♥ me.\n\nI got ♥♥♥♥ed so many times playing this game. If you wan't to buy this, make sure your plan is foolproof. How do you know it's foolproof? Either a)looking on the internet) (which I think is cheap) or b) trial and error). Trial and error, however, is punished.\n\nSO WHAT THE FOUR HEART SIGNS AM I GONNA DO!?\n\n\nHow ever, the game is still fun for other reasons.\nJust really wish it had quick saving.","February 23, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

An 8-bit strategy game invloving its own crafting system and all about escaping prison.  Yeah, perfect ingredients for a great game.\n\nSome Positives Here:\n-The crafting system is well designed and very simple (its just acquiring some of the materials that's the hard part).\n-The mechanics of the prisons are varied, in terms on jobs, indoors/outdoors, security, etc.\n-Diverse ways of getting out (some are exclusive to certain jails).\n-Just all around fun\n\nOf course not every game is perfect:\n-I didn't like the update of having to complete sequential jails rather than just jumping right into one, I enjoyed occassionally jumping into Iron and realizing I have no idea what to do.\n-Minor glitches, but mostly forgivable\n\nBut overall it's a great game and anyone thinking about getting totally should.","February 28, 2015","true","54.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/recommended/298630/","cyberusuk","CyberusUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/","271 products in account","Developed by Mouldy Toof Studios The Escapists places you in the role of a convicted felon trying to escape from prison. Prison games aren’t the most original of ideas right now, but there take on it is quite unique. It’s currently out on Early Access on steam, so expect bugs and issue’s if you take the plunge. The game has an 8bit style that’s reminiscent of the games on the NES and gives the game a really stylised feel. The Escapists isn’t afraid to poke fun at its self too, you’ll often find yourself chuckling at the odd line a guard says or an awkward moment in the showers.\n\n\nThe main idea is of course to escape, but the game gives you a huge amount of choices on how to do that. Will you build a tunnel under ground, or pose as a guard? Will you climb into the ventilation system or chip through the walls? There is no set method and no dead set rules. But before you even think of escape there are other considerations.\n\nPrison life starts in the morning with role call, this is where you will find out who’s cell will be tossed. If its yours I hope you’ve not left any contraband or signs of escape for the guards to find as this will set you back to square one again, you’ll lose all you’ve worked so hard to acquire and all your holes and false walls will be filled in.\n\n\nAfter role call your day will be broken up into meal periods, exercise time, shower time and free periods/work periods. Through out the day you will be interacting with other inmates, buying items from them or taking jobs from them. These jobs range from acquiring for them a comb shiv to causing a distraction in the showers so your fellow inmates can dish out some rough justice. These jobs will improve your standing with said inmate and earn you money but might cause the victim to take a less positive view of you, eventually they may come looking for revenge. Guards that you’ve had run-ins with in the past might attack you on sight and leave you in the infirmary. You’ll find your constantly walking a popularity tight rope, it adds a nice dynamic to the game.\n\nYour inmate has three skills that he can improve too, strength is the first. Improving strength with bench presses or push ups will increase your health. Speed is the second, this is improved by running on a treadmill or other cardio workouts. This skill is strange as it doesn’t improve your movement speed but rather how fast you can attack. Lastly is your intelligence skill, Improved by browsing the web or other knowledge based ventures. This improves what you can craft and is perhaps the most important skill in the game. You may want to take the time to improve these skills to keep you alive long enough to put you escape plan into action.\n\n\nDon’t be fooled by the cute graphics or stylised charm of The Escapists, the game is not easy. It draws you in with a nice easy tutorial, but that’s it. After this you don’t get any help, your on your own. At times this can be infuriating, when you’ve been struggling for hours to put the perfect escape plan together only to be caught by a slight miss step. But! And its a big but, when you get it right its amazing. The game can be hard, but I can promises you that you’ll find yourself going back for more and more.\n\nFor full review see http://cyberusuk.com/2015/01/27/the-escapists-review-should-it-be-kept-behind/","April 6, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From what I have seen there are a few glitches  in animation and AI but there is nothing game-breaking, and It does lag after a while but saving and loading it back up fixes that. If want to make your prison escape dreams a reality I would suggest this to you and also you could just play this as a prison simulator if you wanted.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smedrek/recommended/298630/","smedrek","Smedrek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smedrek/","201 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been playing this game non-stop for the past few days after I've gotten off work, lets talk good, bad, and ugly\n\nGood: Game has potential, worth the price tag (currently at 10$US). The gameplay is simplistic but it keeps me coming back. It is a fun game all around, and some of the interactions have made me laugh.\n\nBad: Game is almost too simplistic. What I mean by the prior is that, you do the same thing 40 times before you make any headway, which is fine, I understand that the game is in Early Access and it is for a reason, but at the same time, this point of the game development is strictly based around "Let's hope they just get lost in prison", because half my game time is structured around just doing usual prison crap. There isnt any gore which frankly bothers me, I stab a guy forty times with a shiv and it looks like im slapping him with my di**\n\n\nUgly: Holy hot ♥♥♥♥♥ from hell there are spelling errors. The game is based out of the UK, which means "favor" is spelt "favour" these are not the spelling errors im referecing, in the general game itself when you speak to other inmates (of which there is almost little interaction) they say one of like.... 6 poorly spelt phrases and continue on their way, and it isnt meant to be misspelled for "hey its prison these people are stupid effect" it might've just been laziness with the devs..\n\n\nWhat Could We Do to Improve? Im not going to suggest mutliplayer like many others have, I would like to see more prisons, and a bit more strict time lines, I would also like gore and some sort of better violence, perhaps people get released, and new people come in, you might have to share a cell or something. But there are some serious bugs that need to be worked out. When someone punches me, and I punch someone in retailiation, and the cops only see me? I get wailed on for half an hour, and these guys just dont stop, they chase your ♥♥♥ all over, and if you go outside? "BOOM HEADSHOT", yes you get freaking sniped walking outside.\n\nOverall: This game is worth 10$ if it increases Do Not Buy. Bottomline, I have seen small development from this game, and I would like to continue seeing it. If the game becomes mutliplayer, I might just stop playing it all together.","September 12, 2014","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Also, more dlc's, the better (unlike most games where dlc's are crap). You can also now build your own prisons, add prisoner stashes, security perimeters, sniper towers, electrified fence that will fry you, and even a mobile vehicle! But, it takes quite a while to build a prison, aproximatly 0,5h-2h, not to mention editor been confusing and buggy. Game also lacks multiplayer, but makes up for it with workshop support (up to a point).\n\nLong story short:\n\nPros:\n- Great and fun game simulating prison escapes\n- Cheap and great DLC's (I recommend them all)\n- Prison editor and workshop! If you can't escape them, build them!\n\nCons:\n- Prison editor is somewhat buggy and maybe complex a the beggining (NO coding)\n- No controller support (sadly)\n- No multiplayer, what really misses in this game\n\n9/10 people","July 27, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theivanator/recommended/298630/","theivanator","Ivan Ivanovich Ivanowsky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theivanator/","79 products in account","So, I tried playing it again after leaving during Early Access.\n\nAfter making butt loads of custom dialouge for my game (great change, btw) I actually got in and tried to beat the first Prison, Centerperks.\n\nAs far as I can tell, the only way to escape prison is at night. The end of the day. If you attempt an escape at day, you'll be insta killed by all-seeing snipes placed everywhere. And this is Minimum Security? Anyway...\nMy plan was to get a guard outfit using a contraband bag, crawl into the vents use my plastic utility key and make my way to the roof. I'd use a bedsheet rope to scale down the ceiling, and cut my way out.\nThis is my first time playing this game, remember. I forgot to make a bed dummy, and the guards found my empty cell.\n\n\nSo, I had to do the whole day over again, or have to do the entire escape plan over again.\nThe whole day. So it ended up becoming everytime I found something useful for my escape, I waited for the end of the day so if I got caught, I wouldn't have to buy it from the RNG merchants again. Like, getting the contraband bag was huge hassle. The guards came after me, I got beat up and they took my bag. I had to spend two in game days trying to find a merchant to sell me the damn materials because they sell different stuff each time.\n\nAnyway! I failed my escape attempt, did the whole day over again. I went into the vents and was unscrewing the vent infront of the utility shaft to the roof. I would put down a stepladder to go back up and replace the vents so I wouldn't be teleported instantly to solitary confimement. (which is BS by the way. if they find anything wrong, you'll insta-lose and go to solitary and have to redo the whole day.)\n\nSo, I was unscrewing the vent, unscrewed it and BOOM insta-lose. There just happened to be a guard walking by and saw the vent go up. I just realized that at night, you can't see what's under the vents like you can at day. I had already tried this escape plan 3 times before. First time I got to the roof, but they discovered my empty cell. Redo the day. 2nd time I forgot to get my guard outfit because I had waited the whole day last time. Redo the day. Third time, a guard jsut happened to walk by.\n\nSo now, I have to hope that when I unscrew the vents, a guard wont walk by before I can replace it.\nOr else I'll have to redo the day.\n\n\nI AM SO SICK OF HAVING TO REDO THE DAY.\nThe day's are long and boring once your escape plan is in place. If you mess up, it just becomes waiting until night-time simulator.\n\nThis would all be fixed if I could quick-save. I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing noob at the game, and looking at walkthroughs for the "first day" escape or whatever is, in my mind, cheating.  Just let me quick save at night so I can try again. The people who are good at this game can do ironman mode or whatever but don't ♥♥♥♥ me.\n\nI got ♥♥♥♥ed so many times playing this game. If you wan't to buy this, make sure your plan is foolproof. How do you know it's foolproof? Either a)looking on the internet) (which I think is cheap) or b) trial and error). Trial and error, however, is punished.\n\nSO WHAT THE FOUR HEART SIGNS AM I GONNA DO!?\n\n\nHow ever, the game is still fun for other reasons.\nJust really wish it had quick saving.","February 23, 2015","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gkbsteam/recommended/298630/","gkbsteam","GryphonKingBros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gkbsteam/","27 products in account","The Escapist is an awesome sandbox prison game where you take the role of a prisoner that you can name and choose a look. The game provides a tutorial, three save files, six challenging prison maps to escape, four DLCs, a whole community of map makers and the tools to make your own map with the additional Escapists: Map Maker (comes along with the purchase of The Escapists)\n\nStart off with daily routine and earn cash by doing jobs for the prison or for fellow cellmates, steal from guards and cellmates, craft dozens of unique tools and weapons, break open vents, dig underground tunnels, make gangs; whatever required to escape the prison! I highly reccomend it for those who love strategic games and crafting games. I'd give it 4 Stars and a 9/10. There still are some glitches like the NPCs getting confused when you sit in a seat the bots target to sit in at lunch and some just annoying things like the player immediatly getting sent to solitary while trying to escape. (guards should just come out and find the player if they are to be caught.) Developers should fix this but those are small details that don't ruin the entire game. They have gotten annoying to me though. Anyways 4 Stars/ 9 out of 10!","March 25","true","78.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another good feature is that you can create your own crew in the prison if you complete missions from NPCs or if you give them some stuff, if you do this you will earn them confidence and you will be able to create a crew that can help you in beating cops.In Conclusion this game is so good for 15euro price and i hope the multiplayer will appear soon but good.Develpoers pelase take how much time you need to make the multiplayer good.","February 19, 2015","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/recommended/298630/","cyberusuk","CyberusUK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberusuk/","271 products in account","Developed by Mouldy Toof Studios The Escapists places you in the role of a convicted felon trying to escape from prison. Prison games aren’t the most original of ideas right now, but there take on it is quite unique. It’s currently out on Early Access on steam, so expect bugs and issue’s if you take the plunge. The game has an 8bit style that’s reminiscent of the games on the NES and gives the game a really stylised feel. The Escapists isn’t afraid to poke fun at its self too, you’ll often find yourself chuckling at the odd line a guard says or an awkward moment in the showers.\n\n\nThe main idea is of course to escape, but the game gives you a huge amount of choices on how to do that. Will you build a tunnel under ground, or pose as a guard? Will you climb into the ventilation system or chip through the walls? There is no set method and no dead set rules. But before you even think of escape there are other considerations.\n\nPrison life starts in the morning with role call, this is where you will find out who’s cell will be tossed. If its yours I hope you’ve not left any contraband or signs of escape for the guards to find as this will set you back to square one again, you’ll lose all you’ve worked so hard to acquire and all your holes and false walls will be filled in.\n\n\nAfter role call your day will be broken up into meal periods, exercise time, shower time and free periods/work periods. Through out the day you will be interacting with other inmates, buying items from them or taking jobs from them. These jobs range from acquiring for them a comb shiv to causing a distraction in the showers so your fellow inmates can dish out some rough justice. These jobs will improve your standing with said inmate and earn you money but might cause the victim to take a less positive view of you, eventually they may come looking for revenge. Guards that you’ve had run-ins with in the past might attack you on sight and leave you in the infirmary. You’ll find your constantly walking a popularity tight rope, it adds a nice dynamic to the game.\n\nYour inmate has three skills that he can improve too, strength is the first. Improving strength with bench presses or push ups will increase your health. Speed is the second, this is improved by running on a treadmill or other cardio workouts. This skill is strange as it doesn’t improve your movement speed but rather how fast you can attack. Lastly is your intelligence skill, Improved by browsing the web or other knowledge based ventures. This improves what you can craft and is perhaps the most important skill in the game. You may want to take the time to improve these skills to keep you alive long enough to put you escape plan into action.\n\n\nDon’t be fooled by the cute graphics or stylised charm of The Escapists, the game is not easy. It draws you in with a nice easy tutorial, but that’s it. After this you don’t get any help, your on your own. At times this can be infuriating, when you’ve been struggling for hours to put the perfect escape plan together only to be caught by a slight miss step. But! And its a big but, when you get it right its amazing. The game can be hard, but I can promises you that you’ll find yourself going back for more and more.\n\nFor full review see http://cyberusuk.com/2015/01/27/the-escapists-review-should-it-be-kept-behind/","April 6, 2015","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Decision. Ever. Been playing for ages, stealing from desks at breakfast and working out. It's very addictive and I can't even figure out why! But I love it. I've always liked playing prison servers on Minecraft and this is much more fun than them. Anyone who's a fan of those kinds of servers should DEFINITELY get this game.\n\nThere is only one con I can think of, which is sometimes when I'm making my way to my job at the metalworks, I'll be walking down and guards will attack me for no apparent reason, even though I don't usually carry contraband. After they kill me I'll be walking back to my job and they'll be yelling at me to get back to work, which will increase my guard heat.\n\nBut overall it's a great game, and it's in Early Access so there's still loads to be added. I'm exited for any further release.","September 2, 2014","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The trick to this game is patience, it took me over 60 days to pass the first level, it is also an enraging game. The rage part are the cops, they are always snooping around somewhere and somehow always figure out things you've done. This game is also good for those who like easy survival.

Also, more dlc's, the better (unlike most games where dlc's are crap). You can also now build your own prisons, add prisoner stashes, security perimeters, sniper towers, electrified fence that will fry you, and even a mobile vehicle! But, it takes quite a while to build a prison, aproximatly 0,5h-2h, not to mention editor been confusing and buggy. Game also lacks multiplayer, but makes up for it with workshop support (up to a point).\n\nLong story short:\n\nPros:\n- Great and fun game simulating prison escapes\n- Cheap and great DLC's (I recommend them all)\n- Prison editor and workshop! If you can't escape them, build them!\n\nCons:\n- Prison editor is somewhat buggy and maybe complex a the beggining (NO coding)\n- No controller support (sadly)\n- No multiplayer, what really misses in this game\n\n9/10 people","July 27, 2015","true","22.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I ended up needing to look at the wiki for some recipes, because waiting untill you find a worthy crafting note takes way too much time.\n\nRegardless of this, it's cool you can find your own way to break out, you could plan your whole evil masterplan to break out, or just use plastic cutlery to cut the fence on level 1 (which I later discovered). The great thing about this is that you kinda need to find a new way on each level, as it gets progressively harder.\n\nThe visuals are pleasing, audio is quite nice for a 2D game and I like the fact that gameplay-wise you can just take your time to observe your environment, get familiar with the prison schedule and you don't get punished by the game for taking your time and just following the prison guidelines.\n\nPros:\n- Great difficulty curve (once you get familiar with the game)\n- Custom levels and level editor (so you don't have to regret buying the game once you finish it)\n- Pleasing graphics and good audio\n- Controls are okay\n\nCons:\n- May become repetitive after a while (Even with the level editor, but hey, everything gets repetitive eventually)\n- Tutorial tends to overlook some stuff (like how to unlock crafting recipes, recruit prisoners, etc.)\n\nNevertheless, had tons of fun playing this game, I do recommend it for any 2D stealth/freeroam loving person like me.\n\nA multiplayer/co-op mode would basically be heaven\n\nDecent to strong 8","February 3","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gkbsteam/recommended/298630/","gkbsteam","GryphonKingBros","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gkbsteam/","27 products in account","The Escapist is an awesome sandbox prison game where you take the role of a prisoner that you can name and choose a look. The game provides a tutorial, three save files, six challenging prison maps to escape, four DLCs, a whole community of map makers and the tools to make your own map with the additional Escapists: Map Maker (comes along with the purchase of The Escapists)\n\nStart off with daily routine and earn cash by doing jobs for the prison or for fellow cellmates, steal from guards and cellmates, craft dozens of unique tools and weapons, break open vents, dig underground tunnels, make gangs; whatever required to escape the prison! I highly reccomend it for those who love strategic games and crafting games. I'd give it 4 Stars and a 9/10. There still are some glitches like the NPCs getting confused when you sit in a seat the bots target to sit in at lunch and some just annoying things like the player immediatly getting sent to solitary while trying to escape. (guards should just come out and find the player if they are to be caught.) Developers should fix this but those are small details that don't ruin the entire game.

Pick one of 6 prisons and try to escape in multiple ways. Seems simple, but turns out to offer quite a challenge. Get used to the mechanics in the first prison, then move on to harder ones, with different escape methods and different routines, locations and mechanics.\n9/10","March 5, 2015","true","74.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wanted an option to upgrade these pixel graphic like the escapists Walking Dead, it would be awesome (yes I know, it's another game engine but why console get better graphic than pc ? ) And it's my only huge regret after playing the walking dead escapists, I was expecting similar graphics..\nNot much prisons so more good prison maps made by the devs (because community creations are all buggy xD)\n\n9/10 :)\n","November 5, 2015","true","65.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's challenging to those who refuse to look up recipes (like me), but still fun even if you do. Learning to make new and unique items is one of the best aspects of this game (Planning your escape route and starting full out riots isn't far behind.) Plus the new map builder is a great way to make this experience endless! I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the RPG, Sandbox, and even the Strategy generes of gaming. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I have.\n\n9.5/10 (Would give it a 10/10 but I have encountered a few game breaking bugs in my travels, but if they fixed them then consider it a 10/10.)","May 14, 2015","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Dont let the graphics fool you this is a fantastic and well made game. You well have to craft weapons and various tools too aid your escape. You can also buy tools from your fellow inmates. You can earn money by doing the job the prison has asigned you or you can get some quick cash by doing your inmates dirty work. You well need to keep it cool with the other prisoners or they might get angry with you and they might turn violent you also want to keep your repuation good with the gaurds becuase they can make your life misruble in the slammer. There is also DOWNLAODIBLE CONTENT in the WORKSHOP so you can always downlaod new prisons and maps if you get board. So over all i give this game a 7 out of 10 its a good game with nice game play mechanics and i highly recommend i.","December 30, 2015","true","60.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
