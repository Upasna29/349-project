"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyy/recommended/259530/","shyy","Shyy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shyy/","201 products in account","Savant, Aleksander Vinter, is one of my favorite electronic musicians. I became a huge fan of his music ever since the first tune of his I heard. He dabbles in dubstep, glitch hop, electro, house, complextro, and some other styles. The superb music is great in this game! It really goes well with the intense action. The gameplay, so far, has been fast, fluid, exciting, and challenging. The CDs you complete for new powers are aquired fairly quickly. I've only played for about ten minutes and already have all but two pieces, of four, for the last CD. Being that Savant is a musician I, honestly, didn't expect much from this game but I wanted to support the artist for all the wonderful songs he's made. I'm glad that I was proven wrong. For the measly $2 you need to spend to buy Savant - Ascent I most certainly got my money's worth. When I'm done with this review I'm turning up my speakers and going to jam out while slaying baddies some more. There even appears to be a mini-boss enemy and I'm hoping that there will eventually be a final boss.\n\nPros:\n- Fluid animations\n- Crisp old-school graphics\n- AMAZING SOUNDTRACK!!!!\n- Challenging, but enjoyable\n\nCons:\n- None, I don't know what else I could ask for with the small $2 price tag.\n\nBottom line:\nIf you're a fan of electronic music, or Savant himself, then you should immediately buy this game. Anyone could play it and enjoy themselves for at least an hour. Seriously, guys and gals, it's no more expensive than a candybar but the gameplay, plus the music, is a much sweeter experience!","December 4, 2013","true","0.6"," 186 of 204 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","186","204","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rekkonin/recommended/259530/","Rekkonin","Sarge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rekkonin/","1129 products in account","Savant - Ascent is a pretty short, absolutely gorgeous, and entirely unique game. It's fast, fun, simple enough to pick up in minutes, and deep enough to warrant long discussions and in-depth guides, and still leave room for new discoveries. The first release from D-Pad Studio (to my knowledge), made in collaboration with the titular musical artist, Savant (Aleksander Vinter), this is definitely a good example of how to make a game the right way.\n\nStory mode is pretty short, consisting of only 5 levels that each take 2-5 minutes (except perhaps the final boss), and the gameplay itself is very simple, consisting of attacking enemies and moving between 2 platforms (and sometimes not even the latter). However, the game really shines through in its ability to stretch everything it offers to the limit. Story mode done? Try to race yourself, your friends, and the rest of the world with time attack, or go for an all-time highscore in endless mode. Maybe [SPOILERS] don the mask of the vanquished Vario and replay story mode with different attacks and movement for a change-up. During play, collect CD pieces from special enemies to unlock bonus soundtracks and new abilities, working your way up to obtaining the ultimate power that is the whole reason you're at the tower. Then try to take on the final boss, a lighting-fast, teleporting robot samurai in space with laser-shark friends who want nothing more than to see you reduced to a pile of ashes with a silly hat. And when all of that's done, maybe think about unlocking all of the achievements in the game. There aren't a lot of them, but when you accomplish them for the first time, they are certainly deserving of the name; the devs intentionally made them difficult to accomplish so it would actually be worth getting them and not just some extra stuff they threw in on a lazy Friday.\n\nThe music and visuals of Savant - Ascent also need to be mentioned; and they are both spectacular. The soundtrack is entirely composed by Savant himself and each song goes perfectly with the crazy, upbeat feel of the game. Some parts of the game even feature specific music not available in the 7 records you unlock, and the final boss seems to fight you to the beat of the music playing in the background. The graphics are simple, 16-bit images with that nice comfortable, retro, pixel-y feel while still being grand and beautiful (seriously, take a second to look at the background in the screenshots or during play).\n\nFor a while, there were two extra unlockable versions the game: GOTY and X-MAS versions, which changed the look of the enemies and added a nice little change. They aren't currently available as of writing this, but maybe X-MAS will come back for the holidays, and perhaps GOTY will come back in a patch or a further update.\n\nNow for the price. I'm sure this is a big issue for a lot of people, and it definitely is a factor for me. Luckily, this game costs only $2! If you can't quite afford that, maybe it'll go on sale for 50% during one of steams big sale events. I would say this game is definitely worth more money than just 2 dollars, but I'm more than happy to pay just that to play the game.\n\nAlright, this is getting lengthy... In summary, I would absolutely recommend this game to everyone, even if it's just to try the unusual gameplay for a few minutes. The music is great, the visuals are stunning, the features play off of each other perfectly and the Devs obviously knew what they were doing when designing the unlockables, achievements, special abilities, enemies, and levels. Play this game. Seriously, though, play it.","December 4, 2013","true","72.5"," 152 of 161 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","152","161","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/259530/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Savant - Ascent is a sort of twin stick shooter bullet hell type game. You are essentially rooted to two spots on each level, you can roll between them to avoid enemies, jump up and down, and that's it - although this sounds like it is restricting, you soon realize that it's all you need, and you probably don't need an extra thing to think about, so having just two positions is quite a good idea.\n\nThe art style is very nice. A lot of games are taking on this graphic style, and rightfully still as it does look good. The sprites of the main character and all the enemies look awesome too. Now, the music, if you are into electro/dubstep music, you may just have stumbled upon a gold mine. The sound track to Savant is amazing, there are about six different tracks to unlock and each of them is probably one of the best soundtracks you'll ever hear. I am surprised they haven't released the sound track as its own download to be honest!\n\nEach of the levels is presented very well; the aim is to just kill everything on screen for a number of minutes, nothing too complex. The game does get increasingly difficult though, it will probably take you a few tries on each level before you get to grips with what you have to do. The last two stages probably had me raging more than any other game I've played. That brings me onto game length, the game is very short, I managed to finish the story in just about an hour, while this is short, there are two other game modes that will keep the replayability going. I can see some people have over 100 hours in this game purely from these modes bringing them back for more.\n\nI would say Savant - Ascent has a place in most people's library, it's short and sweet and for £1, 59, you can't really go wrong can you?\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I didn't think of this much at first to be honest. When I started it and realised that the character wasn't moving freely, only hopping between two possible spots while shooting enemies, it seemed very limited to me. Everything was happening in this confined area without the possibility of going anywhere. That early impression wasn't fair. As it turned out the strength of this game lies elsewhere.\n\nThe gameplay is generally about shooting swarms of enemies with your character's powers, who can fire magic missiles from his hands at really high speed. Lots of sweeping action as you clear them out while dodging them when they charge. Music plays an important role in this game and while I may not normally listen to this sort of music, it's very appropriate for such a fast paced game.\n\nThe real fun comes from obtaining new abilities and learning how to use them effectively to become even better. In fact... Every ability you unlock is something new, but having a big impact on the gameplay. It forces you to change your habits to get used to the new mechanic, as it gives you decisive advantage that helps you make even greater progress. The abilities are unlocked along with new music tracks that you collect as you play and once you have them all, you can also obtain a secret ability (if you figure out how or look it up) which leads you to possessing unbelieveable power that you'll need to prove your true ability in the Endless mode.\n\nOverall this was fun!","June 9, 2014","true","14.1"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","2"

After going on a five hour binge of playing the game, I can contest that it's not just a competent game, but rather great at what it does. The controls feel extremely responsive (I've used mouse & keyboard), the animations are well-excecuted, and there is no dull moment.\n\nYou start the game with only a rudimentary set of skills – and it's hard in the beginning (or at least was for me), however, you unlock extra abilities by progressing through the levels and game modes. You can probably beat the Story Mode in half an hour or so, but that's where the fun begins. Time Attack Mode is over quickly and good for a short game, while Endless Mode is where the real challenge lies – i.e. in defeating neverending ways of enemies, each wave stronger than the last.\nThe skills you unlock are tied in with six different music tracks you can change at will, all of which are great (and I'm not a huge fan of electronic music, in general).\n\nIt took me five hours to unlock all the different skills and get every achievement in the game – extremely good value, considering the price point of the game, I'd say. One thing to consider is, however, that this will be most enjoyable if you are into score attack games – beating the game once does not take very long, as I said. If you want to challenge yourself (and beat your friends' score, maybe?), though, this might be the ideal game for you.","April 9, 2014","true","8.8"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

On the contrary I actively detested it, but it seems I must have been hearing the wrong stuff, as more and more I find myself eating my own words as I fall in love with some immensely talented artists who make up the genre. The latest of those is Aleksander Vinter A.K.A Savant, a musician whose catalog is a blur of sounds and styles, and who is now the protagonist of his own video game: Savant Ascent.\n\nA mixture of up-scrolling shooting and quick back and forth jumping, Ascent feels and plays unlike anything before it. Simple controls compliment the hefty difficulty as you attempt to stay alive through the onslaught of enemies, only able to move from one platform to the other as you make your way to the top of the tower. Enemies occasionally drop pieces of CDs, which on top of giving you a new slice of the soundtrack, rewards you with a new ability to use in combat. It's arcade nature lends itself very well to hi-score chasing, and the relentlessly quick pacing makes it hard to put down no matter how many times you die.\n\nSavant Ascend is nothing less than an absolute blast, and although it's a short run (I beat it in an hour, though it will likely take less for most players) it is abundantly replayable whether that be going for a new best score, racing through time trials, or seeing how long you can last in endless mode. It looks brilliant, sounds even better, and costs less than a cup of coffee!\n\nWith blistering action, tight gameplay, and loads of wub wub, whether you are already a fan of Savant or not this is something you ought to be playing!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 13, 2013","true","1.4"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/recommended/259530/","slothyexistence","The Slothful Existentialist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slothyexistence/","952 products in account","Overview:Savant - Ascent is a 2D twin stick shooter developed by small indie dev team D-Pad Studios. The game was made using GameMaker and won the GameMaker GOTY award for 2013, it also won Gullstikka Norwegian GOTY 2014. It’s got much replay value with beating previous high-scores and attempting to be ranked in the leaderboards. It is based on real-life EDM artist Savant (Aleksander Vinter), who also provides the soundtrack straight from some of his albums. Savant - Ascent is available on Steam, Google Play, and the App Store.\n\n\nStory:Savant has been expelled from his tower by an evil Orb, as a result he needs to shoot and dodge his way back up the tower, defeating waves of enemies as he ascends.\n\nHigher up the tower are even more powerful enemies, enemies against which your skill will truly be tested. Are you ready for the challenge that lies beyond the tower?\n\n\nGameplay:Shooting and dodging are the game's main gameplay mechanics. The player shoots a burst of bullets before the shots become rapid-fire, dodging and taking down mobs also builds up energy that make your shots stronger. When enough energy is collected the player can shoot a powerful shot that mostly one-hit-kills enemies.\n\nThere is a variety of enemies in the game, ranging from small ones with different amounts of mechanics to big worm-like enemies with destroyable sections. There is also boss battles, which are challenging if the player fails to notice patterns and are careless. The enemies come in hordes, and if they’re not picked off in the order they spawn then you may have some crowd control to deal with, the burst shots help a lot with that. Throughout the whole game there are CD fragments, four of which form one full CD. CDs unlock more songs on the soundtrack and also unlock different abilities and buffs for the player.\n\nThere’s Story Mode, Endless Mode, and a Time Attack mode. You unlock latter two modes by beating the Story Mode. In endless you can try and beat your highscore and also rank high on the leaderboards; same with the timed mode, you can try to beat your time and rank high on the leaderboards. Good old arcade-style gameplay model, which give the game a high replay value.\n\nNow, the Void Update.\nWith the Void Update a whole other section was added to the game, and this section is much, much harder. It adds more enemies with different mechanics, and it also adds a new boss, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to beat, to say the least.\n\n\nVisual:The graphics are an overload of visual stimulation. The sprites are fairly detailed and animations are fluous. Explosions and shots are brightly coloured and debris and particle effects are eye candy. Amazing art. Just wait until you fight the space-samurai, just wait.\n\n\nSound:8-bit sound effects and Savant’s music make this game’s audio something unique but at the same time nostalgic. Aleksander Vinter (Savant) has savant syndrome, this makes him able to remember every musical sound he’s ever heard as well as make massive amounts of music in short periods of time. In his lifetime he’s made over 10,000 songs; since adopting the alias “Savant” he has released eleven albums, seven EPs, and twelve singles. He has no definitive genre or sound, and is constantly experimenting with his music.\n\nFor this game he chose most songs from his dubstep-sounding albums: Alchemist, Cult, ISM, Ninur, Orakel, Vario, and Overkill. Not including the musical scores made specifically for the game.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts:Gameplay this simple and this addicting takes ingenuity to develop. D-Pad Studios took a world based on Savant’s music and fleshed it out into a full universe. The Alchemist from the album Alchemist, Vario from the album Vario, and the Samurai from the album Protos.\n\nPersonally, I bought this game simply because I’m a huge fan, had ‘Savant’ in its name, and because the trailer was featuring his music. What I was surprised to encounter was a ridiculously fun game with an amazing soundtrack and crazy good visuals. A must have for Savant fans and twin stick shooters alike.","May 30","true","10.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

I did not expect much, considering the low price, but the game really delivers.\nIt plays a bit like an old school 2D arcade game, the graphics and pacing definitely remind me of that era.\n\nGraphics are very sharp, controls are simple and responsive, and the music, which is more or less the focus of the game, is great.\n\nMy only problem with the game is, considering the nature of enemy attacks, I'd much rather have the view zoomed out at all times (or at least have an option). The camera is always zoomed in VERY close to the character and the only way to see enemies is to pan with your cursor, which you're already using for shooting 100% of the time... So even though you're given off-screen markers for charging enemies, that's still far from ideal.\n\nAlso, no Steam overlay on Mac (yet?), meaning no achievements or screenshots for Mac users.","December 30, 2013","true","0.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

I have to admit that I have no idea about what I should talk about first. When I bought, for 2$, I never expected it to give me so many hours of fun. I thought it would be a 15 minutes game and that I'd never launch it again after finishing it. Looking at my time in game might inform you of how wrong I was.\n\nShort version : If you're looking for a 2D shmup with an awesome OST, go for it.\n\nLonger version : I was already a fan of Savant and his other works (as Vinter in Hollywood/Vegas, and his other band names) before knowing the game. When I discovered the game, I didn't think I'd appreciate it so much. First of all, the songs of the OST, which are Savant's work from different albums (Alchemist, Overkill, ISM, Vario, Orakel and Cult), fit perfectly in the nervous gameplay. The difficulty which increases along the levels is here, but it isn't too big, and it permits to have fun even after the twentieth try (gotta admit I ragequited a few times, but that's another story). And when you're finished with the five levels and if you love tryharding and competition, you'll love the Endless and Time Trial mode, which require some patience and skills (and ragequits) to master. Also, the characters from Savant's lore like Vario, the Samurai (spoiler : they are the bosses (spoiler: they're ♥♥♥♥ing hard at first)) and the Alchemist (the protagonist, who can be seen on Alchemist's album cover) aren't too much (I don't know how to say it, so I'll just assume you got the idea). The only thing that's bad for the game in my opinion are the bugs, but they're funnier than boring and the developer listens to the player and push updates from time to time.\n\ntl;dr savant memes tryhard godlike ost GOTY (got it ?) game 10/10","April 8, 2015","true","92.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","3"

It's only 2 bucks, and the meat of the game is fantastic! Honestly, you can stop reading now, sacrifice just one vending machine trip, and purchase the game, it's good.\n\nBut if you want to know more, then know this. Though the game play is enjoyable, and the presentation top shelf, it's a small game. There's not a lot in the way of extra features, even the options menu is relatively lacking, and I suspect the difficulty, though satisfying, was cranked up to hide the game's low content. But with that said, know that what is there, is exceptionally well crafted! Think of it as fine cuisine. You get just enough to be full, and while you were tasting it, it was some of the best you've had, except this game doesn't come at the cost of fine cuisine!\n\nIf you've made it this far into the impression, just ignore every thing you read and buy the damn game.

The soundtrack is one of the game's biggest selling points, with intense, fitting tracks that keep the action flowing. The game is somewhat short, but this is only due to it being early in development (I hope, at least; devs should continue to add more content). I almost wish that I would have waited for the price to go up so I could support this developer with more than 2 dollars. I'd have been happy with $10 in it's current state. I do think that there are some glitches still, which I anticipate the developers will work out. I hope that everyone reading this will buy this great game and give such a skillful development team the support they deserve.","December 4, 2013","true","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you are a high score chaser then you'll get a lot more out of the game, but I'm not really.\n\nThe gameplay primarily consists of jumping or rolling between 2 platforms while spamming bullets at monsters, and using a special super attack once you've filled up your bar by shooting things with your regular attack. You have to unlock abilities though, by collecting CD shards. There are 4 of these abilities and you can't beat the final boss without at least 1 of them, so don't worry about dying on the way there, since that is the only way to turn in your CD shards.\n\nThis is really interesting idea, a sort of micro-game to promote Savant's music, while actually being pretty fun to play.","December 4, 2013","true","0.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Completely. This was possibly the best example of a music action game I have seen in a long time, even up against games like Beat Hazard and Audiosurf, two classics that are by no means easy to conquer themselves.\nThis game has an amazing sound-track that you won't soon forget, even if you don't like the genre; it fits the pixelled graphics so well you almost feel no other music could have ever belonged on this game.\n\nMechanic wise, it's a simple but brilliant system; protect yourself from enemies by shooting and dodging. What makes it brilliant, you ask? Several reasons.\n1. You have only 2 platforms on which to move about, with 2 ways of achieving movement between them (Jumping through the air or just dodging left and right.)\n2. The number of enemies you face in even just the campaign makes this beat-based defense tricky.\n\nEven when you can predict /when/ the enemy is coming, can you predict how many and where from? Not without some practice and those ever precious Gold CD's that give you even cooler music to work with as well as powering up your Alchemist.\n\nI reccomend buying this even at full price.","July 27, 2014","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Although, it will probably take you at least 40 minutes to complete. To me anyway, there was a definite learning curve. It will probably take you tons of tries to complete the story mode unless you're like some machine. But once you beat it, it will be easy. I probably died 30 times trying to complete it. After I beat it, I played the story mode again, and didn't die once in the whole thing.\n\nAfter completing the story mode, you will unlock the vario version of story mode, time attack, and endless mode. Don't think you're done once you beat the main story.\n\nIf you like dubstep, you'll love the music and probably the game. If dubstep isn't your thing, you probably won't like this, but there are some more mellow songs. Unlocking the 6 CDs which give you special powers is very fun, challenging, and also a cool and unique concept. I still have the last CD to unlock.\n\nI would give the game a 7.5/10. It doesn't have the most content and the design is simple, but it's very entertaining and definitely worth the price. It's even better for a sale price of 99 cents.\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It revolves around a mysterious figure, who aims to climb a tower in order to find the secret source of magic. Countless and diverse types of enemies try to hinder him and you need to help him getting rid of the evil forces that guard the philosopher's stone.\n\nDesign & Art The game is nicely designed and features an original gothical artstyle. The character and enemies look very detailed and well animated. In my opinion, the visuals were crafted with tender, love and care, they positively enhance the atmosphere of the game.\n\nControls Controls are pretty straightforward; you aim with the mouse and the game offers a tutorial for the moves you are able to do. Also, the Savant - Ascent features complete controller support, for people who want to play that way. Nice!\n\nSound & Music The soundtrack is what keeps this game alive. The game features a set of electronic/dubstep songs, that accompany you during your play. In my opinion, the music is really awesome and makes the game feel more arcady, even without repeating chiptunes!\n\nSounds are nice too. Overall, the sound of the game enhances the gameplay and lets you feel the action from start to finish. It really feels like you are playing an arcade game!\n\nGameplay The gameplay is kept simple: you, enemies, shooting, surviving. You aim in the general direction enemies are in and shoot. That's it. Disc parts you can find or unlock throughout the game will give you a new track you can listen to, but they also grant you a special power (more damage etc.). There are different powers and all of them make you somewhat stronger. Try to find all of them, in order to beat the endgame content this game has to offer!\n\nChain up kills to increase your score multiplier and reach that sweet, sweet highscore in the leaderboards. But be careful not to get hit, since it reduces your multiplier, aswell as your lives. Three hits and it is game over for you!\n\nNext to a small story, this game features and endless mode, in which you have to survive as long as possible (and consecutively gain very many points). Lastly, there is a timed mode for the storymode, in which you will need to beat the game as fast as possible. Small eastereggs are also included.\n\nWeakpoints Unfortunatly, music is (as always) a matter of taste. If you feel a strong dislike for said music, I would advise against buying this product.\n\nBe aware of the fact that this game is short and might not keep you engaged for a very long time. Fortunatly, the shortness is compensated with its price. Consider it a tasty snack you discover, so tasty you want to savor it by not eating it too often.\n\nConcluding Thoughts Savant - Ascent is a game that could really be called a new age arcade game.\n\nFor a game that small in size and content, I really had lots of fun with it. The soundtrack enhanced my complete experience with it and kept my heart pumping and my head banging. The gameplay feels overly satisfying, wrecking some enemies with POWER OVERWHELMING has never felt that good for me.\n\nSo you should definetly give it a try, because Savant - Ascent took the term "Brevity is the soul of wit." and "Sometimes, less is more." very literal. So literal, that I can't even believe I didn't spend more than two dollars on this game.\n\nFriendly advice: Just be careful not to headbang too much or you'll wake up with neck muscle hangover the next day.","March 27","true","7.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The soundtrack alone would be a steal but you get an excellent game too!\n\nThe core gameplay of Savant - Ascent is quite simple but don't let that deter you. Its fluid, pulse raising action is a blast to play. The difficulty curve is just right for most of the game but got a bit steep for my liking right near the end. A steady stream of unlocks keeps things fresh throughout the main story and avoids overwhelming you. This isn't a very long game but it includes a few extras like time trial and endless modes that will please you if you like a challenge.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that the final boss gets away from the frenetic gameplay and instead becomes an exercise in memorizing a static sequence of attacks. While the fight has an epic air to it, it lost the fun factor for me and became a chore to overcome in order to see the ending. Without spoiling anything, the ending suggests that the developers had more planned but it's unlikely that we'll see an expansion telling the rest. That is disappointing but considering that the story is told solely through short, nonverbal cutscenes, you can't claim that story was ever this game's strength or focus.\n\nIf you like electronic music you should enjoy the fantastic soundtrack. All the songs are accessible in .ogg format in the game's main files folder (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\SavantAscent ). It's a testament to their quality that many of the tracks have found their way into my music library.\n\n8/10","October 18, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

That is why I picked up this game. For those of you who do not know Savant, he is an EDM artist, with a unique style.\n\nI went into this game expecting some awesome music and exciting gameplay, and was not disappointed.\n\nThe game is essentially a really fast paced shooter, like a lot of “shoot-em-up” games. Although I feel like the game would have worked better as a flash game, the price is reasonably low, so it’s justifiable. The game begins with a very primitive story told in a series of pictures, featuring the man himself, with his own music playing. Although the story is really not necessary, it is a nice little touch.\n\nYou’ll find yourself engaged in combat as soon as you’re in control of the game. A series of robots float around the screen before tumbling towards you if not killed quick enough. There are different types of these machines and you’ll need to keep on shooting at them to be able to progress the level. There are three levels total, with the last containing a surprisingly difficult boss battle.\n\nIt took me quite some time to beat the last level, but the game only took me around 40 minutes to beat. The game has some replayability in the form of high scores, and for me, speed runs. The only real difference in running through the game again is to use the power-ups earned through collecting four disc pieces. These pieces will assemble to form a new power-up.\n\nThe game has its fair share of technical flaws, however. It cannot run at a resolution of 1080p, which I found quite irritating. There are checkpoints in the game, but my game crashed at one point and, upon reloading it, the game failed to place me back at my previous checkpoint, even though I still had the abilities that I had unlocked prior to the crash.\n\nI was also surprised by the lack of documentation on how to even play the game correctly. Sure, it looks self-explanatory, but I found myself confused on how to progress through the game. I figured out after about ten minutes of mindless blasting, but I would have liked to have known what to do from the start.\n\nOverall, the game certainly appeals to fans of Savant and just about all EDM fans at that, but it lacks heavily in content. If you’re up for some fast-paced shooting with great music playing, then this is the game for you.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwTe_M55lOc","December 4, 2013","true","0.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

So I had to add it to my collection of games, I only recently decided to play it, until then it had just been sat in my libary being uninstalled and unplayed. I'm glad I decided to play it..\n\nThe game itself if amazing, a really fantastic soundtrack, given you like Savant's music, it is all out chaos, colours, explosions, and just generally fun. There's Story mode, Time attack and Endless mode. Story mode is fairly straight forward go from A to B killing things, when B is reached theres gonna be a little cutscene and then a boss fight, then a cutscene. Simple really. Time attack is story mode but the enemys spawn faster, hence, you need to kill them faster, and then you get through the story in little to no time - about 2 to 3 minutes for me boss time depending. Finally there's Endless mode which is the second level for an extended period of time. The second level happens to be a elevator ride up, so you go up and up and up killing things. It gets progressively harder but I've found with each go I get a little bit futher by learning a new little tactic or plan or whatever.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly simplistic, you have a left and right platform that you can move between to dodge incoming attacks. The control give a good idea of how simplistic the game is:\nLeft mouse button: - Shoot/Pick up CDs\nArrow-keys/WASD-keys: - Dodge/Jump\nRight mouse button/Down/S-key - Shoot special attack(when unlocked)\nSpace/Ctrl/Shift - Ignore CD pickups\nQ - Pick up closest CD\n\nIt's a pretty good/great game to be completely honest, and for £1.59 what excuse do you have for not buying it?","March 8, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I think this is a really interesting type of shootemup with abilities that you need to learn when to best utilize. There are interesting trade offs after you get various CDS Like using your burst ability that explodes pretty much everything on screen but losing your double damage normal attacks, or stop attacking to jump multiple times so you can full your burst super fast (You get this with the 6th CD) but you need to take care not to get hit and spamming burst all the time can create some problems depending of the situation.\n\nI recommend this game even if you hate the gameplay as long as you like electronic music. It's 2 dollars for 8 free full musics pretty sure that's still a bargain. Savant is a musical genius you should check him out as well. He also has many other free releases out there and 13 amazing albuns.","November 2, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It does, of course, come with pros and cons:\n\nPros -\n+ Straightforward, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t game. Click and shoot and survive. Nothing to it! A nice, quick challenge for those seeking one without really jumping through hoops of fire.\n+ The pixel art is pretty darn good. Haven't seen this kind of quality since the SNES/PS1. Even for a port, it looks nice.\n+ Cheap. 2 dollars is pretty piddly so you can pick it up, play for a bit, and put it down at your leisure without feeling like you dumped an investment.\n+ Upgrades carry over from death, so you can start again with stronger abilities if you unlock them.\n+ It's a sledgehammer. The Savant music is an awesome addition if you're a fan of their works. It's in the title, so one has to assume people who play this are fans of the music too. Duh.\n\nCons -\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ difficult. Don't expect to beat this in one sitting. It picks up in speed fairly quick and can be tough to progress if you aren't paying attention.\n- Only one track during the actual game, which can be pretty monotonous. (Not sure if you can change it in-game or not).\n- Really fast. Like stated before, you have to pay attention and things can slap you silly if you're not looking.\n- (Controller) Weird camera issues. You have to use the right stick for attack, but unless you abuse the five missile charge attack, you're constantly going to be off focus from your character, "hiding" some enemies from view, like the sawblades or Trapjaw.\n\nOverall, its a great game, its cheap, its challenging, and it has Savant music. Quick thinking and a bit of luck will carry you far.","December 4, 2013","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For example aiming is done with the mouse but I think it can also be played with a controller. During the game you can collect cds, each consisting out of 4 pieces, you can collect these by destroying a certain guy. These cds contain songs from an artist called Savant, he makes some kind of glitch hop.\n\nI have to say it is pretty much awesome how it all comes together. As soon as I finished the story mode, which was much fun, I started playing endless mode. This mode becomes more difficult after time and helps you to become a better player. As for being a player, you can see highscores so you can also compete for a highscore.\n\nSo Savant - Ascent is a really nice game, and the best of all is, it'll only cost you two euros!","January 9, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is more a defense game than anything, as you only move from one spot on the level or another, and become stationary at either point. The wizard must shoot enemies and ...things that drop pieces of records. Getting full records upgrades your firepower (I think) and advances the stage. You're essentially a turret that can jump or move to another point on the level, as you shoot in 360 degrees while dealing with a limited screenview that requires you to be catious and prioritize certain targets as the enemies have different attack patterns. The limited vision is very annoying for me, but I can see that it was an intentional design decision. It's unfortunate that I can't play it full screen or expand it to my 2560x1080 resolution. I don't really get why there is a gothic, Castlevania-like visual theme mixed with Dubstep and 8 bit sound bytes. Savant has a nice style, but it's strange.\n\nThe game is pretty fun and it's mostly a hardcore score attacker's delight. The game is absolutely brutal, and I can't get past the 2nd level for the life of me. I might be able to get further if I really hunker down and practice this game for hours, but I don't feel like doing that at the moment. It's a solid game, especially for $2 or less, but realize that you're getting a very simplistic and hardcore, almost arcade like experience that has an extremely short story mode (From what I read) and an endless mode that is just about score and survival. .","August 12, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Played it today and got through the whole game in around 47-50 minutes. I honestly didn't expect anything amazing except the soundtrack (Savant did it, of course it's good), but I have to say I'm actually amazed by the gameplay. It's a really addictive shoot 'em up that is relatively short, but likeable. I think the artstyle and the classic elements of a shoot 'em up is implemented in a nice fashion (the way explosions look, paths of the enemies etc.). A few more enemies and more collectibles would be nice.\n\nI can see most (casual) gamer fans of Savant and EDM lovers enjoying the game. At a 1,99€ price tag, I can't complain too much, but I would have loved a second story or cheap/free DLC's in the near future.\n\nOverall it's definitively worth the money and should definitively be tried out by any fan of EDM.\n\n8,5/10 :)\n\nP.S.

When the bass drops in certain parts of the soundtrack I can clearly define the audio for enemies spawning and enemies attacking. I think these small details really does bring out the enjoyability of the game.\n\nI enjoy the rogue-like dungeon crawler paired with a shoot em up. I find that it brings a bond to the character to see it grow as it learns new abilities and techniques. Sometimes I was able to develop my own personal strategies to defeat levels after levels.\n\nOne intersting suggestion that I like to see maybe implemented in the future to add difficulty is I noticed that during the second level when you are in between two escalators that when one of the moves higer than the other i was able to dodge to that escalator even though it seems like it is impossible to roll up. I think that adding a constraint to that for the player to jump to the higher escalator instead of simply rolling would add some extra challenge. (Maybe it is already implemented, I have to play more and find out)\n\nOverall I had a blast playing this game and the amount of thinking involved of creating a fun game through its plot, game mechanics and user experience and UI design won you a fan.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tallion86/recommended/259530/","Tallion86","Tallion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tallion86/","221 products in account","Ignore my playtime. I have sunk several hours into this game outside of Steam.\n\nHave you ever played an awful game that just completely captured you with a stellar soundtrack? Well replace that bad game with something of epically fun proportions and you will get Savant Ascent. When you first crank this bad boy up, I implore you to have a good set of headphones ready to rock. The music will melt your face off with its genuinely heart pounding syncopation of the blisteringly fast gameplay. This game is not for the faint of heart. I come from a background of solid training in the SHMUP (shoot em' up) genre, yet I still found a pretty good challenge in my first few playthroughs.\n\nThe core of Savant Ascent's gameplay is built around dodging waves of enemies and blasting them with rapid shots at the same time. You are also tasked with collecting various CD pieces that will drop from specific enemies. These pieces are extremely valuable as they will unlock new soundtracks to compliment your destructive rampage, as well as give you new abilities for your character. Things like charge shots, a spray of missiles, and alerts when encroaching enemies are coming towards you. Speaking of enemies, there are only a few types. Each of them are very discernable from one another, an attention to detail that I greatly appreciated. Some will simply slowly move towards you. Other's are much more menacing as they require several shots to take down and will lunge at you at high speeds. They game is not afraid to throw multiple types of baddies at you to induce panic.\n\nControls are very simple. Three keys are used for dodging or jumping left or right to the only 2 predetermined spots you can occupy. the mouse is used to move a cursor around, and you simply click and hold the left button to unleash a steady stream of magical bolts.\n\nThe game has only three modes to choose from. Story, Time Attack, and Endless. Endless is by far my favorite and it is truly what the game was built to provide it's players. However, I would very much recommend that all players start with story mode.\n\nSavant's story mode starts with a scene very reminiscent of Castlevania Symphony of The Night. A gothic castle-esque interior painted with deep intense variations of purples, blues, and greys. Suddenly, our pixel perfect hero comes smashing through a glass window in all of his glory. He looks like if V, from "V for Vendetta", had a love child with a Sith lord. Get ready for about 30 seconds of hand holding before the game completely dumps you into the shark tank. You will die relatively fast on your first attempt. I lasted about a minute, as I recall, before meeting my untimely demise. This is just one of those video games experiences that abuses you in a good way. It says "Hey stupid! wake up and pay the hell attention to what is going on around you!". I seriously felt like I was learning the basics of gaming all over again. I was punished with a gameover screen and my score tally counted up. Then something awesome happened. I watched as all the cd parts I had managed to collect formed into a new disk. The music instantly changed into another heart pumping rhythm and offered to throw me right back into the fray with a new ability. The sense of defeat was met with a small form of progress that many games these days seem to neglect. I didn't even have time to take a bite of the big fat failure cake I had just made myself before I spawned back at my last check point. The story mode itself is very short. Only three stages long with the last being a pretty fun, yet intense, boss fight. I won't spoil the surprise, but there are some awesome references to a certain popular gaming franchise in the final stage.\n\nOnce you finish the story mode and clean up your pants, you are now ready for the meat of the true game. Endless mode! This is exactly the same setup as the story mode sans boss fight. If you couldn't guess by the name, it just goes on and on until you die. You will still have various cd parts to complete new soundtracks while you challenge your best score. I managed to get over 40,000,000 once, and have yet to best myself. The action just constantly gets more intense until you cant take it anymore.\n\nTime attack was simply a test of how fast you are able to clear stages by killing all the enemies. I have never been much for time attack modes and found very little innovation here. It was very considerate of the developer to cater to that crowd. There are many very avid time attack players out there that will blow your mind with skillful, yet torridly fast completions.\n\nSo what do we have here? A fast paced game. A fun game. A low priced game. I paid $2 on the steam store for my copy of Savant Ascent and have loved every second of it. I will mention that I ran into a few minor UI glitches that were in no way game breaking. That aside, this is a special treat in a world dominated by games that want to baby you with tutorials the whole way through. You can play this game for 20 minutes and accomplish something, or you can dive in for hours if that is your choosing. It is always there to tailor to your specific needs. That, my friends, is a mighty fine deal!\n\nI write for Beast League Gaming!\nCheck us out on Facebook\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/BeastLeagueGaming","September 6, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay starts simple enough with basic bullet streams controlled by the mouse with a simple manuevering system involving jumping between two platforms. However, collecting 4 track pieces will unlock addition power to your arsenal which is where the mechanics start getting interesting.\n\nI enjoyed the music, but if you don't care for dubstep or heavy beats it will get grating on you. The spritework is well drawn and colorful, though very light on frames of animation.\n\nThe main game is only 2 stages and a boss, however a time attack and survival mode are available after the main game is completed. Add to it the unlockable powerups though collecting tracks, it does have some replayability, though I do wish there was more levels and enemy types to mix up the gameplay more.

I bought it because it looked fun for 35 cents. I was right.\n\nThe game is 2 levels, with a third acting as a boss. You left click to shoot your bullet hell at the baddies (There is about 6 types of baddies) and push A or D to shift between one of two points to avoid attacks. You can also press W to jump to dodge when rolling isn't an option. If you shoot up the gold baddies you'll get a part of a CD which you can use to create a full CD that can be chosen as the music playing. Not only that but these grant passively abilities to your V for vendetta-esque character. Ablities like a charge attack or maybe better awareness of where enemies are.\n\nIt's a fun game, but I am done with it. After you beat the story mode you unlock endless mode and time attack which can extend the game. You can also go for achievments if that is your thing and it would be probably be worth $2 then but if you are are on the fence wait for that sub 1 dollar sale!","March 3, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have sunk several hours into this game outside of Steam.\n\nHave you ever played an awful game that just completely captured you with a stellar soundtrack? Well replace that bad game with something of epically fun proportions and you will get Savant Ascent. When you first crank this bad boy up, I implore you to have a good set of headphones ready to rock. The music will melt your face off with its genuinely heart pounding syncopation of the blisteringly fast gameplay. This game is not for the faint of heart. I come from a background of solid training in the SHMUP (shoot em' up) genre, yet I still found a pretty good challenge in my first few playthroughs.\n\nThe core of Savant Ascent's gameplay is built around dodging waves of enemies and blasting them with rapid shots at the same time. You are also tasked with collecting various CD pieces that will drop from specific enemies. These pieces are extremely valuable as they will unlock new soundtracks to compliment your destructive rampage, as well as give you new abilities for your character. Things like charge shots, a spray of missiles, and alerts when encroaching enemies are coming towards you. Speaking of enemies, there are only a few types. Each of them are very discernable from one another, an attention to detail that I greatly appreciated. Some will simply slowly move towards you. Other's are much more menacing as they require several shots to take down and will lunge at you at high speeds. They game is not afraid to throw multiple types of baddies at you to induce panic.\n\nControls are very simple. Three keys are used for dodging or jumping left or right to the only 2 predetermined spots you can occupy. the mouse is used to move a cursor around, and you simply click and hold the left button to unleash a steady stream of magical bolts.\n\nThe game has only three modes to choose from. Story, Time Attack, and Endless. Endless is by far my favorite and it is truly what the game was built to provide it's players. However, I would very much recommend that all players start with story mode.\n\nSavant's story mode starts with a scene very reminiscent of Castlevania Symphony of The Night. A gothic castle-esque interior painted with deep intense variations of purples, blues, and greys. Suddenly, our pixel perfect hero comes smashing through a glass window in all of his glory.

Played it today and got through the whole game in around 47-50 minutes. I honestly didn't expect anything amazing except the soundtrack (Savant did it, of course it's good), but I have to say I'm actually amazed by the gameplay. It's a really addictive shoot 'em up that is relatively short, but likeable. I think the artstyle and the classic elements of a shoot 'em up is implemented in a nice fashion (the way explosions look, paths of the enemies etc.). A few more enemies and more collectibles would be nice.\n\nI can see most (casual) gamer fans of Savant and EDM lovers enjoying the game. At a 1,99€ price tag, I can't complain too much, but I would have loved a second story or cheap/free DLC's in the near future.\n\nOverall it's definitively worth the money and should definitively be tried out by any fan of EDM.\n\n8,5/10 :)\n\nP.S.

When the bass drops in certain parts of the soundtrack I can clearly define the audio for enemies spawning and enemies attacking. I think these small details really does bring out the enjoyability of the game.\n\nI enjoy the rogue-like dungeon crawler paired with a shoot em up.

The levels are challenging, and the music is enough to keep you going through the whole thing.\n\nProblem is, the golden robots with CD pieces have WAAAAAY too much health. When you're getting mercilessly attacked by 500 other robots then you don't have the time to chip away at the gold enemies for a CD piece. Once I was blasting at one and dodging in an attempt to avoid the other bots and then the gold bot vanished and then I was twatted in the face by an oncoming one and then I died. The way the controls are mapped gives me finger strain and the camera only moves when you're shooting, so when you gotta clean out the CD pieces you missed at the end of the level it's awkward to try and see them.\n\nBut I get a little further in the game with each attempt, and I do believe I can eventually finish it.

Played it today and got through the whole game in around 47-50 minutes. I honestly didn't expect anything amazing except the soundtrack (Savant did it, of course it's good), but I have to say I'm actually amazed by the gameplay. It's a really addictive shoot 'em up that is relatively short, but likeable. I think the artstyle and the classic elements of a shoot 'em up is implemented in a nice fashion (the way explosions look, paths of the enemies etc.). A few more enemies and more collectibles would be nice.\n\nI can see most (casual) gamer fans of Savant and EDM lovers enjoying the game. At a 1,99€ price tag, I can't complain too much, but I would have loved a second story or cheap/free DLC's in the near future.\n\nOverall it's definitively worth the money and should definitively be tried out by any fan of EDM.\n\n8,5/10 :)\n\nP.S.

It's a twitchy arcade shooter with precise dodge mechanics and a progressive power unlocking scheme in the form of collecting pieces of CDs (don't question it; it just works).  There's a Story Mode, but I honestly have no idea what the story actually is.  That being said, in this game, it hardly matters.  This game is about surviving as long as you can.\n\nEDIT: Apparently Savant is a musician who does the music in this game and I live under a rock.

Which is a great game. Let's just get that straight. NOW onto the review itself.\n\nSavant: Ascent has a hectic, fast paced and heart pumping gameplay inside a wonderful aesthetic vision. Together with a fantastic soundtrack from the electronic composer Savant, all the elements of this game works and compliments each other extremly neatly. I find myself time and time again tapping my feet to the beat of the music, while at the same time ruining the rhyhtm with my excessive mouse clicking. Many, if not all elements in Savant: Ascent is tied together with a very simplistic, but very effective game design.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are simple, where the difficulty of the game is elegantly increased by more rapid enemy spawning and more powerful foes. I think the controls are tight and right to the point, and works well together with how the game tells you where your enemies are located at all times. It feels very balanced through all stages.\n\nI recommend this game from the bottom of my heart. It is worth every penny (which is not that many). It is truly worth your time. I wish D-Pad Studio all the best in the future, because for you guys it is looking VERY bright based on what I've seen so far.","December 5, 2013","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It takes Savant's awesome image and music and slaps it into an old 16-bit arcade elevator battle game. The enemies are easily killed but they spawn like crazy, the mobs are difficult and are a good taster at real gaming when it comes to quick thinking and planning your moves. I played for over 2 hours and could have easily kept playing all night. The different modes were really fun; Vario Mode was hilarious. Time Attack was the usual deal, try better your game and finish the game in under 5 minutes. Endless Mode was just what I was looking for; 16-bit non stop battle with amazing music and incredible gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PixelDeploy/recommended/259530/","PixelDeploy","Nihillis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PixelDeploy/","276 products in account","Savant is a simple game that runs an average playtime of about 45 minutes. And, I suppose that is what’s to be expected for a 2 dollar indie title. Though, here is the thing.\n\nSavant for me, was an amazing purchase. If you are someone that 'needs' a good story with their indie game, you might want to look elsewhere. This is a game that is all about style. With its odd look of Cyber Punk-Fantasy and loud Dubstep blaring in the back ground to get your adrenaline running. Savant is more akin to games such as Realm of the Mad God or even Hotline Miami. With its tight controls and literally taking no time to lean. It’s an 'aim with the mouse cursor' game, a game that is fast to get into, and even faster to get out of.\n\nFinally, while it may not be as hard as Hotline Miami, Savant is still pretty challenging. But that is exactly why I would still suggest picking it up. I mean... its only 2 dollars! When games are cheap and have such a great amount of polish on them like Savant does, it’s hard to say no.","February 13, 2014","true","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Savant, your character, is stationed at the center of the screen, on one of two platforms, and your goal is to survive the hordes of enemies around you. You can "dodge" by quickly switching platforms, which will keep you alive much longer if used correctly. Power-ups, unlocked by collecting CD pieces dropped by certain enemies, make the the game a little more interesting, and the levels get more difficult, but the basic gameplay remains the same.\n\nIt's fun blasting away enemies, having to decide which enemies to target, how best to use your abilities to defeat them. But the pixel graphics and the amazing soundtrack by Savant (no, that's not a coincidence) aren't enough to conceal the repetitiveness of the gameplay. This game is more of a score attack than a constantly evolving experience, since most of the replay value comes from attempting to beat previous scores. That having been said, it's probably a good thing that the game is short, otherwise it would drag out and lose its entertainment value, which it currently has a lot of.\n\nPros\nShooting up hordes is fun\nPower-ups and dodging mechanics make the game interesting\nAbsolutely stunning soundtrack\nCons\nPanning around the screen feels clunky at times\nGameplay is somewhat repetitive\n(Note: I wouldn't say being a short game is a con in this case, for reasons stated above, and the price tag)\nTL;DR: Savant - Ascent is definitely short, but it's awesome, and I'd say the low price tag was worth it.","December 5, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The animation is smooth and the character design is great. I never get tired of saying of how great they are for a game that's worth a few bucks. And while it depends on your personal music taste, the music is great to listen to as well.\n\nI was really dissapointed to find out how short the game was. I managed to beat story mode in 30 minutes! Not only that, but I find the gameplay very repetitive. It's always the same map, and the same enemies. The setting changes a little as the gameplay goes on, but the only thing that changes is the color and difficulty of the same enemies over and over again.\n\nI also find it frustrating how the game doesn't expand to fullscreen, unless it's just happening to me. My mouse often goes off-screen and I end up moving the window and having to re-adjust the whole game window.\n\nOverall, the game is fun for a few hours then it just gets old unless you enjoy playing repetitive games. I hear that there are more features coming in the future- I'm interested in checking them out.","June 25, 2014","false","1.1"," 17 of 33 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","17","33","0","0"

First of all I purchased this game to support Savant, he's an awesome artist and a cool guy in general. I didn't expect much looking at the pricetag so I entered the game with very low expectations, the first few minutes of the game were confusing but I noticed (and instantly liked) one of savants songs playing as I shot laser beams at the flying metal robot things. I died a few times and got kind of frustrated but then I noticed that I had found 4 parts of a Golden CD. I was pleased to find that I had unlocked a new song and a new ability so I figured, why not play some more! A few minutes later I had found another CD with a new and epic ability and I really started liking the game, however it is not a long game by any means, I was done after half an hour or so... Again I was going to put down the game, generally pleased with how it played out... But then I noticed  the "survival" and "time attack" modes with leaderboards. So far I have had a blast with those for 2 hours and I do not think I will stop enjoying them soon.\nOne of the greatest things about this game is the community (the steam Community Hub that is) I went on the forum only to find that some guy were giving out free games to whoever beats his incredible leaderboard ranks, and generally people seem to be very friendly and polite to eachother.\n\nGreat ♥♥♥♥ing game! 10/10 Considering it's price.

You're limited to moving one space to your left and right and jumping and shooting.  That said, it's fun for what it is.  The upgrades are useful and the gameplay is solid and fast-paced.  The real draw to the game is probably the endless mode/time attack stuff, which are are unlocked after beating the regular game.  It's the kind of stuff that if you're into high scores and the like, you'll probably find some extra hours of enjoyment.\n\nNot a bad little game for a buck or two that could have some serious short burst of gaming appeal to those that like it.","August 17, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some of the best 2D graphics you'll ever see and of course fantastic music from Savant.\n\nThe gameplay is simple but surprisingly challenging and you'll need to master the game's mechanics to finish it.\n\nI have a few minor complaints. The menu screens are a bit glitchy and aren't as intuitive as they should be. I also had a few control issues where I would sometimes fail to swap platform while spinning, and also accidentally using chains instead of shooting. In general though the control is very responsive.\n\nThere's only an hour or two's worth of content but it's well worth the price.","December 4, 2013","true","6.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you try and go up sometimes it jumps up other times it acts like an actual savant and does what ever it wants regardless of your input. The game is solid in every respect except the dodging. it is remarkly slow in that regard you might as well dodge yesterday if you want to avoid something. That only works when the objects don't take a straight line because they can and will make it impossible to dodge regardless of your actions and at that point the game becomes a lesson in futility......\nIf you fix the dodgin mechanics the game will be epic.

Enjoy, Or not, Your life.\n\nPostive [A breif overview]:\nReally dam good pixel graphics.\nGood Controls, shooting works fine.\nDesign is fantastic, especially SAVANT&The backgrounds. Did i mention this game has dam good graphics?\nThe CD mechanic is intresting, its a bit diffucult for me as im not good at this game at all, but whatevs.\n\nNow for some negatives, because no game is perfect:\nThe enemy designs are simplistic [Note:I mean the normal enemies, not any bosses if there are any]\nPretty hard, though thats really more nitpciky on my part. Alot of people might like that challange.\nThe soundtrack,atleast to me as its really not my thing, is awful.\nNow this last one is prooooably just me, but at the beginning screen, it glitches out nonstop, showing 01010101s and a few other werid things. I dunno, might just be me.\nThe CD grabbing can be delayed, or not even registered.\n\nFINAL GRADE:7.5/10.\n\nFor me, a soundtrack is a BIG part of a game, and thats why im not giving it like a 8 or 9. I do reccomend this for you players out there who like your Shoot-Em-Ups, And your difficulty. Just dont expect that theres no bugs with the game, mkay?

GREAT GAME !\n\nOVERALL This game is pure awesomeness, I've been a fan from the electro house DJ from a couple of years now and when I found out that he had a game I had to play it and boy I wasn't letted down. This action game is a shoot 'em up that needs a lot of coordination if you want to progress, also as you collect Golden CDs you unlock new songs to play in the background and Savant is an exquisite electro house DJ, for $2 you can't go wrong!\n\nREPLAYABILITY You may beat this game in 2 or 3 hours, but once you get to the end boss you can still fight your way to collect 2 more Golden CDs, which mean 2 more songs and 2 more abilities, I haven't been able to get the 6th and last Golden CD and that frustrates me... but things get pretty hectic in Endless Mode and I have just been able to get the 5th GCD, the last one is way too hard!\n\nGAMEPLAY The gameplay has a nice difficulty curve, even if you keep dying you will be accumulating golden CD pieces and once you get 4 you unlock a new song and new abilities that will help you a lot to progress, creeps that were given you a tough time will be vaporized in a breeze after getting the 4th Golden CD, you may also learn to evade hits more efficiently, overall it's easy to just use your Mouse on one hand and a few keys on the other, the only complaint will be the lack of variety in the levels, you only have The 1st Floor, The Elevator Climb and The Boss Stage.\n\nAESTHETIC I love this game look, it's a great realization on Savant's previous cover art for its albums and singles, plus it captures this magic atmosphere that was very well transmitted in his songs, specially on the album titled "Alchemist", we get "Melody Circus" from that album as the 5th track you may unlock.\n\nSTORY The story is simple and yet very cool, specially on the Boss Stage when you'll fight some unexpectedly familiar foe. You play as Savant, a alchemist who tries to control the mysterious great power of the Philosopher’s Stone and fails, getting blasted by an explosion who throws you out of the tower of your castle and you need to climb back and try to master this bizarre energy.\n\nMUSIC Do I need to tell anything more? I'm clearly a big fan of electronic dance music, and electro house is a pretty energetic genre that nourish amazingly well this videogame, it was love at first play.","September 18, 2014","true","16.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Although a pretty fun game it lacks more than it comes out with\n\nPros\n_____\n+ Fun\n+ New Game Style\n+ Fast Paced\n+ Never Boring\n\nCons\n_____\n- Can be completed in 10 minutes\n- Time Attack is impossible\n- Endless after 3 worms is impossible\n- Collecting all CD's is impossible unless you want 100 hours on a $2 indie game\n- Nothing to unlock like characters or new color scheme's for getting a bigger high score in arcade or endless\n- Nothing to do after 3 hours MAX\n\nSo all in all I really liked it but it just fell short in my book. I recommend it only because of the pricetag and because it is really good gameplay.

Rather like a "game and watch" you are fixed on screen with only 3 options, dodge left or right or jump. Baddies charge at you and you need to get out the way; this gets tricker as the game goes on and is great stuff.\n\nThis all falls apart due to one fatal flaw which is the moving camera, you see the camera moves in the direction you are shooting in so you are blind sided from every direction except the one you are shooting. To make matters worse, moving prevents shooting, so you can't just hop around to avoid getting hit otherwise too many enemies will appear and you will die.\n\nEverything about the game is either good or great. The art direction the various soundtracks (yes you can pick different soundtracks as you play!) the controls (although admittedly they are limited and simple) are good but the whole challenge of the game is dodging enemy attacks or enemies altogether so its a huge, huge promblem that you can hardly see where the enemies are coming from in order to dodge them.\n\nIt's a handicap that ruins what is otherwise an amazing gaming experience and while progress in the game will unlock ways to help deal with this, it is clear it was a design intention but sadly a misguided one because games like Contra are hard; like Metal Slug are challenging but those are great games! No will look down on you for copying the tried and tested method of making a run and gun game!\n\nIf you can deal with the camera moving around all the time then you will enjoy the game but for me I really really tried hard and everytime I got into the game I just couldn't look past how much better the game would be, without giving me motion sickness. :(\n\nJoin Grumpy reviews for all your gaming needs\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/grumpyreviews","January 17, 2015","false","2.5"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","15","33","0","0"

Its not an old school fighting game like you expect. Its basically a rail-shooter. You can't control your guy at all, only just just straight up or diagonal, or roll to 1 of 2 different spots on the level. You just spent the entire time holding down the analog stick and spraying shots at guys. The lack of character control is made further worse as dozens of guys spawn on the screen faster than you can kill them, and come at you in packs. hopefully one of the 2 spots is open or your rolling will just get you hurt and you take damage no matter what you do, which is a major game flaw. You can only get hit 3 times per level before you die, which is dumb based on how many guys come at once and how many waves there are. So basically you just keep dying and getting upgrades slowly and keep replaying the levels. There is no real story.  And the game is supposed to be super short, no wonder its 2 dollars. 4/10.

I'm just disappointed, and where to start.\n\nWell, it's a one-stick shooter. The store description makes Savant sound agile and mobile. You CANNOT walk, and only jump between 2 platforms on screen. Oh, but it's a game about climbing the tower? That involves one screen of fighting enemies until the elevator starts moving, a second screen as the elevator flies to the top, and a third screen with the boss fight ending. An update did add 2 more sections, but they don't change much. The core game can be easily beaten in 10 minutes, with some time attacks under 2 minutes.\n\nGameplay is simple, jump and shoot. There are some extra mechanics with the first shot, charge shots, and grapples, but they are unlocked by beating the game. So the early parts are only difficult or time-consuming because you have no damage or abilities unlocked. Once you collect everything, the game becomes trivial enough that you hardly need to jump to avoid damage. There are only 5 enemy types, and combat switches between bullet-spongy grinds to easy mode once you unlock the last CD.\n\nOh yea, the music is a thing. It's not what I expected from the store video. I like maybe 2 of the 7 tracks, but they are all short enough that they loop and repeat. Music tracks only switch when you pause the game to select a new one, unless the game decides to switch to the Wyrm spawn song. I know the game is absurdly short, but the soundtrack should at least vary enough to last the length. Some people argue the cost is worth for the songs alone, but there is so much free music available now from generous artists, I can't recommend this game's music unless you already like the specific artists. If you are a chiptune-dubstep fan, you can probably find free songs from other artists.\n\nThere may be more content coming, but at this point I have to consider the game effectively complete. The Void update nearly doubled the game content, which is nice, but I'd think there should've been some big Early Access banners for how short and incomplete the game was. Simple bugs still remain, navigating too far in the music selection will crash the game.\n\nThe graphics are amazing and I love the style, but the game just stumbles too much to end so soon. It feels like a demo, and only gains depth once the game is nearly finished. That leaves score attack content as the only reason to replay, but I expected a complete game. I suppose it was a fair deal at 50% off, completing everything in 4 hours. I still feel misled, as the store neglected to point out that walking around was not a feature. It feels like a Newgrounds game with excellent art, but I can't recommend unless you know what you are getting here.","January 2, 2015","false","4.0"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","9","25","0","0"

The majority of their "Demo" video is spent on a level where there are 2 elevators, and the player is jumping from one to the other while firing like crazy.  Everything looked great and natural.  That said, if I had known that those 2 positions were the ONLY positions in the game where you could stand...  Yes, that's right.  Even in full levels where there are visually PLENTY of places to stand, you are limited to jumping back and forth between 2 specific spots.  You then use your mouse to point at enemies and shoot.\n\nGenerating another understatement, I'd have to say that this game gets boring and repetitive after about 5 minutes.

The gameplay is very shallow and the "upgrades" you unlocked are some of the most useless I've ever seen in a game. The screen flashes when an enemy approaches! Very helpful!

So i tried the game pad and what do you know, the A button acts as SPACE. So than i continue to use my game pad to read the controls that are explained for the keyboard - the device that the game no longer allows me to use.\n\nAfter that i was thrown into the middle of chaos, enemies coming from all directions, a game pad as my only choice for controls which i do not know how to use since the game never told me the controls for the game pad, so i'm blasting in all directions, some how taking hits without so much as a second of time to react and about 15 seconds after the start of the game i died. i barely knew what happened, it was over so fast.\n\nNow i'm not very fond of games where i see the GAME OVER screen within the first 60 seconds of launching it but even still, i decided to give it another try. Pressed START on my game pad to try again and there i was, blasting away in all directions, i managed to dodge a few hits, i think, but with only three i knew i wasn't going to last long. I got hit twice but still going, maybe 30 seconds of living this time and right before i could get hit a 3rd time, the game crashed.\n\nto summarize the game play, you can fire in any direction, you can only move between 3 positions in the room and they are very close together, enemies spawn from all directions, and you can only see 1/6 of the room in the direction you are firing in. you mostly get hit by enemies off screen, out of view. it takes many hits to defeat a single enemy and some take quite a while to destroy. 3 hits and it's game over.\n\nso, my time with this game was breif, confusing and a bit frustrating. bad design and bad programming. all i can say is at least the game was really cheap, so i didn't lose much at all. except for a piece of my soul...","December 26, 2013","false","0.1"," 10 of 37 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","10","37","0","0"

I saw it on sale for 99 cents and bought it. It took me all of 30 minutes to beat it. There was no story beyond some weird character falling off of a tower and coming back to fight his way back up it to destroy whatever shiny round thing knocked him off. I later found that the "hero" character is actually the alias of some musician (Aleksander Vinter), and the character is dressed up as he dresses on stage. And of course this game just happened to be released on the PC just days before his new album...surprise surprise.\n\n+ Really nice art. Too bad there is so little of it.\n+ Apparently there will be additional content added for free. Leaderboards for a 20 minute game that doesn't penalize death? Hurray!\n+ If you are into this artist "Savant" or dubstep, you will love the music, apparently...\n\n- This seems like a showcase for the artist, his music, and his on-stage persona, not about a complete game with compelling gameplay, story, or characters.\n- There is no substance to this game. Your progress in the game continues at the last death, thus removing any impact to death. You simply crunch through the easily defeated waves of enemies until you grab enough pieces of "cds", a ridiculously obvious allusion to the modern real world which makes this game feel even more like part of an album promotional campaign of some kind, giving you extra powers. Then you die, new powers completed/retained and then you start anew with no penalty whatsoever.\n- End boss is ridiculously easy. This fits the general sensibilities to this game though.\n- This is an iOS port of a game developed in just five weeks. I should have known...\n\nI would skip this and buy a good $1 Humble Bundle instead. You are sure to get more value and quality gameplay in a good Humble Bundle than with a 30 minute promotional game for an artist developed in just five weeks...","January 13, 2014","false","0.6"," 10 of 39 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","10","39","0","0"

D-Pad Studio, responsible for the beautiful but not yet released Owlboy, have actually released a game ? I recall them saying they'd paused the development of Owlboy in order to work on this game first. A move that doesn't make sense to me. Not that it's a bad game, but a game that can be finished in roughly in 1 hour. After that you still have Time Attack and Survival Mode, but I couldn't care less really. I usually play games for their story and when I finished the first level of Savant Ascent (or so I thought) it actually booted me back to the main menu, with the new gameplay modes unlocked. That's it ?! How the hell is that a story ? This game didn't raise the bar for action games. It didn't raise the bar for anything. And not that it's bad, it plays just fine, but it's so just frustratingly short and incomplete.\n\nOh man, Owlboy...

Shoot low, camera ducks low, pack comes in from the top - every time. I'm a somewhat old school gamer, and I'm no stranger to NES-level difficulty. This one, however, starts out a bit difficult and by stage two I wanted to turn it off.\n\nThere are also visual bugs, specifically in the menus. Bits and pieces of something kept popping in all over the screen while I tried to figure out how to get the game to function with a Logitech controller - which it won't, by the way. That said, you won't really need a controller for Savant, it's played mostly with the mouse, which is not in itself a bad thing.\n\nAnother minor problem is that I none of the resolutions on offer fit my screen, all of them leaving part of the screen behind my taskbar. One of them changed the position of the window, placing the top of the window above the screen, making me unable to drag the window until I changed the resolution yet again. There is no full-screen or windowed full screen option.\n\nAnd the music is unremarkable. By no means is it bad, but not nearly attention-grabbing enough to justify it being a central facet of the game.\n\nAbsolutely beautiful pixel art, though.

As a fan of Dubstep and the man himself since he released ISM, its amazing to see him rise to prominence, even if it includes a video game.\n\nThe simplicity of the game bedazzles me, basically its an Arcade/Action style shooter, where you fend off hoards of enemies whilst on either two available platforms, or an elevator of some kind. Facing off against these enemies can sometimes be a challenge especially for me, especially on the Time Attack and Endless game modes this game offers. Some enemies in this game will offer CD pieces when destroyed, and can be collected to form full CD's that offer 1. Sweet music from Savant's previous albums and 2. Exclusive powers to give you an advantage during play.\n\nThe game offers limited controls, Left, Right, Mouse Control for aim and Space for Jumping. This makes it a simple game to play for anyone who wishes to reminisce over old arcade shooters. Like myself.\n\nThe music you collect through CD's can be selected at will, they are offered as Savant's old songs from his previous albums, they are Ascent, Bach To The Phuture from the Ninur album, ISM from the ISM album, Kali 47 and Butterfly from the Cult album, Fat Cat Shuffle and Melody Circus from the Alchemist album, Organismical from his recent Orakel album and Vario 64 from his Overkill Album.\n\nOverall, I love this game not because I am a fan of Savant, but because this sort of game is so challenging it makes me want to bash my computer in with a Sledgehammer (No pun intended)\n\n- 9/10 - Great gameplay, simplistic, adrenaline pumping music and not enough Manslaughter (No pun intended)","December 23, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only places he can be at is to a left and right position.  There is no walking on platforms.  But despite this straightforwardness, the game is insanely fun.  You control a Savant who not only can output a barrage of damage to wipe out enemies but also quickly evade enemy attacks by switching positions by either jumping or rolling.  It's fairly hard at first but as you collect these in-game objects that are CD pieces and complete them to become full CD's, you unlock powers that makes the Savant stronger, such as shooting missiles after rolling.  Not only that but completing each CD unlocks a new soundtrack to listen to and every soundtrack is awesome and matches the hectic pace of the game.  It's a fairly short game but considering the price and replayability, it's very well worth it.  If there was any wish I had about the game, it would be for the developers to sell the soundtrack as well.","November 29, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's even a rhythm-based final boss, and I've always had a weakness for a good rhythm-based shooter. Also included are time attack and endless modes.

I had no idea what I was stepping into (like most games I get from humble bundles), but I actually really liked it.  You need to focus during this game.  Sure, it looks like a small time indie game, but you need to be fast and quick minded when playing Savant.\n\nYou basically are being attacked from all directions.  You have infinite bullets, and can only occupy two positions.  When getting to the opposite position you can either slide to it or jump to it (basically your dodge ability).  As you kill more enemies, they drop quarters of discs that unlock both new music and new powers.  Once you are dead, you restart from the level you started at on that playthrough, but when you die, all the discs you collected are formed together to create your powers and music.\n\nI was hesitant to recommend this game at first, but it eventually stood up to it's name.  It's fun and worth the buy.  If you're looking for some simple, witty action, then this is your game.

There are a couple of things worth noting before making that steep, steep investment of $2.\n\nWub Wub Wub\nIf you like dubstep, you will love the soundtrack. An integral part of the game is collecting pieces of CDs that simultaneously expands your powers while expanding your listening options.\n\nIf dubstep really isn't your thing, this game won't change your mind. You may be inclided to mute the sound and listen to your own music instead.\n\nYou Will Die - A LOT.\nAt the start of each game, you are allowed to be hit three times before you die. The game saves your progress each time you ascend to the next level, and will start there each time you pick the game back up. Your survival along the way will rely on your ability to dodge and shoot at the same time. The game's fast speed and high degree of difficultly are what make it engaging.  Whether you rise to the challenge or rage quit will depend on your tolerance for it. In fact, a good portion of the game's difficulty arises from the next point.\n\nTight Camera Focus\nThis is the only pure negative I have about the game. The focus of the camera is zoomed in on the character, leaving your surroundings unseen. Your first dozen or so deaths will likely result from the fact that when enemies appear, you aren't even aware of their existence until they attack. This is clearly by design as one of the powers you get will grant you more insight as to when and where they appear by way of flashing the screen and red arrow indicators. It is helpful, but I would much rather have a zoomed out view so I can see everything that's going on.\n\nWhen you shoot, the camera shifts in that direction. When you release, the camera shifts back to the character. If you are attacked from behind while shooting, you won't even know what hit you. WIth this camera shift also comes another, external, hazard. If you are prone to motion sickness, this game will turn your stomach upside-down. It did me. Within minutes, the constant camera shifts might have you clicking the X and grab some ginger root.\n\n\nIf none of the above bothers you, the asking price is an enormous value for a game that lends itself to so much replay and fast, engaging action. Though, how much you like it may depend on your preference for dubstep, tolerance for frequent death, and your ability to keep nausea in check.","November 5, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only places he can be at is to a left and right position.  There is no walking on platforms.  But despite this straightforwardness, the game is insanely fun.  You control a Savant who not only can output a barrage of damage to wipe out enemies but also quickly evade enemy attacks by switching positions by either jumping or rolling.  It's fairly hard at first but as you collect these in-game objects that are CD pieces and complete them to become full CD's, you unlock powers that makes the Savant stronger, such as shooting missiles after rolling.  Not only that but completing each CD unlocks a new soundtrack to listen to and every soundtrack is awesome and matches the hectic pace of the game.  It's a fairly short game but considering the price and replayability, it's very well worth it.  If there was any wish I had about the game, it would be for the developers to sell the soundtrack as well.","November 29, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is one of the hardest indie games I've played since The Binding of Isaac, but this game is harder in my opinion, although they are two quite different games. Savant Ascent is a very fun game for what it is, which is a indie game with the intentions of being made just to promote Savant's music. This is by far one of the best indie games ive played in a long time. It gives a fun challange, but this challenge is not impossible to overcome. And the challenge doesnt become frustrated as you continue to fail, it begins to get more fun and you begin to get better and better, eventually being able to beat the challange. Savant Ascent is a very good game for 2.00$ i wouldn't pay anymore then 5.00$ for it, but it is still a very fun game and worth trying out if you like challenging indie games such as The Binding of Issac. I will admit this game is not the longest indie game, so keep that in mind, but despite the game's length the game is very fun and challenging and worth a try if you have a couple extra bucks lying around, or even if your looking for a new indie game.","December 1, 2014","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The price is the same for all the other places you can get this game for (Google Play and the App Store, mainly).

I'd say the game's certainly worth much more than a hotdog. The game plays like a great and innovative frantic shooter with plenty of never before seen elements, and the amazing (customizeable!) soundtrack adds a LOT to the intense feel. There's even a rhythm-based final boss, and I've always had a weakness for a good rhythm-based shooter. Also included are time attack and endless modes. The only tiny downside is that it seems difficult to control whether the character jumps straight up in the air or to the other platform at times. 9.5/10; I really hope to see more updates in the future.","December 4, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the price of the game, it is a EXTREMELY well made game, which if put on a mobile platform would put other mobile games to shame. But, even with this game's extreme high points, with it's beautiful art, and beautiful music, the game really is only a time waster. The added modes are helpful in keeping one entertained, however the game does lacks in essence and content. My main complaint is that what should be a more satisfying part of the game (I.E. The Story Mode) feels more like a longer, dragged out version of the Time attack and Endless Modes. I was there where more sections added onto the game, which would allow that final boss to be much more intense and satisfying. I also wish that I knew more about the background lore in the world of which the devs had made. Who was Savant? How is he able to shoot light energy from his hands? and what's the background of the villian, Vario? This game has much potential into being something great, but I would think that the game needs a little bit more content before I consider it a full game. None the less, for the price of a whopping $1.99, I think the game is very much worth giving a try. 7.5/10","July 26, 2014","true","19.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Theres some new abilities, and a new, ultra epic, super hard boss battle.\nThe biggest think that keeps me playing this game is the fact that once you work your way up to the ultimate power, you have EARNED THAT S H I T.

The game sometimes doesn't let you change the song in the pause menu, and it crashes if you press 'W' or the up key in the pause menu.\nSome other things needs fixing too, The game doesn't support full HD, which doesn't matter too much since it's 16bit styled, and I would like to be able to skip cutscenes, as it can get a bit tedious watching the same, relatively lenghty "It's-a-me, Vario" in the middle of an intense boss fight, and it ruins the pacing a bit, but those are just nitpicks.\nTotally worth 2€.","January 5, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Endless mode I haven't tried yet but presumably it goes on for some time.\n\nDespite the shortness, this is quite an action packed game. Purchased for 79p in the Steam Winter sale 2013, it's very addictive and meaty when you hit the enemies with your blasts. Similar to Bleed in regards to how powerful you are in comparison to the enemies, yet you really only have two weapons, a stadard energy blast, a huge blast which can take out harder foes. You collect pieces of CDs in order to upgrade your powers, which you can see in my gameplay video. Each CD gives you a new ability, and in story mode there are 4 of them, in Endless mode, you can get the last 2.\n\nA very modern dubstep and some chiptunes in the soundtrack, of which the files are simply OGG files in the directory, meaning they can be copied away and played elsewhere.\n\nFeel free to look at my video of my run through the game. Spoilers for the ending of course, but you'll catch the drift of it in no time.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/rtyr63NZ2q0","January 6, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Very short.\nBut don't get me wrong. It might be short, but it is also very hard and addicting.\nYou will want to test your skills by improving your time and highscore after every failure. And you will fail.\nAt least at the beginning... And then, you will fail again... Ok, you will fail a lot. But you won't give up. The music won't let you.\n\nAnd what about the music? Well, the music is fantastic. It is made by Savant himself. If you don't know him, you can check his music at his YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5ur2L6Zu4oCShmtFw9UTfQ) or his Soundcloud (https://soundcloud.com/aleksander-vinter). It might look like I'm promoting him or something, but it is worth it. Because you might thank me for that.\n\nLet's talk about the art style now. It is great. It reminds me a lot of Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. And if you know what I'm talking about, I don't need to talk about it anymore.\nBut if you don't know what I'm talking about, here is a little summary for you. The art style looks like it draws from Renaissance and Gothic styles of architecture. And thanks to that, some of us might feel nostalgic about this game. Others will say that the style looks good and I can't agree more. I will just add that it is very atmospheric.\n\nSo, is it worth paying the amazing amount of 2 €?\nYes, it is. You will have fun and that's the most important thing about games.","February 15, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I knew it was a VERY short game ( On time attack,it took me 3:20:30 minutes to beat) But it has something..that really makes me come back.\nIts soundtrack is top notch by savant. Pumping you,Making you to hear more,etc. Fitting in some cases,though it has some oddly placed music to what the game is showing to you. But its good music nontheless.\nThe game itself is simply shooting waves of enemies without getting hit,Scoring,Multiplers,all that fair. Not grinding levels,not grinding perks or such. Something easy to pick up and kill some time,A time sink if you will.\nIt tends to get preeeeeetty hectic in endless mode,so if you want some challenge,this game will kick your ♥♥♥ raaather hard.\n\nI rather recommend it for such a love price,just if you are looking for a short ammount of enjoyment in dead times.","February 15, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really liked Savant before I even knew about this game, and when I found out that this existed, I had to get it. It was amazing from day 1: Pure, no-nonsense ♥♥♥-kicking, and Savant's awesome music. But, then the Samurai shows up. Up until that point the game is all about skill and speed, after, well, it's just pattern recognition. It makes me feel like a three-year-old with a Little Einsteins toy. 'Press this key when this sound plays' that kind of thing. Another thing that gets me is how out of place some of the songs are. I can get behind ISM and Melody Circus, they sound adventure-y and damn badass, I can even understand butterfly, maybe even Kali 47. But, things like Organismical and Bach to the Phuture seem out of place. Where's No Time For ♥♥♥♥♥? where's Splinter? Anything from his newer albums? But, that's all in all just a minor gripe. My big problem is with the Smaurai. He could be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ badass boss that you would have to think outside the box to beat. He could've had all kinds of complex attacks and powers and strategies. Instead we got Robot-Samurai-Dubstep-Little Einsteins. But, there's always endless mode.\n\n9/♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ IT I DIDN'T MOVE IN TIME NOW I HAVE TO START ALL OF THIS SAMURAI ♥♥♥♥ OVER AGAIN SEVEN HOURS OF MY LIFE DOWN THE DAMN DRAIN... 10","June 9, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just right. You can probably finish the story mode in around 30minutes. But it's the modes unlocked after that, that make the game great. A whole new character, endless mode, and a time attack for those speedrun inclined. It's an over-the-top semi-shmup. It's worth the current $2 and at the current 99c, a steal. You can easily spend a few hours in the game just unlocking everything and seeing how long you can survive in endless mode.\n\nA few gripes with it, is obviously its length, a lack of epilepsy warning (This game has a lot of flashy lights and colours be careful), and as you progress further, it gets harder to keep track of enemy positions and attack states. However this may be because I may not be the best at this game.\n\nOverall a wonderful little hidden gem in a sea of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games on steam.

When I dropped the .99 on this back in Winter I was simply looking for a new game but couldn't justify dropping $5 or more. But what I got was an experience. Savant is an artist I'm familiar with, having listened to each of his albums so when I was introduced to this game I was a bit excited to see what lay in store. The beginning is challenging, especially learning controls and then applying them but it does get a lot easier when you level up in game by obtaining new tracks. The game for its price contains a fair amount of content. A standard story mode, a reprise after you complete the standard mode, a skin change for the enemies and finally the endless mode. You'll breeze through the first 2 and thereby obtain the 3rd quite easily but the real challenge comes in Endless. The real incentive for that is to collect the final tracks that aren't available in the story mode.\n\ntl;dr\nFor the price you could do MUCH worse, heck you could do much worse for more than that. If you're into shooters, and want a small time killer game with a good soundtrack, then give Savant Aascent a try.","July 1, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, I bought it to see why it was given that award. That didn't take long. I completely fell in love with this game during JUST the intro for the story mode (and for the actual game that followed), and for a bunch of reasons!\nThe art in the game is absolutely gorgeous, from the first scene to the last boss. I mean, REALLY gorgeous. It would almost be just a continuous slideshow of beautiful frames if it wasn't for the non-stop enemies coming from all sides at the same time! This game is also delightfully difficult, albeit how short it is. Most of the difficulty can be found in the modes unlocked after the main game is completed, which is also where a lot of the replay value can be found. Throw in GOTY mode and Vario mode unlocked as well, and it multiplies the content of the game. And, probably THE best part of this game is Savant. And, I mean Savant as in his music within the game. Every single, expertly crafted wub that's created from the godsend of his computer is pure gold. All of his music is completely unique, and a pleasure to listen to many, MANY times. It feels as if the game is controlled by the music any time you listen to it, and the function to pick and choose your song at anytime is very nice.\nAside from how short the majority of the game is, the replayability of everything else, the AMAZING art and music, and the amount of evident effort put into this game easily makes up for it. The only thing someone should request more out of this game would be for it to be longer and MAYBE some more diversity in the enemies (which isn't an issue AT ALL), which is why it's easy to see how this game got GOTY from GameMaker (it's community), and I wouldn't be suprised if it took the same reward for any indie games.\n10/10","July 1, 2014","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In order to avoid some enemy attacks, you have to jump and dodge, and cannot simply move anywhere you want to on the screen. In any given stage, you have 2 areas side-by-side (hyphens are useful as hell, aren't they?) in which you can stand and shoot.\n\nThe game starts out hard due to the fact that your powers are garbage to begin with. In order to unlock new powers, you must kill special enemies who drop CD pieces that you scoop up with a chain whip grappling hook gimmick. You will die....a lot....but your powers stay with you into the next life, and the game lets you start your next life from the same stage you got to last. Takes the sting out of it nicely and keeps you from ragequitting!\n\nIf you like twin-stick shooters, touhou shmups (that really is a silly "word"), or just plain difficult games, you might find this to be a solid shoot-em-up type of experience for 2 bucks.

The art work was interesting and in the most recent update the "intro" scene gives the player an idea of the storyline behind the game all the while leaving a sense of mystery. Gameplay is indeed fast as it took me about 15 minutes to actually beat the game. However, replayability is present in the scoreboards for highscores, timed runs, and other various features of the game.\n\nThat being said I would have liked to see more from the developers in the aspect of the music. Considering the fact that it is crucial to the gameplay, I would have liked to see more tracks available to play. It would add a lot more replayability in my opinion. However that is not enough to knock it down in my recommendation. Overall if you have some spare change and are looking for a fast paced techno shoot em up with pretty good music, Savant Ascent is for you.","December 28, 2013","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will say ive Listened to some of Savant's stuff so it wasn't hard to pick up the flow of the game since its theme and composed by Savant (Aleksander Vinter) and themes arround his common style images of V for Vendetta and Mario both clearly and obviously refrenced. But to the game play, a smooth ryhtmically synced action shooter where the full map is avaible for attacking and to be attacked, and your limited between 2 spaces and 2 forms of dodging and neither of which make you invincible thus making who you attack and what you attack at what angles builds this into strategy and time management. The game is on its own very brief (i mean its 2 bucks i bought it by selling left over Trading Cards, lets be real) a rough time attack after beating the game twice ebbed at 4:11:33 (m/ss/msms), Endless Mode provides more abilites, powers and music than story mode will offer you to you keep going as well. The game does lack alot of diversity capping at about 5 enemies total but even then its the right amount of things to keep it on track smoothy and not over or under balanced. Also the art style feels very Sega Saturn which struck home with me personally, im aware its a much smoother newer astetic along with the days abilites but it has a feel to it that is very reminding, ya know what i mean?\n\nSide Note (subject to change as they announce it): The devs have heard alot of feedback about the desire for a customizable personal track set the players can use and have with in 2 days of the game launch already gone back to discuss this feature due to the fact it is a music heavy game, Either way the musical aspect is enjoyable and has a flairing taste for most people even if its just one of the tracks.","December 5, 2013","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Savant Ascent is the kind of cruel mistress that brings out the most deliriously self-serving masochist from within you, and rewards it with the delicious satisfaction you crave: but only after you have endured every sweet punishment it has thrown at you. If that analogy sounds overtly sexual, then I implore you to view that as a re-enforcement of how devilishly brilliant this game is, and only in some small part as a reflection of my own character.\n\nThe game is not perfect; the difficultly curve is steep, the 'story mode' is a tad short to be called a story, and the final boss is more than a little odd (Although Savant fans will get a kick out of the in-joke reference). However to re-use the previous analogy: she's cheap and you get exactly what you deserve. She's also got some surprises you would never expect, and not in the venereal-infection kind of way!\n\nBuy it, growl at it, then submit.

He has released 7 LPs and 3 Eps since 2012. If you're a fan of his music you probably already know this, if not you should look him up on youtube. I am a fan of the songs "Butterfly", "Melody Circus", and "ISM", all of which are featured in Ascent.\n\nSavant - Ascent is essentially a a bullethell game,, except that you don't have freedom of movement--you can only move between two locations. It's really short--the story mode is like 10 minutes if you don't die. That said, it's also really challenging, and between the time trial and the endless modes, there is a really good amount of replayability for such a cheap game.\n\nThe music is great, obviously, although it's a shame that there isn't more interaction between the game and the music.

The music is decent, the art is fantastic and the general ease to learn the mechanics are great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyyhkari/recommended/259530/","pyyhkari","Pyyhkari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pyyhkari/","848 products in account","There are things this game gets wrong: no native support for 1920x1080 resolution, for one, or the slightest help in picking the correct resolution for the fullscreen mode so that the aspect ratio matches. And, the worst, the unskippable slow camera pan at the start of the third stage of the story mode. And to unlock the main point of the game - the endless and time attack modes - the player has to finish the story first. The first time, the camera pan is OK. But after half a dozen attempts (there are unlimited continues, thank goodness), it becomes infuriating. Let me play already!\n\nBut once the story mode is cleared, it becomes a very addicting score-attack action game. No more cutscenes, no more unskippable camera pans, just pure gameplay. The story mode works as a tutorial to the basic game mechanics. For a novice like me, surviving two minutes in the endless mode is a challenge.\n\nThe character moves only in a very limited way: jump or dodge to the adjacent platform. There doesn't appear to be any danger of missing a jump.\n\nThe pricing, 2€, is competitive with its price on the mobile platforms, but I would think it's easier to play with a proper controller.","January 3, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
