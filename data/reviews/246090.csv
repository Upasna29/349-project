The game is going into "1.0" release next month and is being left to modders to finish it up. They claim they're going to fix bugs, but as I made clear in the review below, they couldn't even finish the A.I. during thier "Alpha" stage.\n\nThis game is like an incredibly dumbed-down Dwarf Fortress in space. Key word being dumb.\n\nThe AI has incredibly complex inabilities to solve their problems. They would rather let themselves asphyxiate in the cold of space than finish constructing the airlock that is filled with oxygen. Why? Because the unfinished part is a space suit locker. They were in space suits already.\n\nIn a previous run, the builders refused to add onto the life support section because oxygen was running low (for some unknown reason) and so the whole crew suffocated.\n\nAnother run, I had to tear down a door I placed. That destroyed the wall and converted the next room from an airlock into a reactor, and while trying to fix that, the builder simply never finished construction. The crew died because they had no airlock to exit and expand and there was a hole into space.\n\nThe security have no sense of uniformity and would rather walk one at a time into a derelict and die continuously to the same thing.\n\nYou can't place objects in 4 directions, only two. I don't know why 4-view camera controls aren't implemented yet, but its frustrating to deal with as you have so much unused space.\n\nIt's a neat concept and can become a good game, but it is not at all worth your time or money. It is bug-ridden. It has very stupid AI. If the developers can create useful viewing controls and decent AI that you don't have to play around in a nit-picky manner, it'll be a fun, hard game of balance between many facets of every characters' needs and wants, and management of a space station.","September 8, 2014","false","10.0"," 665 of 691 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","665","691","4","0"

I don't care how great the guys developing Massive Chalice are, they're from the same studio that scamed me out of 25 bucks.\n\n25 dollars, in the grand scheme of things, it isn't much. But there's alot of things I could've done with that 25 dollars, first thing that comes to mind is buy a case of mediocre beer.\n\nNow when I buy a case of Budwieser I expect certian things; I expect bland taste, I expect to get a mild buzz, sounds like a pretty ♥♥♥♥ty use of 25 dollars right? Here's the thing, I was never promised anything more.\n\nLets expand on the beer analogy: instead of Budweiser, DF is now the brewer. DF promises me a pretty nice brew: nothing amazing, but something well worth my money. Having heard DF has produced some quality brews in the past I buy a case from the affable salesman. I take the case home, eager to try a fresh new flavor from the brewer I've heard so many good things about; then I open the first bottle. ♥♥♥♥, this bottle contains nothing but ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ fumes; disgusted but still hoping to at least drink my initial disgust away I open another bottle..........more ♥♥♥♥.

So I hope you fine folks at DF can understand why the next time someone asks me to spend my money on one of your products, I'll tell you to shove your product up your ♥♥♥.","November 12, 2014","false","41.5"," 550 of 611 people (90%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","90","550","611","53","5"

And it reminds me of the Sims 4 or Sim City(2013)\n\n\n\n-Great idea for a game\nlots of people have done building games, city games,etc, but Space Bases are few. The idea for this game is Perfect, now if only the game was...\n\n\n\nWhat Space Base DF-9 did wrong\n\n\n-Did not deliver\non the Double Fine Games website they had a roadmap (now long gone) of things they said they were going to try to add. It was a big one. And yes i know that even they said it wasn't "set in stone" but it was used to get people to buy the game, and now only about 20 to 40% of those features are in the game, and it kinda feels like they tricked us.\n\n-Left the Game unfinished\nDouble Fine Games the dev and publisher has left SBDF-9 to make another game and thereby make more money. They basically blame the community citing that "not enough people bought the game to fund it". Perhaps because the game is in an Alpha state at the most\n\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI\nI don't know about you but when i'm in a space base on the far reaches of the milky way, i get pretty damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when i don't have Five Star meals, or Gyms, or bars, or TV. So mad i start trashing my own Oxygen tanks thereby killing myself. What? You wouldn't do that? Well the AI in this game does that. Yep, if they aren't living in luxury they decide life just ain't worth living.\n\n-Not Worth the price\nIf Double Fine Games was going to keep working on this, i would say this is worth the price, however they aren't so really there is no point in spending cash on it. Its not going to get better, its not going to get fixed, and its not a good game.\n\n-bugs and glitches that will never be fixed\nNot being able to build, Oxygen not being produced despite the fact i have Oxygen tanks and more, these are bugs and glitches that will never be fixed.\n\n-Made us pay for their failure\nThis is more of a issue of Double Fine Games itself. They the whole reason they said the game is being shut down is because one: Not enough people bought it, and two: they ran out of Kickstarter money. If they did run out of kickstarter money then STOP working on another game and spend that money on the game you sold us.\n\n-This is not the first time Double Fine Game has let people down\nAnother game by DFG, Broken Age was also misleading. The game is sold as a full game but it is like TellTale games in that there are "Episodes". Right now, a year after the funding for the game ended there is only ONE  episode, with a "promise" that the second one will be coming on "sometime in early 2015"\n\nWho Space Base DF-9 is for\n-People who like wasting money\n\n-People who don't care about playing an unfinished game\n\n-People who buy games on sale\n\n-Idiots\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe idea behind this game is amazing, and if worked on properly it could be a masterpiece. But it won't and thats a shame. Normally i keep supporting even bad EA games because i figure "eh, they will fix it later" i mean at the point i've already given them money, the best thing to do is hold on to the hope (however pointless) that the game will get better. There is no hope with SBDF-9, not anymore. And yes, modders could make it better, and they could make it a great game, but my belief is that if modders have to fix your game, and i mean Make it playable, then you've already failed.\n","December 18, 2014","false","10.5"," 337 of 360 people (94%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","94","337","360","9","6"

But between the horrible AI, UI, and overall game meta, not to mention lackluster developer support over the course of the last year I cannot with good conscience recommend this to anybody. Wait at least until beta to buy this, and only if they significantly alter the meta-game.\n\nAs it stands the AI are imbecilic, the gameplay progression borders on unfair or unplayable even at low difficulty, and the game has a daisy chain of progressive bugs and glitches that functionally cripple your base the longer you play. Invisible raiders? Yes. Unhealable citizens? Got that too. Ludicrous pathing? Sure! Lack of transparency in regards to what you're placing into the game?

But it is obvious to me that Double Fine isn't investing many resources in this game, and probably have no intention of doing so either.\n\nMy prediction? A halt in development by Fall of 2014 when the dev team gets recalled to work on what is seen as more 'profitable' ventures.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/recommended/246090/","maximumslothfulness","Maximum Sloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumslothfulness/","618 products in account","I purchased this game when it was still in Early Access for the full price (was $25 when I bought it).  Developers promised a lot of things, new features, customization, and a vast amount of gameplay.  Unfortunately, none of these promises were delivered.  I bought the game because I enjoyed Double Fine's Brutal Legend.  They seemed like a trustworthy developer that could get a fun quirky game done and make it worthwhile.\n\nAfter months of no updates and no communication I began to lose heart.  The minimal amount of playtime (logged 0.6 hours) was due to the lack of a tutorial (which they have since added, and it's sub-par) and (I assume) a bug that prevented my characters from entering the base I built.  I started another game, and again they wouldn't enter the base I built and ended up suffocating.  Started another game and I finally got them to enter the base, and that's where more bugs appeared.  Just read the forums to get an idea of how frustrating the bugs are and how broken the game is, despite it getting a full release.\n\nVery disappointed in Double Fine.  Their lack of communication regarding the game's development, refusal to be honest with people who bought their product (e.g. not letting us know they planned to stop development and leave the game as is), and the fact that they had the gall to release the code and tell the community that if they like the game, then they have to fix it.  Come on.\n\nTo conclude, I'd say avoid this game, it will receive no further updates, and as it stands it's an incomplete mish-mosh of ideas.  Even for $12 I'd say skip it.  Hopefully they update Gang Beast, which I also purchased before this fiasco, although it hasn't received an update since the day I bought it (2 months ago).\n\nUpdate: Source code has been released...and there are still parts of the code that are hidden, as one person on the forum mentioned, the Oxygen Recycler.  One of the most basic units of the game.  It's used to prevent your base from losing oxygen, thus preventing everyone from suffocating.\n\nUpdate #2: Price has changed to $20.01 (from the sale price of $12), and that's about it.  Tried playing the game again and it wouldn't let me complete the tutorial (was not allowed to place a second airlock door where it indicated).  Still have yet to build my own base.  They supposedly also fixed some bugs on October 30th.  This is what one user had to say:\n\n"crlsniper Nov 1 @ 2:30pm\n\nGlad to see your working on fixes, though the bigest fixes need to be AI fixes, Mostly for doctors and security. I lost an entire base just because none of the doctors would go help people who where incapacitated, neither would soldiers go arrest and move raiders who where incapacitated either."\n\nMultiple counts of the same complaint.  Furthermore, despite where you establish your base, you will have near constant attacks from pirates/raiders.\n\nSome brave souls have attempted to mod the game (essentially having to rebuild the game from the ground up), check this thread out: http://steamcommunity.com/app/246090/discussions/0/613940477963640858/\n\nIt outlines a lot of the bugs and problems with the game, such as faulty oxygen recyclers (e.g. too many people in a room would cause dramatic decreases in oxygen no matter how many recyclers you had, thus everyone in that room eventually would suffocate).\n\nUpdate #3: Free copies of Hack n Slash were provided to buyers of this game (myself and a few others received a copy), however it strikes me as more of a political ploy than a genuine apology.  This is because people who purchased Hack n Slash got a copy of this game.  As far as I know, Hack n Slash purchasers weren't spat upon and kicked to the curb by Double Fine, so this move makes no sense to me.\n\nAnd of course I'm not eligible for the new refund policy, since I purchased this game over a year ago.

No I am not.  I have never dealt with such mind-crushing stupidity in any game of this sort, ever.  The stupidity of your citizens goes above and beyond funny and delves into the absolutely painful and rage-inducing.\n\nI'm talking about builders not building airlocks and dying from it, Techs not maintaining their oxygen recyclers, panicing when the lack of oxygen makes them suffocate, and then dies flailing around in circles - going into a raider/monster infested derelict one after another for the sole purpose of greed; the overwhelming desire to pick up some stupid, worthless toy and dying for it in a pile of their greedy dead friends, stamping on a roaring fire the size of a house and burning to death in a huge mass instead of using the fire extinguishers directly outside and in said flaming room - walling themselves into small rooms and dying, refusing to tear down the wall to escape or build a door,   Downright refusing to maintain the station, their lives, their jobs, or anything relating what so ever to order, because they'd rather bash each others brains out in some psychotic fight, or they'd rather have a temper tantrum because they need to keep the oxygen recyclers operational and they can't play with their rubber duckies.\n\nYes, all of this actually happens, and it happens constantly.  It isn't some stupid trivial issue that appears once in awhile, it's literally ♥♥♥♥ing constant and it never ♥♥♥♥ing ends.  Seeing 30 people die one after another because they individually decided to stop working/cooking/sleeping to go steal a ♥♥♥♥ing trinket from a derelict near-by, and absolutely nothing I try to do can ♥♥♥♥ing stop them (Making them security and putting the deployment icon elsewhere, making them builders and trying to make them build, ANYTHING BUT DIE IN THAT ♥♥♥♥ING DERELICT ONE AFTER ANOTHER FOR YOUR STUPID ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T).\n\nAgain, this isn't funny.  It goes beyond funny.  It's unplayable.  It's literally ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable because you're actually trying to manage severely mentally disabled humans and aliens in a ♥♥♥♥ing space station.  If they don't kill themselves from suffocating, greed, or just random senseless violence and fighting, the almost constant raider attacks (that eventually culminates to a literal raider fleet, for no reason what so ever) will kill them.\n\nThe best part is apparently the developers took the money and ran, haven't been doing anything with the game, ban people who point this out or mention it on their forums, and are making new projects/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with the nonexistant money.\n\nThis game could be really, really good if the crew wasn't so ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and suicidal.  If they were competent and HAD PRIORITIES like ANY LIVING CREATURE WITH SOME SENSE OF SELF-PRESERVATION, the game would be good, REALLY good in fact.  As it is right now?  No it's unplayable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nMaybe some modders can take it over and fix it, do anything with it, I don't know.  But by default this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is awful.","November 9, 2014","false","19.0"," 221 of 233 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","221","233","9","6"

After completing most of the goals in the game I've come to a conclusion:\n\nDF-9 does not hold up to its promise. Not by a long shot.\n\nAside from the fact that fact that Double Fine abandoned (I do actually understand their situation) the game long before their planned goals had been implemented, the unfortunate truth is that what we do have isn't finished either.\n\nMost prominently the power system. Without an actual power meter (like we have for O2) your base will just suddenly lose power if you've built too much. You have no useful way of knowing when to build another reactor. The devs expect you to hover your mouse over each and every room and sum up the power consumption in your head each time you want to take inventory.\n\nNext up is the "story" of the game. One of the last versions must have shoehorned this in because I don't remember it from Alpha5. Basically at some point the game will spontaneously throw multiple raider ships and raider astronauts at you in bulk. I've you've managed to build your base accordingly by then: congratulations for figuring out the simple and boring strategy needed. If you haven't? Well, you can start all over again.\n\nThen as you continue to play and expand your base to meet the other goals you'll notice how the game becomes increasingly glitchy.\n\nAnd speaking of goals: The "build all the things" goal isn't even possible.

The store page says this is in Alpha. It is not. It is in final beta stages since they have just announced that after a round of bug fixes they will release version 1.0 in october and content updates will stop.\n\nThe game had huge potential and I was under the impression this still had at LEAST a year left of updates, but sadly it seems like they are ditching it. What exsists today is the shell of a full title, a scant promise of something it could be after a lot longer in development, but £19 for this? Forget it.\n\nThis is the first time I have been badly stung by Early Access and it has shaken my faith in it completely. I have huge respect for Double Fine, but I will NEVER buy any of their Early Access titles again (and I was so close to getting Gang Beasts).\n\nJust have to put this one behind me I suppose.

No, don't fix them, lets panic for two hours while the oxygen slowly runs out"\n\nNow you can put most people down to blind panic in situations like those, but out of a crew of 64, 52 of them went to stomp out the fire (they ran all the way from a safe section of the base, past security and into the raiders, most of which were assigned to security and tasked with killing the raiders.  You just wouldn't get a situation like that in real life.\n\nI understand the reasons behind it, and the bug fixing is ongoing.  However in its current state it is still very very difficult to play smoothly, and I don't mean that the game is hard, I mean the game visibly holds you back when you want to play it and a single bug can be a game breaker.\n\nIf you like the look of this game, feel free to get it, back up your saves MANUALY on a regular basis, and don't be surprised if a sudden bug/glitch wrecks your experience.  However please don't buy this game if you are thinking it will be epic.  It's epic until a bug kills it.\n\nAs major bugs are patched I will update this review, but it’s looking like the "patches" will either not continue or be few and far in-between.  There is currently a comminity unofficial patch in the works so I will be interested to see how/if that pans out.","October 30, 2014","false","82.6"," 111 of 114 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","111","114","0","0"

A game that has potential, a game that has that Double Fine sense of humor we all love, and a game that will fill a void in the market that has been left open for far too long.\n- The investors love it and give Tim Schafer $400,000 to make this game.\n- Tim Schafer gets addicted to cocaine and hookers and completely blows (heh) all of his investors' money, but just about this time Steam early access was hitting its stride and crafty Schafer cooks up a scheme.\n- Tim Schafer puts a very early, borderline-developmental build of DF9 up on steam for $25 with a link to a web page promising tons and tons of features - all with a very nebulous timetable attached.\n- A few months later (and a few inconsequential updates later) Tim Schafer finally cons enough money from hard-working people to pay back his investors (and get himself into rehab). Unfortunately, Double Fine is now broke.\n- Tim Schafer announces the latest development build as the final release, takes down the webpage with the planned content, and releases the source code in a futile attempt to placate his former fans.\n- Tim Schafer goes off to further bankrupt Double Fine.\n\ntl;dr, DO NOT BUY.  This game is fundamentally broken and lacking in content.\n\n\nI realize game development can be expensive, but I think it's pretty obvious from this and the Broken Age debacles that Tim Schafer isn't particularly good with money. Maybe Double Fine's next project should be an Excel spreadsheet so he can keep track of expenses.\n\nAlso, I really don't see how releasing the source code, or modding API, or whatever will possibly save this turd.  Modders are not going to want to spend time making a bad game adequate.  I think a complete rewrite of the AI should be the first thing to be done, but by the time they familiarize themselves with the code and rework the game, it'll be months from now. Months of work, just to maybe make the game playable and - best case senario - make Tim Schafer a few more bucks from sales.\n\nTim Schafer\nTim Shillfer\nTim Pilfer\nTim Tookallyourmoneyfer","November 28, 2014","false","9.0"," 238 of 283 people (84%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","84","238","283","11","0"

BUY. I bought into this game very early, paying $25 for basically a tech demo, because I loved the concept. I also trusted DoubleFine and Tim Schafer, being a respected studio and developer, to deliver an awesome product in the end. Alas, the development of this game seems to have been mismanaged into the ground. DF is abandoning the project and leaving us gamers with an unfinished buggy mess and calling it 1.0 release. There's about 10 hours of playtime here at most and quite frankly that is just not worth the pricetag.\n\nUpdate 11/12/14: I tried playing this game again after the 1.0 release. It still feels terribly unfinished. The new tutorial and goals system feel slapped together, lackluster, and unnecessary. I wish they would have spent the time adding more actual game content instead of these "features". Not to mention, the game is still very buggy. My first attempt at a base fell apart rather quickly after a derelict showed up. I set  a beacon to have my security guard check it out, who got killed by a bot. That alone would be fine as a possible risk of exploration, but then my other non-security personnel decided to go to the derelict "picking something up" (presumably the body) even after the beacon was removed. They all subsequently got killed, too. Nothing I could do would send them back to the safety of the base. Basically, I just got too frustrated to want to continue. If you still want to try this game, get it on super sale. It is just not worth the new lower price of $20.01.","October 26, 2014","false","11.5"," 135 of 147 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","135","147","0","0"
