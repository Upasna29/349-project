This is baby's first lemmings game, almost every level is just "bridge the gap." I've used Unity before, and almost everything in here is straight out of the default templates.\n\nBetween the irritating controls -- seriously, you have to use a mouse AND keyboard, no scroll wheel? -- the mind-numbingly easy levels, and the fact that you can't skip ahead to slightly more difficult levels, it's a boring, phoned in reimaging of lemmings. Those icons at the bottom promising interesting actions are dirty lies, when nearly the whole game is nothing but brick laying. The game is unfinished, but it's actually a relief that the levels end prematurely, they're so bad. I also can't believe this is 300 megs, when it could easily have been a Super Nintendo game.\n\nThe worst part is that this feels every bit like a $0.99 or free-to-play mobile game port, but it isn't, it's a student project that makes you feel like you're playing a bad knockoff of a good game. At least if it was on mobile, it wouldn't require the keyboard for half the actions.","February 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

It's cute and generally it's just a timefiller.\n\nThe design is fitting the style although it's a little basic. Everyone with small talents of art could pull off something like this. The babies are easy to distinguish in the levels and the overall clarity of elements and level parts are great.\n\nThe sound is somewhat mediocre. I feel that not much effort has been put into, especially since most tracks are constantly 10-seconds looped soundbits. It becomes boring after a short time and there is no mute button.\n\nThe puzzles are really balanced and gets progressively tougher. It's definitly the strongest point of the game, although for veterans I feel like it's just a tad too easy, you'll roll right through most of the levels on the first try, but for younger audiences, this is will be a challenge!\n\nThere are a few bugs though, sometimes a baby will simply fall through a block without reason, or you'll end up having a wrong count. The worst bug so far is one that is currently still in the game (which I already mentioned in forums), where when you reach LVL 60 it will automatically complete LVL 61 as well and you can't progress as clicking it won't open the level, and neither unluck LVL 62.\n\nFor the score, I have to give this game a 7/10 because I think for filling your time, it does its job and the few glitches almost never happen, and reloading a level is one click away. But, I do hope the dev(s) fix this issue and please add a mute button!\n\nAs such, this game gets a thumb up!\n\nVIDEO Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8NB09kRlj0","October 4, 2014","true","6.6"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

All levels but one will bore you to death with how easy they are and no real way to fast forward. In addition to that you will experience bugs, bad controls, bad game design, and the unpleasant artwork. You have been warned.\n\nIf you want a good game that plays like Monomino, play MouseCraft here on Steam or the original Lemmings which is available as a free browser game, instead.\n\n\nbuggy:\n- With the first two solutions for level 59 I did not get 3 stars, because babies randomly fell through blocks. I had to rearrange the blocks until the babies did not glitch to death anymore\n- the level list shows 100 levels, but there are actually only 60\n\nbad controls:\n- no hotkeys for the tetrominos and special abilities\n- no pause build mode\n- level list keeps going back to the first group of 20 levels instead of staying where you left it and moving to the next non-3-star level automatically\n- fast forwarding is disabled until you have used up everything, and a bunch of levels can easily be solved with some stuff left over. And when it finally lets you fast forward, it's still so slow you can go afk while waiting, on some levels\n\nbad game design:\nThe pause button brings up a huge window that blocks pretty much the whole screen, obviously to keep you from planning out the level in peace. So there is no way to plan out the levels without failing to save the babies. When they are all dead you cannot continue to plan, instead you get whacked with the pause window, again blocking everything from view. Imagine thinking through different tetromino placements while the babies fall to their deaths literally right through the area where you are planning, in a continuous stream. Talk about a downer, seeing them all die when your goal is to save them, over and over. The only thing left to do is to trap them somewhere to give you some peace and time to plan. Basically you add your own working pause button to the game ...\n\nboredom: about 57 of the 60 levels are so easy a 3 year old would get bored, then you have maybe 2 levels that take a few tries optimize the solution. When finally you get to level 60, which is a nice challenge, the game ends directly afterwards. So basically you spend about one and a half hours wading through boredom to be rewarded with a single entertaining level.\n\nunpleasant artwork: This is strictly personal taste, but since I was extremely bored for most of the game, the ugly office style graphics and bad music soon got on my nerves. While I was thinking of a solution for the final and only challenging level, I did not mind them so much. Turning babies into suicide demolition bombs is not to everybody's taste either.","October 10, 2014","false","2.0"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

By the time you reach level 30 you just give up. Surrender. There is nothing here to see. Not on this level and not on the next 10 to come either.\n\nDo note there is technically nothing wrong with it. It works smoothly. looks good etc. There just isn't a proper game underneath the hood. Want to kill time while moderately stressing your brain? sure thing - buy this.\n\nThis game would have needed better game concept design. It seems the designers could not quite decide if they wanted to make this a kids game or a more challenging game in the spirit of Lemmings.

When you want the babies to walk slow they are so fast and when you really need them to speed up they are like great-grandmothers taking a stroll in the park.

For most of us, there's almost always about a million things we'd rather be doing than our current job. When the clock's laughing in your face, you'll find just about any reason you can think of to slack off. Suddenly, twirling your pencil becomes a sport, the Internet becomes your new work television, and Windows Solitaire has you ignoring every responsible thing you know you should be doing instead.\nEnter Monomino, an E-rated casual puzzler developed by final year students from Nanyang Polytechnic in Singapore. A delightfully casual game that's both challenging and addictive, Monomino will have you clocking out early for lunch, then clocking in a whole half an hour late. It's a highly addictive game that's anything but dumb and easy.\n\nThat's one way to teach your children about safe sex...\nAside from being slightly weird, the game is strangely challenging. You'll get used to restarting the levels trying frantically to figure out what you have to do to get those Monominos home; it's all trial and error. The little guys walk aimlessly in one direction and then turn around. They won't climb higher than one block, they can't jump over gaps, and they can't fly, so you have to use your head and figure out how to lay those polyforms down. Once you place a piece down, it can't be removed, so choose wisely. As the levels progress, you'll be given other tools like bombs and springboards to help you lead the babies home – and when you finally do get them home, it's pretty satisfying to say the least.\nThe game is not without its flaws. For starters, it is completely devoid of any sort of options menu. That means the background music that's been playing for the past hour cannot be turned off. You'll simply have to turn your speakers off... or take a power drill to your eardrum, whichever seems logical at the time. You also don't get a lot of time to figure out how to lay out your pieces, which means you'll be restarting the levels a lot. Sure, you can trap the little buggers while you figure out a strategy, but other than that, it's all on the fly.\n\nAs simple as the game is, you'd think it would get boring after a while, but instead you'll find yourself getting sucked into it, and with 100 levels, you'll be busy for sure. Obviously not a title for the hardcore gamer, Monomino works on a simple system that honestly keeps you heavily entertained. The game is simple enough to play it casually, but challenging enough to have you banging your fist on the desk like "Oh, come on! I can do this!"\nMonomino is a great time waster, and an excellent first attempt for Nanyang Polytechnic. It's good to know there's still a place for simple games like this in the gaming world. You can grab it on Steam now for the very affordable sale price of $4.49 – which is good because once your boss finds out that for the last two days all you've been doing is drinking up the company's coffee and playing Monomino, you're probably going to want to save as much money as you can.","October 6, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"
