Why force the use of mouse wheel? No idea and no real rationale behind it. Developers could have simply implemented the use of two keys for the same results. Or could have supported gamepad. Though luck: my computer is a laptop. Couldn't move forward in the game. Game specs don't specify that the use of mouse wheel is mandatory. Refund requested and obtained. So beware before buying this game.","September 3, 2015","false","0.2"," 30 of 49 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","30","49","0","2"

The presentation is nice and the fluid physics seem to be pretty spot on.  They react how you expect them to react and do so reliably each time which is important for physics based gameplay like this.  It seems like it would be a simple concept that would be difficult to find challenge in, but the levels do up the ante as you progress.  Very early in I was presented with a few that really had me scratching my head a bit.  But they weren't so difficult that I left the experience frustrated.\n\nMost importantly, the dev is very responsive to the community and you can tell they are very passionate about the game.  I had a small scoring issue which I posted about and got a reply within hours.  The bug was not only fixed within the week but followed up on in the comment thread by the dev to let me know.  It's a pleasure to support devs who are so active with their community and willing to fix things even when they can't replicate the bugs we're seeing.  It's a refreshing change from so many of these unfinished or bug-ridden games that release then wallow for months without updates.  Well worth a purchase if even just to support those qualities that we should be looking for in game devs.  It doesn't hurt that it's pretty fun to boot.","February 23, 2015","true","1.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I can say I've never owned nor played the original but I got the hang of it quite quickly. Bloop Reloaded doesn't required much of a tutorial but fulfills when required.\nPros:\n- Simple & easy to play.\n- Easy to use level builder.\n- Nice artistic graphics.\n- Fun Music.\n- Steam Trading Cards.\n\nCons:\n- Short Gameplay although the Level Builder extends it.\n- Expensive for a small game.\n\nPrice:\nI didn't pay full price for this game, around $1. On steam it is valued at $10... I have to say right now, never pay $10 for this game. You can usually find it on sale & even then it can be a little pricey. Personally I'd value it at $1-$2.\n\nOverall Score:\nI'd give Bloop Reloaded by 2SD a 58/100. Fun for a while when you're bored but not exactly worth a $10 investment.","February 16","true","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

All my developer sponsored reviews are positive because I review games that I like!\n═══════════════════════════════════\nOVERVIEW\nBloop Reloaded\n\nThis game is similar to classics like Lemmings. You guide an oject to an objective. The main difference between this game and Lemmings is that while Lemmings deals mostly with a programming aspect to guide the objects to the objective, Bloop Reloaded uses physics to guide liquids. You must create platforms to guide the liquids to the bottle, avoiding hazards and sometimes mixing to liquids to get an end product. Aside from the pre-level setup of platforms, the player can use the right mouse button to pick up and move quantities of the liquid.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/315060/\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPROS & CONS\nPros\nThe ambient music is great\nCons\nThe mechanics are poorly explained\nThe right mouse button mechanic defeats the puzzle aspect of the game\nInstead of a cooldown for the right mouse button mechanic, you must hunt down and left click on floating ojects to gain more time that this ability can be active\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSUMMARY & FINAL RATING\nThis game suffers a few design flaws that make it less fun to play. Being able to pick up the liquids and move them around defeats the need to solve a puzzle. If Lemmings allowed such a function, the game would not have been as successful. The fact that this ability can be active for a certain amount of time and then be recharged hurts the gameplay. Having the skill slowly recharge would make the skill more interesting than having to switch tasks to find the skill recharge items. It plays like two distantly related minigames that are expected to be perceived as a whole game. I really like puzzle games for their need to plan out how to complete a level, but the right mouse button skill negates the need to really plan for anything.\n\n3/10\n═══════════════════════════════════\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow  Lot's O Giveaway's  group curations  here !","March 13","false","0.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This one is a really cool physics based puzzle. I like the way diffrent chemical behaves. But this game suffers with a bad UI design. There is no way to restart a level you will have to quit the game to main menu and the select the desired level.\nit is still a solid puzzle game which doesn't hold your hand (at all). After 2-3 basic levels there is no info or help. You will have to figure out everything on your own. Sometimes you will feel lost, and it may frustrate you.\n\nIn my opinion it is a flawed gem, which fulfils my hunger for puzzle.","September 1, 2015","true","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
