The game was incredibly fun. During the normal playthrough, the keys move and feel great, and the abilities are all super fun and responsive and fitting. The bosses were interesting, and the game was satisfying.\n\nAfter completion, I enjoyed going around, completing the area and the zones, which was so enjoyable I decided to just complete the entire game again in Hard mode!\n\nHard mode, however, was a surprise, as parts of it were genuinely hard! Usually, as a longtime gamer, I'll find hard mode to simply be "normal" level of difficulty, but in Guacamelee the bosses and, later on in the last zones, even the mobs, are incredibly challenging, which again gives a satisfying edge for further completion.\n\nI'd highly recommend this game at any price, but as it's an older game it will undoubtedly be on sale soon, so ensure you pick up this very fun and engaging title when it is!\n\nNilesy","November 23, 2013","true","20.5"," 326 of 344 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","326","344","0","0"

Their emphasis on exploration and character building make them instant favorite for those looking for those looking for retro gaming experiences with contemporary flavor. In addition to that contemporary flavor, Guacamelee is also spiced with chili powder and served with a shot of tequila. It's a south of the border styled adventure packed with plenty of platforming and pugilism as well as a sexy senorita in distress. It also might be, surprisingly, one of the best games you will play all year.\n\nYou play as a simple agave farmer named Juan who finds himself having the worst DÃ­a de los Muertos celebration ever when and evil Charro named Calaca abducts El Presidente's daughter and sends Juan to the underworld. In a small stroke of luck Juan is resurrected and transformed into a luchadore so that he may rescue El Presidente's daughter and stop Calaca from wreaking havoc among the living. The plot is Guacamelee is what pico de gallo is to a taco, it provides color and flavor but certainly isn't the main attraction. The healthy dose of humor and Mexican culture and folklore do distinguish Guacamelee from its contemporaries however and give it a unique ambiance.\n\nUnlike most metroidvania styled games, Guacamelee places a huge emphasis on platforming and some optional areas have an almost Super Meat Boy like difficulty requiring quick and precise actions to traverse the obstacles laid out. Most of Juan's offensive repertoire doubles as a means to navigate the environment. A Street Fighter style flaming uppercut acts as a super jump, a charging maneuver that can be devastating to your foes is also effective when it comes to smashing blocks. By the end of the game these abilities can be combined into lengthy, deadly combos and used to reach far off platforms. Juan also eventually gains the ability to swap between the world of the living and the world of the dead and much like The Gianna Sisters, things change between worlds, opening up new passageways and allowing Juan to reach previously inaccessible areas.\n\nThe fundamentals of combat are simple enough on the surface with one button throwing punches, another dedicated to special attacks and one used to grapple enemies once enough damage has been doled out. Grapples are very effective for crowd control since once an enemy is in Juan's grasp the game slows down and an arrow indicates where your foe will be tossed and throwing your enemies into each other is always a good idea. Special grapple maneuvers can also be purchased at the games save points for additional offensive options. Costumes, health and stamina upgrades are also available for purchase. Combat starts out simple enough but over the course of the game's six or so hours enemy types are mixed up and combined with the platforming ca pose a satisfactory challenge. Some enemies have shields that require a particular special to bring down. Bosses also challenge your mastery of Juan's skills and many offer multiple phases.\n\nAs with any metroidvania game backtracking is a necessity if you want to grab every secret that Guacamelee has to offer and this is made painless as a result of a fantastic map and plentiful fast travel points. Blocks that require specific abilities to break are color coded and their location is marked on your map making them easy to find on repeat visits once Juan has the proper skills to smash them. Chests are also marked on the map. Rounding out the distractions are a handful of side missions who can be found by talking to the citizens of the two towns you are able to visit. These missions involve everything from simple mini games to talking to every citizen in an effort to gather the ingredients necessary to make the world greatest enchilada. The only problem with these side missions is that they are very centralized and don't really require any exploration. It's easy to complete most of them within a matter of minutes.","November 25, 2013","true","12.1"," 82 of 97 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","82","97","0","0"

So why bother getting this version when they're the same price?\n\nGuacamelee is a joy to play platforming beat'em up done in a Metroidvania style with a lot of flair and fresh ideas for an old genre. The combat is excellent. Easy to play, tough to master. Attack button, special attack, roll trigger and jump are the basics you need to know. You can uppercut enemies into the air, jump and punch them, roll through enemy attacks and hazards, grapple enemies to throw them in any direction you want. There is good stuff here. Then as the game progresses, you unlock special moves, like jumping uppercuts, wall jumps, double jumps, headbutts, frog stomps, wall climbs where you shoot yourself straight until something stops you. All of this is considered combat, but in Guacamelee it is also a means of traversing. Jump uppercut will let you break red walls or its used as an extra boost while in mid air. Now just that, but the game's enemies will eventually have shields that can only be broken by special attacks. The shields are all color coated, such as jumping uppercuts break red walls and red shields. Yellow shields and walls are broken by headbutts and so on. Then on top of that there's an extra layer of day and night worlds or living and dead worlds. You flip through them to traverse or take out enemies that can only take damage in the living or day. They still hit you if you're not in their world, but you just can't hit them.\n\nEach world full of bright, vibrant and beautiful colors. The game is a joy to look at as well as play. Great simple story, the president's daughter has been kidnapped and you are killed, but resurrected by a luchadore mask. Everything has a lucha Mexican vibe to it and that makes the game feel so fresh and different instead of space worlds or never ending castles. The world isn't that big and really it feels like there are a few specific combat areas tied together by a major town. There's no real chance to get lost, since you have a map and the map will always point you to your objective, without revealing rooms that you've been in.\n\nWhile the combat is easy and joyful enough, the game really starts getting tricky with your powers. Such as having to wall jump back and forth all while switching between the living and dead worlds. Timing plays a big part in the later areas. There are plenty of side rooms with parts of heart and stamina containers that will really test your skills and timing, but since there are frequent easy challenges, it makes the big challenges seem less daunting and have a 'one more try' mentality.\n\nI have completed the game on PSN and it seems like the Gold Edition on Steam is just easier when it comes to bosses. The bosses are simpler and I can't say that's a bad thing. Maybe its because there is no difficulty setting for the Gold Edition. Steam also offers character skins in the Steam Workshop, which is always nice.\n\nOn PSN I completed the game in 4 or so hours and that's when it was more difficult. That might not be enough play time in some people's opinion, but it was an absolute joy to play and well worth the time and money. I'd much rather have a game be short and sweet than long and boring.","February 19, 2014","true","6.0"," 59 of 66 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","59","66","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/214770/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Guacamelee is an action platformer that was released in August 2013, published and developed by DrinkBox Sudios. Originally pinned as a Sony exclusive on the PS3 and Vita, it was however later ported to PC before eventually getting the "Gold Edition" releasing on all of the platform in mid 2014. Guacamelee is heavily based on Mexican culture and lore.\n\nYou play the role of Juan, a powerful luchador fighter. You will be fighting various different enemies in this platforming metroidvania style game. You start off with a very basic arsenal of attacks which you can pull off such as a basic three attack combo, but eventually you can work you way up to combos which can consist of eight plus button presses! (I never managed to pull off one of these more than once). Juan will also learn a various number of "out of combat" skills, such as wall jumping and the ability to turn into a chicken. The platforming element of Guacamelee was probably the most annoying for me, mainly because I am just terrible at the genre, but I found the jumping puzzles to be just tedious and grew very thin on my patience at times.  The fighting side of the game is done very well; the combo system and special moves you can pull off are all really well done - some fights you will end up getting swamped by enemies, but it won't matter since you can throw together a number of punches which will just knock them out with ease.\n\nGraphically, there isn't too much to shout about, it's a 2d side scroller so generally nothing spectacular is going to be seen, however the art style on show is gorgeous. This really portrays the Mexican style of game extremely well, and is probably the game's best feature. It looks very similar to the recent release of "The Book of Life" from 2014. Whilst it has a cartoon look to it, there is still an element of maturity and darkness in some of the scenes.\n\nThe plot in Guacamelee! was nice. It is your typical adventure style story, the humble farmer who is in love with the El Presidente's daughter, the daughter then gets kidnapped, and it is your task to rescue her so you can live happily ever after.  The plot is very well thought out, offers a couple of cliffhangers and interesting twists and turn a long the way. Guacamelee also has a couple of comical moments in too to lighten the mood.\n\nGuacamelee is another game which doesn't have voice acting in; I would really of liked to have seen (or heard) it included, because there is quite a bit of text to read through and I would of thought that having voice acting would make people get more immersed into this wonderful world on show. Having said that, the sound track is amazing. It is playing pretty much constantly throughout the game, and it never wears thin.\n\nAs I said above, the I found the platforming side of the game to be the most annoying, mainly because it is super difficult to progress in the game due to a number of jumping puzzles which had me close to rage quiting a number of times. Eventually you will get past them, it just takes perseverance and a lot of patience (something I am slowly finding out that I don't have very much of).  Most of the fight scenes are easily mastered and you probably won't find your self dying an awful lot in this game. The opportunity to raise the difficulty level may change this though, which is something more confident veteran combo fighters will want to check out.\n\nThe world in which Guacamelee is set in, is very well fleshed out. There are plenty of NPCs to interact with, loads of side quests to find and complete, most of which are of no relevance to the main story, and is just an extra way to generate funds. Touching again on the topic of special abilities, you will also find your self backtracking to a degree in the game so you can use the new abilities you have just unlocked to reach places which you couldn't before, to unlock chests, health bonuses etc. You will also find a number of shops scattered around the world where you can purchase health and stamina upgrades along with a number of other power ups.\n\nA full playthrough of Guacamelee took me almost eleven hours to complete; this was with the inclusion of the majority of the side quests too. I would say that eleven hours is just the right amount for me. The game also has a local co-op mode which you will find adds a whole new element to the game as well and is certainly worth a second playthrough on this mode, easily touching this game up to the twenty hour mark - and then of course there are the higher difficulty modes you can play on should you desire so. There is plenty of content on offer in Guacamelee to sink your teeth into.\n\nNo technical issues here; played on 4k resolution, at a steady 60 FPS as should be expected from a 2d side scroller. You will need a controller to play this game to any degree of competency though, simple because the jumping puzzles and combos would just be ridiculously hard to counter on a keyboard. The options menu also includes a wide variety of options when it comes to selecting resolutions and frame rates too, which is always nice to see.\n\nIn conclusion, Guacamelee! is a really rounded out game, which is certainly one of the best indie titles to come out in recent years. The addition of local co-op makes this game even better, and fans of metroidvania style games really need to check this out. The price of Â£9,99 is an absolute bargain for the amount of content on show here too.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/214770/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Guacamelee! is a colorful 2D action platformer by Canadian developer DrinkBox set in a vibrant and thoroughly unique world inspired by Mexican folklore. The players take over the role of an agave farmer Juan who becomes a luchador after El Presidenteâs Daughter is kidnapped by a charro skeleton Carlos Calaca. Itâs as zaney as it sounds, but it just works. The story is basic and presented only in text, the writing isnât great, but youâll get a few chuckles out of it here and there.\n\nThe first thing youâll notice are the fantastic audiovisuals that set the tone beautifully. The game world is a wonderful fusion of vibrant colors and cheerful music. The soundtrack is simply awesome, it sounds as if a house DJ remixed a mariachi band. Both of these elements come together to create a game world that is simply a joy to explore.\n\nConsidering that Juan is a luchador, the combat is melee-based â as the game title itself suggests. It starts off very basic with only a few moves, but you will unlock a healthy amount of varied and satisfying special moves during the course of the game. These are mostly wrestling moves such as the body slam or the headbutt. Different enemies will require different tactics and moves and they will sometimes be color-coded which means that only a specific attack can hurt them. Also, the game will at one point introduce a dimension-shifting mechanic which will alternate between the living and the dead worlds. Certain enemies can only be beaten in a specific dimension. Once the game starts throwing enemies in different colors and dimensions, the combat gets incredibly frenetic and intense due to the amount of stuff you need to consider. The fast-paced combat feels good thanks to sharp controls and the variety of moves at your disposal. Guacamelee! is a really tough game and you have to be vigilant at all times as you will often get beaten to a pulp. But it just feels so good that I always felt compelled to keep trying and get it right.\n\nOutside of combat, thereâs a fairly nice-sized world to explore full of secrets to find. But it will be incredibly hard getting to those goodies. This is where the platforming and dimension swapping come into its own. Certain platforms, walls or columns will only be visible in a certain dimension and the game will often make you switch dimensions mid-jump. It can get pretty nerve-wracking as the game demands pinpoint precision. Once again, the stellar controls make it worthwhile to persevere even though the fiendish difficulty will try its best to break your spirit.\n\nGuacameleeâs retro design is both its strength and weakness. Thereâs no question that the design is strong, but it will at times give in to needless trial and error drowning the player in frustrating repetition. It will also feel cheap at times with enemies that will strike in moments when you really canât do anything. But the sense of accomplishment is great indeed. I would say that a game like this is more enjoyable on the second run. Once youâve unlocked all your powers and moves, the level of frustration drops down significantly.\n\nIn the end, Guacamelee! does what it sets out to do masterfully. Despite the overly punishing difficulty and a few design quibbles, itâs a great game worth playing for its fantastic world, frenetic combat and satisfying platforming.\n\n8 OUT OF 10 (GREAT)","February 28, 2014","true","18.9"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","41","46","0","4"

Newer release here: http://store.steampowered.com/app/275390/?snr=1_5_1100__1100\n\nGuacamelee! is a game that brings nothing new to the front table. Its roots are pretty obvious, as it's a game that pays a staggering homage to the likes of Metroid and Castlevania. However, it adds nice puzzle elements and blends everything with such finesse and precision that elevates this game way beyond the "old school tribute" that many Indy games seem to be around these days, as it's safe to say, the boys from Drinkbox Studios went the extra mile and dwelled way pass their confort zone.\n\nThe graphics are amazing, the art has that Comic book feel to it and the colors are warm and well put together. Every character has their own feel and, despite their all sharing that Mexican Luchadore vybe with the masks, skulls and marching mariachis, they have their own sense of indivuality so the game wont bore you with that. Soundtrack is nice as well and the sound effects are really retro, part what I like most about this.\n\nApart from the challenging puzzles, the part that I liked most was certainly the bosses, specially the Leopard fight, it was one of the hardest and most fun I've ever faced.\n\nOverall, great game with a nice amount of replay-value.","June 14, 2015","true","19.4"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","30","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/214770/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Guacamelee is likely my favorite title of any video game ever, which makes it a good thing the game that actually bares it is so awesome! Drinkbox Studios, developers of one of my other favorites from recent years, Mutant Blobs Attack, has completely outdone themselves with not only their best creation yet, but one of the most fun and charming games of the year.\n\nIn a world that all but worships Luchadores, Juan is just a normal guy who hope he may one day have a shot with the governor's daughter. But when a band of demon's attack he is sent on a one way trip to the land of the dead, he must don the mask and become a Luchadore to save his beloved (and as it turns out, the entire world).\n\nIt's a setup seen a million times, but here it's tweeted and turned into a hilarious and unexpectedly engaging tale. Full of terrific and hilarious writing, as well as fantastic characters that while encompassing cliched roles, are all fully developed and likable (even the villains, crazy as it may sound). If this was a movie I'd have been impressed, but when paired with the great gameplay it's truly an amazing experience.\n\nFor fans of metroidvanias, this is the equivalent of being serenaded by a mariachi band outside your window. The world strikes the perfect balance between size and navigability,making it almost impossible to get lost but hiding tons of secrets to find. In classic fashion certain areas are blocked off until you collect the requisite move, but what Guacamelee does that not many games of this sort do is make almost every move you gain equally usable in combat and exploration, keeping both parts fresh throughout.\n\nThe combat system is easy to understand and yet full of depth in how you use it. Only a few buttons are used but combining them can produce a wealth of different moves, and it's up to you to make the most of them to rack up huge combos, or just stick to the basics and punch everyone in the face. Boss fights require a bit more planning in how you approach them, and this does present a slight problem as they put up a much better fight than most of their minions. Thankfully it's usually just a matter of memorizing their patterns in order to finally beat them.\n\nPlatforming is the other half of the package, and the level designs are outstanding. Utilizing familiar moves like double jumps and wall jumping, they place you in new and creative scenarios that proved a joy to navigate. It's not until you begin to use one the most prominent mechanics though, switching between the world of the dead and that of the living, that the levels really take off. Because some platforms (and in combat, enemies) can only be seen in one realm or the other you have to quickly switch between them as you jump from point to point in an amazing display of platforming genius. Even the early sections top anything Mutant Blobs had to offer, and the quality only goes up from their.\n\nA couple of minor playability problems do pop up, with the somewhat clunky controls being chief among them. Because you are required to use the stick and buttons in conjunction with one another to pull off most special moves, it can lead to problems where you are pressing the stink in the opposite direction you need to be heading  often sending you off a cliff or into the path of an enemy. They aren't bad, but they could have been better and make some of the more difficult sections terribly frustrating. I also wish that side-missions were highlighted on your map, as there isn't any indication of them in the game and without the achievements informing me of their existence I'd likely have missed them.\n\nDespite these minor issues Guacamelee is an all around excellent experience that makes it easy to gloss over the few rough spots. The art style is brilliant and creative, the gameplay very enjoyable, and the soundtrack a freaking incredible blending of contemporary hip-hop and rock, and traditional Mexican Ranchera music. It's a great deal of fun and incredibly charming though and through, and most of all a game everyone should take the time to play.\n\nViva la Drinkbox!","November 22, 2013","true","6.6"," 39 of 51 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","39","51","0","1"

It is a very well-crafted metroidvania game with a great combat system and a very unique setting.  I don't think I've heard of any other games where you play a luchadore.\n\nFrom the graphical style to the music, the writing and the sense of humor, gameplay and combat design, every aspect of this game is top notch.

You can pull off some great combos and it even takes some cues from fighting games, adding mechanics like dodge canceling of special moves.  The game also includes a set of alternate costumes you can unlock which affect your combat abilities and strength.\n\nIf you're a fan of beat-em-up games or metroidvanias, I think you would enjoy this game.

The art is great, the music is great, and the game is very clever in a lot of places. However, once you get deep into it, everything sort of devolves into a series of contrived and unforgivingly difficult jumping puzzles. They're not particularly hard to figure out, but they are almost certain to be incredibly frustrating to execute.\n\nI think the controls are partially to blame. As the game progresses you earn more and more super moves, taking the controls from tight and simple to needlessly complex. Also, my platforming reflexes have dulled with age a bit, so I'm partially to blame. Either way, this is probably one of the hardest games I've played in a very long time, if not ever.\n\nThe beginning of the game is simple, charming and enjoyable. As it became more difficult it wore out its welcome quickly to the point that I found myself really not enjoying it anymore. If you're young and have the dexterity and patience for this, I highly recommended it. Ultimately for me it gets a thumbs down because my fat thumbs and I were ready to snap the controller in half by the time I decided to stop playing and move on to something more worth my time.","January 6, 2014","false","12.8"," 93 of 153 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","93","153","0","0"

I'm feeling lazy so you know what that means?\nBULLET POINTS!!!!!!!!!2\n\n+Combat is good. As you progress you get new moves and can create some wicked combos. It's not at all necessary to win fights, but it's fun to play around with.\n+Nice bits of exploration. Each area has plenty of secret rooms, some offering different challenges. The game is well-paced and simply getting from place to place is rewarding.\n+As with any Metroidvania worth its salt, Guacamelee! can be played through in a variety of ways. 100%, Low %, speedrunning, etc.\n+There are quite a few challenging platforming segments. They make strong use of an ability to switch between worlds and have different platforms appear. Also most of the special moves are used effectively as transportation. It's all very well done.\n+Good bosses, though you're probably better off playing Hard mode if you want them to be really challenging.\n+Plenty of side-content.\n\n-A couple of optional items are placed in obtuse locations. I'm usually pretty decent at finding stuff in Metroidvanias, but I had to look up a guide to figure these out. More of a nitpick really.\n-For 80% of the game, hard mode is basically just enemies doing more damage. The bosses really step it up, which is welcome but can also make the difficulty feel uneven.\n-The Chupacabra's sword-stab does a crazy amount of damage. It's like...I don't know..It just really stands out. Oh and yeah this also counts as nitpicking.\n\n-Controller issue. This is an odd one. Basically whenever I hit RT to switch between worlds, there are times when the button gets stuck or doesn't respond. I've read some posts where other posters mention this issue. It's possible that it could just be my controller, but I'm not going to buy a new one when this game and RE6 are the only ones I have this problem with. Besides, this glitch is fixed in the "Super Turbo Championship Edition" of Guacamelee.\n\nI recommend this game.\nOh wait, that's redundant isn't it? I already gave it the thumbs up.

This game is now one of my favourite skill based platformers. The difficulty increases at a perfect pace in my opinion. It's also nice that you visit old areas/levels after getting new skills, so you can reach secrets. At some points it's really hard to advance and you need to combine all skills you have curretnly available. I advice you to use a gamepad for this game, with a keyboard it might be very tricky and cause frustration. At least there is a great soundtrack with lots of different songs and they are not annoying when you are trying this one hard jump for the 50th time.\n\nSome things that could imrpove the gaming experience would be more spoken dialogue, it's really alot ot read. Also some cut scenes and splash screens have a really annoying colour flashing, so I needed to close my eyes whenever they appeared before I got an epileptic seizure. :D\n\nAs I said earlier, I'm now 5 hours into the game and it feels like I achieveved alot, I would guess I'm at around 80% completion and I can't wait for tomorrow to finish the rest and get all the remaining achievements aswell. The game even has a Cooperation Mode that I will probably never try, but maybe it's interesting for some people.\n\nThe 'Super Turbo Championship Edition' (a polished version with some more content) is actually on sale now, so I would go ahead and buy it.

The fighting system is the highlight of this game, and is really intuitive and has a wide set of tools once you start upgrading his/her abilities. Anyone can pick up a controller and join your game at anytime which is really cool, they can also work on upgrading their character as well. The art style in combination with the fiesta style music feels really lively and compelling and is really what helps set this game apart from others like it.

The pacing is great, just as you begin to master a technique the game introduces a new ability and a new set of challenges to overcome. By the end of the game, you'll be weaving all of your abilities together, evading traps and fighting enemies from two dimensions through some challenging but fair levels. The controls are solid and the animations are very fluid allowing you to chain combo's together seamlessly whether defeating enemies or manoeuvring through the world.\n\nThe only slight quibble I had with the game (and certainly not enough that it dampened the experience) were a couple of sidequests, complete with !

Does this sound like an appealing combination to you?  Yes?  Then just get it right now, because you will enjoy it.\n\nEvery part of this game is well done and polished.  The combat is smooth and gives a good feeling of advancement, doling out new abilities that both add to the fun of combat and give you an extra bit of exploring power.  The main game is challenging but definitely finishable, though I anticipate some people may have trouble with some of the bosses.  I'm not GREAT at beat-em-up type games but I found that I was able to push through some of the harder parts after no more than a few tries, with very few exceptions (and these exceptions were mainly bosses or challenge areas).  Where it really puts you up against the wall are the optional challenges.  Some are incredibly difficult platforming sections (one actually a little too difficult in my opinion, though I did manage it), others brutal combat sequences.  But these are all optional - Though there are some challenging bits in the main playthrough, for the most part it may only take a little practice to get through these.\n\nThe exploration is a real joy, though, especially once you get the ability to swap worlds at will.  Dual worlds is not a new concept (Zelda, Castlevania, and plenty of other games have used it), but it is not unwelcome and, even more, fits very well in with the story here.  And, by the way, the story is incredibly simple, and yet, tied with the sense of humor this game has, is well done and does not break the flow of the game.\n\nAlong with this, the visual style is incredibly bright, well animated and just full of visual treats and silly references.  It doesn't rely on these references to get anything across, they are merely little bonus details, but easily appreciated by fans of games in general.\n\nThe only criticism I have to offer is that I sometimes feel like combat is too hectic to tell what is going on and that the bosses may have a little bit of a difficulty spike, but other than that I heartily recommend this game.  All the pieces fit together into something fun, light-hearted and well polished.","December 30, 2013","true","34.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","3"

The influence of Super Nintendo all-time classics such as Zelda: A Link to the Past and Super Metroid are very obvious in Guacamelee.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n- The graphics are exquisitely beautiful. The bright colors and fun-to-look-at landscapes create a very rich and visually appealing world.\n- The action is fast and smooth. You can create some crazy insane combos if you learn how to chain them correctly. It reminded me a lot of Street Fighter where, if you can execute, then you can pull off some very satisfying hurt-filled awesomeness.\n- The music is pretty sweet. It is Mexican themed and a lot of fun to listen to. I would find myself humming these tunes randomly without thinking about it. That's when you know it's done well.\n\nThe BAD:\n- Some of the platforming areas can get really difficult and will require you to have patience and good reaction times. Some people may not enjoy this part as it can get a bit frustrating.\n- It is not required, but a controller is recommended for this game. I personally completed the entire thing with a keyboard, so it's definitely not necessary to have a controller if you are comfortabe with a keyboard. Whatever you prefer.\n- I can't really think of anything bad about Guacamelee, maybe just a few things to add/improve on. Like maybe making the dojo always open so you can practice combos, little things like that.\n\nAs a side note, the boss fights can get pretty difficult. They are are all 100% patterns though and you just need to learn their visual/audio cues and how to react to them. You cannot just try to zerg the bosses, you will die. Have some patience and learn their patterns, react accordingly, and you will take them down in no time!\n\nOverall, Guacamelee is a lot of fun, very pretty, and is definitely a current era title with some influences from classic Nintento. Guacamelee takes about 8-10 hours to complete.\n\n9/10\n\nPlease upvote this review if you found it useful :)\n\n\n","August 14, 2014","true","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"Difficult" is not adding HP or extra damage to monsters. I swear there are still too many punishing mechanics masked as challenge curves  such as forcing the player to wait or rushing to reclaim everything that you've earned in a previous playthrough. "Difficult" makes the player think and plan. "Difficult" should challenge the game developer as much as it challenges the player.\n\nGuacamelee is difficult, especially if you want the true ending, but it's not punishing. I miss a jump, I go back to the last platform, I try again. THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE. THIS IS WHAT EARNS THIS GAME THE THUMBS UP FROM THIS REVIEWER. I never felt like I was wasting any time playing Guacamelee. There's variety in the platforming challenges, introduced by incorporating the special moves that you discover as tools to broaden movement. The Rooster Uppercut introduces double, then triple jumps. The Dashing Derpderp (bad name, I know), brings a horizontal dash and so forth... There's no resource management to worry about (and that's including health management), you just have the platform challenge in its purest form.\n\nI'm old. Thirty-five years old. I've played the old NES platformers. There is absolutely nothing good to remember from any of these games. None. I'm gushing because I remember â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Castlevania, â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Ninja Turtles and â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ Megaman and Guacamalee ISN'T LIKE THAT. Thank goodness. By the way, that's why every review of Shovel Knight has made me wary of it. Briefly considered it, considered the hype, remembered the old days and went NUH-UH.\n\nIronically, the hard mode of this game is a complete wash. Just more damage from the monsters and more hits required to kill 'em. Kinda breaks the whole point of my review but I really wanted to laud everything else about this game.\n\nIt really does seem like a fun challenging platformer with monsters thrown in because of course you need monsters to smash. A whole combo tutorial camp and none of its lessons are ever necessary. A game built around luchadors and then you have this weak â¥â¥â¥ combat system. It's kind of a bait-and-switch in that regard: the moves you unlock seem to have a platforming purpose first and an enemy bashing purpose second... Artificial purpose at that, what with the introduction of colored shields to force you to use the appropriately colored attack. That's a juvenile way to handle combat. Boss fights centered on pattern recognition? Yes, that is a hallmark from the platformers of old but that doesn't mean you couldn't add some innovation on it.\n\nI ain't mad, and this is coming from a huge wrestling fan who bought the game because he wanted to play a luchador protagonist. The rest of the game made it worth it.","October 18, 2014","true","11.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

It has platforming, fighting, ability progression, all very well made. Its Metascore is well deserved.\n\nI hate fighting games, and the platforming aspect of Guacamelee! is not shown well in the videos and screenshots, so I had very low expectations for it. Aaaaand it's one of my favorite games now.\nSo if you think it's kinda cool, get it and you will not be disappointed. Make sure to give it some time, because the beginning is indeed underwhelming.\n\nIf you're still hesitating, a description of the gameplay follows. Contains minor gameplay spoilers (like revealing what abilities await you before you unlock them).\n\nIn Guacamelee! you unlock various abilities as you progress. But there aren't separate "fighting abilities" and "movement abilities", because they're the same thing! At first you get an "uppercut" ability, which is also a poor-man's double jump. Later you get wall-jumping, dashes, smashes, etc. and eventually the actual double jump, and more yet. All these things are very pleasant to apply in combination to reach more and more places and solve (mostly optional) difficult platforming challenges.\n\nThe parts where you kill enemies are also a lot of fun. You can do combos... throw enemies into the air, punch the â¥â¥â¥â¥ out of them, dash to the other side, punch some more, slam them down... that's one example.\nIn many games where you kill things I don't see the point in blocking or using different combos, because usually mashing one button and eventually doing that one overpowered combination will do.\nHere, though, dodging is something you do a lot. You need to block other enemies' attacks while you're dealing with one or a few of them. It's intuitive and accompanied with nice subtle visual effects. It's fun to anticipate enemies' attacks and dodge projectiles just in time. And of course, different enemies need different strategies. Some of them have colored shields, which require you to use a particular special attack on them first. This doesn't sound that exciting but it really adds a lot to the game in combination with other small things.\n\nThere are many characters/costumes with different stats and traits that suit different situations and playstyles.\n\nLocal co-op multiplayer... that's very nice probably. But I haven't tried it.\n\nDifficulty... Yes, Guacamelee! is quite difficult, although most of the difficult parts are optional, as I already said. If you have some experience with platformers, you will feel right at home: the game won't be very hard, but will still feel rewarding.\n\nControls are nice. You can do a ton of things with relatively few keys. Keyboard is redefinable.\nBut I played with a controller. Buttons are not redefinable, but the controller support seems very, very good, because my very old noname controller worked perfectly, while most games mirror the 4 buttons on it...\n\nThe duration of the first playthrough can vary wildly, depending on your pace and completion rate... let's say 6-14 hours.\nTo get all achievements you may need 15-22 hours. All achievements are fun to get, not grindy and not missable, but some of them may be too hard for the average player.\n\nIf you don't like the theme of the game, don't worry, at first I wasn't too fond of it either. But you get used to it and it's quite nice.\nAnd if you don't like the main character, you can change it almost right away...\n\nââââââââââ","March 1, 2014","true","18.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/froomtan/recommended/214770/","froomtan","SammyBoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/froomtan/","160 products in account","Guacamelee is a 2-D platforming action game set in a Mexican themed world, with a smaller emphasis on story than pure action (although there's still enough there to make you care). It follows the adventures of Juan, an everyday farmer who is resurrected after being killed by the evil Carlos Calacka, as he punches, jumps, and kicks his way to freeing the daughter of El Presidente.\nThe fighting in this game is superb - there is a great mix of normal attacks and more powerful special attacks that are unlocked throughout the game, and moment to moment action feels great. Trying to chain up a huge combo by pummelling enemies into the air, picking them up and throwing them into other enemies so they all land in a huge heap is fast, fluid, and feels amazing. There is a large variety in the enemies you face - starting off with standard brute enemies, and eventually leading up to giants with hammers, spikey armadillos with deadly, fast attacks, four armed sword wielding skeletons, and flying lightning priests. The game slowly introduces these enemies to match your rising skill level, and starts mix and matching them cleverly which leads to some genuinely difficult fights. That being said, on Normal mode (Hard mode is unlocked only after beating the game, and is much harder â enemies have more health, and you have less) the game is not very difficult, due to a forgiving checkpoint system and it will only take about 10 hours to finish the story. However, there are many collectibles hidden around the maps that can keep you occupied as you try for 100% - again, this will only take an additional 4 hours or so. There are also additional challenges (the El Infierno levels) that test your fighting, platforming, and thinking skills â these are easily the most difficult part of the game, and getting a gold medal in all challenges is a worthy achievement.\nThe art style in Guacamelee is one of the most striking things about the game â the graphics are crisp and look beautiful, all presented in a lovely and vibrant, if clichÃ©d, Mexican style. The soundtrack is much the same â beautiful, and easy to listen to for hours on end. These two combine to form a convincing and engaging that makes the game fun to play for hours on end.\nSummary:\n- Beautiful aesthetics, both graphically and musically\n- Fast, fluid and fun combat\n- Great boss battles that test your fighting skills\n- Responsive and challenging platforming.\nA great mix of platforming and action, combined with a beautiful world make this a must buy, whether you like platforming and/or fighting games. This game is worth full price, and definitely grab it if it is on a sale.\n","June 23, 2014","true","23.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

The combat mechanics are simple, but execute to look quite flashy and complicated when chaining combos and dodging enemy attacks. Once you begin to feel a mastery for the combat, the game throws in an extra challenge of having to break color-coded enemy shields with specific skill moves.\n\nPlatforming is at its best in Gucamelee. Skills and jumps need to be chained together to reach heard to reach areas. Late game platforming becomes quite challenging when the dimension switching mechanic is introduced. I wont bother explaning it, but it really pushes you to time your movements perfectly.\n\nTo top it all off, the art style is colorful and refreshing accompanied by a comical storyline.

As with other games in this genre, you have some freedom to explore the world, with access to new areas controlled by gaining new abilities. Exploring this beautiful Mexican art inspired world is made easy with the game's great map system and fast travel points. Blocked areas that require specific abilities to enter are color coded and are marked on the map making them easy to go back to once you have the ability to break them.\n\nThe platforming sections are mostly challenging. You'll be combining precision jumping, special moves, roll/dodge, and switching worlds to reach distant platforms. The combat provides a good challenge as well, and as a luchador you will punch and grapple your way through different enemy types that you'll be facing in bunches. As you go deeper in the game, these enemies will have different types of shields requiring a certain type of move to break. Some will also exist in one world or the other and you must be in the correct world to attack them.\n\nIt took me around 8 hours to finish this in my first playthrough, but there's some replay value to it as you can play as other characters with different attributes. There are also some side quests, collectibles, and you can continue exploring the world after you've beaten the final boss.

Consisting of side-scrolling combat, jumping puzzles and boss fights, the gameplay strikes a balance, being challenging yet fair.\n\nProgressing through the game unlocks new abilities and areas. There are also new enemies and puzzles that provide opportunities to use these newly acquired skills, so the game becomes more complex and harder. Compensating for the difficulty, the game allows you to respawn from numerous checkpoints or whatever ledge you fell from. This prevents frequent deaths from breaking the gameâs flow, and allows the player to learn from failure and quickly adapt to overcome a hard part.\n\nI hate excessive dialogue in games, but fortunately Guacamelee! has just the right amount. It has enough to move the story along and even work in some comedy, but it doesnât overstay itâs welcome. This is necessary in a game where parts must be repeated until gotten right. Having to scroll through the same dialogue over and over again just to get to the point you failed at before is an annoyance from an obsolete era of gaming.\n\nGuacamelee! is not without its flaws. It can be a bit repetitive at times and get slightly boring, but itâs not enough to hinder the gameplay significantly, and the soundtrack and colorful animation inspired by traditional Mexican folklore give it a unique style that almost had me buying this game on looks alone.\n\nDigital Logik PC Gaming[dlgaming.net]","December 27, 2013","true","7.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Most of my experiences in this genre are games that require painstaking trial-and-error to figure all the moves and combos. Guacamelee was able to break that mold because the best part of the games for me wasn't the combat aspects, but actually the way the game trained me to use each skill along the journey through superior level design. And I thought this game was pretty hard, but mastering the moves became second nature because it forced me to use specific skills throughout each level, so by the time the final boss came around it was a piece of cake.\n\nBut it's not just the training that made the game fun. There's also the transition between the living and dead worlds which adds a very difficult twist to platforming and combat. Even though the fighting moves are pretty basic, it makes combos reasonably easy to pull off and thus doesn't frustrate. Plus it's always fun to throw enemies around, transform into a chicken and peck them to death, or goat fly across the screen through a horde.\n\nOne word describes Guacamelee--FUN.","May 19, 2014","true","10.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The platforming controls well, and has a lot more variety than one might except from a Metroidvania style game. Similarly, the combat system takes a more traditonal beat-em-up style and infuses it into the game, while it might not be comparable to some hardcore action games, it is a satisfying system overall, and I had lots of fun racking up high combos.\n\nIn traditional Metroidvania fashion, you'll find yourself gathering new abilities throughout the game and then using said abilities to progress through new areas. The game has a fair amount of optional secrets, which will motivate players to backtrack through previous areas to find powerups. Personally, I liked how the games combat system and abilities worked together. A majority of the abilities you get are multi-purposed, one use being how it helps you explore the enviroment and the other use being how it helps you in combat. For example, the uppercut ability allows you to break various red blocks throughout the enviroment, but it also adds a uppercut to your character's repertoire in combat. This means as you get more abilities, the variety in both combat and platforming increases. The system works near perfectly.\n\nMy main problem with Guacamelee is a minor one and it has to deal with the games sense of humor. To be frank, I found the games attempt to be awful. The games references to the Metroid series didn't come off as funny, but lazy. The game also has some weird obsession with some bottom of the barrel Reddit memes, they aren't funny or orginial. It's not a major complaint, but it's annoying to me that the humor has to resort to "lol me too references" and "xd reddit memes" considering the work that was clearly put into the games world design.","November 30, 2013","true","7.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The combat is fluid and satisfying, especially when you pull off high hit combos or get through a particularly hectic battle without a scratch on you. The addition of a dodge ability adds an extra level of skill to combat and allows for different styles of play. The artwork is gorgeous and does an excellent job setting the mood for the game. And tons of fun video game and pop-culture references are sprinkled throughout the enitre game.\n\nOne particular thing I love is the optional depth to the game. If you're the type of player that only wants to stick to the main path and beat the game as soon as possible, you are able to do so. But for those who feel they've mastered the mechanics and want a bigger challenge, a little exploring reveals there is so much more lying beneath the surface.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys platformers, particularly those in the Metroidvania vein.","January 30, 2014","true","22.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

It has beat'em up combat that rewards you for keeping enemies in the air with super long combos, and the controls are easy to use and the combat is lots of fun. The level design is reminiscent of the levels in Mark of the Ninja, with shortcuts and extra areas added that become usable when you unlock special powers.\n\nI found the game to be hilarious. It features liberal abuse of stereotypes and cliches of "Old Mexico", and lots references to video games (especially indie games, though obvious Mario and Metroid references feature prominently). You play as a regular dude, made into a powerful Luchadore with a mystical mask, and skeletons are invading the land of the living on DÃ­a de Muertos, and the plot basically becomes:\n\nEL PRESIDENTE'S DAUGHTER IS KIDNAPPED! ARE YOU A BAD ENOUGH DUDE TO SAVE EL PRESIDENTE'S DAUGHTER?\n\nThere's a bit more to it than that, I guess, with chicken transformations and a goat-man and stuff... but the details are unimportant.\n\nThe game has a very generous save/respawn system, restarting boss battles instantly upon player death, which is nice. It does make the platforming sections of the game trivially easy, since if you miss a single jump, you instantly respawn back onto the last platform you were standing on (and the jumps aren't even difficult). None of the game felt frustrating or too repetitive to me (the first beat'em up I can say that about; I gave up on Shank a few levels in, for example). That said, I only got the "bad" ending at the end of the game, and I heard that the extra levels required to get the "good" ending are rather challenging.\n\nIf you like Metroidvanias, you should play this one.

I love how the level design is setup for you to just have each area appear linear and small until you obtain new abilities, its just way way bigger and interconnected.

The combat system has a lot of depth and variety which is something that can be lacking in other games of the genre - allowing for dozens of combo combinations. The controls are very crisp and responsive - though, you will want to use a controller for the best experience.\n\nWhat I love is how the developers designed the wrestling moves multi-purposefully. You use the same wrestling moves in combat as you do for platforming and traversing the environment. It's extremely satisfying and intuitive. They also did a great job of steadily introducing new game mechanics (such as switching between the living and dead world, goat climb and goat fly). The great thing is - you learn these new mechanics via the level design as soon as you acquire them - never taking away control from the player and forcing a unnecessary cutscene. More developers need to design games this way.\n\nThere is minimal voice acting, but the story gave me a few chuckles with a few well placed memes and references (normally I don't like that in most games). The visuals of the game are quite unique and colorful - and it's wonderfully animated. The soundtrack is also stellar.\n\nGuacamelee also provides quite a challenge. The bosses are well designed and there is roughly 20 hours of value if you are a completionist/achievement hunter. Some of the challenge areas remind me of games like Super Meat Boy, requiring fast reflexes and good timing. You can bet you will be raging at some of them.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Guacamelee! as it's one of the most shining examples of it's genre. I'm looking forward to seeing what DrinkBox studios do next, as they clearly have some smart and capable game designers over there.\n\nAdios amigos!","January 31, 2014","true","21.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Is based on four concepts:\n\n- a Metroid-vania style of gameplay\n\n- a semi-complicated fighting system\n\n- luchadores portrayed in a cartoonish way\n\n- jokes based on modern internet popculture\n\nIt seems that there is pretty much nothing you could dislike. Indeed the first half of the game was very enjoyable for me. Some dialogs are written really clever, and the gameplay itself is enough to keep you playing.\n\nBut then it all falls in to pieces. The more powers you unlock the more difficult it is to play on a computer keyboard. Soon it becomes unplayable and confusing... and this is the part when someone tells me I should use a gamepad (like the authors told me on the beginning of the game). Well I tried... I have three gamepads and none of them worked... oooohhhh.... it needs an XBOX controller?\n\nSo now I should pay because the authors are xbox fanboys or because they sold their souls to MS? Not a chance.\n\nReleasing this game on a PC (an also Linux for god's sake!) is a mockery.\n\nThe keyboard and mouse are basic PC controllers , so a game released on WINDOWS/MAC/LINUX should be designed to work with them, or at least allow ANY gamepad to work with it on all operating systems it is available for (I use Linux all the time, and never once had a problem with any of my gamepads in a game that allowed them).\n\nThere is also something else, that happens after the first half of the game â all the creativity of the authors just vanish (and the jokes from the first half began to stop being funny in the context also):\n\nâErm... I don't know how to make this game actually, so... hmm... let's make it incredibly difficult, and fill it with irritating enemies, internet memes redrawn to look mexican and references to other games!â\n\nGive me a break...\n\nThis is unfortunately a trend in modern indie games .\n\nâDon't have an idea to make the gameplay interesting? Make it freakishly difficult.â\n\nâDon't have an interesting story? Make it a parody. A parody with a very difficult gameplay!â\n\nâWe don't know how to balance the gameplay? Let's give the player every ability we can think of! And make her/him use them simultaneously during a very difficult gameplay!â\n\nI bet at some point of the development, the creators of games like that think they are smart, and creative. Throwing every idea for a gameplay element in to the final product, redrawing jokes made by others and making obvious references to other games...\n\nP.S.\nOf course the level of difficulty is not only to be blamed on the controller. The game is literally unfair. Exactly like playing a badly designed NES game. UNFAIR. The projectiles thrown by enemies go right through every element of the environment, every enemy and stop only at the player. Every enemy attack is impossible to block and usually it has priority over your attack even if it is a combo, or a special move. Also, some actions work in some cases, and don't work in other (in which logic tells you, they should). The controls feel very awkward generaly, and most actions are hard to trigger.","March 4, 2014","false","9.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","6"

It should have been Mark of the Ninja type combat game if the description in store page is read correct, instead it tries to be a super meat boy with combat. I would give it a thumbs up if the devs wrote the truth in the store page. But it isn't what anybody will expect since the devs speaks nothing about frustrating brutal puzzle which deserves a definite thumbs down.\n\n\n\n\nOld review-All of the puzzles are designed for gamepad.

Knocking one enemy into another will force them off their feet (provided no shield), which often makes many fights trivial if you juggle the enemies into each other, giving you reasonably large intervals (for a 2D fighter), where no attacks are coming your way. An enemy who has been knocked down can be supplexed across the screen, essentially every enemy is a projectile used to knock down other enemies, combining this mechanic with juggling makes you feel like a true deity though the resulting gameplay presents little threat.\n\nUnlocking new skills throughout the course of the game is done in a Metroidvania-esque manner, though from memory none of the 'backtracking' (hub aside) is required to complete the game. The difficulty ramps up slowly over the game, enemies towards the end of the game usually require one or two specific skills to 'pop' a recharging shield before they can be hurt, in addition they are mure numerous + more damage. However this is largely an artificial increase in difficulty throughout the game, using the knock-back mechanic is less useful in these situations, forcing the Luchador to focus on one target at a time while breaking shields, and trying to combo those enemies into each other before the shield recharges, it makes you feel like much less of a badass chasing one of 8 foes around a screen instead of bringing pain to all 8 at the same time.\n\nAudio is pretty pleasing to listen to, while I'm personally out-of-touch with the genre/nationality vibe they where going for, it seems to fit the pacing of movement throughout the levels pretty well, I could probably listen to this music for a reasonably longer length of time due to the lack of this style in more media today.\n\nVisuals are pretty nice and colourful. Simple larger sprites make everything super-easy to tell friend-from foe, including yourself when things get a little hectic with more enemies. I think this refined/simple look suits the world of the Luchador quite well, bright colours + striking shapes rather than many complex details/patterns. Makes it really easy to pick out which enemies (or pieces of environment) need which skills to break them.\n\nThe only negative about this game, is that some of the side-challenges in an optional areas of the game require nigh on pixel-perfect execution of skill sequencing to pull off a combo/maintain hit-streak. In this regard the game feels very much like a Capcom fighter, finding the sweetspot so that you're skills will juggle the enemy correctly. This level of precision is needed nowhere else in the game so it feels more than a little superfluous. Granted Challenges in games are designed to present situations more complex/difficult than the main game (albeit in smaller packets), so probably not solid grounds to complain about.\n\nOverall this game is pretty baller. For fans of other 2D & 3D beat-em-ups It's pretty much a necessity on the list, it may not not cater to the more experienced 2D fighters in the same way it does to the general populus, as overall the game is fairly easy. Its unique setting definately warrants a look when compared with the dark/gritty beat-em-ups we see more often today.\n\n8/10","May 30, 2014","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/helldee/recommended/214770/","helldee","eldee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/helldee/","402 products in account","If cave story took the metroidvania style and added in shooter elements, and Steamworld Dig took it and added the minecraft/terraria thing, Guacamelee is the brawler take on the same genre. It has a fun story and style to spare. The art and animation in the game are incredible, it has a great sense of humor (plenty of tongue-in-cheek references to be had throughout) and the fighting/combo system is surprisingly deep. I absolutely love this game, and I say that upfront because I have to be harsh about a handful of things that hold the game back from perfection.\n\nAs good as the fighting system is in Guacamelee, it could have used some more love- specifically recovery time and cancels. If it sounds incredibly petty that I'm asking for such a 'deep' feature in what is essentially a beat'em up game, it really starts to make sense toward the end of the game when enemies start doing shields that you need to break with specific attacks.\n\nOften times, you'll break a shield and get knocked down by another enemy and before you can get back up the shield you took out has regenerated. It ends up making for a handful of really frustrating encounters, and one boss fight that is absolutely infuriating (javier jaguar). Your special moves take so much time to wind up that the situation can change while you're in mid-animation with no way to cancel it, so you have to watch in what feels like slow-mo while you get smashed in the face. This leads to a lot of situations where you die and feel completely cheated because you weren't in control of the character and could have avoided the attack if you could cancel.\n\nThis is exacerbated by the fact that pretty much every enemy attack in the game interrupts your special attacks. As I mentioned, you have to use these special moves to break shields, but in a room with multiple shield types, you can wind up your super long uncancellable special move to break a shield, only to get smacked in the back by another enemy (with a different shield). While your recovery animation is playing, the enemy's shield is regenerating. On the flip side of that, bosses are pretty much immune to special attack stuns and knockbacks, so the combos you've been practicing for so long are basically worthless in a boss fight. Specifically in the Javier Jaguar fight, you'll have to break his shield with a special, but he'll attack simultaneously- guess whose attack knocks back and whose doesn't? You will find yourself wanting to throw your controller through the wall during this fight because so much of it is beyond your control. It just seems intentionally punishing and doesn't reward the player for the skill they've developed over the course of the game.\n\nTo add to that, lots of end-game encounters have you fighting not only enemies that are shielded in a multitude of colors (which require completely different moves to break), but also enemies that are phased into the living/dead worlds. Here's another situation where it feels like the balancing is slightly broken or in need of adjustment. Enemies can hit you regardless of which dimension they're phased into, but you can't hit them. I would have preferred a system where opposite dimensions would give/take more or less damage than the dimension you're currently in, which would have made it more interesting and less frustrating.\n\nOverall, like I said- this is a fantastic game and totally worth the full asking price, but it does have some frustrating moments later in the game due to some issues with the finer fighting mechanics.","October 19, 2014","true","31.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Gold Edition is an action, adventure, 2D, indie platformer that has strong Spanish/Mexican themes. Not only that, but there are hilarious cross-game-references. The game play is fun, fast paced, and dynamic. I greatly enjoyed this game, and recommend it to anyone who enjoys indie adventure-type games.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You are Juan, you are trying to save el presidenteâs daughter (whom everyone tells you that youâve had a crush on since you were little. Everyone knows but me?) The villain Calaca has taken her and Juan must master his powers as a Lunchador to save not only el presidenteâs daughter, but to also save both the world of the living and the dead.\n\nGame Play: Guacamelee! Gold Edition starts out extremely basic with controls, but after 30 minutes into the game you will have unlocked several new abilities. Eventually I started to wonder âhow can there be more moves for me to unlock?â But sure enough there was consistently new abilities every new zone.\nThe puzzles grow more elaborate and complex the father you get through the game, it doesnât slow down and the game gets progressively more difficult as you unlock new abilities, and have new monsters thrown at you every new area.\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the game play, this game was always making me work harder to fight or platform, but the game did it in certain way that made me think âokay, this time Iâll make the jump for sureâ. There were some spots where I would spend hours trying to get past it, but those were extraâs and my own fault for wanting to get them.\n\nAchievements: Iâve played 16 hours of this game, most of those hours were spent either on challenges or trying to complete every area 100% I decided to do a majority of the achievements the old fashion way, I only had to look up one or two really difficult achievements (that were often times very simple; gotta love over thinking something.)\nA majority of the achievements will be unlocked on your first play through; the rest will need to be hard earned platforming with the abilities you unlock. Good news about that; even if you beat the last boss, you can continue from your original save. Instead of bracing yourself for a redo like I do for most games I play. You can beat Calaca and continue and go backwards to keep going with clearing the world. (or after beating the game, switch to hard mode, where you need to do it all again)\n\nPrice: Guacamelee! Gold Edition costs $14.99, since I played 16 hours (and still need to put in a few more to complete hard mode) that is easily over a dollar an hour. In my book that is a good quality game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/constablelemon/recommended/214770/","constablelemon","Timed Hits Knower","http://steamcommunity.com/id/constablelemon/","245 products in account","This game is a love song to Super Metroid played by a nerdy mariachi band.\n\nInstead of an arm cannon, you use your fists. Instead of a morph ball, you turn into a chicken. Instead of color-coded doors to be opened with the appropriate weapon, there are colored blocks to be smashed with your varied slam attacks. You even gain your powers by destroying precious Chozo statues (more on that later.)\n\nThe best part of this game, hands down, is the combat. The multitude of useful attacks at your disposal, combined with the responsive dodging mechanic and the fun and powerful grapples means that the combo system is both useful and rewarding. Battles in this game just resonate with me as being really fun, as you can bash some skeletons around, throw them into other skeletons, and just keep it going as the numbers on your screen go up and up and you get a bigger money reward when the fight is finished. It's just really fun, and the enemies are well designed to let you take advantage of combos and such if you're good.\n\nThe level design is nice, and they manage to keep the levels fresh with mixtures of new and old elements that let you make use of your powers. Backtracking when you have new powers, a staple of any "Metroidvania" game, is present in this game, but also quite simplified. Areas that are blocked off from you are marked in bright, unmistakeable colors on your map, and correspond to certain powerups. While this is unfortunate if you enjoy more subtle or clever ways to impede progress, there are a few secret areas scattered about that have very little indication on the map, meaning you have to be perceptive to find them. The art style and design of the levels are also overall pretty good, but while the backgrounds are vibrant and creative, the walls of the levels are all dark and square, making areas seem kind of cramped, and it's just not as visually entertaining as it could be.\n\nUnfortunately, there is a lot of untapped potential in Guacamelee. There were a few levels that were pretty barren as far as secrets and backtracking goes, which sort of made them simply linear puzzle dungeons. The last few hours of gameplay for me could have been a lot better if I had more reasons to revist older areas. Due to the linearity of how and when you get your abilities, most of the secret areas just contained health and stamina upgrades. I would have liked if there were optional powerups or attacks that I could find, or perhaps more villager sidequests that required you to visit other areas. There are only two towns in Guacamelee, and all of the "quests" are pretty much just completed inside those towns, when there's no reason not to use other areas for them.\n\nMy main gripe with this game is how shallow the world feels, and there is one big reason for this: instead of worldbuilding and lore, the game opted for silly references and jokes. I think that the developers got kind of lazy in this regard, because the world concept is a pretty cool one, and the art and character design is top notch. But even though the game was inviting me to care about the world inside through its visuals, it just completely falls flat whenever it wants to convey information about the world directly. The towns are littered with posters of famous luchadores and advertisements, and 100% of those are jokes or references to nerd stuff. They were cute and funny the first couple times I saw them, but then I realized that these areas that could have been vibrant with character were just a platform for showing me some mexican versions of memes.\n\nI mentioned that you gain your powers by smashing Chozo statues, and I mean really. There are Chozo statues laying around in the dungeons, like, actual Chozo statues from Metroid. And you smash them, and then the goatman cometh and yells at you for smashing his rare Chozo statue, and gives you a new power. Again, this was funny the first time, like, haha, we're trying to make a Metroid game guys! Haha! But really, that's a missed opportunity for something more creative or fitting for the game's world. You could still make a lazy Metroid reference, but instead of it being a Chozo make it a Luchadore or something. I hate saying this, but the over-reliance on jokes in this game smashes ~my immersion~. I know, I would roll my eyes if someone told me that, but it's true. It just ticks me off because the lazy world-building sours what would otherwise be a fantastic game.\n\nDespite all that, I really do love this game. It's a blast to play, and I had a good time exploring and taking on the secret challenges. The game can get pretty tough when it wants to, and those difficult areas are really satisfying to beat. The music is great, and the gameplay is superb. I would only write such a big effortpost review if I actually cared enough about the game, so at least there's that. I highly recommend you give Guacamelee! a try.","February 3, 2014","true","25.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

Tule Tree became a major problem for me and I couldn't get past it. I did a quick Google search and read the negative comments on Steam reviews and found out that it's not only my problem.\n\nAlso another thing to note is even though I used to be able to do every single combo in a Mortal Kombat game on PS2 and could get to some decent Fatality stages, the challenges that Giant Chicken (I don't remember its name) give became undoable after some point.\n\nMy Logitech F710 had some minor lag issues throughout the part I managed to complete, which I haven't experienced in any other games I played with that controller, but it wasn't that much of a problem except for hardcore platforming parts, such as in Tule Tree and the game had some problems reading the diagonal movement input.\n\nI can only recommend this if only you're deeply into hardcore platformers or you want to enjoy a somewhat different artistic setting for a low price (I think you might be able to purchase it for $1-1key on trading sites and on different retailers).

You absolutely must enjoy both of those things or this game WILL increasingly â¥â¥â¥â¥ you off as it goes on.\n\nFor me, I enjoy side-scrolling beat 'em ups and also enjoy platformers, but I am not the type of person who particularly enjoys intensely punishing difficulty in either one (maybe in a challenge mode, but not in the campaign). I picked up this game mainly because I had heard it had strong metroidvania elements, and I was very interested in exploring a mexi-metroid. The game started off super enjoyable and very much mexi-metroid, which I loved. But I started getting super frustrated at the game once I got to the Tule Tree, where the game first revealed its unwavering fetish for spamming dimension shift challenges in prolongued wall jumping segments. (If you think it will be over after the Tule Tree, you're wrong.)\n\nI stuck with it, though. It was infuriating, and I cursed a lot, but I stuck with it for a long time. I was disappointed that the metroidvania elements increasingly dwindle away and the game becomes more and more intensely focused on infuriating cage match challenges and infuriating platforming challenges where you have to execute a specific sequence of jump extenders (while dimension shifting ever other step, naturally), and the game just turns these up more, and more, and more as you advance. I kept feeling the frustration rise higher and higher as I progressed, but I kept on going.\n\nI made it all the way to Javier Jaguar. I'm now quitting forever, because seriously: F**K THAT. Talk about a sudden and maddeningly huge difficulty spike. (Especially considering that the previous boss battle, Flame Face, is incredibly easy.) There comes a point where one experiences furious anger more than joy with a game. Javier Jaguar is the deal breaker for me and Gaucamelee. But I won't say that makes it a bad game. It is a beautiful game that I think was just not made for me. I recommend it to those of you who enjoy a game that invites you into its house with promises of cake and candy, but instead just holds you down and punches you in the balls over and over again, laughing and shouting surprise, until you cry.","January 3, 2015","true","7.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I immensely enjoyed it. The game's graphics are just perfect with tons of detail and color. The gameplay is great, too.You'll unlock moves by buying them or by completing parts of the story. These new powers will help you find secrets in previously played parts and open up new parts of the story.\n\nThere are a couple of sidequests, but they can be finished rather quickly. One or two of them are fairly lengthy, however, all things considered.\n\nGuacamelee is not a long game, I think I completed it in 8 hours or so, so I hope that a possible sequel will be longer. It's just so much fun.  Drinkbox's previous game was also kinda short. A real shame, because their games are great and feature the same kind of graphical styles.\n\nBut the game's not perfect. Battle arenas can become frustrating because they're limited in space and a few of them are timer dependent. The arenas do help you practice for bossfights though; those can get pretty hectic and intense.\n\nThis game was released on the same day as Papers Please and Spelunky and if I had to pick one of these games Guacamelee would be my first choice. Papers Please would definitely grab the second place.\n\nFor those guys that think: 'TL:DR'; let me say this with my best Star Wars voice: Guacamelee is the game you're looking for.\n\n[Rating: 88/100]","August 23, 2013","true","8.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

A few funny references here and there, but not over-the-top too many.\n\nYou can unlock different costumes in-game that best suit your favorite style of play. My favorite is the chicken suit; in the middle of a tough fight I can hide away and regenerate some health.  The Skeleton suit lets you do endless supermoves. Another suit makes your slams really strong. And so on.  When you get into some of the really hairy fights you'll almost wish the slamjam song were playing.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, beat-em-up with strategy involved, but also platforming.  In fact once you get about halfway through the game some of the jumps and platforming tricks you have to do are a little frustratingly difficult.  With a little practice and patience (you get as many fall-off-the-screen deaths as you want), you can make it through.  Except maybe a couple of the secret items... getting them (tula tree and sierra, I'm looking at you!) are fairly insane no matter how much you've practiced.\n\nDon't speed-run, at least not the first time. Take your time and enjoy the game.  The boss fights each have their own flavor and they each seem fairly impossible at first, but then you clue in on the boss's strategy after a couple tries... almost reminds me (not really) of the old NES game Punch-Out... the bosses are HARD at first but they telegraph most of their moves and once you learn to read the tells and react... presto.\n\nAnd oh. Make sure you have a controller for this one.  You *can* play with the keyboard... but don't do it.\n\nThe only con I can think of, is that if you're a completionist, you might throw your laptop across the room (then kick it a few times for good measure) at the Tula Tree...  that and you can't decide to marry X'tabay.

This game grabed me in its' steely luchador grasp and didn't let go until it had played out its story in full glory. The tight control scheme is the ground work for this awesome action side scrolling title. The easy-to-pull-off combos and simplicity of linking them together makes this games fight sequences not only enjoyable to play, but also to watch. The controls don't only extend to the fighting, the platforming is also top notch. Coming from a platforming background, I was pleasantly surprised with the difficulty in some of the optional areas. It definietly put my skills to the test, but fear not, the controls are such that any mistake is on the player and it's pretty obvious when you make an error.

Stylish, fast paced, tight controls, difficulty, appealing characters, a good sense of humor, and a great sountrack are only some of what this game brings to the table, which is a lot. This game grabed me in its' steely luchador grasp and didn't let go until it had played out its story in full glory. The tight control scheme is the ground work for this awesome action side scrolling title. The easy-to-pull-off combos and simplicity of linking them together makes this games fight sequences not only enjoyable to play, but also to watch. The controls don't only extend to the fighting, the platforming is also top notch. Coming from a platforming background, I was pleasantly surprised with the difficulty in some of the optional areas. It definietly put my skills to the test, but fear not, the controls are such that any mistake is on the player and it's pretty obvious when you make an error. From the comical characters and their interactions, to the endgame battles and platforming, the only thing this game doesn't nail, is it's name. Other than that, do yourself a favor and buy this game. You won't be disapointed!!!","July 6, 2014","true","15.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A few funny references here and there, but not over-the-top too many.\n\nYou can unlock different costumes in-game that best suit your favorite style of play. My favorite is the chicken suit; in the middle of a tough fight I can hide away and regenerate some health.  The Skeleton suit lets you do endless supermoves. Another suit makes your slams really strong. And so on.  When you get into some of the really hairy fights you'll almost wish the slamjam song were playing.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, beat-em-up with strategy involved, but also platforming.  In fact once you get about halfway through the game some of the jumps and platforming tricks you have to do are a little frustratingly difficult.  With a little practice and patience (you get as many fall-off-the-screen deaths as you want), you can make it through.  Except maybe a couple of the secret items... getting them (tula tree and sierra, I'm looking at you!) are fairly insane no matter how much you've practiced.\n\nDon't speed-run, at least not the first time. Take your time and enjoy the game.  The boss fights each have their own flavor and they each seem fairly impossible at first, but then you clue in on the boss's strategy after a couple tries... almost reminds me (not really) of the old NES game Punch-Out... the bosses are HARD at first but they telegraph most of their moves and once you learn to read the tells and react... presto.\n\nAnd oh. Make sure you have a controller for this one.  You *can* play with the keyboard... but don't do it.\n\nThe only con I can think of, is that if you're a completionist, you might throw your laptop across the room (then kick it a few times for good measure) at the Tula Tree...  that and you can't decide to marry X'tabay.

Though the strong point in this game is the combat. But as I always do, I'll start off with the story.\n\nStoryline:\nIt's alright and other than that there's nothing else to say about it. It's not special, but not bad. And that's all what I can say about the story.\n\nCharacters:\nThey 'aight. There's also is a goat/guy who I would be alright with if he was my dad......but then I would be Daniel Bryan.......Nevermind then.\n\nPlatforming:\nIt's hard and it challenges you how to beat it. It could be simple as jumping to small floating platforms to changing dimensions and dashing herpderping, rooster uppercutting, double jumping, goat climbing, goat flying, turning into a chicken, jumping, and then landing on the checkpoint. Hard, rewarding, and good at the same time.\nGG, Drinkbox Studios, GG.\n\nWham! Bam! And Slam! Combat:\n(They dont actually call the call the combat "Wham! Bam! And Slam! Combat", but I just thought of it and had to put it in)\nAnyways, the combat is just awesome. Grabbing my enemies and piledrivering them to rocks was more fun than I imagined. And booting them off a cliff to their deaths. You just have to see how good the combat is. Fun and hard enough that's it's not a breeze.\n\nAbilties:\nFun to do and usefull in combat. Goat flying into a skeleton's skull has never been more satisfying.\n\nEaster Eggs:\nThis game has alot of them. If you want to see some just go into my Guacamelee! screenshots and see them, but if you're thinking of getting this game. Dont spoil all of them for yourself. I loved each and every references this game had in it.\n\nEnding statements:\nThis game is fun, hard, challenging, rewarding, and good game to play through in your spare time. So If you're looking for a small game where you're a luchador in a 2D world that can bashing skeleton's head in a f#cking wall. Then this is your game, senoir.\n\n6.8/10\n*Mexican Gaben voice*\nGracias! y divertirse!","May 2, 2014","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls are very fluid,the graphis are easy on the eyes, the combat is fun and the adventuring keeps you wanting to play.Game runs very smoothly at all sections in it and the music keeps up with the pace of the game.The story is not great but not bad, is something kids might find more entertaining than adults,but better than nothing at all.\n\nThe combat in the game works like a beatem up where you can do combo's and after unlocking, use various skills which become part of your arsenal to take down mobs.There are boss fights which are a lot of fun and entertaining and though out quite well. Outside of the combat moves you can unlock there are different outfits which give different stats when you wear them.The adventuring is fun because all of the locations are unique to one another including the other dimension versions of each.Great care was done to the enivornments and locations to make them not reptitive in looks ,feel and play styles.\n\nThe only thing and I mean the only thing about this game they I cannot stand are the very few , and I mean very few puzzle-platform areas that will keep you doing them over and over again. I encountered three areas in the game that thanks to my patience I manged to do but two of the area's took me 30-45min to do soley because of constantly messing up. The third area is an area in which the puzzle is a long vertical jump,run,jump,climb,etc portion.After trying my hand at it for literally 5 hours of total gameplay time I decided I had enough with the game and uninstalled it.\n\nAside from the three area's I ran into I loved the game, but I will say this as a warning about those areas.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIf you want to play a very actiony beatem up, platform puzzle game,can deal with a few sections you will have to try and try again to do, you will enjoy the game. I got about 2/3 the way finished before I had enough of the 3rd puzzle are that had me at bay and uninstalled. Enjoy my time with the game and it was lots of fun. You will have a blast.\n\n","February 15, 2014","true","17.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The art direction is very unique and melds in well with the game's theme, the story--while basic--is pretty entertaining, and the combat is top notch for a Metroidvania title.  Then you get to the /rest/ of the 'Metroidvania' elements and, honestly, I feel as if things like the enemy AI (brain dead to defeat, adding an additional layer of tedious shielding like the color system) and LEvel Design are pretty damn basic.  Nothing /wow/ to write about.  Then again the boss battles are pretty fun!\n\nX'Tabay is a cutie.  So, buy this game!

I intended to test it out when I installed but ended up playing for 3 straight hours.\n\nYou'll play as Juan who dons the mask of legacy and becomes the Luchador. The game is filled with Mexican culture with modern internet-isms (memes as well) masked throughout. Don't let that push you away however, seeing iconic internet..uhh things in the game actually provide a bit of subjective art as I felt more connected as if the developers are one of us who are playing.\n\nThe controls are extremely fluid, with the ability to cancel out of any action with an air or ground dodge and the combat has just as much flow. You do a regular melee attack that can combo up to 3 hits with cardinal directional moves depending on if you are in the air or ground. Add another button dedicated to Special moves also with 4 directions of variety and you got a simplistic yet intricate combat system. Oh you can also toss opponents across the arena and into other skeletal hombres.\n\nThe exploration aspect is top notch with nook and crannys begging to be searched. You'll find places you can't reach due to some obstruction and be rewarded if you remember later down the road. At one point in the game, you'll have the power to switch from the light world to the dead world with platforming and combat creatively incoporated. While some secrets are obvious, you'll need to put on your master explorer hat to find everything Gucamelee! has to offer. The difficulty is just right, with the enemies requiring more finesse and the platforming demanding 2 or 3 actions in short time. For the daring, to 100% the game, Guacamelee! demands you to channel your inner Super Meat Boy and do some sadistc platforming challenges.\n\nThe soundtrack is fantastic with each area giving you a different Mexcian vibe. I always enjoyed hearing all of the pieces each and everytime I entered an area.\n\nYou can even have local 2 player coop!\n\nThere is a ton to say about Guacamelee! but I think you should save it for yourself. I personally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys beat-em ups/platformers/and exploration adventures (Castle Crashers, Metroid, Castlevaina, Super Meat Boy)\n\nTo fully complete the game (100% completion including Steam Achievements) I clocked in at about 10 hours.\n\nGuacamelee!","February 3, 2014","true","19.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I was really amazed at the combinations I could pull off toward the endgame.\n\nI do have one complaint, which falls under performance and controls. Originally it felt like the game moved super fast, and I was having trouble pulling off basic combos and fighting some of the early enemies. One sequence in particular, where you must run in sidescroller fashion from a destructing environment, felt like it was moving way too fast. I was only able to pass it after about 20 attempts. Later I learned that there can be a bug with the vsync that basically doubles the speed of the game. Turning off vsynce solves the problem, however it will lead to some graphical glitches along the way. I found it a small price to pay for a playable game. After playing about the first quarter of the game at double speed, later platforming sections felt pretty easy in comparison.\n\nBeyond my one small complaint above, I was enamored by everything else in Guacamelee. It was fun to explore, fun to see what was next, fun to fight the enemies, and just plain fun overall. I would welcome a sequel, since it feels like there are so many places for this series to go. I see that a rerelease just came out with some new levels, and while I would prefer an entirely new game, eventually I may give that a shot as well.\n\nI completely recommend Guacamelee. While it has received heavy praise so it wasn't a complete surprise, it really exceeded my expectations.

I don't think I've ever had this much fun with a game before. It benefits from a solid, distinct soundtrack, and a pleasing visual art style. This one's for the subscribers of the arts.\n\nWhen it comes down to the game itself, story is solid, perhaps short, maybe a little spent, but every now and again, a classic hero story is all we need. It's paced accordingly, and catches the eye, and at times, the heart. *sniff*\n\nCombat mechanics are reminiscent of a super watered-down Street Fighter. It's simple, and with practice can become devastating and fast. The upgrades are simple and to the point, just like the rest of the game.\n\nAll in all, this is a splendid use of money, as far as games go. It provides hours of fun if you're willing to deal with it, and some serious, but rewarding, challenges. Prepare to curse, though.\n\nNOW GO AND BE GOLDEN.\n","June 28, 2014","true","16.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Boy, was I wrong.\n\nThis is truly a little gem. I got it from a humble bundle and decided to try it out just for the hell of it. Ten minutes later, I was hooked. The game plays extremely well, and it's just a LOT of fun. Combat is very satisfying, controls are responsive, artwork is lovely and full of references and humor that'll constantly put a smile on your face.\n\nI started playing with my girlfriend, an aspiring gamer, and Guacamelee proved an immersive, delightful, and easy enough experience (the simple parts at least) that she REALLY enjoyed, and so did I. Even when the game got quite tricky - which it does - and she couldn't help, she stood there, rooting for Juan. Truth be told, we actually ended up going to a mexican restaurant after a playing session, that's how much addicted we were (and still are!) to the whole setting, almost immediately after starting the game.\n\nI also don't think I've ever felt interested enough in getting all the achievements before Guacamelee. They are not too many, and are quite feasible, which I find a very smart strategy: it makes me want to come back again and again after having finished it, instead of putting me off because of the sheer impossibility of completion.\n\nThis is one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had.","March 8, 2014","true","22.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do not miss this game if you like metroidvania style games at all. The soundtrack is also top-notch mariachi-electro fusion thing and I definitely recommend getting the soundtrack bundle.\n\nIn short, Guacamelee is exploration-oriented sidescrolling 2d action game with most gameplay mechanics lifted straight from Super Metroid and refitted with a magical Mexican luchador theme. Suits are wrestling suits and masks, weapons are wrestling moves etc. Even color-coded doors are here and they have to be opened with specific moves. Gamepad is almost mandatory, since you have to be able to control your character quickly and combo all sorts of moves in order to get through some later challenges. The game also features local co-op, where player 2 can just drop in and drop out whenever. I haven't tried it myself, but it should be at least a fun diversion and maybe provide some help in the trickier boss fights.\n\nThe game isn't flawless though. The difficulty curve is a bit uneven and especially two of the boss fights provide some nasty difficulty spikes. The fights are far from impossible, but they do require some very good reflexes and good control of all the moves in the player's disposal. Also the game world feels slightly small. Everything is designed quite tightly and there is not too much backtracking, but it feels like there should have been something more. Still, if you feel like 100% the game, the first playthrough should take somewhere in the vicinity of 10-12 hours, so it isn't too short at any rate.\n\nDefinitely get this game if you want a good metroidvania and/or love luchadors.","January 11, 2014","true","28.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With tight controls (I played through it with a keyboard and a controller, with the latter being superior), a nice to look at angular art style and intuitive fighting mechanics this game earned it's place as one of the best Metroidvania games out there.\nGuacamelee has Steam workshop support where everyone with experience in Flash can upload their own costumes for the heroes Juan and Tostada.\nThe only negative aspects I could find were the lackluster story and only one save file. Many gamers fell afoul to the difficulty of the game, and although there are definitely parts considerably harder than others - most of them optional - Drinkbox aimed to appeal to the hardcore gamers.\n\nAfter getting 100% completion and all achievements you can still perfect your game time/speedrun to earn your place in the leaderboards. For players concerned with replayability, there is lots to do.\nYou're still reading?

Likely,\n\nGuacamelee is a pretty competent metroidvania with a focus brawling "luchador combat" and some moderate platforming. String combos together, weaken enemies and grapple them to throw into other enemies or perform various slams that can be purchased from money gained from killing and finding chests. It's fairly simple and the towns are filled (almost too much) with various video game and internet Meme references - though, it's one of the first times where I've been able to recognize practically every reference in the game since it's not a bunch of obscure book and movie references like the Fallout series. You gain new moves from busting Chozo statues, giving you basically color coded power ups, which makes the game on the surface feel a bit simple, even absurdly so (why can't my Super punch break the same things my head butt can...because of it's color effect?!). Though, it makes for interesting combat sense some enemies have shields that can only be broken by certain attacks (but still is sort of silly). While the game is fairly easy, since arenas are fairly short and enemies don't have a ton a health, but in the later parts of the game, it's a often a wonder on how I can avoid damage with multiple projectiles and assailants at times - the controls are mostly competent to keep you alive, but I sometimes wish there was a block and switching directions wasn't "Mario Slidey". Bosses fight in typical "learnable patterns" but you might die a couple times in the process trying to figure out when the game expects you to jump, dodge, or know how an enemy is telegraphing attacks. Bosses don't take too long to kill or have super crazy attacks like similar games. Platforming puzzles are scattered here and there, which offers a bit of challenge and sometimes frustration. They often reward you with health/stamina upgrades or cash used to buy more slams or health/stamina benefits.\n\nI finished the game around 5 hours, and I think I got the bad ending. I'm not quite sure what would cause a better ending, except for doing it faster (and I may have missed a town quest or two now that I think about it). I've seen leaderboard speed runs around an hour. If you care to, you can replay on a harder difficulty. If you like to play all the content of the game, $15 is a fair price, if you're like me and just want to get to the end and get the gist of the game, you may want to wait for a sale.","January 5, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Reminds me somewhat of Outland, with the switching between light and dark worlds, but Guacamelee has less of the bullet hell and more of the titular melee action. I'm not a huge fan of backtracking, but the world is laid out so smartly that even as it expands, your accumulating powers allow you to traverse the world more and more rapidly. Combat is challenging, but fair. Cetain fight setups felt cheap and unfair on first attempt, but after some careful observation and thought (and a few deaths), they were actually quite reasonable. Checkpoints are relatively generous, and placed in all the spots you'd want them. The boss fight thankfully actually uses the same skills honed during the rest of the game, rather than throwing in something out of left field. All in all, a total pleasure.","December 19, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I wasn't quite sure why.\n\nI recently retried, because this is a good game and I didn't understand why I disliked it. I did figure out why, though, as I got to a certain mechanic that turned every platforming incident into a timing and reaction dependent stress-fest with massive consequences for failure.\n\nDidn't help that the fighting gets progressively sloppier as you get more combos. I happen to not like combos. Also for some reason, the grappling speeds up as you progress. This makes it harder to do the grappling combos, even though they're simple as hell.\n\nUltimately, I didn't like the combo based fighting and the platforming turned into an unduly frustrating experience. I think it's actually a good game, still, but I don't like it and I won't recommend it as such.

I though this was a great and awesome game. And it is for some things, but not for many other.\nThe story is pretty weak and not much worked on: the princess has been kidnapped, you gotta save her and beat the crap out of 4 bosses.\n\nThe art style as the location is very sweet, probably the best thing of the game. Great animation, and good looking characters.\n\nThe only thing that this game miss a lot is a personality: there are many, LOTS of game references from 80s-90s, some gameplay sistems are just fully recicled from those kind of games, and some of those are almost stolen with the excuse of "easter egg" (http://nerdreactor.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/guacamelee-metroid-chozo-statue.jpg).\n\nThe humor is pathetic, there aren't many good jokes, maybe you're gonna love it if you're a 9gag kid or something. It has lot of memes, that's all I have to say about it.\n\nThe controls are pretty good, and the map design it's great, but still, with those gameplay elements, there isn't much difference between a level and another one.\n\nThe boss battles are just ridiculus, most of them are â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ kid level, and the last one it's a ripoff of many other games battle. Also, that last battle is total bullcrap, cause the level designer just went "screw this" and probably made that in about 5 minutes.\nThere aint no plot twist, you can see everything coming. After I've finished the game, I just didn't care about the characters or what it was gonna happen.\n\nFinal Score: 5/10\nGames like these needs to stop living into the past. You wanna make a game that has the same feel of a SNES game? Fine. But at least add something new to it, don't give me the same crap with a different color.\n\nBut wait, there's more! If you complete the game normally, you'll get the sad and boo-hoo final; if you wanna see some happy engings, get your â¥â¥â¥ back into the game, find every collectable, and then beat the final boss again! Like a big â¥â¥â¥â¥ you into my face! Wow, and I though this game couldn't get any better!","May 28, 2014","false","8.8"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It's got a great musical score, great artistic style, humor, interesting and seldom-seen-in-a-video-game Mexican-theme. And I've always loved Metroid style games.\n\n** BUT **\n\nThe platforming sections of the game are ridiculously difficult. Needlessly difficult, I'd add. I'm still stuck on the section in the Tuli Tree, where you must do a series of wall jumps combined with flipping in and out of the land of death. I cannot do it. And I'm no stranger to platformers!\n\nI wouldn't have a problem with this kind of difficulty if it were only used sparingly in areas of the map with hidden power ups or bonus content. But to make just getting to the next dungeon/temple/castle/level this ludicrously challenging is too much to ask! I play games to be entertained; if the gameplay turns into a repetitive series of failures that's no fun at all!\n\nPart of the problem is that the controller layout isn't ideal. A few glaring control issues: One, Right-Trigger to switch between light and dark worlds!? Bad button mapping! Also, when playing two players, we often accidentally enter the bubble mode, which is disaterous if we both do it at once! And the button placement for "chicken mode" isn't so good either. Rather than doding (left trigger) I sometimes bump the left button for Chicken mode. And on top of all that, there's no way to re-map the buttons.\n\nSo, DEV...  before I could recommend this game to anyone, PLEASE fix the level designs and button mapping!\n\n\nEDIT: I changed my mind on this one. I gave it rest for a while then came back to it. As I had previously said, it IS insanely hard! But I did finally manage to make more progress. I'm now all the way to boss fight with Calaca! It's definitely a good game, although, I still wish they had made a easy mode!","December 16, 2013","true","17.4"," 29 of 56 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","29","56","0","0"

Generally speaking it's loads of fun and it looks absolutely gorgeous because the aesthetic is drenched in mexican culture, primarily the Dios de las Muertos. The only downsides are it basically requires you to have a controller as some of the later fights are damn  near impossible with keyboard controls alone. There are also some extremely demanding platforming/jump timing sections in order to get life/stamina expansions that are possible to get early on but are so incredibly difficult to do so that you'll likely end up saying "Screw it, I'll come back later" and when you do with later upgrades you'll find them to be incredibly easy. Overall one of the best metroidvania games on steam and unquestionably one of the most stylish. If you have a controller to use with your PC then I can't recommend this enough, if not you may want to give this a pass. 8/10","November 12, 2013","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Those two, along with its grappling-and-throwing-based combat system, consistently keep encounters interesting.\n\nThe visual style and the music are very memorable as well, and some of the antagonists are actually good characters in their own right.\n\nNow, if only the developers hadn't gone overboard with the meme references...","August 10, 2013","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've never been into platforming, but after completing this game, I've found out that I really like the platforming genre which means I'm going to end up buying more games like this in the future. Anyways, over to the review. Guacamelee is and has everything that all platformers should be/have. Drinkbox Studios have been able to mix the platforming itself, exploration and combat along with each other perfectly. A reason alone to buy this game if you're into platforming is all the funny and immature comments all the different npcs, placed in the world has to say. Besides, who doesn't want to run 'round in Mexico as the great Luchador, beating up silly enemies while listening to mariachi backgroundmusic.

The game has an opened combat system and encourages exploration, so I feel once I've finished I won't mind playing again and again on ocassion.

The fighting mechanics are easy to pick up right a way, but still deep enough to remain interesting. You'll need to use your special attacks to traverse the environment and the game merges combat and platforming very well. This combined with a dimension-switching mechanic makes for one hell of a platformer! The humour in the game was also spot on for me. With references to other games, movies and various internet memes scattered all over place.\n\nI strongly recommend this game!","December 27, 2013","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's my first review.\n\nGuacamelee feels like a mix-tape of "best-of" 2d side scrollers. It's one part hardcore platformer, one part open metroidvania, and one part action game. The parts make greater whole, which a fantastic game. Levels are interesting. The jumps are great. And the combat is emmaculate and meaty. One of the best combat engine to be found in a 2d game.\n\nThe music and visuals are most definatley a highlight. While most video-games go for a try-hard "epic" score or bad butt rock, Guacamelee draws on a unique source of inspiration (traditonal Mexican music) and fuses it with a very classic video game sound for a soundtrack unlike anything else. The Mexican inspiration  also carries over the visuals. The results is very aesthetically excellecent complient to the some great mechanics.\n\nThe humor and reference are hit-or-miss. The video games tend to be charming as hell, while the meme ones are cringe-worth, in my opinion.\n\nWith that said, Guacamelee is excellent game in nearly all regards. It the type of game that's not afraid to have some fun. If you like 2-d action games at all, buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlapTurtle/recommended/214770/","SlapTurtle","SlapTurtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlapTurtle/","269 products in account","Intro:TLDR: Gameplay: Outstanding!  -  Visuals: Stunningly beautiful artstyle -  Story: Fitting  -  Coop: Double the fun, though making the game easier at some points.  -  9/10\n\nAmazing 2D sidescroller with a very broad combat system! Boss-battles, mini-bosses, loads of different enemies, platforming, jump-puzzles with various difficulties, and a great storyline. A Masterpeice! If you like a challanging platformer/combat-sidescroller; this is it for you.\n\nOriginally got this game through a HumbleBundle and wasen't expecting much from it. Boy was I in for a surprise!\n\nPros and Cons:++ Pros:\n+ Local coop\n+ Responsive controls\n+ Full controller support\n+ Combat with a lot of variations\n+ Customizations\n+ Fun and fine story\n+ Side-material (and loads of it)\n+ Immersive world\n+ Artstyle\n\n- - Cons:\n- Fairly short actual story\n- Coop restricted to local\n\nDetails:The games features a coop mode, but this is however only on a local pc. The coop mode is essentialy adding another character to the game with next to none extra interactions. This is however a neat feature for the game, and is very fun. doubles the people, double the fun, right!? right indeed.\n\nThe combat and movement system is extremely good, you control every action, and your charactor is a super responsive slave to your controller of choice. It features full controller support, which I personally find great for this kind of game. Great use of combo variation and at some points it is even a necesity to win a duel or complete a challange.\n\nWether you jump your way thorugh spikes, traps and platforms, or (Guaca)melee your way through hazzards of enemies, It's allways a very good mixtures of the two main gameplay mechanics. The game has a lot of mechnics, which are all very well explained, and it forces you to utilizes almost everyone of them. You can't just stomp thorugh the game using one move, or one combat technique. Variation is key to defeat certain enemies.\n\nOne word *Sidematerial*!!! Side-quests (so to speak), challange modes, collectiables, unlockables. Guacamelee has pretty much all of it. It also featues a some custimization to suit your playstyle as well. Some of the challanges may be difficult and frustratin! I must admit I at one point spent 1Â½ hours completing a single jump-puzzle... I suck... damn my stubborness. And yet other parts may be a peice of cake.\n\nThe overall game is an eye-pleaser. The artline is amazing, especially considering it being a "just" a 2D sidescroller. You can really feel the mood of the game, being pumped up with references to other games, memes and various sidestories. It's all in the detail of the tiny thing. And there is a lot of tiny things in this game. Makes for an overall better experience. It is very rewarding to go around exploring the world of guacamelee, trust me on this one!\n\nThe story is pretty straight-forward, humorous, filled with some unique characters. This is however not the bearing factor, as it falls a bit short compared to the standard of the other parts of the game. Only problem is that you can rush through the main storyline in a matter of a few hours, which leaves you storywise a bit dissatisfied. The loads of extra content largely outweights this problem though.\n\nFinal verdict:One of the best sidescrolles i've ever played. Rewarding to play.\n"Me Gusta". I rate this game 9/10.","November 5, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not very long by this genre's standards, but it's still a good 9-10 hours if you want to do everything. I'd give it a solid 8/10, but something bugs me.\n\nHard mode is complete and utter trash. I don't usually complain about hard difficulties, hell, I love hard difficulties, but this game wanted to be special. You want a hard mode that smooths out the game's uneven difficulty? â¥â¥â¥â¥ you! Instead, you get a game with even worse difficulty jumps, horribly unbalanced enemy combinations, and a game that, honestly, isn't very entertaining on a second playthrough.\n\nBut hey, if that's your thing, go right ahead hombre.

Then you'll love Guacamelee! This Mexican themed action platformer is set in in the colourful world of luchadores and the not-so-colourful world of the dead (which is still nice to look at anyway). The fighting is fast paced with plenty of moves and enemies to mix it up. There are also puzzle solving elements, where the player (that's you!) has to utilise the new techniques you have learned and quick reactions to solve them all. The music is also beautifully well suited, as are all the sound effects.\n\nThe game can be a bit challenging at times when you're facing multiple enemies in different dimensions, but by no means is it impossible. There is a hard mode available after completion of the game if you found the first run through too easy.\n\nThe game however, is quite short unfortunately. I finished it in 5:15, though that was with completing most all of the puzzles along the way (which probably made it easier for me anyway). That said, there are a number of side quests that I did not complete, and with multiple costumes also available, combined with the hard mode, there is some replayability in this game.\n\nAnother feature, though I have not tried it out, is co-op mode. Could be fun, but not necessary anyway.\n\nThe story isn't too bad - typical save the princess stuff with a Mexican and underworld theme mixed into it. The dialogue can be funny at times, but I think the only decent material was when references to other games were made. I feel like the developers tried too hard with this, and perhaps should have been more subtle most of the time - to me it seems they relied upon it too much.\n\nGuacamelee is fun, beautiful to look at, and engrossing, which is why I recommend it, but considering it's length, I would wait for a sale so as to get more bang for your buck.","December 29, 2013","true","6.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This gives Guacamelee a certain sense of lightheartedness, despite getting quite difficult at times.\n\nAfter the main storyline, there's still more to do; a hard mode that makes the combat a bit more challenging, and optional challenge rooms in the Infierno, which will put your platforming, creativity and reaction skills to the test.\nDefinitely my game of the year.","September 22, 2013","true","26.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it is a bit too short story wise, it has a lot of secrets to discover, and the well designed levels are an encouragement to explore. If you want to get 100% with a good ending, get ready to suffer as some of the challenges, platform puzzles in particular, are ridiculously unforgiving.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/recommended/214770/","Laisaniah","Fruitbowl M.D.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/","154 products in account","You probably have a good idea of what Guacamelee is by now. A Metroidvania with a Mexican Wrestler/Luchador theme, where the stamina-draining moves you learn are what unlock new areas. This is mainly done through colored blocks that require a specific skill in order to be broken. And that's the extent of the Metroidvania.\nIt's simple enough and proves to be a lot of fun in the largest portion of the game.\n\nHowever, several things in the end come together to create a frustrating experience unless you're the sort of player who's perfectly accustomed to every trick in the brawler book. And in fact, die-hard brawler fans are the only people I would really recommend this game to, at least to completion.\n\nIn the near-end game, you run into enemies and a few bosses that like to 'shield' themselves. A bubble fitting their shape that can only be broken by a specific stamina attack, which uses the same color coding as the aforementioned blocks. This actually starts out as a great idea as it throws around the way you think and need to approach a combat situation.\nBut therein lies the first problem: The 'yellow' attack, being headbutt, requires you to stand still and press the B button (on the controller).\n\nHowever, it takes about half a second before the game apparently registers you standing still, meaning you're spamming B while nothing happens but you standing there.\nObviously, in a high pace brawler, this means you are immediately punished for it by being attacked.\nThis headbutt lag only becomes more frustrating when you are going up against bosses that constantly change their type of shield. So whenever headbutt is required, you can count on it that you are going to get punished for it. It requires a compensation the likes where you feel like you are compensating for a bug.\n\nAnother technique that you must master in order to progress is the art of blocking. In the beginning, that's only required to jump through thorn vines. But eventually you will run into situations where the amount of melee and ranged enemies make it short of change of perspective to make it a bullet hell. Blocking is essential, period.\nAnd this is where another problem sets in. As someone trained by 'Witch time' in Bayonetta, I expect my blocking in a brawler to be instant. Many are the times where I had blocked a moment before being hit, yet it did not register. Frustrating.\n\nBut the biggest issue are the 'gauntlets' you are forced to partake in. These are single rooms where you are shut in and are forced to beat all the enemies that spawn. Most of the time these are pretty fun, if not challenging. But every now and then you find a gauntlet that simply does not belong in the game. In one, you were forced to constantly pop the appearing timed 'balloons' because otherwise, upon exploding, you receive significant damage. In the middle is an obstruction that has a hazard on top. And the balloons constantly appear on opposite sides of the room, AND you have to deal with other spawning enemies. Meaning you not only have to run like mad at each timed balloon, but you need to dodge any other ranged attacks and then survive the other enemies.\n\nOne other that I vividly remember is being forced to fight enemies that like to throw columns of light at you, and for some reason their AI likes to constantly throw these in sync where the distance between both columns is too great to overcome with one dodge/block, meaning you get hit regardless. But the biggest sinner is the gauntlet is the one where you have to kill a series of instakill exploding balloons with the moves they're obviously lined up for. But this brings another shortcoming: The special moves have a deceptively shorter range than they appear to have.\n\nBut my biggest gripe with these gauntlets is that they are non-optional. You have to do them, no matter how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t they are. There's no going around them, meaning you have to suffer their punishment for as long as it takes for you to master whatever (usually pointless) lesson it wants to impart. Because I can guarantee you, most lessons you will take from these will not help in boss battles.\n\nNot to mention that the throwing-invincibility frames are deceptive as well, there's no telling in a split second when you are vulnerable at the end of your throw. Yet at the final boss, this is exactly whats required to know.\nAll in all, the game likes to maximise the abuse out of your weakness, even when they are being forced on you by the game itself. It's unfair and harsh and maybe that's why it's not the sort of game for me. I can take difficult games, very difficult games. Games like Bayonetta (when going for Platinum), Super Meat Boy (A+'ing everything) and Ninja Gaiden (because, game) all are enjoyable for me because their responsiveness is perfect. Any mistake you make in those games are your fault alone. Failing because of an uncontrollable contender, however, makes for something very frustrating. Which is exactly the thing this game sins to.\n\nStorywise... it's cheesy. But what do you expect? The game itself likes throwing joke after joke at you, referencing many things that are Gaming related. It doesn't take itself too serious and neither should you. It's okay.\nBut with me having a bunch of frustrations with this game, I can't get myself to collect the other hidden mask pieces for the 'Good' ending or even replay the game.\n\nYes, I have to say the game is pretty good at what it's trying to do. Nowhere near the best, especially with me having so many irks around responsiveness. But if you can get over the gripes I have (or somehow manage to not experience them at all as a rare few do) then yeah... maybe you'll enjoy it. It won't be easy, even on Normal, so make sure you bring some alcohol to mellow you out. Because this game won't let you off the hook that easy.","April 16, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is great, and I enjoyed every fight, even if the final boss was a big and somewhat frustrating ramp up in difficulty I managed to defeat him in one sitting. It is also just a well written lighthearted game, as I feel it should be, aside from a couple moments. The visuals are bright and colorful, and the music is good too.\nBut where this game really shines, is when you have unlocked many of the powers and have to use them all in combination to get through some of the later platforming sections. They're used in truly brilliant ways here. Although sometimes I felt it could have gone further, it was just a lot of fun getting through the last few areas. It helps that falling does not kill or even hurt you. Of course colliding with a thorny vine or some spikes or an enemy's attack still will, so it's not as if there's no risk.\nOverall, this game surprised me with how well made it was.

As you progress you unlock combos and special moves and experience a ton of ridiculous scenarios (the humor is brilliant). There are tons of unlockables and a hard mode if you choose to play through a second time. The moves are pretty creative and don't feel all that gimicky or hard to utilize. I stuck with a gamepad the whole way through and the controls felt really solid. Also, co-op makes the game 100 times better; I definitely recommend playing with a friend.","June 27, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Itâs for a game that really deserves the effort. Guacamelee. It tells a classical story in which you (Juan, a former agave farmer and now luchador) have to save âEl Presidenteâs Daughterâ from the evil charro Carlos Calaca.\n\nThe game features a mix of platforming, combat and exploration. You start with a few basic moves and learn better ones throughout the game. Juan is able to switch between the two worlds of the living and the dead. This also changes music and environment. Both are brilliant and you will discover many details and references to other games.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game are no doubt the dialogs. They are hilarious and contain many Spanish words. I donât know the Spanish language but had no problems understanding everything. I think I might have missed a few jokes but thatâs ok. For the first time, while playing the game at home alone, I read out aloud every dialog. They are fantastic.\n\nIt took me about 6 hours to finish the game. The difficulty is appropriate on normal.

Prime 2 and 3 probably rank second and third respectively, but before I get longwinded: I love Metroid games.\n\nAs such I also have the poor habit of buying Super Metroid every time Nintendo rehashes it just to get some more of that sweet exploration action. Consequentially, I also love the Castlevania series...basically for being Metroid. Enter Guacamelee, an indie game that basically is Metroidvania, but dipped in taco sauce and smothered in chili's. You are Juan, a agave farmer who one day finds his town in peril and recovers a mask that gives him mystic Luchador powers. Along the way he learns new moves from peculiar looking statues and supplexes baddies into the ground to save the woman he, supposedly, loves. I don't know, the game doesn't care much about the whole love story. It wants you to play Metroid. And it does. Really well. In fact, the number of references to Metroid (and any other game for that matter) are so abundant, you might consider the developers lazy for not trying harder themselves.\n\nI'm poking holes now, cause Guacamelee is hilarious and fast and it certainly is excellent while it lasts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/recommended/214770/","Laisaniah","Fruitbowl M.D.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Laisaniah/","154 products in account","You probably have a good idea of what Guacamelee is by now. A Metroidvania with a Mexican Wrestler/Luchador theme, where the stamina-draining moves you learn are what unlock new areas. This is mainly done through colored blocks that require a specific skill in order to be broken. And that's the extent of the Metroidvania.\nIt's simple enough and proves to be a lot of fun in the largest portion of the game.\n\nHowever, several things in the end come together to create a frustrating experience unless you're the sort of player who's perfectly accustomed to every trick in the brawler book. And in fact, die-hard brawler fans are the only people I would really recommend this game to, at least to completion.\n\nIn the near-end game, you run into enemies and a few bosses that like to 'shield' themselves. A bubble fitting their shape that can only be broken by a specific stamina attack, which uses the same color coding as the aforementioned blocks. This actually starts out as a great idea as it throws around the way you think and need to approach a combat situation.\nBut therein lies the first problem: The 'yellow' attack, being headbutt, requires you to stand still and press the B button (on the controller).\n\nHowever, it takes about half a second before the game apparently registers you standing still, meaning you're spamming B while nothing happens but you standing there.\nObviously, in a high pace brawler, this means you are immediately punished for it by being attacked.\nThis headbutt lag only becomes more frustrating when you are going up against bosses that constantly change their type of shield. So whenever headbutt is required, you can count on it that you are going to get punished for it. It requires a compensation the likes where you feel like you are compensating for a bug.\n\nAnother technique that you must master in order to progress is the art of blocking. In the beginning, that's only required to jump through thorn vines. But eventually you will run into situations where the amount of melee and ranged enemies make it short of change of perspective to make it a bullet hell. Blocking is essential, period.\nAnd this is where another problem sets in. As someone trained by 'Witch time' in Bayonetta, I expect my blocking in a brawler to be instant. Many are the times where I had blocked a moment before being hit, yet it did not register. Frustrating.\n\nBut the biggest issue are the 'gauntlets' you are forced to partake in. These are single rooms where you are shut in and are forced to beat all the enemies that spawn. Most of the time these are pretty fun, if not challenging. But every now and then you find a gauntlet that simply does not belong in the game. In one, you were forced to constantly pop the appearing timed 'balloons' because otherwise, upon exploding, you receive significant damage. In the middle is an obstruction that has a hazard on top. And the balloons constantly appear on opposite sides of the room, AND you have to deal with other spawning enemies. Meaning you not only have to run like mad at each timed balloon, but you need to dodge any other ranged attacks and then survive the other enemies.\n\nOne other that I vividly remember is being forced to fight enemies that like to throw columns of light at you, and for some reason their AI likes to constantly throw these in sync where the distance between both columns is too great to overcome with one dodge/block, meaning you get hit regardless. But the biggest sinner is the gauntlet is the one where you have to kill a series of instakill exploding balloons with the moves they're obviously lined up for. But this brings another shortcoming: The special moves have a deceptively shorter range than they appear to have.\n\nBut my biggest gripe with these gauntlets is that they are non-optional. You have to do them, no matter how â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t they are. There's no going around them, meaning you have to suffer their punishment for as long as it takes for you to master whatever (usually pointless) lesson it wants to impart. Because I can guarantee you, most lessons you will take from these will not help in boss battles.\n\nNot to mention that the throwing-invincibility frames are deceptive as well, there's no telling in a split second when you are vulnerable at the end of your throw. Yet at the final boss, this is exactly whats required to know.\nAll in all, the game likes to maximise the abuse out of your weakness, even when they are being forced on you by the game itself. It's unfair and harsh and maybe that's why it's not the sort of game for me. I can take difficult games, very difficult games. Games like Bayonetta (when going for Platinum), Super Meat Boy (A+'ing everything) and Ninja Gaiden (because, game) all are enjoyable for me because their responsiveness is perfect. Any mistake you make in those games are your fault alone. Failing because of an uncontrollable contender, however, makes for something very frustrating. Which is exactly the thing this game sins to.\n\nStorywise... it's cheesy. But what do you expect? The game itself likes throwing joke after joke at you, referencing many things that are Gaming related. It doesn't take itself too serious and neither should you. It's okay.\nBut with me having a bunch of frustrations with this game, I can't get myself to collect the other hidden mask pieces for the 'Good' ending or even replay the game.\n\nYes, I have to say the game is pretty good at what it's trying to do. Nowhere near the best, especially with me having so many irks around responsiveness. But if you can get over the gripes I have (or somehow manage to not experience them at all as a rare few do) then yeah... maybe you'll enjoy it. It won't be easy, even on Normal, so make sure you bring some alcohol to mellow you out. Because this game won't let you off the hook that easy.","April 16, 2014","true","9.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After one last time of getting near the end of a long jump sequence only to miss the last button, I sighed and uninstalled the game.  I'll own that, but I'll also put some blame on the controller mapping, which doesn't seem to be editable, at least with a 360 controller on the PC.\n\nI'd still recommend the game because it has a truly excellent sense of style: great art, great humor, great animation, etc.  For a few bucks I think that's worth it even if you don't get to the end.

I'm not great at the game, and I've made it to the final boss, so it's not impossible (although I don't know if I'll beat the boss).\n\nI've definitely had some euphoric moments when I finally got good enough to progress past a challenge -- and I kept at it because it felt like I was making progress. I often give up on notoriously hard games because I feel like I hit a wall. That's not a big problem in Guacamelee!. I gave up on some of the "Chac Mool" arenas that test your various skills and some rooms in the challenge arena, but they're optional. Yesterday, I hit a wall at the final boss (but I might come back to fight another day).\n\nThe humour is good, but the fourth-wall breaking varies from hilarious to grating (eventually I grew tired of the homages to other games). The atmosphere is great (I love Mexican themes) and the music is pretty good.\n\nOverall, I think Guacamelee! is a lot of fun and the drop in coop is great.","February 15, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plagued (literally) with references to other games and internet culture.\nThe atention to detail it's remarkable, without any copy and paste material, or mirrored levels, a problem that plagues the genre, ie: the last nds Castlevania iteration. This gives really fresh content for the entire game, but it comes at a price, the length of it.\nThe length is little short for any major genre enthusiast, with just a little obvious backtracking here and there.\nThe game copes with this by presenting you with amazingly difficult platforming challenges, mixed with insta-death and insta-respawn.\nI assure you that 2 sections of this game will get you stuck jumping the same platforms again and again for about an hour. For me that sounds like fun, been an old gamer from the NES era, but i am sure that many new fellas will feel ripped off by the platforming difficulty of this title. Some of this rooms are just for item-grabbing, but others are mandatory and un-skippable.\nGo watch some youtube vids of it, to get an idea\nAnother thing to mention is the combat system. This game hides an amazingly complex and robust combo system, that you can learn through the game, and test in the Hell challenges.\n\n\nIt took me about 11 hours in my first run, and then about 4 on my second run.","February 17, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I donât usually dig beat emâ up games, but Iâm glad checked this game out, itâs pretty awesome. You play as Juan Aguacate, a Mexican farmer who dons a magical luchador mask to become a superpowered wrestler in order to save his kidnapped girlfriend.\n\nThe game can be played solo or co-op, a second player can assume the role of the female wrestler âTostadaâ. I played through the game both solo and co-op. The co-op makes the platforming sections a bit more frantic, but makes the beat emâ up sections and boss fights quite a bit easier.\n\nThe game has some Metroidvania elements as well: as you progress through the game and unlock new wrestling moves, youâll gain access to areas you previously unable to reach. As mentioned before, Guacamelee! also has a very silly sense of humor. Itâs chock full of ânerd jokesâ, internet humor and direct references to other video games. It was kind of a fun âcan you spot them all?â subgame within Guacamelee!; trying to catch some of the more subtle video game references. There was even a Zelda II reference in there! How many people are really going to get that one?\n\nGuacamelee! is a bit on the short side, but itâs quite good.

The combat scales from the trivial to the relentless:\n- Some attacks can be dodged, others cannot.\n- Enemies can be shielded with barriers that make them invulnerable until one of four specific attacks is used against them, or until they are pummeled with several attacks quickly.\n- Enemies can be in either the land of the dead or the land of the living. They can attack you from either but you can only attack them if you're in the same world as them.\n\nBut you have several tools to outmaneuver them:\n- Daze your enemies and then smash them around with wrestling throws to use them as projectiles or area-stun effects.\n- Four distinct special attacks that launch you or your enemies in different directions.\n- Turn in to a chicken and peck the bejebus out of your enemies to rack up higher combos.\n- Freely phase between the living world and the land of the dead.\n- Dodge through enemy attacks to rack your combos higher and negate damage.\n- Lock enemies in aerial combos for a moment's respite from the earth.\n- Unlock outfits with special powers.\n\nIf the game was only a beat-em'-up it would still be nearly worth the price of admission - but the various combat tools you attain are also the methods by which you unlock additional areas to traverse. The game strongly rewards exploration with both practical benefits (more life and more whuppin' fuel) and significant soft benefits (a better ending than the default for finding five main secrets).\n\nAll of this is backed by a crisp sense of humor, good writing, and a consistent mythology based in incan myth and mexican folklore. Critically, the controls are very tight - at least with an XBox 360 controller, which I had - which allows you to play with confidence that it won't glitch you out.

It's a hard game, but not too hard, well......not on levels used in order to advance the story anyways. There are several hardcore levels in this game, but they are mainly for side-quests like collecting all the orbs or the Inferno challenges. But otherwise, the difficulty is pretty fair.\n\nThe graphics are really nice-looking and stylish, even if the characters and monsters are Flash-animated, the Mexican-themed art-style is what made this game so gorgeous. The music is astoundishing and the trumpets and guitar fits perfectly with this game's environment.\n\nBut what really makes this game shine is the gameplay. It has the style of a Metroidvania platformer mixed in with a beat-em-up. You perform different kinds of combos to beat up your enemies with and can add them up together much like a 2D fighter game. The game has plenty of areas to explore in, lots of side-quests to accomplish, and even has it's own arenas if you're interested in completing the game 100%.\n\nMy only downside is the story, which isn't anything new and intriguing, and is pretty straightforward. Other than that, I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves 2D side-scrollers and loves to explore.","January 25, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Guacamelee! Is just tons of fun from beginning to end. I loved all the hidden easter eggs that pay homage to the classics, such as Mario Bros., Zelda, and Metroid acknowledgments (like the "choozoo" statues).\n\nSome of my favorite aspects of the game are the soundtrack (which has a wonderful Mexican cutlrual tone) and the gameplay. I enjoy Metroidvania style games, and this one hits the nail on the head. The gameplay is tight and the fighting is fun. The art style is also fantastic, I love it. The story also is not too bad for this genre, it is not on a Metroid level, but intriguing nonetheless. Couple that with fun and unique gameplay mechanics and you have a great game on your hands.\n\nAs far as gameply goes, I HIGHLY recommend using a controller. There are some tricky platforming parts that are nigh-impossible on a keyboard (they are doable but just unnecsarilly challenging due to the keyboard format.) Either way, I cannot recommend Guacamelee! enough, I would encourage you to purchase it to enjoy this gargantuan gem that is Guacamelee!","December 30, 2013","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything from amazing animation and visuals, tight controls, and an awesome sound track, make this the best game I've played in the last five years.\n\nIf you are wondering whether you should get it, get it.

Although you can fail a lot of times at a given mission, there is zero frustration.  Best way I can describe Guacamelee's gameplay is that it has a "flow" and once you are in the zone it's a joy to play.  There is no point where the game cheats, and every error is due to the player not mastering the controls.  Being Mexican, this game had me smiling at a lot of things, the humor, the surprisingly authentic portrayal of a lot of Mexican folklore, the subtle way that is was playing with telenovelas tropes.

Metroidvania is probably my favorite video game genre, and this one gets it right. While the game doesn't have a large focus on exploration, its still there. The combat is legitimately fun, and is not just tacked on like in many games of the genre. The platforming sections are very interesting and can get challenging. The atmosphere and setting are very unique and cool. The music is beautiful and fitting. The humor is quite good, I laughed out loud a good deal at some of this game's jokes.\n\nI think the coolest thing about this game is the way that platforming and combat are integrated. As you progress in the game you gain combat moves, powerful punches and such. These moves are used in combat, but also are the backbone of platforming. For example the first move you learn is an uppercut that launches you upwards in the air. And while useful for combatting enemies and sending them skyward, the uppercut can also be used as a "double jump" of sorts.\n\nHighly, highly recommended.","January 7, 2014","true","13.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Love the art style, smooth controls and wonderfully designed combat even with a keyboard which I am using, and last but not least, the music is AWESOME! Certainly one of the most memorable things about this game. Where the games takes place and how the story line handles it is well executed, but this is definitely not the reason to buy this game.

You play as Juan Aguacate, a Mexican farmer who dons a magical luchador mask to become a superpowered wrestler in order to save his kidnapped girlfriend.\n\nThe game can be played solo or co-op, a second player can assume the role of the female wrestler âTostadaâ. I played through the game both solo and co-op. The co-op makes the platforming sections a bit more frantic, but makes the beat emâ up sections and boss fights quite a bit easier.\n\nThe game has some Metroidvania elements as well: as you progress through the game and unlock new wrestling moves, youâll gain access to areas you previously unable to reach. As mentioned before, Guacamelee! also has a very silly sense of humor. Itâs chock full of ânerd jokesâ, internet humor and direct references to other video games. It was kind of a fun âcan you spot them all?â subgame within Guacamelee!; trying to catch some of the more subtle video game references. There was even a Zelda II reference in there! How many people are really going to get that one?\n\nGuacamelee! is a bit on the short side, but itâs quite good. Check it out.\n\nFor more game reviews, check out http://whatisjamesplaying.blogspot.com/","January 24, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is a 2d side scroller beat-em-up, it has a lot of exploration and there is some backtraking to places when you get new abilities. The combat is pretty basic at the start but once you gain more abilities the combat is very fun, it involves a lot of combo juggling, but mashing buttons works too albeit less efficient. The platforming in the game is pretty decent and fairly managable, however many of the optional areas can have really hard platforming puzzles, but these are optional. The setting is very vibrate and has a lot of sense of humor, the game is littered with indie game cameos and references. Guacamelee! is an execellent game filled with exploration, combat and platforming. I recommended purchase.","February 24, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plagued (literally) with references to other games and internet culture.\nThe atention to detail it's remarkable, without any copy and paste material, or mirrored levels, a problem that plagues the genre, ie: the last nds Castlevania iteration. This gives really fresh content for the entire game, but it comes at a price, the length of it.\nThe length is little short for any major genre enthusiast, with just a little obvious backtracking here and there.\nThe game copes with this by presenting you with amazingly difficult platforming challenges, mixed with insta-death and insta-respawn.\nI assure you that 2 sections of this game will get you stuck jumping the same platforms again and again for about an hour. For me that sounds like fun, been an old gamer from the NES era, but i am sure that many new fellas will feel ripped off by the platforming difficulty of this title. Some of this rooms are just for item-grabbing, but others are mandatory and un-skippable.\nGo watch some youtube vids of it, to get an idea\nAnother thing to mention is the combat system. This game hides an amazingly complex and robust combo system, that you can learn through the game, and test in the Hell challenges.\n\n\nIt took me about 11 hours in my first run, and then about 4 on my second run.","February 17, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You fight about 15-ish different enemies, learn various special attacks which also offer movement tricks required for some platforming elements in this game. The last key feature is that you can switch between the realm of the living and the dead. You'll have to use the world shift as well as the special moves to deal with your enemies, who can attack from both planes of existence while also being protected by some form of shield that requires a particular attack to break first.\n\nPersonally I liked the graphic style, but I can see that it might be offputting for others. I did experience a graphical bug that caused a very particular form of screen-tearing, regardless of Vsync options.\n\nI found the combat pretty satisfying, and I can say that a controller is required to get the best experience possible.\n\nThe game isn't all that long; It takes about 6.5 hours to complete a playthough to start to finish, solo (the game support Co-Op, but I haven't tried it) on Normal. It offers some challenge modes and harder difficulties, as well as speedrun leaderboards, in case that's your cup of tea.

I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Guacamelee is one of the very best games the genre has ever seen.\n\nThe game really has everything; excellent graphics with a healthy serving of style, wonderful music, tight and well-executed controls and combat and a world that's simply fun to explore. That's really the key word here; this game is FUN! Everything from juggling enemies and racking up a 300 hit combo to exploring every nook and cranny of the world is constantly and consistently engaging and entertaining.\n\nThe game also keeps things fresh by throwing a curveball or two your way, mostly in the shape of balls-hard platforming segments, almost on the level of something like Super Meat Boy. This is actually something I think the game does well, because most entries in this genre have pretty uninteresting and frankly lame platforming, Castlevania included. Guacamelee wears its platform roots on its sleeve and demands some tricky, technical jumping from you, and it's all the better for it.\n\nAs you can see, I have nothing but praise for this game. I could ramble on about how much I love it all day, so I'm just going to summarize and say that if you have any interest in this genre and haven't played this game yet, you absolutely have to. Like right now. Do not pass go, do not wait for a sale; play it immediately!","February 27, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If an action platformer, a beat em up, and metroidvania had a child this would be the child.  In this game you fight and grapple the enemies, as well as using moves you unlock throughout the games.  All of your moves can combo together.  For example, I can use my upward punch, then jump up and rooster claw(upward attack that shoots you up too.  This is useful all game to help you platform as well.), attack them multiple times, then either groundpound them, headbutt them away, or grapple them and follow up with one of my throws.  I could always piledrive my enemy, kick them 20 feet away, or do a deadly suplex to help wipe out the enemies that might await below me.\n\nThe enemies have a good variety, even tho I wish it had more.   I felt like with a little more variety amongst the enemies, this game would have been so much more fun.\n\nFor now, I'll give it a 8.5/10.

The jokes and puns scattered through out the game don't really seem forced and you get the feeling someone had a lot of fun making this game. The storyline isn't nearly long enough, I really would have loved play more and that is really my only complaint. The variety of moves allow for satisfying combo chains that aren't just given to you by mashing one button. All of of the moves you aquire are satifying and have multiple purposes and keep you exploring the enviorment. Some obstacles have multiple ways to be passed by combing move chain. Other times some of the puzzles and platform timing will have you wanted to snap your remote over your knee... but if it didn't you wouldn't feel like you accomplished anything. There isn't an intense and detailed leveling up system, but the progression and gains in power still feel substantial. The music is incredible and goes so well with every detail of the game.

The soundtrack, artwork, and in particular the animation are all pleasant and cohesive.\n\nCombat is intuitive and flowing, and Guacamelee does a good job of forcing you to use your full range of powers by the variety of enemies and their weaknesses. The abilities you acquire find use both in combat and in platforming/exploration, so you end up really looking forward to discovering the next powerup.\n\nThe local co-op mode works well during the fighting sections; flinging a hapless enemy across the screen to your partner who then slams them into the ground doesnât get old. Unfortunately, the co-op platforming is a mess. The sections that use the environment-shifting mechanic are great fun in single player, but in co-op it's impossible not to get in each others' way. On top of that, the camera essentially only follows one player, which means it is inevitably more efficient to just let one player attempt the jumps while the other player watches.\n\nGuacameleeâs smooth animations, upbeat soundtrack, colourful backgrounds and enjoyable Luchador theme all contribute to a polished feel. Other than the weak co-op I donât have any major complaints. I wasn't blown away but I definitely enjoyed my time with it. Recommended for fans of metroidvania games, worth a look for everyone else.","October 19, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Spent $15 on the gold edition, would spend 15$ again.","October 7, 2015","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Wow, I had a lot of fun with this one. I highly recommend for players that like getting super fustrated trying to get past the same platform puzzle for an hour. This game is super hard and fustratingly so, but its so much fun you just need to keep trying. Eventually I tried to complete as much as possible but then I just said eff it on some of the inferno challenges, this game is better suited for 10 year olds with super fast reflexes than old timers like me. Regarless I still recommend if you have some patience and love sidescrolling adventures in the vein of Metroid and Castlevania.\n\nPS. there are a lot of hilarious game references in this game, i must have seen at least 10 some blatent and others hiding in the background.","May 11, 2014","true","24.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You fight about 15-ish different enemies, learn various special attacks which also offer movement tricks required for some platforming elements in this game. The last key feature is that you can switch between the realm of the living and the dead. You'll have to use the world shift as well as the special moves to deal with your enemies, who can attack from both planes of existence while also being protected by some form of shield that requires a particular attack to break first.\n\nPersonally I liked the graphic style, but I can see that it might be offputting for others. I did experience a graphical bug that caused a very particular form of screen-tearing, regardless of Vsync options.\n\nI found the combat pretty satisfying, and I can say that a controller is required to get the best experience possible.\n\nThe game isn't all that long; It takes about 6.5 hours to complete a playthough to start to finish, solo (the game support Co-Op, but I haven't tried it) on Normal. It offers some challenge modes and harder difficulties, as well as speedrun leaderboards, in case that's your cup of tea.

Boss-battles, mini-bosses, loads of different enemies, platforming, jump-puzzles with various difficulties, and a great storyline. A Masterpeice! If you like a challanging platformer/combat-sidescroller; this is it for you.\n\nOriginally got this game through a HumbleBundle and wasen't expecting much from it. Boy was I in for a surprise!\n\nPros and Cons:++ Pros:\n+ Local coop\n+ Responsive controls\n+ Full controller support\n+ Combat with a lot of variations\n+ Customizations\n+ Fun and fine story\n+ Side-material (and loads of it)\n+ Immersive world\n+ Artstyle\n\n- - Cons:\n- Fairly short actual story\n- Coop restricted to local\n\nDetails:The games features a coop mode, but this is however only on a local pc. The coop mode is essentialy adding another character to the game with next to none extra interactions. This is however a neat feature for the game, and is very fun. doubles the people, double the fun, right!? right indeed.\n\nThe combat and movement system is extremely good, you control every action, and your charactor is a super responsive slave to your controller of choice. It features full controller support, which I personally find great for this kind of game. Great use of combo variation and at some points it is even a necesity to win a duel or complete a challange.\n\nWether you jump your way thorugh spikes, traps and platforms, or (Guaca)melee your way through hazzards of enemies, It's allways a very good mixtures of the two main gameplay mechanics. The game has a lot of mechnics, which are all very well explained, and it forces you to utilizes almost everyone of them. You can't just stomp thorugh the game using one move, or one combat technique. Variation is key to defeat certain enemies.\n\nOne word *Sidematerial*!!! Side-quests (so to speak), challange modes, collectiables, unlockables. Guacamelee has pretty much all of it. It also featues a some custimization to suit your playstyle as well. Some of the challanges may be difficult and frustratin! I must admit I at one point spent 1Â½ hours completing a single jump-puzzle... I suck... damn my stubborness. And yet other parts may be a peice of cake.\n\nThe overall game is an eye-pleaser. The artline is amazing, especially considering it being a "just" a 2D sidescroller. You can really feel the mood of the game, being pumped up with references to other games, memes and various sidestories. It's all in the detail of the tiny thing. And there is a lot of tiny things in this game. Makes for an overall better experience. It is very rewarding to go around exploring the world of guacamelee, trust me on this one!\n\nThe story is pretty straight-forward, humorous, filled with some unique characters. This is however not the bearing factor, as it falls a bit short compared to the standard of the other parts of the game. Only problem is that you can rush through the main storyline in a matter of a few hours, which leaves you storywise a bit dissatisfied. The loads of extra content largely outweights this problem though.\n\nFinal verdict:One of the best sidescrolles i've ever played. Rewarding to play.\n"Me Gusta". I rate this game 9/10.","November 5, 2015","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFlyingDill/recommended/214770/","TheFlyingDill","Dille","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFlyingDill/","667 products in account","Guacamelee is another one of those action platformers set in quirky colorful world with an over the top story and a silly sense of humor. If you are like me and you are sick and tired of this genre I sincerely recommend you to try out Guacamelee.\n\nAt the first glance Guacamelee really seams just like any other game from this genre. What saves it from the awful fate of mediocrity is it's gameplay. While most games concentrate on one or two unique mechanics, in Guacamelee you have a wide variety of special moves that are use both for combat and traversing the environment, and sometimes for both tings at once. Which is cool, but isn't the thing that made me love this game. The awesome bit is that while the platforming is simple at first and requires you to use only one or two special abilities at once, later on you'll need to be able to preform very complex  combinations of you abilities. The satisfaction of pulling off some of the more challenging platforming segments is wonderful. And the same goes for combat. The only thing I didn't like about it is the pace at which you acquire new abilities. It's slow. I didn't notice the first time I played trough the game, but on my second run on hard mode in the beginning of the game I felt handicapped. Another thing I noticed only ind hard mode is that the boss hit boxes aren't all that grate. Every now and again fighting a boss I got hit by it's attack when the animation of that attack had already played out. If the game had been more combat oriented this had really been a big problem for me, but since I only noticed it a couple times on hard mode it's only a minor annoyance.\n\nAnd wile the games artstyle doesn't  set it apart from all the other indie games, you can't deny that it looks quite nice. Simplified blocky shapes and the bold color pallet works well together. Wen it comes to the visual part of the game I only have tow criticisms. First - I have no idea why would anyone think that it's necessary to have a thick black line always present on the top of the screen. There definitely  has to be an more ascetically pleasing way to make the health and stamina meter always visible. Also there is no reason to have pause button prompt always be displayed at the top of the screen. Second - every now and again there ware situations when the color of a particular enemy matched the backgrounds color which made identifying their attacks difficult at times. And wile for the most of the game it's a non issue since health enemies aren't that strong and give a lot of health orbs once killed, if you are fighting a boss on hard mode where it can kill you in 5 or 6 hits it's a bit annoying not to be able to see it.\n\nWhen it comes to the games story I really can't tell you anything. I read just the first four or five dialogs, realized that I absolutely didn't care and stopped reading. I really hope that there will come a day when indie devs will realize that many people don't care about the story in a game like this and will start to put in options that allow to skip story at faster pace. Because in Guacamelee you have to press a button for every line a characters says. It takes ages to click trough some of the more lengthier dialogs. And it absolutely enrages me when there is a conversation before a boss fight that is repeated every time that you try to defeat the boss. STOP THAT! No one wants to click trough that â¥â¥â¥â¥ again and again. Good thing this game only has four instances of this.\n\nAll in all it's a surprisingly competent action platformer. It may lack the design elegance of games like Super Meat Boy, but it's grate no the less.","March 28, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/214770/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","My favourite genre is probably the Metroid-vania type of games.\nMostly because they have just the right amount of combat, action oriented gameplay, and then also some necessary exploration!\nSeeing Guacamelee, it interested me greatly, both because of its genre, and also because it "draws from Mexican culture". Why make it all up when we have cultures full of interesting folklore already?\nSo, I was pumped. And I now stand really impressed. This game blew all of my expectations out of the window, and here's why.\n\n\nFirst off, the presentation.\nThe game looks gorgeous and unique. Enemy and character design overall was very detailed, and it looks really great. Everything else isn't anything to sneeze at either, it looks pretty good overall, although the characters were what stood up for me. Some parts of it can look to same-y, but it has a bunch of different areas to keep things interesting.\n\nThe music wasn't something that I'd listen to out of the game, or is stuck in my head. But it fits the setting really well. and makes the experience more atmospheric.\n\nAnother note on the presentation: there are tons of stylized references to multiple videogames, specially in the form of posters in town. Those are all "revamped" to fit the setting, but anyone can see who/what they're referencing. And the most important thing: those weren't just references because "it's cool". One can clearly see that they've seen what made those games great, and they've managed to put most of those aspects in their own game. More on that later.\n\n\nSo, gameplay.\nIn Guacamelee, you have a lot of combat and platforming, and they both behave very closely to one another, because the special moves you use in combat, you'll also need to platforming, be it to reach an higher platform, to stand in place until a platform moves, etc. And platforming scales really well, starting out pretty easy, and getting more and more difficult as you progress. The same with the combat, and here's my biggest complaint: the game was way too easy. The harder parts were actually "optional" as part of secrets, and exploration.\n\nI'll explain it in more detail further.\nAs you progress the game, you gain several abilities (by breaking Metroid-like statues) and those will help you in both combat and platforming. Combat was surprisingly good, as the player could pull some really long combos, and it wasn't too hard to make. And the combat never felt like a button-masher, and dodging is also an essential part of it.\n\nThe Boss Fights were also impressing. Each Boss has several phases with different pattern that the player should memorize. Unfortunately, once more, they were way too easy and didn't provide much of a challenge, despite the fight being enjoyable in itself.\nAlso, the last Boss fight had a weird hitbox that messed it up a little bit. Nothing game breaking though, it just felt weird.\n\n\n\nTo keep going forward, besides unlocking new abilities, the player should also explore to find Money (to buy Costumes for different playstyles), Health and Stamina (what is used for special abilities) around the world. These are the sections that usually provide the biggest challenge in terms of platforming, and they were really enjoyable!\nThese require the best use of all the abilities the player had learned up to that point.\n\nAnd this is what mesmerized me: this game does a lot of things right! Platforming, Combat, Exploration, the World, and I could go on. They've taken some of the best aspects of previous game and made it their own, and they've done an amazing job here!\n\nThey've taken a similar respawning system as in Super Meat Boy for the hardest platforming sections, and a Metroid-like transformation to reach tighter places, just for two very obvious examples. The point is, the references are there not just as a nice poster, but also deep in the mechanics of the game, and I'll applaud the developers for that. Great job!\n\n\nOn the exploration side, there are also some mysterious "Orbs" that are very well hidden, and present the most hardcore platforming in the game. Nothing is told to the player about what they're in the game for, and it made me go all in to find them. Some of these challenges could get somewhat frustrating, but it's good that they're there! Some challenge, at long last!\nWell, unfortunately, I only went to find them after I had 100% each zone, and the reward wasn't very useful to me. So, I won't spoil it, but you should try to find all of them right away. The last one you can only obtain after defeating the last Boss.\nAll in all, they were worth it.\n\nThe DLC provides 17 challenges that are also very enjoyable, ranging from combat to platforming and rancing. They were all well done and provide additional challenge and add new suits with different attributes which is always nice to keep things fresh!\n\n\nSo, overall, I really enjoyed all of my time spent with the game, and have found explored 100% of the game's areas, and it was all worth it. The sidequests all had character to it and were pretty amusing, adding a bit to the world and setting of the game.\nIt did more things right than it had the right too, which was impressive! Sometimes, it felt too ambitious with it, but those feeling were far minor compared with the positive aspects of it.\n\nNow, I'll get on with the bad parts.\nThe first one is one I don't understand, and almost despise.\nThey've decided not to include Hard Mode until the player finished the game. And there was no NewGame+ option. What the hell? Why? Seeing as the developers went deep into many games to see what they did and didn't do right, how did they reach this conclusion?\nNormal Mode was by far too easy! I barely felt challenged at any point, and it highly detracted from the experience, specially after seeing "You've unlock Hard Mode!"... It's not very enjoyable repeting the whole game, specially from the 0! If there were a NG+, I might've done it, because I still needed to unlock some Suits and Explore part of the world. But having to do everything all over again just harded didn't really feel very nice... So, I've done almost everything to do in the game, with the exception of playing the game in Hard Mode. A game that I've found too easy...\nI don't understand this decision, honestly. I just hoped the developers realize this mistake and don't make it in future games, because I sure look forward to them now! If I'm the one missing something with this, feel free to reply and tell me, but I really hate to have to repeat the whole thing to play the game as it was intended.\n\nAnother thing, is the fact that the exploration isn't all that rewarding, since the player doesn't really need to upgrade to beat the game. And, specially after the end of it, exploration was mostly there for the achievements (except for the SideQuests, which were genuinely amusing, and some optional secrets along the way).\n\nI'd also like to make 2 constructive critics.\nOne of them is about the Map System. It was pretty good, letting the player know where previously encountered coloured blocks were in the map (these were areas blocked until the player gained X ability), but some areas were not as direct or evident and easy to see by looking at the map. As such, a nice addition would be a sort of "Note" system in which the player could right Notes and a certain point in the map for further reference.\n\nAnother one, is about certain achievements. There were some for beating the Bosses or Arenas on certain conditions. These made the fights harder, and more interesting, which is a plus! But there was no way of knowing about them without browsing the achievements. many players probably missed enjoyable content because of that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/214770/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","My favourite genre is probably the Metroid-vania type of games.\nMostly because they have just the right amount of combat, action oriented gameplay, and then also some necessary exploration!\nSeeing Guacamelee, it interested me greatly, both because of its genre, and also because it "draws from Mexican culture". Why make it all up when we have cultures full of interesting folklore already?\nSo, I was pumped. And I now stand really impressed. This game blew all of my expectations out of the window, and here's why.\n\n\nFirst off, the presentation.\nThe game looks gorgeous and unique. Enemy and character design overall was very detailed, and it looks really great. Everything else isn't anything to sneeze at either, it looks pretty good overall, although the characters were what stood up for me. Some parts of it can look to same-y, but it has a bunch of different areas to keep things interesting.\n\nThe music wasn't something that I'd listen to out of the game, or is stuck in my head. But it fits the setting really well. and makes the experience more atmospheric.\n\nAnother note on the presentation: there are tons of stylized references to multiple videogames, specially in the form of posters in town. Those are all "revamped" to fit the setting, but anyone can see who/what they're referencing. And the most important thing: those weren't just references because "it's cool". One can clearly see that they've seen what made those games great, and they've managed to put most of those aspects in their own game. More on that later.\n\n\nSo, gameplay.\nIn Guacamelee, you have a lot of combat and platforming, and they both behave very closely to one another, because the special moves you use in combat, you'll also need to platforming, be it to reach an higher platform, to stand in place until a platform moves, etc. And platforming scales really well, starting out pretty easy, and getting more and more difficult as you progress. The same with the combat, and here's my biggest complaint: the game was way too easy. The harder parts were actually "optional" as part of secrets, and exploration.\n\nI'll explain it in more detail further.\nAs you progress the game, you gain several abilities (by breaking Metroid-like statues) and those will help you in both combat and platforming. Combat was surprisingly good, as the player could pull some really long combos, and it wasn't too hard to make. And the combat never felt like a button-masher, and dodging is also an essential part of it.\n\nThe Boss Fights were also impressing. Each Boss has several phases with different pattern that the player should memorize. Unfortunately, once more, they were way too easy and didn't provide much of a challenge, despite the fight being enjoyable in itself.\nAlso, the last Boss fight had a weird hitbox that messed it up a little bit. Nothing game breaking though, it just felt weird.\n\n\n\nTo keep going forward, besides unlocking new abilities, the player should also explore to find Money (to buy Costumes for different playstyles), Health and Stamina (what is used for special abilities) around the world. These are the sections that usually provide the biggest challenge in terms of platforming, and they were really enjoyable!\nThese require the best use of all the abilities the player had learned up to that point.\n\nAnd this is what mesmerized me: this game does a lot of things right! Platforming, Combat, Exploration, the World, and I could go on. They've taken some of the best aspects of previous game and made it their own, and they've done an amazing job here!\n\nThey've taken a similar respawning system as in Super Meat Boy for the hardest platforming sections, and a Metroid-like transformation to reach tighter places, just for two very obvious examples. The point is, the references are there not just as a nice poster, but also deep in the mechanics of the game, and I'll applaud the developers for that. Great job!\n\n\nOn the exploration side, there are also some mysterious "Orbs" that are very well hidden, and present the most hardcore platforming in the game. Nothing is told to the player about what they're in the game for, and it made me go all in to find them. Some of these challenges could get somewhat frustrating, but it's good that they're there! Some challenge, at long last!\nWell, unfortunately, I only went to find them after I had 100% each zone, and the reward wasn't very useful to me. So, I won't spoil it, but you should try to find all of them right away. The last one you can only obtain after defeating the last Boss.\nAll in all, they were worth it.\n\nThe DLC provides 17 challenges that are also very enjoyable, ranging from combat to platforming and rancing. They were all well done and provide additional challenge and add new suits with different attributes which is always nice to keep things fresh!\n\n\nSo, overall, I really enjoyed all of my time spent with the game, and have found explored 100% of the game's areas, and it was all worth it. The sidequests all had character to it and were pretty amusing, adding a bit to the world and setting of the game.\nIt did more things right than it had the right too, which was impressive! Sometimes, it felt too ambitious with it, but those feeling were far minor compared with the positive aspects of it.\n\nNow, I'll get on with the bad parts.\nThe first one is one I don't understand, and almost despise.\nThey've decided not to include Hard Mode until the player finished the game. And there was no NewGame+ option. What the hell? Why? Seeing as the developers went deep into many games to see what they did and didn't do right, how did they reach this conclusion?\nNormal Mode was by far too easy! I barely felt challenged at any point, and it highly detracted from the experience, specially after seeing "You've unlock Hard Mode!"... It's not very enjoyable repeting the whole game, specially from the 0! If there were a NG+, I might've done it, because I still needed to unlock some Suits and Explore part of the world. But having to do everything all over again just harded didn't really feel very nice... So, I've done almost everything to do in the game, with the exception of playing the game in Hard Mode. A game that I've found too easy...\nI don't understand this decision, honestly. I just hoped the developers realize this mistake and don't make it in future games, because I sure look forward to them now! If I'm the one missing something with this, feel free to reply and tell me, but I really hate to have to repeat the whole thing to play the game as it was intended.\n\nAnother thing, is the fact that the exploration isn't all that rewarding, since the player doesn't really need to upgrade to beat the game. And, specially after the end of it, exploration was mostly there for the achievements (except for the SideQuests, which were genuinely amusing, and some optional secrets along the way).\n\nI'd also like to make 2 constructive critics.\nOne of them is about the Map System. It was pretty good, letting the player know where previously encountered coloured blocks were in the map (these were areas blocked until the player gained X ability), but some areas were not as direct or evident and easy to see by looking at the map. As such, a nice addition would be a sort of "Note" system in which the player could right Notes and a certain point in the map for further reference.\n\nAnother one, is about certain achievements. There were some for beating the Bosses or Arenas on certain conditions. These made the fights harder, and more interesting, which is a plus! But there was no way of knowing about them without browsing the achievements. many players probably missed enjoyable content because of that. So, a cool addition would be to add a Tab for Optional Objectives so that the player always knows what can be done.\n\nWell, that's all from me.\nI loved this game and I certainly recommend it to everyone who likes the genre!

The combat is fluid and fun with tight controls. Platforming is kept fresh throughout the game with steady introductions of new techniques. Its story is well written with a good sense of humor and enjoyable Mexican setting. Quite simply, it's everything I'd want in a Metroidvania style game.\n\nCombos, special moves (one of which is hilariously named Dashing Derpderp), double jumps, dodges, throws and grapples kept me engaged with the combat the entire way through. New moves are unlocked at such a pace that I never felt overwhelmed with too many options, nor bored with too few. Many of the new abilities also double as platforming tools. So just as you gain a wider range of battle skills, the platforming sections also evolve to require their use. There is a lot of great level design featured in Guacamelee! complete with plenty of enticing hidden treasures.\n\nEven as a backseat element, the story shines with likeable characters and heavy doses of comedy. In particular, I enjoyed seeing some of the villains fleshed out enough to know a little of their backstory and how they came to follow Calaca (the primary antagonist). Guacamelee!'s soundtrack does a fair job of matching the setting and action but never hooked me enough to look into buying it. There is a nice atmospheric shift in the music as you swap between the world of the living and the dead. I think a person with very little familiarity with Mexican culture and the Spanish language will have no problems having a blast with this game. That being said, this is one case where I'm glad I took 2 years of Spanish in High School as I think it helped me understand or see the humor in a few situations.\n\nI only have a few complaints with the game. The first is its native controller support, or lack thereof. From what I can tell only Xbox controllers will work automatically. I use a PS2 controller hooked up with a USB adaptor. This is the first game I've ever played where I had to use the external program x360ce (found online) to emulate an Xbox360 controller. Most games either work automatically or I can simply go to the in-game control options and set it up that way. Neither of those worked with Guacamelee! which is really unfortunate for a game that was designed for a controller.\n\nSecondly, while I hesitate to call this a complaint, the platforming can be really hard at times. Whether that bothers you or not is entirely subjective. By and large I found the challenge to be gratifying except for just a couple of frustrating sections.\n\nAnd finally, in a lot of ways calling a game too short can be both a critique and a compliment. For me Guacamelee! clocked in at 12 hours to achieve 100% completion on a normal difficulty playthrough. For an inexpensive indie game that's actually pretty good but as this review's title said: I still want more!","June 7, 2014","true","12.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/recommended/214770/","noibn","noibn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/","1756 products in account","Guacamelee is the latest competitor to enter the 'Metroidvania' wrestling ring (see what I did there?)... har har. Ahem. So it is a worthy descendant of the classics? In a word, yes. There's a lot to like about this one. First of all, the Mexican style/setting is something I can't recall ever seeing in a game before, and it actually works really well. The characters are cool and the writing is decent. Secondly, the combat is surprisingly deep and can be challenging at times. You play as a luchador and mainly utilize wrestling moves to take down your opponents. After beating on a guy for a bit, you get the option to grapple and toss them. This ends up being really fun, especially when you start racking up huge combos by throwing dudes into a group of other dudes. It's not simply a mindless beat-'em-up, though. There is a deeper layer of strategy and skill required, as certain enemies can only be defeated with careful timing or by using specific special moves to break their defenses first. It's not too hard versus 1 or 2 enemies, but when the game throws a screen full of baddies at you with projectiles flying all over the place, it can actually get a bit challenging. Aside from combat, the game also mixes in some classic 2D platforming. Some of these sections will really put your skills to the test, as they require precise coordination of various moves to be strung together very quickly. This could have potentially been very frustrating, but luckily, the game is very forgiving when it comes to the platforming. If you fall to your "death", you just end up back on the most recent platform you touched with no other penalty. While this may seem dumbed down, you'll be glad for it... trust me. Overall, the game does a great job of tuning the balance of difficulty between its various systems. The toughest parts are probably the boss fights, which require patience, observation and exploitation of patterns. You'll be challenged, but with a bit of practice, you'll eventually get by. Depending on how quickly you play or how completionist you want to get, the game will last you anywhere from 9-13 hours, and many more if you plan to go for the best ending or complete all of the challenges in the "El Infierno" DLC level (included for free). So it's a good value for the money (and I haven't even touched at all on how many gaming references and other neat touches can be found throughout). Guacamelee is a serious love-fest for gaming fans and especially those who love the Metroidvania sub-genre. If that sounds like you, then pick this one up without hesitation.\n\nTechnical notes: I know I say this for almost every sidescroller, but seriously, I mean it this time - you are gonna want to use a gamepad for this one (specifically an Xbox360 controller if you have one). I suppose it's possible to play this with a keyboard, but I sure as hell wouldn't want to. Some of the platforming and combat sections need split-second finesse maneuvering, which is hard enough even with a controller. The developers even put up a note at the start of the game that they recommend using a controller. Whenever I see those warnings in a game from a developer, I have learned to heed them. You probably should too. So think twice about buying this if you don't have a gamepad with the standard layout of buttons/sticks.","August 13, 2013","true","14.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

And the first few hours I played were excellent. I loved the freedom of the combat and the ability to chain together lots of moves in new ways. I also appreciated the wealth of references.\n\nBut as the game progresses, you get flooded with new abilities (OP and unnecessary abilities IMO that ruin the rhythm of the game) and the once precise and tight controls become way over-saturated. The combat becomes muddled and convoluted.\n\nOn top of that, the game rapidly shifts its focus from combat to platforming, which is not its strong point. I had a blast in the beginning of the game chaining huge hit counts in very satisfying and visually appealing fights. Then some way into it, I have to make my way through almost Meatboy level platforming, only without the precision and quick respawn that dedicated platformers like Meatboy have. Where games like Meatboy and Dustforce are VERY hard, they don't feel unfair, and they focus on platforming mechanics so they can perfect them. Guacamelees platforming has terrible controls, and the platforming feels thrown-in. The game becomes crazy frustrating and promptly sucks all the fun out of it. If you're looking for platforming, leave Guacamelee on the shelf and go get Dustforce.\n\nThis game suffers from over-saturated mechanics and identity crisis. If you love brawlers and Metroidvania style games, you might get some enjoyment out of this, but my advice is don't get too invested.  If you want something that does brawler/Metroidvania really well, I suggest Dust (if you can get past bad story/voice acting), or even better, go buy Muramasa for about $12 on Wii or just emulate it. You'll have more visually unique game with better mechanics and longer campaign.","February 24, 2014","false","0.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

If the option to remap the keys is available, I probably wouldn't have so much gripe to the interface and actually recommend this.  Any type of action/platforming game relies on good control, this one feels tremendously lacking becaues it tends to break the flow/rhythm I've built up.  Combat control works, but anything that involves quickly switching light/dark world becomes awkward due to button placement.  This is even more annoying when the game ACTUALLY recommend you to use a controller for the game but won't give you the option to remap the buttons.  It's only 1 controller profile too, no alternates either.  If you have a distinctive play style and prefer certain button mapping, consider checking out how this one is mapped first before making your purchase.\n\nMy general sentiments after I first completely beat the game with good ending: It took the Meat Circus of Psychonauts, the speed bike in Battle Toads, the disappearing blocks in Megaman and haphazardly rolled all the frustration bits into this.  Really not a fan of the gimmicky part of the level design.  Just. No.","November 11, 2013","false","18.6"," 46 of 91 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","46","91","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/214770/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","TL;DR I closet love this game. The music is great, the gameplay is solid, and it is intentionally silly. Not only that, but it's also got a really fun combat system and it actually forces you to learn how to play the game so that, by the end, you know what you're doing; it's not like other games where you can more or less wing what you're doing and just follow the objective marker to get to the end. I'd give this game something like an 8.5/10 or so. Not quite as high as a 9 or 10, but also slightly ahead of most 8s.\n\nGuacamelee is a game where you play as some Mexican guy to avenge the girl he closet loves after being smashed by the guy who stole her away from the village. You do this by dawning the a mask that has the soul of a former luchador or something. Look, listen, I don't care for story, I like gameplay, visuals, and sounds.\n\nGuacamelee is a beat-em-up influenced by Mexican culture. Simple premise. You, as a luchador, can learn grabs, throws, combos, and other things to help you get though the legions of baddies sent to delay you from getting to the final boss. Not all baddies can be dispatched the same way, though. Some require you to break their shield by performing a special super move (using your meter), some require throws, and some just need some knuckles to the dome. Perfect. Exactly what you'd expect from a beat-em-up.\n\nBut wait, that's not all of the gameplay. There's also some platforming. What? Platforming? Yeah, I know, listen: each of the special moves that you learn influence your character's movement. The TOTALLY NOT SHORYUKEN moves your character up so you can get some vertical movement, there's a belly flop that moves you down to the lowest platform (or breaks blocks that can be broken), and there's a dash that moves you sideways...  Look, listen, basically you're forced to use the moves you learn not only in combat, but also to get around. It's pretty neat.\n\nThere's also this concept of the netherworld or whatever that is merging with the human world, so, sometimes, things change to reflect how they are in the other dimension. This becomes something that you can control and offers some interesting puzzle-platforming like things where you have to pusha da button real fast and stuff to get to another area. The game also rewards you for going back to revisit places and stuff, so that's cool. Always gotta give shout outs to games that reward players for going back and experimenting with newfound powers.\n\nThat's really all there is to the gameplay. It's not terribly difficult to learn, and getting the combos off from the chicken's gym will be pretty satisfying because some of them are lengthy for a beat-em-up. Everyone that plays fighting games knows the satisfaction from getting off a lengthy combo.\n\nWhat else is there to talk about after the gameplay? Oh yeah, visuals. This game is 2d and feels like how Samurai Jack would be if it were a video game. 2d with not too many circles. A lot of things are obviously overdone. It's not a bad thing by any means. That said, I wasn't too impressed with it. Beyond the simple graphics, though, the game has a ton of references to internet stuff in the background. One thing that makes me love games is being silly and this game is totally silly. It doesn't detract from gameplay and isn't in-your-face narration from a character you don't care about, but it's mostly harmless jokes or references to things.\n\nThen there's the music. Ok, look, listen, I'm Mexican and I grew up listening to some pretty ethnic music. Most of it I didn't really care for, but this game took all the good parts of the music I didn't like and smashed it together to form a REALLY REALLY solid soundtrack. Like, holy crap, I actually listen to some of the songs from this game regularly because they sound so nice. You'll get some pretty stereotypical accordion and brass instruments playing, but you'll also, for example, in the jungle area, get some fast drums because fast drums are associated with jungles because reasons.\n\nYeah, but what's not to like about this game? It offers solid beat-em-up gameplay, neat platforming, and even some puzzles. The graphics aren't anything highest-end, but they get the job done and look just dandy anyway. The game doesn't take itself too seriously and this game is just genuinely fun to play. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. I'd highly adivse anyone to pick up this game. Also, this game tends to be on sale pretty often, so there's almost no reason to pick it up if you don't already own it and it's on sale. I personally got mine off a humble bundle and it was great. One thing I would have really liked was if this game had online multiplayer or something, but it doesn't, and that's I guess permissable. It offers local co-op, so I guess that'll have to suffice.","November 4, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Tight controls coupled with colorful, smooth graphics, combing exploration with a brawler combo system in fights make Guacamelee fun to play. The music relies on typical mexican instrumental, brass heavy ensemble music, fitting to the game's style and setting and giving it a certain melancholic feel, sometimes.\n\nWhile the gameplay is fun, the story is rather uninspired, but that's okay. This game is more about the fighting and exploring, than the story. There is a nice little twist, however. There is nothing really new, gameplaywise, either. Also, the exploring doesn't feel quite right, as you are always guided by an arrow on the map where to go next. This is a bit sad, in my opinion, as I love metroidvanias for their laissez-faire gameplay: proceed by exploring.\n\nNevertheless, Guacamelee is a fun game that will give you some hours of gameplay, and some more if you plan on 100%ing it. Getting into the combo system might take a little time (it took for me, but I suck at these things, anyway), but once you got it, it just flows. By now, there's another version out, called http://Super Turbo Championship Edition which you might rather buy, instead of this, as it includes an additional level. But it contains less achievements, if these mean anything to you.\n\nFun, colorful game.

The writing is actually funny and the controls are excellent. I love the mexican style of the game and using the fighting moves to help the platforming is very unique and interesting. The combat is very easy to learn and surprisingly enjoyable.

Thing is - you have to do this VISUALLY in a game where you/the enemies often obscure each-other - this isn't a brililant idea...\n\nOther issues appear in terms of what simply badly tested/lazy scripting/design\n\nExample\nYou can hit an enemy, they'll fly away and then the missile they were about  to throw will appear where they were standing anyway (likely hitting you).  You'll also hear the sound of an enemy's move  DESPITE the fact you should stunned or killed it and thus stopped the move from taking place!?\n\nMaybe you can tolerate those things for a while - I did - but sooner or later you will realise the game is really "working against you".\n\nAND\n\nBefore you buy, ensure you have a joystick/pad with a decent DPad.  Playing this on keyboard is impossible and the a 360 pad left stick isn't precise enough/DPad is a joke.","March 22, 2014","false","11.1"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

What makes the plattforming really interesting is that you can use your wrestling moves you'll learn over the course of the game, to reach your destination. In combat you use as already mentioned wrestling moves to defeat your enemies, apart from that you can throw a damaged enemy, who can be thrown onto other enemies, which is not only efficient, but is very satisfying to do.\nAlthough you are very limited with the throwing when using a keyboard. Because I still don't have a controller I used a keyboard for this game and personally I found that the keyboard controls difficult to get used to, but didn't feel at a disadvantage because of the limited throwing. Apart from that the PC-Port seems fine.\nOverall I didn't see any major flaws with the game, it was just challenging enough, it doesn't have a perfect pacing, but cool Easter eggs, I'll recommend to people, who are looking for a challenging platformer and like to find references/Easter eggs.\nThis game gets a 'G' for Good(A>G>O)","September 6, 2014","true","12.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

The game does well introducing you to new powers and combos on regular basis and gradually increasing your repertoire of moves, which comes to use during both: platforming and combat.\n\nI really liked most of the game, however, there are just moments of huge difficulty spikes. Most of them were due to the level design expecting way too much from the player to solve some very very tedious platforming. A good portion of the frustration was to due to that fact the controls aren't just tuned to such precision platforming required. These issues were few and far between, but enough for many players to rage quite. I hope the developers take note and make alterations for future games to avoid such bumps down the road.\n\nLucky for me, I finish my games no matter what, and I got to play through this otherwise fantastic game.","May 17, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The devs "recommend" a controler and cite some flaw with keyboards as the reasons for any problems with the game's controls, but the lack of responsiveness goes beyond acceptable levels. Thousands of other PC games use the mouse and keyboard for controls and most of them manage reasonably smooth gameplay. There is nothing in this game which is so complicated that it would be impossible to make it work with the keyboard, and yet there are some sections which are boarderline unplayable.\n\nThe problem is that the game is so unresponsive that absolute perfect timing is required to perform even the most basic platforming and combat. This isn't a huge issue when you are fighting one enemy or just hopping up to the next ledge, but there were some sections where I must have spent 20+ minutes trying to complete a jumping puzzle just because the damn Rooster Punch wouldn't work half the time.\n\nIf you already own a controler, the game seems like it would be pretty good.

I enjoyed the majority of the game, honestly. Powers and their uses got incredibly reptitive, there was no use at all for some of the segments (I didn't use a single combo I learned from the Chicken Dojo)., but whatever. The actual combat system is pretty fluid and controls are pretty dead accurate.\n\nThe game was incredibly easy and pretty bland  up until the very end at the Great Altar. â¥â¥â¥â¥ EVERYONE who had anything to do with this segment of the game. I can shrug off the awful memes throughout the entire game, the bland story line, the boring chats with NPCs  inability to show even the slightest bit of attachment or character development, because I care more about the actual game mechanics rather than the story. The boss fight was unenjoyable, spammy and downright easy, but even worse than that was the room where you pit the player against three of the lightning mobs. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥? What made you think this was even remotely a good idea? Normally this wouldn't be a problem because you could just dodge all the enemy attacks, but the rate at which these mobs spammed made it impossible to dodge all of the attacks. Even worse than that, you can't just shut them all down at once to end the horrifble spammy spells because one of them is in another dimension, meaning while you're trying to do just a little bit of crowd control you're immediately stunned by the one in another dimension.\n\nâ¥â¥â¥â¥ you, â¥â¥â¥â¥ your childish "LE MEME TROLOL" throughout the entire game (the secondary antagonist literally says trololol in one scene), â¥â¥â¥â¥ your repetitive â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and â¥â¥â¥â¥ everything about the Great Altar. The only thing i'm going to begin slightly commend here is the art style and the sound track (but even then you managed to â¥â¥â¥â¥ up even the simplest of animations, making the first boss woman's hair restart its flowing animation every time it talks]\n\n0/10, would definitely not buy again.","December 28, 2013","false","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The devs "recommend" a controler and cite some flaw with keyboards as the reasons for any problems with the game's controls, but the lack of responsiveness goes beyond acceptable levels. Thousands of other PC games use the mouse and keyboard for controls and most of them manage reasonably smooth gameplay. There is nothing in this game which is so complicated that it would be impossible to make it work with the keyboard, and yet there are some sections which are boarderline unplayable.\n\nThe problem is that the game is so unresponsive that absolute perfect timing is required to perform even the most basic platforming and combat. This isn't a huge issue when you are fighting one enemy or just hopping up to the next ledge, but there were some sections where I must have spent 20+ minutes trying to complete a jumping puzzle just because the damn Rooster Punch wouldn't work half the time.\n\nIf you already own a controler, the game seems like it would be pretty good.

I enjoyed the majority of the game, honestly. Powers and their uses got incredibly reptitive, there was no use at all for some of the segments (I didn't use a single combo I learned from the Chicken Dojo)., but whatever. The actual combat system is pretty fluid and controls are pretty dead accurate.\n\nThe game was incredibly easy and pretty bland  up until the very end at the Great Altar. â¥â¥â¥â¥ EVERYONE who had anything to do with this segment of the game. I can shrug off the awful memes throughout the entire game, the bland story line, the boring chats with NPCs  inability to show even the slightest bit of attachment or character development, because I care more about the actual game mechanics rather than the story. The boss fight was unenjoyable, spammy and downright easy, but even worse than that was the room where you pit the player against three of the lightning mobs. What the â¥â¥â¥â¥? What made you think this was even remotely a good idea? Normally this wouldn't be a problem because you could just dodge all the enemy attacks, but the rate at which these mobs spammed made it impossible to dodge all of the attacks. Even worse than that, you can't just shut them all down at once to end the horrifble spammy spells because one of them is in another dimension, meaning while you're trying to do just a little bit of crowd control you're immediately stunned by the one in another dimension.\n\nâ¥â¥â¥â¥ you, â¥â¥â¥â¥ your childish "LE MEME TROLOL" throughout the entire game (the secondary antagonist literally says trololol in one scene), â¥â¥â¥â¥ your repetitive â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥t and â¥â¥â¥â¥ everything about the Great Altar.

The only game in my steam library I regret buying.\n\nThe Good: This game is unique in that it is to my knowledge the only 2D Mexican-themed metroidvania beat-em-up in existence. For the first 1/3 of the game, you'll be thinking "wow, I've never played anything quite like this". Almost everything meshes really tightly (more on that "almost" later).\n\nSuperficially, the game is great. I am usually critical of vector/Flash art in indie games (Ed McMillan's style is ugly and unappealing to me) but this game's style is beyond well done and beautifully drawn. It really captures the luchador aesthetic, and it's refreshing to see an indie game with an art style that isn't pixel art (or Ed McMillan's John K-esque gross-out shock-art style). One aspect of this game's art that really impressed me was that it uses its bold and flamboyant colour palette to its advantage: not only do the colours highlight the setting and theme, but bright and vivid contrasts make it very easy to not lose track of your character in the brawls, even in multiplayer. A++ to the art department. Colour me impressed.\n\nThe Bad: This game's music is repetitive and unmemorable. While what there is sounds very authentic and fitting, this is a game whose music will become muted very, very quickly. It feels there should be more, but there justâ¦ isnât.\n\nUnfortunately, beneath its shiny exterior Guacamelee! sports some very flawed game mechanics. Fighting becomes bland quickly, and about 1/3 of the way through things start to get baaad. The game tries to stave off the samey-samey-ness of the combat in ways that ultimately fall flat. Instead of increasing the (very limited) variety of enemies, the game introduces gimmicky limitations to combat that feel broken, frustratingly arbitrary, and poorly thought-out with respect to the way the characters control. They also artificially increase the difficulty to levels that border the âcompletely unfair / broken game designâ line.\n\nA fair challenge tests mastery of game mechanics and rewards player skill. Fair challenges are not a part of the latter 2/3 of this game. In fact, some parts of this game are so stupidly difficult (the insta-death fast-spawning exploding bomb enemies for example) that I almost stopped playing. These parts of the game do not test skill; they test patience (in the worst way) and temper. Failure during these parts is almost entirely out of player control. And I do mean literally out of player control because there is virtually no damage-invincibility or ability to recover from a mistake before your character becomes a pingpong ball. And this will happen, again and again and againâ¦\n\nThe Ugly: Good writing can be to bad game design as is brown sugar to porridge. It can make something bland into something modestly enjoyable. Unfortunately, Guacamelee!âs writing is more like finding a hair in that bowl of porridge. Sure, it might be your own hair, so there's nothing wrong with it per se, but now you really donât want to eat any more of that porridge because ewww.\n\nOutside of combat, this gameâs story is overrun by a certain style of humour. Take a long sigh out of your nose. That's really the best summary. There are a few actual jokes (setup/payoff) that did make me laugh. Unfortunately they are buried in a sea of dated and cringe-worthy internet memes (???), "references" to movies, and "call-outs" to popular videogames. Yes, that last sentence did indeed say âmemes", as in "injokes" with no purpose or amusing qualities beyond "hey I know what that is lololol".\n\nFinally, the ending is an absolute joke.\n\nAnd when I say the ending is an absolute joke, I mean both that it is an out-of-nowhere, context-blind, poorly-integrated reference, and also that it is abrupt, stupid, and ultimately unsatisfying.\n\nConclusion: I really wanted to recommend this game. After playing, I felt let-down and disappointed. Give it a pass.","September 23, 2014","false","5.6"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The game does well introducing you to new powers and combos on regular basis and gradually increasing your repertoire of moves, which comes to use during both: platforming and combat.\n\nI really liked most of the game, however, there are just moments of huge difficulty spikes. Most of them were due to the level design expecting way too much from the player to solve some very very tedious platforming. A good portion of the frustration was to due to that fact the controls aren't just tuned to such precision platforming required. These issues were few and far between, but enough for many players to rage quite. I hope the developers take note and make alterations for future games to avoid such bumps down the road.\n\nLucky for me, I finish my games no matter what, and I got to play through this otherwise fantastic game.","May 17, 2014","true","12.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

BUT the controls are way too glitchy. The first combo move you learn in the game is Rooster Uppercut which is performed by pressing up and D at the same time. The problem is, the vast majority of the time you press up and D (and I'm not exageratting when I say VAST MAJORITY. It means at least 95% of the time), your character will either jump (up) or do a normal attack (d)\n\nThis wasn't much of a problem (yes it was) until I learned another combo move, this one is activated with just D\n\nNow, whenever I try to Rooster Uppercut, I'll end up doing the new move instead, which takes away a stamina block. Meaning every second time I try to Uppercut, I have to spend a couple seconds standing around doing nothing waiting for my stamina to refill itself. A couple seconds might not sound like much, but it adds up overtime.\n\n\nIncluded is a YouTube clip I recorded of this. A note: I was trying to get past this part where you need to jump into an Uppercut into a portal and then walljump a couple more times for almost 15 minutes before I begun recording. And after I ended the recording, I tried for another 45 minutes without ever getting to the other side.\n\nYes. That's an entire hour of me jumping up and down trying to perform a combo move that was as simple as pushing two buttons.\n\nAnd before all the potential angry comments come flooding in, I KNOW ABOUT MICROSOFT GHOSTING.

THAT IS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSZ5Ce7BPE4\n\nUPDATE: Yes, I am aware now that you can simply jump into the walljump without Uppercutting, but that still doesn't mean there isn't a frustrating bug that prevents you from using your moves","August 7, 2014","false","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

Maybe it's the prevalence of save points. Maybe it's the fighting system that rewards variety and reflexes instead of perfect aim and conservation of ammo. Maybe it's just the amazing luchadores. I have never played a game in a world of luchadores, and I'm not sure one has ever been made before this.\n\nThere's a well-told story in a unique setting, an engaging combat system, a high level of difficulty, and a couple hundred in-jokes. There are also tons of secrets to find, dozens of challenges to beat, and a bevy of achievements with varying levels of impossibility. All told, this is a great game for fighter/platformers with a good deal of reward for those who like exploring.","January 31, 2014","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Also i HIGHLY recommend you play this game with a controller, because with keyboard and mouse you will get a though time.\n\nStory is very typical, hero saving the day, rescuing is girl and all bad guys are defeated, but is still fun to play, also this game have a really good jokes between the main charterer and is "mentor".\n\nThe combat system is the highlight for me, very good very nice combos, also during the story mode you will get new techniques and ability to help during your journey. Best of all, if you have friend in your house at any time he can join you - yes because this game doesn't support online COOP - and help you on your journey.\n\nBoth OST and scenarios are great, the OST really fits the gameplay in general, Mexican and stuff and scenarios are full of colors and well design. About the replay value on this game, you have two choices: after beating the final boss you can collect the rest of the mask and do the side quests witch are few, about 5/6 or you can try the hard mode, witch can be a good challenge.\n\nWell that it, with no doubt Guacamelee deserve every cents that you spend on it. Totally recommend it.\n\n~ 9/10","December 28, 2013","true","7.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Turns out I was right to begin with. The first level is nothing but running back and forth, holding stupid conversations with the locals and jumping up and down while punching some barrels. WOW. Mario has been there and done that already. Then all of a sudden you are dead and there are no clues as to what that giant green sparkly thing in the floor is and can I go back and do something with it? OOPS, no I guess not!  Or why am I being attacked by skeletal Mexicans in ponchos and sombreros and why, why, WHY?\n\nI probably have less than an hour in this game and was hoping for more but I found the story to be flat and without real substance and the gameplay to be less than fun (for me, anyway). The colours are nice, and the game appears to be professionally developed but that being said I am glad I only paid $3.00 for this game.

The music is great. The story is great. Why not everyone love it!?\n\nMay be this is just me, but I really hate the way you map default controller button, it's the most hardest thing to mastering.\n\n- Dashing can be done by both {RS} and {LS}+{LT} ... why?!?\n- Special move require {B}+{LS} (or sometime, just {B}), this is very troublesome, since {LS} is analog, most of the time the game interprete my action wrong.\n- Some time you will need to hold down {Y} and then press {A}, such position is not easy to perform at all. I think its too complicate rather than challenging and fun.\n\nI also think some achievements are too hard to be done under the game design. For example, Heroine-ism: require Juanita (standard female character) to win final boss fight. This is almost impossible since she can not throw object too far (main attack), and object that she can throw just appear randomly everywhere on the screen, not optimise to appear near the boss. (I know it meant to be hard, but why too hard?) After all, the most importance point is, this achievement state that we need to use a female character to win the game, there are plenty of female characters, but why limited it to be completed with only this standard-lowest-tier female character!?\n\nMy conclusion is:\n- For perfectionism who want to complete all achievements, just skip this game, it will made you screaming in F*** word A LOT.\n- For non-expert platform gamer, just skip, its too hard to completed.","September 10, 2015","false","31.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","3"

Beware if you're colorblind.\n\nI had a marathon couple of days playing this game; I enjoyed it immensely though I'm not the best platformer or combo-maker. The checkpoint locations were pretty forgiving and the gradually ratched up challenges made the game more fun than frustrating. Until the boss fight against Calaca, but for a very particular reason.\n\nThe Calaca boss fight mechanics rely entirely on twitch reactions to colored shields with zero room for error. For my particular kind of color blindness, I can only reliably detect the blue shield and the red shield. The green or yellow shields look identical; it's a 50/50 chance if I do the correct move to score a hit.

Beware if you're colorblind.\n\nI had a marathon couple of days playing this game; I enjoyed it immensely though I'm not the best platformer or combo-maker. The checkpoint locations were pretty forgiving and the gradually ratched up challenges made the game more fun than frustrating. Until the boss fight against Calaca, but for a very particular reason.\n\nThe Calaca boss fight mechanics rely entirely on twitch reactions to colored shields with zero room for error. For my particular kind of color blindness, I can only reliably detect the blue shield and the red shield. The green or yellow shields look identical; it's a 50/50 chance if I do the correct move to score a hit.

Platforming sequences became rather annoying, the once great combat became a complete mess:\nAs you unlock several abilities, enemies get shields which you can only destroy by using the corresponding ability. Okay, that's not a problem, but when rooms start to get filled with those enemies, all wielding different shields, then it is. Especially when the dimension-switching mechanic is involved. Good luck with that.\nI can see why people like this game, but the gameplay just feels too clunky and unpolished for me to enjoy.

There are parts that mirror the GBA Metroids really well: Flying across multiple screens for secrets, and hidden 'morph ball' tunnels, to name a few. The nostalgia is incredible, but it is very much its own game.\n\nThe combat system feels pretty decent: It's not anything groundbreaking, but it never gets in the way, and killing crap always feels nice. Throwing enemies was a neat (And fitting) addition, though. With enough enemies on the screen, you can just keep throwing them around, racking up massive combos and killing them without getting touched.\n\nThe secrets scattered throughout the game (As any Metroidvania should have) are satisfying to find and oh so numerous. What I really enjoyed, though, was rather than having 'energy tanks' that instantly increase your health cap, you have 'heart pieces,' which are instantly reminscent of Zelda. Some areas for secret items get notoriously difficult, and the platforming skills it asks for have been compared to Super Meat Boy (Which, personally, I love a good difficult platformer). The main game, though, is a nice difficulty to get through: It isn't a stroll through the park, but it's not too tricky. And it's still rewarding to finish.\n\nThe game is also absolutely filled with very-unsubtle references to... Everything. Classic games, internet icons, memes, you name it. The lack of subtlety makes it pretty hilarious. And lastly- This is a game I will never get tired of looking at. It's so gorgeous.\n\nBuy this game.

However, the game shines in everything that it does right. You unlock moves and abilities during the adventure, each neatly fitting in with what you already know. The map makes it clear where you need to go (so it's a bit less exploration), but leaves you enough to encounter. Combat is tight and interesting: you gradually learn how to play without it ever feeling a chore to do.\n\nThe Mexican theme is nice and (strangely enough) mix well with winks to various games like Zelda (I AM ERROR), Mario (the first boss) and of course metroid (the statues). I probably missed quite some.\nAlso note that like Zelda, there are 2 overlapping worlds (life and death), which add to your arsenal of challenges to overcome.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Bosses are great, the saving and buying is great and there's plenty of chests to explore to upgrade your cash or your life or power-up meter. Enemies can be tough but never frustrating and the design makes use of all the powers you have.\n\nAny minusses? Hard to say. I hear keyboard/mice controls aren't that good, but I used a controller, so can't say. And perhaps there was a bit too much storyline at the start, but that's certainly not an issue.\n\nAll in all: a great recommendation.\n\n:-)","November 8, 2014","true","7.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It relies too much on the Meatboy formula and not nearly enough on the Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and Metroid that it claims.  Knucklebusting puzzles, difficult as hell bosses and almost abusive level design feature prominently, slathered with a veneer of reddit humor.  I wish I could recommend this game, I do, but it's not the metroidvania that I'm looking for and hopefully this review will save someone else.\nThat said, if you like that kind of thing, this is the platforming internet-stupid humor luchador game for you.","July 4, 2014","false","3.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Combat is fluid and fun, and although simple at first, it can be comboed into something intricate. I played on the keyboard, but if you have a controller it will be a more enjoyable experience as the analogue sticks will allow you easier platforming and better angles when performing grappling moves.\n\nProbably my favorite part of the game was the art direction and music. The environments and characters are beautiful and just ooze style, and the Spanish theme and music helps really solidify the experience as memorable and unique.\n\nThe game can be beaten 100% in less than 10 hours, and there isn't much replayability other than hard mode. Still a very solid game though, and one that should be experienced.","July 3, 2014","true","12.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The developers, (that apparently have â¥â¥â¥â¥ for brains) want you to play this game with a contoller. If you play with a keyboard, youÂ´re pretty much â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. The game requires you to do special moves that are a combination of 2 keys, move and special, but hereÂ´s how it  works: You first press the move key AND THEN the special. If you press the 2 keys, nothing will happen. You MUST press the movement  key first AND THEN you press the "Special" key to do the Special move. This can get really frustrating in a fight, since you expect your movements to be quick, but performing them is just frustrating and the combat system is extremely flawed.\n\nThen you have the platforming. It is TERRIBLE! The game tries too much to be Mega Man, but the difference is that in Megaman, the controls were tight and precise. In Guacamelee, the controls are slidy and most of the times you will fall off the platform.\n\nDevelopers, how about you fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game AND take into consideration the players that DO NOT have a controller\n\n0/10\nDo not buy this","April 2, 2014","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Also, the platforming gets hard quick. You need to be good at jumping to complete this game.

After two hours of playing my arm was in physical pain. Fights become boring and tedious fast and I eventually found myself skipping fights just so I could get to the next area. The exploration was done pretty well, but it felt a bit light compared to other exploration/metroidvania games. A little too linear and railroady. Also, devs, if you're reading this, your plot was bad and your reference-based humour soured me on the game about as fast as your bad combat did. We get it, you played a video game before.

Whilst this may sound like a mouthful and a muddled game, what we get is a fun, cool and decently long adventure romp, that is sure to please many people around.\n\nJuan is a farmer who, when his love is kidnapped, takes on the mask and becomes a Luchador! Thus he begins his quest to save his love, smash Chozo statues and kick as many skeletons, cacti and bosses to faces Cacala, a mysterious soul who has the form of a skeleton. Along the way Juan unlocks powers from the Chozo statues and some bosses. What is very cool about this game is that many of the powers translate to combat (which, as mentioned, is in a beat'em-up style), such as the [Rooster] Uppercut not only sending the enemies into the air but also giving up a lift mid-jump. Or the Dashing [Derp Derp] helping you kick multiple enemies whilst going a little bit further horizontally.\n\nYou can also change dimensions to reveal platforms or passages, or turn into a chicken to go into smaller passages. These are used for some challenging, but fun, platforming and puzzle sections.\n\nThe soundtrack is also great, mixing Latin music with some techno. And almost all songs have alternate versions, for the Light and Dark dimensions. These transition well, and the soundtrack feels relative the the setting and tone of the game, Mexican, Upbeat and overall fun.\n\nI finished the game at around 65%-70% completion, so I still had a lot to collect, and I played the game for a good 6 hours (it says 12 as my file deleted... grumble grumble...). This percentage is made up of Health Containers, Stamina Blocks and Orbs (hard-to-find objects for the dedicated). I finished Cacala's final form with difficulty, but not to a extent where it felt cheap or annoying.\n\nGuacamelee! is a fun game, with a good soundtrack and an easy 6 hours of gameplay. Looking for a good game to spend some time with over the weekend? Grab Guacamelee! (and the soundtrack) and you won't regret it.","July 7, 2014","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't know why people keep putting this in games.\n- When you die in a platformer, it should be because you misplayed and did something wrong because you aren't used to the game mechanics, not because you can't jump between walls in different dimension or that you don't have lightning reactions.\n- Not having fall damage is understandable and can be good, but if you accidentally fall down to the start of the level, you shouldn't have to do it all over again.\n- It's okay to have a final boss fight that is nearly  impossible to win, that will have you tearing out your hair in rage and will take you up towards 50 deaths before you even figure out how you are supposed to beat it, but then at least make the save after the cutscene so you don't have to sit through it every f***ing time.\n\nAll in all, it's not a great game. I want to like this game, I really do, because of it's humor and other upsides but a lot of the cons just really ruined it for me.

The developers, (that apparently have â¥â¥â¥â¥ for brains) want you to play this game with a contoller. If you play with a keyboard, youÂ´re pretty much â¥â¥â¥â¥ed. The game requires you to do special moves that are a combination of 2 keys, move and special, but hereÂ´s how it  works: You first press the move key AND THEN the special. If you press the 2 keys, nothing will happen. You MUST press the movement  key first AND THEN you press the "Special" key to do the Special move. This can get really frustrating in a fight, since you expect your movements to be quick, but performing them is just frustrating and the combat system is extremely flawed.\n\nThen you have the platforming. It is TERRIBLE! The game tries too much to be Mega Man, but the difference is that in Megaman, the controls were tight and precise. In Guacamelee, the controls are slidy and most of the times you will fall off the platform.\n\nDevelopers, how about you fix your â¥â¥â¥â¥ing game AND take into consideration the players that DO NOT have a controller\n\n0/10\nDo not buy this","April 2, 2014","false","5.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The platforming aspects, while at times challenging and requiring creativity, are not completely unforgiving and don't require split-second precision (i.e., Super Meatboy).  There are enough side quests to add some flavor, without turning the game into a massive collection of fetch quests.  And there's no need for constant backtracking and revisiting old areas (although you do get skills that unlock certain secret/optional rooms, those entrances are clearly marked on your map so you don't have to waste hours checking every wall in every previous area for a secret).\n\nBottom line, it's just plain fun.","December 27, 2013","true","19.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a very unique dual world warping mechanic that is used throughout the entire game, is very intuitive, and meshes well with the other game mechanics and storyline. Unfortunately, it deceives you with one game and replaces it with another. The sound, art style, combat mechanics, and metroidvania ability mechanics are all very well designed, but it also has many flaws. Most important flaw is the use of color-coded puzzles and combat mechanics without a colorblind-friendly mode. This makes the already difficult combat a dice roll for the colorblind.\n\n\nThe game starts off as a very good beat-em-up metroidvania, but at the end it becomes an extremely hard (super meat boy level hard, no exageration) platformer with a few combat sequences in between. Though a lot of the very hard platforming is optional, they are very unforgiving and require godly levels of coordination with very very sparse checkpoints.\n\nThe combat at later stages also border on unfair levels of difficulty. Enemies can exist in another world that you can't hurt, but they can hurt you. A lot of later enemies also have unblockable attacks, so you end up with half the screen full of enemies you can't hit or block.  You have to swap worlds to deal with these two types of world enemies, and they can overlap each other and not hit or shoot one another.\n\nGetting hit is also a major punishment as you are knocked out for a fair amount of time. The worse thing, though is being knocked far away from your enemies. Being a melee only character, not being able to get close to enemies who are charging for unblockable attacks is bad. The hit stun is way too long and punishing when there are large numbers of these enemies. Although it's rare, it is also possible to be stunlocked in some arenas that have a large number of enemies.\n\nThe DLC shows you just what the developers had in mind for this game as they are all platforming based with little to no combat. This is a puzzle platformer disguised as a combat metroidvania.\n\nIf you like supermeatboy type platformers with very difficult combat, then this game is for you. For anyone like me expecting metroid or castlevania style gameplay, you probably won't find this game very fun after the first half.","April 2, 2014","false","13.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Does it want to be a beat'em up ? Maybe, the combat and combo system is so fun, easily the best part of the game. Does it want to be a metroidvania exploration game ? Meh, theres little to no exploration other than for heart pieces or stamina chunk's. The game also has These chozoo statues of which you get powers by destroying them, however the games story leads you to every single one of them, which pretty much takes away the metroidvania style.\n\nDoes it want to be a cheap old NES platformer ? Ya know, those old â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ games that are just horribly designed, or just cheap in general. Well it sure â¥â¥â¥â¥ing feels like so. This game will â¥â¥â¥â¥ing crush your balls if you're not prepared for the difficulty spike that comes in the mid game. It's not impossible but the game decides to completely throw out everything good it had going for and put in â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ gimmicky platforming which needs PERFECT input, and oh boy, if you're using a keyboard, let's just say, YOUR HANDS WILL HURT.\n\nThe living/dead world mechanic is POINTLESS, it's just thrown in to the story midway into the game. While it is a good concept, it's execution is horrible. Some of the later platforming parts  uses this mechanic to no â¥â¥â¥â¥ing end, it requires you to change between the worlds to make other platforms appear, while some dissapears. The problem is the time the game gives you to switch is 1 second, and with some of the input lag the game has, it just makes it even more frustrating.\n\nThe combat as i mentioned is great ! But again, the game decides to throw it away late game with these coloured shields. These shields can only be destroyed by the different coloured moves you get when progressing through the story. These moves are cool yes, but 70% of the game they're not used for combat, but for PLATFORMING, making the platforming EVEN MORE frustrating forcing you to combo these moves to reach different platforms, and with the mentioned input lag and the horrible inputs required to do these moves, just makes the platforming parts unbearable. I often found myself changing the button inputs JUST for the platforming parts and then switch the inputs again.\n\nLet's go back to the shields, the shields just ruins the combo flow of the combat. The shields are just added onto enemies for ''difficulty'' this is not the way to make the game harder, this is cheap difficulty, the worst type of patting a game. And when they decide to add shields to BOSSES, that's just the â¥â¥â¥â¥ing worst, the bosses are always moving making it almost â¥â¥â¥â¥ing impossible, especially with the last boss. Hope to god when you're fighting against Javier that he doesnt â¥â¥â¥â¥ing put on the yellow shield.\n\nThe visuals are fantastic while simplistic at times, it really works, it just has this charm. The music, i didn't care for, standard Mexican thingies (Idunno). The steam workshop implementation works and is really fun when people make fun costumes. Not to mention that the game costs 12Â£ when all you get is 3-4 hours of gameplay with little to no replayability other than collecting the remaining heart pieces and stamina chunks or the mask orbs, which i swear to god, â¥â¥â¥â¥ the tule tree challenge.\n\nGuacamelee is an imaginative title with lots of great ideas, however the developer decided to throw out these ideas with other ideas that absolutely should not have replaced the other ideas. If the developers decide to make a sequel i hope they will focus more on the fantastic combat and less on the not so good platforming. The game IS called GuacaMELEE afterall.\n\n2 out 5","June 25, 2014","false","7.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Guacamelee is presented in a colourful way and with a very cheery and memorable soundtrack. The fighting system is enjoyable and gets expanded over time with a ton of unlockable moves.  On top of that, it's also possible to earn outfits and upgrades.  To add to the charm, Guacamelee is littered with game referenches to games like Grim Fandango, Super Mario Bros, Castle Crashers and Viva Pinata.\n\nNext point of discussion: the puzzles. There are a ton of little side puzzles that are harder than the main-path, but offer small rewards like extra coins for upgrades. These puzzles range from fairly easy to mindbending hard. Sometimes puzzles require you to remember a set of moves to use to get to the end-goal, while other times figuring out which moves you actually need to get the reward is an excersize on itself. To make the puzzles even harder, switching between the living world and the dead world is often necessary to reveal / hide platforms and obstacles. Often you will find yourself thinking about how you will have to tackle a puzzle and learning the muscle memory of the moves before you're actually able to pull it off.\n\nThe story is fairly straightforward, but because of the small cast of interesting characters and the funny written dialog it feels fun to follow the story. Besides the mainstory, there are always a few little sidemissions to keep things interesting. The aforementioned puzzles are a side-mission on itself.\n\nFinally, the bossfights require you to use all the skills you previously learned in the game and are often pretty hard, but you never feel like you will need to google for a solution.\n","November 25, 2013","true","9.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

When fighting, moves can be utilized in concert to air juggle, to maintain long combos, and to throw enemies at one another, but there really isn't any incentive to use these advanced techniques or even to vary attacks at all.\n\nThen there's the Metroid structure, which is too condensedâtoo simple, too transparent, and too predictable.  You're driven along a very narrow path of progression, and along the way you come across obvious markers for places you'll be able to enter once you receive the proper abilities.  It's just by-the-numbers, and being teased by these blocked-off side paths feels rote when it should feel exciting.  All of the game's puzzle-platforming challenges are characterized by the same workmanlike effort, too.\n\nAll of this would be disappointing although perhaps not damning, but Guacamelee wears this constant, unfading caca-eating grin that the writing absolutely does not earn.  Many games love to wink at the player, but this one does it while standing over you in an arrogant pose.  The most egregious example I've come across was a hidden QR code.  I posted a screenshot complaining about how presumptuous and frustrating its inclusion is since I don't own any device capable of reading it, and a friend told me that it says "Congratulations! You successfully identified and scanned a QR code! Great job!"  That's it.  That's the kind of reward you can expect for making the effort to discover secret paths.\n\nI wish this game was a person so I could punch it in its stupid face.","January 7, 2014","false","2.2"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","17","37","0","7"

Nice metroidvania with a Luchador twist!\n\nThe combat is interesting. It has a strong focus on "grappling" with enemies, giving you the ability to throw them around and into other enemies. Combos are a huge part of the game and keeping them going with chaining throws, slams, punches, kicks and headbutts can be very rewarding.\n\nThe platforming elements are equally rewarding and require you to use an equally large selection of moves to complete some of the puzzles.\n\nThe game has a nice learning curve. You start off with only a few moves and pick up many more as the the game goes along.  Later on some of the challenges can be a bit frustrating when the controls don't respond as fast as you'd like, but it's nothing that can't be overcome.\n\nThe map is free roaming, but certain areas are blocked off until you unlock the moves required to access them. In addition going back to areas you've already played through can reveal new secrets to be accessed with your new techniques.\n\nThe graphics are unique. They look like they could be vector art, the lines are clean and colors sparse but vivid. The many costumes availible keep the variety going. There's also many ireferences to nternet meme and other indie games that are interesting to find.\n\nGameplay: 7.5 Good challenge. Large Variety of moves. Responsiveness can be frustrating durring difficult puzzles.\nGraphics: 9 Characters with a clean vivid look. Large selection of costumes.

Jumping back and forth between the worlds of the living and the dead makes the game feel ever larger giving you a chance to explore every inch of the gameâs world searching for hidden treasures or odes to older games that weighed in as inspiration. Couch co-op allows you and a friend to go slamming enemies around the rooms and taking out bosses.

The story knows what it wants to do and has fun doing it.\n- Co-op integrates seamlessly if you have two controllers.\n- Very appropriate difficulty.  There were a few frustrating challenges, but those were all optional.\n\nCons\n- None.  Seriously, this game is a gem.","November 22, 2014","true","25.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A huge platformer fan, Guacamelee! was a treat, bringing me back to the days of classics like Metroid and Castlevania (I was not expecting a 'Metroidvania' game when I started, so I was pleasantly surprised that it was *and* it was well-executed).  Guacamelee! is challenging, yet provides enough breadth that newer platformer fans will enjoy the game (though it might be tough for the brand-new), while the more hardened among us will still find a challenge (the game is very forgiving in death, its biggest 'flaw' if you're looking for that style of intensity--nonetheless there are pretty tricky areas, side-quests and Inferno challenges that left me feeling pretty badass when I got through).  The art style is quirky and unique, and numerous 'hidden' video-game references are peppered throughout, which adds a fun touch of nostalgia (the Chozo statues were perhaps a bit heavy-handed, but I won't lie, I smiled!).  I did find myself losing track of where to go next in the game, though that may have been a consequence of having to play over multiple play sessions for lack of time (as well as a serious case of "oh, look, squirrel!").\n\nOverall I would recommend this game if you are platforming fan.  Don't expect the hardest platformer ever (especially the core game), but there should be more than enough for a fun experience and no regrets!\n\nNice work, Drink Box. :D","June 2, 2014","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If that doesn't appeal to you immediately, there is probably something horribly wrong with you.\n\nIn all seriousness, this is a very well-executed game. The progression flows well, controls very nicely with a gamepad (the keyboard is so-so, but this is true for most brawlers and platformers in my experience), combat is extremely varied once you unlock a few abilities, and frankly it's a fun romp through the main storyline.\n\nThe only complaint I'll lodge is the game's humor. Sometimes it's spot-on and genuinely funny. Most of the time, it's just pop culture references that get old after a while. This isn't a big deal and doesn't distract much from the game as a whole.\n\nIf you're a fan of adventure, platformer, or Metroid-like games then you owe it to yourself to pick this one up.

It's nearing 100. Yes I'm fully aware that this is actually quite small in comparison to other libraries, but I have enough that I don't want to buy any more right now. So what I've decided to do is complete every single game to the extent that I see fit, then uninstall it and shunt it into a deep, dark category in my library. This game is in said category. So far, it's the only one for which I've thought "I want to play this again."\n\nThis game is awesome. You're a luchador whose movement is heavily influenced by his special moves. The game has such a great, unique style that is very refreshing. I guarantee you that, after you devour the game, you will want to play again. It's just that good!\n\nThe atmosphere is excellent. Each area, in both spiritual planes, is portrayed so excellently. The music is intense, fits perfectly, and is composed very well. The game has an interesting take on the Mexican view of the world of the dead, and does it in a very respectful way. Like, holy crap. This game does an excellent job at making you feel like you're in the game.\n\nThe characters are good, even though there aren't that many. Each of the four bosses you fight are drawn out very well, and that one goat is quite funny. Indeed, this game is so incredibly light-hearted, with lots of references in Santa Luchita, and many instances where you will end up laughing out loud.\n\nThere's very little story to speak of, but that's not the main focus of this game.\n\nFinally, the combat system is absolutely perfect. It is well executed, and the progression of your abilities is just right. Your fighting moves augment your movement (and hence your combat), and the developers have taken direct advantage of this fact to expand this game as far as they can. You wouldn't expect much platforming in a game primarily about fighting, but it's in here, and it's good.\n\nBuy this game.","December 16, 2014","true","37.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
