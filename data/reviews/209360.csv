I like the upgrades in this one and has a bit of a RPG feel to it being you can upgrade your character and his weapons and there are quests and objectives  . It gets uber crazy the longer you last so keep searching and run as much as you can lol\n\nI say the price is right on this one and its a must buy if its in a bundle ;) So give this one a go !! BRAINS !! ops did i say that :P","October 20, 2015","true","3.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

There are just better ones in this genre. No multiplayer, which would make this game awesome. So overall good, but missed the mark.\n\nWorth a few bucks.

There is mild humor, well designed zombies with their own "personality" and the weapons feel like they matter (though the SMG is pretty pointless).  There could be a bit more description added when it talks about Chaos Time and what some of the challenges mean but it doesn't prevent progress and trial and error eventually helps you learn what it all means.","July 8, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game it's a really fun experience, not with online multiplayer, which it is a letdown, but still really pleasant with a good gameplay and nice mechanics. Maybe too much repetitive sometimes, but a local coop fix that. Not a must have but it's low price it's a encouragement for a fun time.","February 13, 2014","true","14.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Scorepocalypse continues the arcade action of the series and includes four different playfields, a homebase, oodles of customizable weapons, and a wide variety of single and multiple map quests and challenges.  My only major gripe with the series continues here, in that this game needs to have online co-op!  The local co-op is nice, but online is often a much easier option for Steam platform users.  The game, like it's predecessor also supports the Steam Overlay, widescreen modes, as well as controller support.  Simply said, this is a must have game for almost any PC gamer.","April 23, 2012","true","5.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Only in this one, its time to go for SCOREPOCALYPSE!!! In case you dont know what "SCOREPOCALYPSE!!!" means, according by me studieing it, it means well YOU KNOW WHAT IM LIEING SO I DONT KNOW! XD Anyway, in this one, you must try to get the biggest score while at the same time, the party from the original are making there way to "Da air base", YOU, are doing "Scorepocalypse". "Dev medal" achievements were REALLY hard, especially the mall dev medal. Very challenging game, with a lot of fun guns, zombies, missions, and achievements. Great work on this sequel guys!

The good part abut this game is that you can have a 4 player local co-op game running. The bad part about this game is that it has only 4 maps, plus you will need gamepads to do a co-op game. There is a leveling system where you put stat points into either Attack, Defence, Speed, and Health, plus crafting weapons to get better weapons. (not that big of a deal to craft weapons to get stronger). 7/10","February 24, 2013","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
