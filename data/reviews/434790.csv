It's not inherently bad, yet it's not all that great. Allow me to explain, dear reader.\n\nPlanet 1138 is an Action/RTS game where you control a "Command Buggy" that has rockets, a machine gun, a shield and nitrous that captures bases which then produce units and pushes them down the lane towards the enemy base. As the game goes on and you complete levels, you will unlock new upgrades which passively upgrade your buggy to deal more damage or to upgrade the turrets on support bases. Honestly, the game is more of a MOBA like Warshift than it is an Action/RTS like Battlezone or Uprising: Join or Die. There are a ton of levels to play through with super challenging AI and even multiplayer. Overall, the gameplay is solid enough, it works and it is competent.\n\nThis all sounds great right? Well, it's more meh than it is good. The core concept is amazing, I'm a huge fan of Uprising: Join or Die and I'd kill to have another one or at the very least an Action/RTS that operates in the same style but that is aside the point. Planet 1138 is meh because of presentation and the cheating nature of the AI opponent.\n\nPresentation you say? Well yes, unfortunately all the menus in the game look as though they were made in paint.NET and the game has the barest of aesthetic qualities. While this isn't bad in itself, it makes the game look more like a first time flash game than an actual 9.99 Steam game. While this isn't meant to be a knock on the dev but I'd highly recommend they hire on someone who can redesign the menus or the interface in general. I truly believe that presentation is one of the most important qualities when designing anything and I'd love to see some more work put into the game's aesthetics.\n\nMy second problem? The AI is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Somehow he can lock on to you and shoot at you from every angle while you can only autoaim at opponent's directly in front of you. The AI isn't foolish enough to sit still and let you shoot at him, he will drive circles around you and pummel you into the dirt. It causes the AI to be super aggressive while the player has to fight defensively by standing next to bases and such. This may just be me being a noob but it seems like the AI has a naturally unfair advantage in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, not a bad game, not a great game. With some work, I can see this being an amazing first attempt by the studio. For now, I can't recommend it at 9.99. I would at 5.99 though. Seems more reasonable of a price.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVlrBH958pQ","February 20","true","4.4"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","17","17","5","3"

In the second mission you'll be capturing base after base while trying to defend your territory.\nIn the third mission you're battling over a whole battlefield of tanks vs tanks.\nPlanet 1138 is a great mix of action of tactics, and basically a lot of fun.","February 20","true","3.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

No lagging here, action all the way.\nThumbs up for this.","February 20","true","6.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But that's it.\nIt is far from finished.\n\nPro: Rare type of game that merges shooters with rts .\nLooks very mod-able\n\nCons: Lots of invisible textures - when you go near a ramp you might get stuck or just get randomly thrown up.\nThe AI is very basic. You can just sit in the back of a base and the enemy AI will just ignore you.\nThe shooting is.. weird. The AI controlled Buggy can shoot while running. You can only shoot straight(minigun).\nThe menu and overall game controls are definetly made and kept for a controller. The only transition are the keybindings.\nVery few upgrades, that don't look like they might impact the game a lot even in the late levels. (didn't reach there tho)\n\nEven if this game would be better, 10$? really? 2$ might be too much. 0.5$ maximum for it's current state.\n\nDo not purchase this, some alpha state games are more complete than this. Even EA games have more content.","February 18","false","0.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","10"

Collision detection messes up a lot and the AI is really bad.  It's also incredibly basic.  Maybe if they spent some time fleshing it out it would be ok but right now it feels more like a phone game.\n\nGo play Battlezone instead.  I think that game came out in the 90s haha","February 18","false","3.2"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","9","18","2","1"

Tactics just really aren't there.\nTerrain does not offer cover...so there isn't much in the way of strategy.  You pick up ammo and repair like some sort of old racing game.  Unless your opponent has really terrible aim you essentially are just trading blows....\n\nIf the player vehicle had a drone mode I doubt you could ever perform better than it....\n\nI do not recommend this game.","March 30","false","0.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

This game reminds me a lot of the classic PC game Battlezone which I loved. It was recently announced that they are remaking the original Battlezone for Steam with an expected release date of Spring 2016 and that game might beat it, but for now it's my favorite new game on Steam.\n\nLink to Battlezone game:\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/301650/","February 18","true","25.0"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","10","24","2","0"

Ive been playing it a ton since I found it on steam. I love the way its a totally even battle so who ever plays better will win (allmost no luck involved) its like live action chess with cool fighting. I find myself thinking of strategies for all the different maps (n theres alot of them) whenever im not playing it. you know a game is good when you think about when your not playing it. lol ive played alot and I dont think any battle ever even played out the same way. I highly recommend this game! if you like strategy try it, you Will like it.","February 18","true","12.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","7","18","2","0"

I enjoyed playing this game for a good while. I like how each stage gets more challenging and think its pretty good considering the price. I ran into a few glitches but overall it worked fairly good to where I still enjoyed it.
