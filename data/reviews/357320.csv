I will do what I usually do and describe my experience within the game.\n\nIve been playing this during the pre-alpha stages (from the demo up) and I have seen the placeholder weapons go to good looking pieces of art. But more importantly I have felt the joy and challange of trying to get enough money to buy the next safe house, and upgrade my gear. After 3 hours of constant heisting (suprisingly for an Early Access this was very stable) I neared my goal of a cabin in the woods.... Then the developer comes on for some "testing"... Whose base does he use for the testing... thats right mine... I come back with next to no money left I cry for a bit and ask the developer if he has been the one raiding my base...\n\nTurns out he had been... Armed with this knowledge (and thats about it seeing as I couldnt afford the supressed pistol I begin a series of raids on the developers base... This goes really well I got up to almost $28 000, then he added land mines to the game... Being blissfully unaware I have probably died too many times to those damn land mines and I slowly gave all the money I stole back... after 10 hours of playing how much money do I have? Dont ask!\n\n... $86....\n\nNot 86K\n\n$86...\n\nI Love this game's idea and potential, I also love it at the moment it is a Early Access in the spirit of Prison Architect or Kerbal Space Program, where the game is rapidly developed and is most definatly playable (even though both of those had a team and the Developer here is working alone)\n\nMy only problem with him is that in our many discussions he has not yet figured out the point of DLCs... he has this weird idea that they are meant to be expansions on the finished game... Not little things that make the game playable or that provide one or two features... This focus on a good game over income and on customer satisfaction make me think this guy is one of the good ones.\n\nI hope you can give this game a go an please if I rob your base... its cause im poor, I have a family to feed.\n\n10/10\nSince you have no proof of my failed base raids.","April 29, 2015","true","147.1"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","37","47","12","5"

Its like clash of clans in a way. You earn money by doing so then you can purchase different safe houses, Weapons, Security and equiptment. This game has huge replayability and the sweet feeling of seeing your money go up from 0 to rich. The community is great with the devs who are very nice and reply within 1 minute.\nOverall this game has huge potential and is very good for a game released 2 days ago. There are alot of new things coming so I would advise you to get it. £6.29 ?

However after a single day with the game, I need to write the review I wish I could have read BEFORE deciding to purchase.\n\n1. You do not decide what upgrade goes where.\nWhy does this matter? When attacking a structure that has upgraded, I already know where the cameras are. I know where the guards are. I know how the landmines are places. Upgrades slow me down, but I can rob every target I hit 100% of the time after only a few trial and error runs. There is no cheeky battle of the wits between intruder and owner. This is without a doubt 'the' game killer right here, as it's the biggest feature that appeals to people (and myself).\n\n2. High value targets pay the most, and can be robbed over and over.\nWhy does this matter? Well you'll find where the vault is, spam it until their bank is dry. You then become a high value target for someone else to do the exact same thing to. It is inherently broken and I do not see a way it can be fixed. There is no exception here.\n\nThese two problems alone loop endlessly back on eachother, as you will discover for yourself if you choose to play. I see this going one of two ways. Either enough people purchase to allow for a nearly full rebuild...or the game becomes an ironic vessel for heist-ing 10 dollars from my safe that I'll never see again (which I'm cool with, I love irony).\n\nOh ps dev, please remove the underscore in the name :P","May 4, 2015","false","2.3"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","1"

There's been a lot of drama on the forums (and lack of consistent posting in said forums, mind you), that it seems that CK can't really take criticism all that well. I've seen a user, named Yandere Snake, write an ironic review about the game. Now, ironic reviews are not the best thing in the world when it comes to game criticism, I'll admit that much, but there's some pieces that CK could've taken from it. Now, you think the developer would be the more mature person in an argument like this, however, CK decided to make his profile private after the whole fiasco, and lock Yandere Snake's thread talking about when the next update is. Oh, he also probably locked it also due to the fact he's playing Final Fantasy a lot.\n\nHonestly, I don't think I can trust a developer who can't take criticism like this. If you've heard of Garry's Incident: Day One, this is basically it. The devs could not take the criticism and censored the community's reviews, videos, and the like. They didn't improve themselves off it, but rather censor and claim that they're still great. It's a shame.\n\nI have a bit of hope that maybe CK might change his ways, but I honestly would not bet on it.\n\nUPDATE 3/25/16\n\nRecently, I have been invited to a test group with the developer, so it seems like he's kicking into gear. Also, he's been giving a couple of the users in the community some communication about what's going on. Although, I'll have to leave this review as negative until I see the update.\n\nUPDATE 4/30/16\n\nWord straight from the horse's mouth, the update was supposed to drop around this month, considering when I asked CK0101, he kept telling me that he's planning to drop it a day closely to when I was asking, but in fact, I haven't seen this happen. I've asked about two times now and gotten that response, but the third time I asked, I didn't get any response at all. I have no idea what he's doing with the game, but whether or not he's actively or actually working on it, if a dev can't give a solid release date for their next update, they shouldn't give one at all. This is, of course, neverminding the break of communication and updates.","December 6, 2015","false","11.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","2"

While this is early access, I think it was a little too early to "realease". Again I see this having a lot of potentional, but as it stands now, be prepaired to get shot around corners, or just general bugs.\n\nThis game has a steep learning curve so be prepared. I don't know if i could recomend buying this now, but I would highly recommend keeping an eye on it to see how it improves.\n\nPros\nRefreshing Game play, Feels intense and has that sense of pressure\nExtremely stable, haven't had dropped frames or crashed\nNice sound trackCons\nSteep Learning curve\nEarly access means there is some game breaking bugs (again getting shoot around corners or having guards prefire you when you can't see them)\nthings cost a lot, (I've only played 2.2 hours at the time of this review) but im stuck @ 5K and really wishing I bought the ammo upgrade/silenced pistol, as without it its hard to gain moneyThings I would like to see added\nAll of the Cons should be addressed\nI would like to see more customization, rather than the checklist, it be cool to see full customization but that might come with time\nmore weapons, or the ability to pick up ammo from the downed guards.\nHowever, this is an amazing game and that it was developed by one person and is this stable already is even more surprising.","May 3, 2015","true","3.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

I really enjoy the amount of ideas being put into the game, from land mines to hiring backup units. I just hope that this game gets what it deserves and doesnt become stale or deserted...Early access can be like that. The good thing is though, is that this game seems like it will hold its own and grow into something quite addicting and frustrating (The castle doctrine had periods in development where builders were able to make unbreakable bases, but this game seems to streamline the building and make it less "do what ever you want" and does more a "you have these options, mix n match!". This game feels very much like the love child of PayDay 2 and The Castle Doctrine by Jason Rohrer.\n\nAlso for the hour I played I had a good time cracking safes, shooting derpy ai (that loudly exclaim semi-disappointedly "Theres someone here...") and standing at a PC for 5 minutes to make 500 bucks.\n\n7/10  - Will be Better with more patches.

So I bought it played it a bit then got bored. Then Today I was looking through my desktop and saw this game so decided to check up on it. To my surprise nothing has happened since! I've had this game for about a year now. And no changes have happened. I loved the concept and Idea behind this game. However, because the developer seems to have given up, I would not recommend buying this game in it's current state.","March 5","false","0.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Of what I know I can't turn the effect off so I'm stuck with this until it is removed.
