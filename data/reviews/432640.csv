When zombies show up while scavenging, you have no choice but to fight with whatever weapon you might have (or just your bare fists).\n\nHere's My "First Play on Launch Day" Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-O-U8Q7HXqg\n\nThis game is very similar to "This War of Mine" and almost has the same kind of feel and seems like the developer tried to copy its formula.  Unfortunately, this game just isn't nearly as well done, 'nor is it anywhere near as much fun to play as This War of Mine.\n\nLooks like a port from the Ipad/Android market place, and there are no options at all to change the resolution to fit your desktop monitor.  The game also lacks other options that would have been simple to add such as a Celcius/Fahrenheit choice and the lack of even the simplest options make the game feel very amatuer and "rushed".\n\nIt's an alright game if you like these kind of games and understand that you will die and randomness and luck will be a big part of how long you last.  However my main problem with this game is the price point.  In no way can I see the value of this game being anywhere near their $6.99 USD asking price at launch here on Steam.  I'd say $3.99 max, so if you like this sort of game and it drops down to $2 or $3 on a sale, pick it up, otherside I have to give this very simple. very high RNG game a thumbs down.\n\nI can imagine zombies attacking me in my head and roll some dice on my desk to determine the outcome for free, this game is only a small step up from that.","January 22","false","0.6"," 60 of 88 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","60","88","9","7"

One of the biggest issues I had was the fact there was no pause button or even an automatic pause to the clock when looking through craft-able items. As a result, the game play felt rushed in order to make best of the time you have towards ultimate survival. I ended up picking up items and leaving behind other without knowing which was more important to me at the time. On the bright side, the game has lots of potential. I think that is what attracts us survivalist game enthusiast. Unfortunately, there are some much needed changes to the game play needed before it becomes worth paying to play.","January 23","false","5.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","74","14","19","4","0"

And it's decent...\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed either of these titles...\n\nYour shelter/resource contains the genetics of TWOM, including: crafting. cooking, defense, sleep/exaughtion, weather/temp, and health/mental upkeep. The military-time day/night counter runs continuosly, with every task requiring said amount of time to complete. It's a pretty basic formula for those familiar with TWOM, mostly proritizing what to build to initially survive versus the race to prepare for, and survive, the oncoming winter...\n\nThe DNA of ZH:D is found in the travel/exploration/combat aspect of the game. Diffrent area nodes will become available as you progress in the game. It consists of timed travel, requiring a few hours to traverse the debris to each destination. Each node has a set number of rooms to explore for potential resources required to survive, occasionally finding secret areas, or you could get attacked... Battle is pure RNG with fast flavor text, there is no "action" here.\n\nBefore initializing combat, a threat level is given indicating the severity of the encounter. Low threat means fewer and weaker zombies, with higher threat levels sometimes raising not only enemy numbers but their severity. And yes, you can avoid battles by either not walking into the next room containing zombies or by running away if attacked while traveling. Enemies will usually start four meters away. As the distance closes, you will fire your ranged weapon, if you have one, and then engage in melee combat until victory or defeat. Ammo is universal for each gun, but save those bullets for tougher battles later in game...\n\nThis is a tough little cookie, but doable after you figure out how to proritize your base growth. Also, there are crucial NPC's that will eventually appear asking for resources. Each can be visited at a stationary node after they make initial contact, trading necessary materials and accepting favored items as gifts to raise your companionship level. Higher levels means not only better trades, but also more varied items. Dont ignore your neighbors...\n\nAll in all this is an enjoyable game if you don't mind rage-quitting a window mode only mobile port with little to no feed back from the developer. I'd sorely love to see a full screen mode with a pause option, other than the quit/continue screen, in shelter strictly for viewing resources/stats, but the non-stop timer otherwise adds to the direness of the situation. Also, while outside of your sheleter, there is no way of identifying the materials you gather. Some icons are self explanitory, such as food and wood, but otherwise it's memorization of what's what till you get it home to inspect...\n\n\nAll negative reviews and aspects aside, I personally rate BuriedTown 3.5 out of 5...","February 28","true","51.9"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

Normally I wouldn't review a game prior to playing it, but honestly, this is more of a review on the developer, rather than the game itself.\n\nLet me first start off by saying: The mobile version of this game is pretty good, and I'm sure most of the people who were looking forward to this, would probably agree. The developer mentioned within the mobile version that a Steam version of the game was going to be released, and I was pretty excited. I thought that bringing the game to Steam would mean that they could make the proper modifications and give the game some additions that the mobile version lacked, and really make this game something awesome. I thought wrong, sadly. So, if you are thinking about trying this game, don't. Download the FREE mobile version instead (it's free on Android, not sure if the same is true for Apple devices), and try that one out instead. It's really good.\n\nThe developer of this game is a perfect example of a what a horrible game developer looks like on Steam. It seems as if they took full advantage of the people who played and enjoyed the mobile version, and exploited their following of the game. They half-♥♥♥♥♥ released this game on Steam, way overcharged for the game (yes, $6.99 IS way too much for this game, considering the fact that it looks like over half the people who tried purchasing it and playing it, couldn't actually play it), and then when these people tried contacting the developer, to find out what was wrong, find out why they couldn't get the game to load or play properly, or to even just find out when a fix for this would be released, the developer did......nothing. Has the developer released any sort of news or information about these issues that so many people are having with the game? Nope. Has the developer even gotten back to me (or any of the people who have posted their complaints or issues on the Discussions Page), to even just apologize for the issue/bug? Nope. Haven't heard a peep from them, or seen them post anything. It's as if they released this game, well before it was ready, slapped a price tag on it, and let it go from there. It's as if they just took the mobile version, and slapped it onto Steam. And whatever profit they make from it....then that's what they make, and who cares about anything else. Who cares about putting the time, effort, and even money into improving the game, making the fixes that are needed to allow the game to actually be playable, and make even MORE profit on the game. That doesn't seem to be their long-term goal at all - whatever short-term profit they make on it, that's all they're interested in.\n\nIt's sad to me that Steam even allows this game to stay on here, considering the lack of playability for most people (it seems that the game is mostly unable for people who run Windows 10, and even for some of those who run Windows 8...Sooo, considering Windows 10 is free, this includes A LOT of people, lol). Also, the lack of any type of communication from the developer is pretty disturbing, and also makes me wonder why Steam isn't stepping in on this, in any sort of way (whatever way they may be able to do that... I don't honestly know).\n\nAll in all, don't play the game. Or don't try to anyways. Luckily, I was able to get a refund on the game, but from what I've seen/heard, not everyone was so lucky. Even though it's not a huge amount of money, it's definitely better spent elsewhere, since the game is totally free (except for IAP, of course) on Android, and maybe on iPhones too.","March 2","false","0.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================BuriedTown is a fun casual game that doesn't really fit that well into any of the most common genre definitions. The Steam game page for BuriedTown suggests that some popular user-defined tags for it are as follows: Action, RPG, Strategy, Indie, Adventure. But this really doesn't define it well at all.\n\nIn BuriedTown, you are a survivor of a zombie outbreak. There's no information provided in game regarding where you came from, how you managed to avoid the zombie virus (?) outbreak, or even who you are, but none of these things is really important for playing the game anyway.\n\nBuriedTown has received some pretty negative reviews on Steam, but in my opinion they're not really justified. The game is addictive in its own way, but it is also frustrating. A short run of bad luck can have terrible consequences, ruining in just a minute or two a game that you have been playing for over an hour. But it's pretty original and has reasonably high production values.\n\nComing into this review after reading some of the others I was expecting the worst, but I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - The graphics in BuriedTown are a bit of a mixed bag. No, there are no graphics options, and no, you can't play it in full-screen graphics mode. BuriedTown opens up in a resizable window and doesn't know anything about bloom or HDR or ambient occlusion. There aren't even any fancy animations to speak of! Instead, the game's graphics take the form of a number of stylised icons that all fit within a single theme, placed over two-dimensional still backgrounds. And in my opinion, they're mostly quite nicely done, and fit the game well.\n\nThe game screen is divided into two sections, with various statistics, your character's five attributes or needs, and a status window on the right; and the relevant world screen on the left: either your home, the world map, the current location you're visiting, or one of the utility screens used for combat, inventory management, improving your shelter, etc.\n\nIt took me my first game to familiarise myself with the meaning behind each icon and the features represented by the graphics, but once I had encountered each one once, that was enough.\n\nSound - I believe there's only one music track used throughout BuriedTown, but it fits the mood of the game very well: a sort-of gently mournful instrumental piece that's blended nicely with a thunderstorm. I haven't yet found myself bored with it, and it blends into the background while playing. The game's sound effects are not quite so good, with zombie combat sounds especially being extremely repetitive and lacking. Other sounds in the game tend to alert you to your character's status changing (usually for the worse), and are passable, but nothing special.\n\nGameplay - The goal of BuriedTown is to survive for as long as you can. You start in an abandoned house that you call home, and each day you need to maintain your character's five needs (mood, energy, hunger, infection, and injury) while exploring the mostly abandoned town outside your door.\n\nUnfortunately it's not quite as simple as it seems, with your mood, energy, and hunger constantly decreasing and requiring you to find and use various resources recovered from the town in order to replenish them. This usually results in your other needs -- infection and injury -- taking a hit from the zombies you'll randomly encounter while exploring, which then prompts you to find still more resources to replenish these needs as well. And so on.\n\nTo explore the town you leave your shelter and select a destination. The game gives you a confirmation screen showing how long it will take your character to reach the destination, and away you go. Once you arrive at your destination, you can there explore up to a certain number of times for each location, either encountering zombies that you must fight or discovering a hidden cache of loot. The town's locations are the same each play through, which I found a little disappointing, but I was pleased to discover that the encounters for each location seemed to be at least partly randomised.\n\nAnd that's basically it. The central idea is very simple, but well executed, if perhaps a tad too difficult for my liking. My first game I lasted two and a half days, my second almost double that, and then in my third I survived for over 12 days before falling afoul of a continuous run of zombies in the local movie theatre. But each game was a precarious dance of balancing needs, collecting loot, automated zombie battles, and crossed fingers -- hardly a relaxing pasttime.\n\nThe game is quick enough to play just for a few minutes and then put down again, but addictive enough to keep you busy for hours if you let it. The implemented Steam achievements and in-game trophies increase the addictiveness, as would the world-wide ranking list, if I could get it to work.\n\nThe whole game is played with the mouse pointer and left mouse button and could easily have been made for a mobile device, which I believe it originally was. But it works well on Windows, too, and once you've learned what all of the icons do you'll find the interface simple and straightforward.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Addictive gameplay with both in-game trophies and Steam achievements, as well as a ranking system\n+ Great music\n+ Simple interface that's very easy to learn\n+ Stable: no crashes or bugs encountered yet\n+ Translation to multiple languages, if you want to play in something other than English\n\nCons:\n- Ranking system doesn't seem to work; ranking lists are always empty\n- Very hard; there are Steam achievements awarded for surviving whole seasons! I thought I was doing well making it through 12 days ...\n- Locations are the same every game, making it more repetitive than it otherwise could be, although encounters and loot do change\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================I'm going to go against the general feeling of the other English reviews on Steam and say that BuriedTown is a really good little game. I've only played it for a couple of hours so far, but I can easily see myself playing it for quite a few more, struggling to survive just that little bit longer, upgrading my shelter and befriending other survivors as I go.\n\nIs it an action adventure RPG, as suggested by the current popular user-defined tags on the Steam page? Most definitely not, in my opinion. But it is fun, and that's exactly what I wanted from it!\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 28","true","2.2"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","11","27","0","0"
