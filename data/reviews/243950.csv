Just one that is so strong in one part... And so weak in another two.... I find it difficult to recommend.. I think some will really love this game, and others will bounce off it. I am somewhere inbetween... And after 8 hours, I just felt like I'd had my fill.\n\nThere are three parts to this game, the RTS battles where you can take the form a dragon to rain down fiery terror on your enemies while commanding your forces about and building a base... the strategy map where you move your forces around in a turn based environment, very much like the board game RISK.. and the part of the game that I call the Emperor simulator.\n\nFor me, the RTS part of the game is the weakest, and ultimately what made me run out of steam and stop playing. I spent most of my time in RTS battles and to be fair they are half decent. The graphics are competent, the AI is good on Normal difficulty and although the units all kinda look the same they are varied in their functions and what they can do. You have land, sea and air units and coupled with the ability to change into a Dragon to help out a crucial time or go on a daring raid to destroy a key building is fun!    ....... For a while.\n\nIt just becomes stale, at least in my opinion. Granted, I am not an extreme RTS player so maybe I don't have the grizzled veteran stripes that would see me through, but I have finished a few in my time. World in Conflict, a few C&C games, Starcraft 2, Dawn of War.. and similar games... so I feel qualified enough to say that the RTS element of Dragon Commander stops being fun and ends up repetitive and at times... a grind.\n\nFighting so many similar battles, often on similar maps, repeating similar tactics over and over eventually erodes the fun for me and facing X amount more hours of it isn't something I relish. Most of the time selecting all your units and pointing them to the enemy base tends to work as a tactic, as long as you time it right.\n\nThe strategy map is half decent, knowing where to spend your turn by turn income and when to commit your forces is crucial to success... and that part is engaging. No real complaints .. or specific praise about the map. It is clean, functional.. and works. So.. good!\n\nBy far the best bit of the game however is playing Emperor. In between battles and troop deployments you will move around your command ship (a big airship powered by a demon) and speak with your generals, learn what makes them tick, settle disputes and do your best to people manage your commanders who are all very different and clearly have different ways of thinking and fighting. You'll also need to manage to needs of the people... in the form of approving or rejecting policies your council proposes.\n\nThings like a national health service, conscription, gay marriage and censorship of the media. The choices you make have direct influences on the war, impacting finances, morale and available troops.\n\nOn top of that you also pick a princess to marry from one of the 5 races (I think) in the game, each have their own story arc, wants and needs and of course who you pick and what happens with them throughout the course of your game influence your standing with that particular race and how the others view you also.\n\nIt is well voice acted throughout, the characters are well written and they are animated to be full of life and colour. It was a real pleasant surprise!\n\nI feel like I am just scratching the surface on this part of the game, but this facet of Dragon Commander is great... and for me..if they could of attached it to a more fulfilling game... like... well... I'm not sure.. .perhaps a fantasy kingdom manager in the mould of Anno 1404 or something? Rather than this repetitive RTS game... then I think this will have been a classic for me.\n\nThumbs up ... because it isn't a bad game... however whether you'll fall in love with it or not... is difficult to say.","November 25, 2013","true","8.1"," 393 of 436 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","393","436","0","12"

Because if you are looking for a good RTS and turn based gameplay, Divinity Dragon Commander isn't the game that's going to scratch that itch for you, even though it employs those mechanics. But if you are looking for a conceptually interesting game, with emphasis on story, character and choices, then I dare say that Divinity Dragon Commander might be worth checking out, if and only if, you are willing to be patient with it and accept the shortcomings of the action phases, meaning the RTS battles.\n\nDivinity Dragon Commander is divided in three parts of gameplay: story and political decisions, turn based Risk-like movement troops on a military map and real-time strategy confrontation during which you can control a dragon. The three phases of the game influence each other in a delightful way: the political decision you make have an impact on all the areas of the map, and the level of bonuses you get from them, depending on the faction to which each county belongs. For example, if you are popular with the elves, your elven controlled regions will grant you more money and will also be more easy to defend. At the same time, it will be harder for the enemy to hold on to those elvish districts. Obviously, should you be less popular, those bonus would become penalties, making the game actually very difficult, even in the RTS sequences of the game, where the number of recruits, and thus units you can build, is tied to your popularity.\nBut on that point, it needs to be said that the whole game is pretty difficult if you don't know its workings. The learning curve is all over the place. The game doesn't explain the consequence of your political decisions and the nefarious effects of a popularity of zero percent with one or more factions. Worse, going against the wishes of the undead faction, which is blessed by the gods, actually gives you a penalty during automatic battle resolutions, which is bound to happen sooner or later since you can only manage one battle per turn personally. This battle penalty can go pretty high as I found out, up to -26% apparently. I wouldn't necessarily recommend that particular experience. The RTS phases are a lot easier if you compromise you political stance and try to accommodate most of the factions, at least some of the time.\n\nThe problems during the battles do not only spring from what the game doesn't establish in mechanics, but also from balancing issues. At the start of the game, you can choose from three dragons, but the differences aren't obvious: the mage-like dragon has more health and better mobility but deals the least amount of damage, whereas the biggest, fastest dragon has the best damage output, but the less health and mobility. The starting skills of each dragon are also different, but since you can unlock every talent for every dragon, it's really a none issue. The problem is that the mage-dragon deals so little damage, that it takes ages to kill anything while the enemy has no problem pummelling that particular dragon to death. Sure, in multilayer, it might make a difference, but for the story campaign, I see no point in going down that road.\nAlso, on the turn based map, it is possible to build local improvements which in turn grant you cards that you can play before a battle to improve your odds of winning, or granting temporary bonuses to counties. But, from all the dozens and dozens of different cards it is possible to get, very clearly the tavern, which grants you mercenaries, is the best way to go. All of a sudden, you can attack an enemy, one unit against ten, and then just summon a whole army of mercenaries to take care of things.\nBesides these balancing issues, there is also the fact that it is possible to carry over gold between acts. There are three acts in the game, and while you are limited in what you can take with you between act I and II, there is no limit between what it is possible to import to act III. While the game puts an emphasis on rushing down opponents, it is well worth waiting a dozen turns at the end of each act to maximise the treasure, the research trees and the cards, stacking up on mercenary ones. The worst part is, winning or, at least for me, enjoying the game, seems to require using these exploits to gain the upper hand against the IA and avoiding most of the dreadful RTS sequences.\n\nBecause there is no way around it, those sequences aren't well made. That they are functional is about the only good thing I can say about them. The RTS aspects of it are rather simplistic, and the tactics are seldom more developed than surviving, building a large army and dumping it on the enemy. The fact that it is possible to play as a dragon during those phases is refreshing, and it is nice to fly over the battlefield, helping you troops and raining down fire on your enemies. But this makes it almost impossible to control you troops, managing your army, buildings, etc. So it is constantly necessary to switch back and forth between dragon and RTS controls.\nAs a balancing issue, -again!-, the speed of the game is a huge problem. It is possible to determine how fast, or slow, the RTS portion of the game can run. This means that everything can happen either twice as fast, or only at fifty percent of the speed. Here is the kicker: the dragon you control isn't influence by the change in pace, meaning that he still moves and attacks at the same speed, regardless of the speed of the enemies. This is completely broken since it means that enemies can dish out twice as much damage to you on higher speed, but only fifty percent on the lowest speed, which makes it also much more easier to dodge. So turning the speed to “slowest” during the RTS section is almost a vital necessity.\n\nBut if, on paper, one third of the game is worth rushing through, the rest of it must be that much better, to compensate, right?\n\nFrom the start, Divinity Dragon Commander pulled me in: the introduction sequence, and it's music, set a refreshing tone for me, as well as the first contact with the generals under your command. The personality, characterisation and style really shines through during those moment. It is the most polished part of the game and the effort shows.\nThe characters feel almost larger than life, straight out of a play, going through individual arcs with their quirks and personal demons, down one path or another, depending on your guidance. The voice acting is just perfect, I couldn't even think of one thing to improve on in that regard. It hits every mark! The dialogue made me think, it made me laugh, it completely mesmerized me. There is so much personality here, even in the background of the scenes where you make decision (like the amazing skeletal barmaid).\nThe opinion of the player is asked constantly over subject which are sometimes trivial and funny, or very serious. It is sad to only have two options as choices, no matter the subject, but it does make things more straightforward. Although, you would be surprised how often the obvious choice isn't always the right one. I liked it a lot, but I suppose it requires a certain interest in political issues, if only to catch the jokes, the nudges and the parodies represented here.\nI was also very surprised by some of the different issues you get, depending on what you decided earlier. Turning down the imp faction looking to build a giant bomb will result in them coming back with a super soldier project, whereas agreeing in the first place, will only ask more and more of you in the search for the “biggest and badest explosion ever”. Each faction (of which there are five), each general (four in this case) and each queen (again, four) has one of these quests with a lot of multiple branching.\n\nStill, although I enjoyed my time with Divinity Dragon Commander, I cannot justify its full price tag, for what content I liked amounted to not even half of what the game had to offer.","April 7, 2014","true","34.1"," 157 of 170 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","157","170","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/243950/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The single-player mode in Divinity: Dragon Commander sets up a decent plot about a being who can transform into a dragon who is disputing with its other, equally crazy siblings. The story portrayed through the cutscenes is certainly well told, but serves as more or less a justification to go from one map to the next.\n\nThough the tutorials don't do much to explain this, Divinity: Dragon Commander is a mix of boardgame-style territory control (a la Risk) and real-time strategy (RTS) battles. The majority of a "match" will have players moving pieces around a game board in an attempt to control and dominate as much of the map as possible. The biggest problem is that the tutorial doesn't even attempt to explain any of this.\n\nAfter watching the multitude of tutorial videos, it's easy to assume that the game is only an RTS game, as it doesn't touch on any of the mechanics associated with the boardgame portions of a match. When first confronted with the board, some tooltips are displayed to help explain things, but they are incredibly insufficient. The tutorials for the RTS elements are also insufficient, as is the case with just about every non-interactive tutorial. There is a "Training Ground" that allows players to screw around as they please, but it does little in the way of actively teaching anything.\n\nThe boardgame portions of the game take place in turns and require a "big picture" type of thinking in order to play effectively. Two types of resources are up for grabs: gold and resource points. Occupying various areas on the map will add to the amount of resources gained per turn, the exact amount being displayed on the territory itself. When a battle occurs, the player has the option to choose a specific general, each with their own playstyle, to auto-simulate the battle and play the odds, or they can control the Dragon Commander and head into battle themselves.\n\nThe battles play out like many other real-time strategy games, but with one twist: the player can take control of a jetpack dragon and partake in the battle themselves. Doing so is somewhat limited; there are a couple of minutes in the beginning of the match in which the dragon cannot be spawned (it takes resources, which you don’t yet have, to spawn the dragon), and there is a brief period after death in which the dragon cannot be spawned. The dragon has specific abilities at its disposal as well, each with its own separate cooldown. There are also three different dragons to choose from, each with their own abilities and playstyle.\n\nPlaying as a dragon is like playing a third-person shooter; it's very action-oriented. When doing so, however, it is important not to forget about the troops on the ground. Battles will be fought in tandem, as the player commands the dragon in the sky while their troops march beneath them into battle. There are limited army commands while in dragon mode, so it is possible to command an army while simultaneously breathing fire on enemy scum. Mastering these army commands is a hugely effective way to get a leg up on an opponent, since it's incredibly easy to forget about a ground army while soaring through the air and toasting fools.\n\nAs for the non-dragon RTS mechanics, battles consist of vying for resources called Recruits. Recruits are gained over time as long as the player has Recruitment Centers built on top of certain locations around the map. These locations are neutral in the beginning of the map, and need to be captured by having at least one unit nearby. The beginning of the match is incredibly important as players have limited units and must try to capture and hold as many build locations as possible, both for Recruitment Centers and unit-producing buildings.\n\nThe RTS controls do feel a bit clunky when compared to the standards of the genre. Intermediate tactics like control groups can be utilized, but most units move way too slowly to micromanage effectively. In addition, the camera is constantly shifting position when going back and forth between RTS and dragon mode and it can be quite frustrating to constantly have to re-adjust the camera.\n\nThe true highlight of the single-player campaign is what happens in between turns, aboard a ship called the Raven. This is where the diplomatic elements come into play, as a group of five diplomats will constantly bug the player with proposals and recommendations as to how to run a country. Each diplomat represents a specific race: Undead, Elves, Dwarves, Lizards, or Imps. Making certain decisions will alter how each race feels about the player, so balancing the favor of each race becomes quite the juggling act.\n\nThe Raven is also where players will spend their research points. These points, accrued each turn, can be spent on new units and unit abilities or on new dragon abilities. Deciding where to spend research points is no easy feat, as doing so can drastically alter a playstyle. One player might want to spend heavily on their dragon, making each player-controlled battle that much easier, while someone else might want to focus on their army and let their AI generals auto-simulate the battles.\n\nIt is, of course, also possible to take the battles online against honest-to-goodness humans. The Raven doesn't make an appearance in any multiplayer mode, since chances are people would spend forever in between turns, but its absence is made up by the presence of dragon-on-dragon battles. There are two game modes: Campaign and Skirmish, the latter of which is a single battle in the RTS-style of gameplay, without the boardgame map. The former is just like single-player but without the Raven.\n\nThe dragon battles are the clear highlight of multiplayer. Battles are no longer instantly won once the player decides to command their dragon, because the enemy player can do the same thing and fight back. The strategy shifts dramatically when a player knows that a dragon can emerge at just about any moment. Anti-air units are way more valuable as most of them, when grouped up, can take out a dragon pretty quickly. The dogfights, er, dragonfights, that can happen in the air are intense and are a true test of a player's focus, as it's even easier to forget about a ground army when using skills and dodging.\n\nEach area and NPC looks unique and beautiful, both in terms of technical graphics power and character design. A pretty big issue for some players, though, is the lack of a colorblind mode, as the default colors of the single-player campaign are red and green. This issue persists on both the overworld map as well as mid-battle. During the battle, enemy units are labeled when far away from the camera with a red icon, but the icon goes away as they get closer for some strange reason, reverting back to the reliance on color differentiation.\n\nThe voice work of Divinity: Dragon Commander deserves special mention. With so many different characters aboard the Raven, the voice acting was immediately a cause for concern for me. Luckily, each character performs well and it is a joy to talk to each and every one. Sure, no one character's voice actor stands out as particularly amazing, but the sheer virtue of not having a single character grate on the nerves is not to be understated.\n\nDivinity: Dragon Commander is a prime example of a game being bigger than the sum of its parts. The RTS elements are a bit rough, but at least it's possible to control a dragon with a freaking jetpack to blow stuff up, while the boardgame-esque territory map requires players to think of the big picture. Talking to the colorful cast of NPCs aboard the Raven in between turns in single-player was easily one of my favorite non-dragon parts of the game and really highlights the writing and wit that the Divinity series has come to be known for. The tutorial needs a lot of work and the game isn't very friendly to colorblind players, but Divinity: Dragon Commander will certainly unleash the dragon strategist in all of us.","October 29, 2015","true","63.1"," 87 of 92 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","87","92","2","0"

Then you know how it plays). Each of these "countries" can be conquered with your units and you can buy and build one of several buildings on it. Some give you more gold, some will grant you cards, which you can use to get extra units or other advantages in the combat.\n\nOnce you bought your units, placed them, used your cards and you want to attack another country, then you will jump into real-time strategy part.\nThe strategy part is rather simple. You have several fixed spots on the map, where you can build buildings on. First, you have to get your units there and wait a bit for them to capture them, only then you can build there.\nOver time, you gain points (i think they are called citizens) which you need in order to build your attack units and buildings.\n\nThe one big diffenrece and fun thing here is, once you collected enough citizens, you can transform into a dragon, fly around in third person and attack the enemy, buff your units or debuff the enemy units.\nYou are pretty powerful and can turn a seemingly lost battle into a victory, but you are not invincible.\n\nOn your flagship you can buy new buffs, debuffs for your dragon, new units and upgrades for your units.\n\nIt's a very well done mix, although it plays very simplistic and doesn't have the depth of other RTS games.\nThe maps itself are also rather small and will repeat quite often.\n\nThe characters are pretty well done, and also the political debates and decisions are quite fun. Most of the time they are split in half, wether they like a decision or not, so you can't please everyone always. But the impact of the decision isn't that big.\nSpeaking of the political debates, the humor is quite good as well, the dialogues are fun and i found myself to have more interest in these, than in the rest of the game ^^\nPretty early on, you are also given the choice to marry a woman from one of the species. The dialogues with them afterwards and the choices you make there are also pretty great and hilarious.\n\nThe game itself is a great mix of different genres, which plays pretty good, although being rather simplistic, but still fun enough to entertain a lot, especially when you are soaring through the air as powerful dragon, crushing all those puny enemies ^^\n\nCan definitely recommend this to everyone even slightly interested in real-time strategy games. A very refreshing and unique game in my opinion, don't miss out.","August 31, 2015","true","27.9"," 85 of 90 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","85","90","4","2"

This game looks incredible at a glance, combining real time strategy with third person shooting action with a dragon (not enough games let play as dragons like that IMO) and all this complimented by the political decisions you have to make between each match.  So much to do, and yet none of it is as deep or thought provoking as you may think.\n\nOn the plus side of things, the graphics and the voice and conversations of this game are pretty good.  While some of the unit designs seem uninspired, all the characters aboard the Raven (the hub you go to between turns) all have intersting designs.  Futhermore, these characters you converse with have their own distinct personalities and are generally enjoyable to listen too.  The political banters these guys  get into often reflects current real world problems, and getting to have your say in them can be fun.  However, the decisions you make are always either "yes" or "no".  This may work for some things, but other times I didn't like the all or nothing approach this game presented to me.  Overall though, this was still my favorite part, as it was fun to see their reactions.\n\nUnfortunately what you may consider to be the main part of the game, the RTS and turn based map sections are lacking.  On the map, too much comes down to sheer luck.  Whether it's what cards you get, which you can use to boost your advantage or cripple an enemy in some fashion, or just moving into the wrong place at the wrong time, there is just too much that can change in one turn.  Sure many strategy games are like this, but in this one it feels more like luck instead of skill.  In battle, the real time strategy elements are hardly even there.  It is difficult or sometimes even impossible to try to micro, and the macro only consists of taking over building plots and building one of a very limited number of buildings (only five different ones all things considered) and keeping them from being taken over.  It just feels like a tug-of-war.  The only fun thing is playing as the dragon, although I found that to be repetitive after a while as it was so much easier to sabatoge the enemy's attempts at expanding than it was to fight with my units as the designers probably hoped you would.\n\nOverall, this isn't a terrible game.  Though it has some good points, they aren't enough to overcome the badones.  I would certainly not recommend this at full price.  Even at 50% off, you may not get your money's worth, as much of the value of this game comes from playing it repeatedly and making different political decisions, but it's hard to go through all of those conversations a second time.  This game is worth a look ONLY if you are looking for a strategy game that tries some things different.  Otherwise, there isn't much here to warrant your attention.","December 5, 2013","false","15.6"," 305 of 401 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","305","401","0","6"

It's one part Real-Time-Strategy, one part RISK, one part RPG, and one part action game. This all sounds like a recipe for a messy disaster does it not? In most other cases, it would be, however, Divinity: Dragon Commander manages to pull off a good chunk of it's intended goals and then some, to create one of the more unique experiences of the year.\n\nThe story begins by declaring that you are the son of the now deceased king who once ruled over the land of Rivellon. Now it is your fate that you must now compete with your brothers and sisters for the empty throne.\n\nRoughly 50% of the game is spent on your ship talking to your advisers and upgrading yourself and your forces. This is the stronger of the two halves of the game because it is here that the excellent writing is put on display. There is a colorful cast of characters to interact with and there are a ton fun and interesting choices to make as a ruler that directly impact the Strategy portion of the game.\n\nThe other 50% of your game time belongs to the Strategy side of the game. This half sadly, is the weaker younger brother to the RPG elements I mentioned earlier, but it is by no means bad. Most of your movements will be made on a RISK-style campaign map as you claim territory from your siblings. Here you can play various cards to help you or hinder your foes in the battles to come. It's a little shallow overall, but it is very snappy and it's all very well-presented.\n\nThe RTS sections are fast-paced and entertaining to play for one major reason and one of this game's main selling points: The Dragon Form. At any point in the battle, provided you have a enough resources, you can transform into a dragon and take direct control of it to support your forces and rain death upon the enemy. This form is wildly entertaining and it does a good job of making you feel powerful. It almost makes you forget the lack of unit variety between the factions, as there is technically only one army in the game. However, in the quick and brutal multi-player, the introduction of player-controlled dragons really spices things up and can lead to some really interesting experiences.\n\nSo overall, Divinity: Dragon Commander is a very unique experience. It is also a very good one, not perfect, but considering the ambition present in this project, it turned out very well for Larian Studios. It shows a lot of ambition in a genre that is otherwise starting to hit a period of stagnation, and that alone is to be commended.","November 25, 2013","true","19.0"," 114 of 136 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","114","136","0","0"

You have limited army control in this mode, so can at least fight with a thrash of units under you, radiant in the healing, damage-boosting auras you emit.\n\nBut you can basically forget trying to play the RTS as designed, because someone put this on top of a Starcraft-y set of units with lots of manually-triggered abilities. You might occasionally switch your artillery in and out of deployed mode, or tell your tanks to use their short-range sonic burst attack, but not much more unless you forego being a dragon. And then I have to ask why you are playing a game whose main defining feature is that you are a dragon.\n\nOne reason possibly being for the challenge (and inevitable achievement). The dragon is basically like spawning with a Supreme Commander Experimental right at the start. You can assert almost total control of any one point on the map. It's rare for an RTS battle to last more than a few minutes, and if you lose it's because you just got overwhelmed by the AI's ability to multitask harder, or bit off such a ridiculously one-sided starting position that you got rushed while the dragon was in its first-minute cooldown.\n\nOn the strategic layer, you can only fight personally once per turn, and the rest is up to autoresolves, possibly modified by generals and cards. There's some depth here, especially in picking which fight you want to be your certain win, but nothing to get ecstatic about. Units are almost too mobile, especially naval ones which loop around the map, for territorial control to mean much more than "keep units on every tile". An offensive force headed by your dragon self can steamroll forward so much more effectively than any other that there's limited utility to fighting on multiple fronts.\n\nThe diplomatic side is basically brilliant. Characters are well-written and well-voiced, although the fact that every choice is binary is oft irritating; there's quite often no room for moderation or nuance. You probably won't want to put up with the actual *war* part of the game long enough to play it through enough times to see everything, and savescumming a bit just to see branches not taken is confounded by several turns' worth of delays between action and consequences. Turns padded by war.\n\nThe ending is flat as a pancake, however. You capture the last key territory, everyone says well done in turn, title screen.\n\nAnd the multiplayer side? Ridiculously crippled. Pick from one of three predefined dragon loadouts (despite loadout-building being a key fun part of the singleplayer), four players per map tops, no AI dragons, only armies. (It's not much of a spoiler to get the disappointment out of the way and say that nothing of the sort shows up to peturb the mix in the campaign, either. There is no climactic final battle here, just another identikit skirmish.)\n\nGet it in a sale, enjoy the council going at each-other's throats, and divebombing down onto massed enemy forces to unleash a huge firestorm amongst them before swooping around to gather your own army and charging forward into the enemy base with a bellowing roar. The ambience is great. Just expect by the final chapter to be looking at the strategic map with a weary, tired eye that just wants to autoresolve but knows the Imperial Army will blow a 70% chance and get driven back, and occasionally wishing your conversations didn't feel so railroaded.","May 24, 2014","true","22.9"," 72 of 81 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","72","81","0","0"

This phase is easily the best part of the game, it is well voice acted, well animated, and provides great enjoyment for most.\n\nCons:\n-Map phase:\nThe map phase is shallow to say the least, here you can play cards that improve empire related things, or build buildings that will allow you to improve income and recruit units or mercenaries. But that is all, there is nothing more here, no diplomacy, no trading, nothing that would make you want to spend time strategizing here.\n\n-Combat:\nThis should be the most interesting part of the game, since this is the part where you get to be the dragon...for about 2-5 mins. Here are the problems with this phase:\nFirst the design choices, as in the way the units look, they are not only quite small(can't zoom in enough), but also look the same for all factions.\n\nSecond, the speed of the combat is waaaaay too fast, if you want to play defensively, you are screwed, you want to build up bases, you are screwed. The only way to win is if you blob all over the enemy at the start of the battle in which case the battle ends rather quickly because if your draw it out, the enemy becomes too strong and usually you can no longer overwhelm them before you run out of resources, enjoy your 5 mins long battle without strategies and being the dragon for about 5 mins. This problem however also relates to being the dragon.\n\nThird, the dragon is strong at the beginning, but if you try and draw out the match to enjoy some base building, you will quickly find, that your dragon is becoming more and more useless as time passes on, since the enemy is improving their units all the time, they will take more hits and you will take less, in the end you will die extremely quickly, making becoming the dragon rather useless.\n\nFourth, the units have way too many skills you can't micromanage on the same level as the ai, which can make some fights rather one sided.\n\nFifth, and this is the largest problem with the combat by far. Mercenary cards. Why in the world would you even want to enter combat with such bad mechanics behind it when you can simply bypass it by spamming inns and mercenary cards and than using auto-combat?\n\n-The length of the skirmish matches:\nThese only take anywhere from 25(min difficulty)-45(max difficulty) mins. I tested this by using only mercenary cards and lol i won all of my matches against highest difficulty ai in 45 mins max. This is a joke. Mercenary cards shouldn't be in the game or should be better balanced.\n\n-Story:\nWhat story? You mean the few cutscenes we get?\nThe campaign can be completed in about 2-3 hours, which is extremely short for a game like this. The enemies are quite generic, have no personality, don't taunt you and pretty much act the same on the battlefield, or at least i haven't noticed that they did anything differently from eachother.\n\n\nTo sum it up, the devs created a great politics mechanic in the game, unfortunately the game fails at the other parts, and for the title dragon commander, i was expecting to see more dragons or at least more often than about 2-5 mins in combat. I have the feeling that if they went with the original concept, instead of remaking the whole game halfway through in a single year, they could've achieved more, alas, it is not so.\n\nDo i recommend this game for the current price(40eur)? NO\nThis game is not worth 40 eur.\nBut i do recommend you pick it up when it is on offer.\nThe game is worth about 15-20 eur, carried by the politics and the multiplayer may give you a few hours of amusement.","November 16, 2014","false","6.6"," 181 of 249 people (73%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","73","181","249","8","21"

They seem to get bored and then begin other projects to leave unfinished. Then some of those projects get mooshed into one game. I don't think they've made a fully realised game since the original Divinity.\n\nSo, how does that apply here?\n\nFirst of all, let's consider that the original concept for this game was actually very different than what we ended up with. There's a lot of evidence to support this.\n\n1.) Their Kickstarter described a game devoted to dragons and aerial combat. It was to be an apology to those dragon fans who'd bought Divinity II for how badly they were screwed over and let down. Furthermore, the media (such as trailers and screenshots) released at the time depicted proper aerial combat, along with unique art assets for enemy forces, enemy flying bases, and flying base combat that never made it into the final game. It gave the idea of an aerial combat MOBA with dragons, which was a brilliantly original idea to be sure.\n\n2.) The concept art for the game shows dragon forms for the various characters who were kludged into your crew as generals. They were supposed to be leading their own forces, as the generals of the diplomats you're dealing with.\n\n3.) The AI behaves like a MOBA. It hangs around out in the middle of nowhere just to give you something to fight (jungling), and when it's not doing that it strictly follows preset paths in big blobs. This isn't even remotely like how an RTS AI is supposed to work, and it doesn't play like any RTS I've ever experienced. It definitely acts like a MOBA in which you were supposed to play a champion (dragon). Yet the end result of the switchover to RTS makes the dragon pointless (I'll come back to this later).\n\nThus I believe at one point Larian were distracted from creating the game they wanted to make by starting a number of side projects. Such as the 'Risk clone,' the 'card game,' and 'diplomacy.' I've used quotations because it is to laugh to actually consider them to be such (I'll come back to that later, though).\n\nAnd each of these projects ended up grossly unfinished, with some having barely any work done on them at all.\n\nOf course, once Larian was done being distracted by experimental shinies, they realised that all of these ambitious projects could never be realised. This included the dragon aerial combat MOBA depicted in their Kickstarter. What to do? They didn't have the assets necessary to actually create their MOBA now, so they ham-fisted whatever they had together and called it done.\n\nWorse than that? They even lost sight of what they were actually making: A game about ruddy dragons! It's a game called 'Dragon Commander' where you don't ever see any dragons -- including your own!\n\nYet this is what Larian is known for. Losing focus, lazily slapping together something, then merrily dropping it into the market hoping that people will be stupid enough to just buy it sight unseen. They did the exact same thing with Divinity II. THis is what they do.\n\nThat, and they just make so many promises that they never, ever keep. How is their reputation not utterly destroyed by this point?\n\nReally, all they had to do was make an aerial combat game about dragons. Instead, they've ended up with what feels like a compilation of bad shareware/home computer games from the '90s, all slapped together into one package that they've very optimistically overpriced. And anyone who's played budget games from that era knows what I mean -- lazily made, unfinished, shallow, uninspired, aggravating, and borderline unplayable cash-ins. That's Larian to a tee, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. That's on me. I was stupid. Never again.\n\nYou might think that's an unfair comparison, but let's look at what Dragon Commander actually is, shall we?\n\nYou can be a diplomat! Hooray! ...except no.\n\nIt's a shallow, binary, yes/no, choose your own adventure sort of affair. It lacks subtlety, nuance, and imagination. It's funny at times, but that's the only virtue it has. Instead of being able to posit your own ideas, instead of debating and politicking to change a proposed bill, you become the voting public embodied in one, tyrannical instance. I didn't want any of that. If you're going to offer me diplomacy, offer me diplomacy! What we got was tyranny.\n\nIf you're looking for this sort of thing, I'd recommend looking elsewhere. Any Choose Your Own Adventure book does it better. Try Lone Wolf, or Fighting Fantasy, or even the entirely free Choice of Dragon, which is written much more eloquently and humorously than Dragon Commander could hope to be.\n\nUninspired.\n\nYou can play Risk! Woo! ...except no.\n\nIt's a completely one-dimensional affair about the basic micromanagement of units and resources. There's no real strategy involved either beyond brute-forcing your way through the map. This isn't even Risk, it's too oversimplified and one-dimensional for that.\n\nLazy.\n\nYou can be a dragon! So awesome! ...except no.\n\nYou have to micromanage everything so if you take your eyes off your units for a moment they're probably going to be doing something painfully stupid (thanks AI). And the enemy forces progress so quickly that they gain weapons and units that can quickly destroy your dragon whilst resisting any damage it could otherwise do, thus rendering the presence of the dragon completely redundant.\n\nPointless.\n\nYou can play a card game! Neato! ...except no.\n\nThe cards don't really have much of an affect on anything. You can completely ignore them and still easily beat the game. They're almost entirely cosmetic, essentially only tickling your resources or units, hardly altering them in any meaningful way.\n\nCrap.\n\nYou can play an RTS! Rad! ...except no.\n\nThe only viable strategy is to create a lot of units and send them in one giant blob to your enemy's base, which results in an immediate victory as the AI is flummoxed by this tactic. I'd hardly call that strategy. Strategy involves... well, strategy!\n\nIt feels like the enemy AI was expecting to have a dragon of its own protecting it, which is also suggested by skirmish mode where you pick a dragon type for your AI enemies but they never actually use it. I believe Larian has even admitted to dropping the ball on this one.\n\nSo, ultimately...\n\nIt's a pretty game, yes. But it's all style and absolutely no substance at all. When you play the game, it really does feel like a bad shareware compilation. It leaves an unpleasant aftertaste in your mouth. You'll feel entirely ripped off by the price they're rather optimistically asking for it.\n\nIt's got the depth of toilet paper, and the general design ineptitude of a bad movie tie-in. It's not fun to play, unless your idea of fun is driving a nail into one of your eyeballs. Yes, at first, it'll wow you with its graphical flair, but that's all it has. And that's not worth the entry price. Not remotely. Dragon Commander is a game that looks good until you actually play it.\n\nI find myself wishing they'd stuck with the original idea, which was brilliantly unique and could've ended up being one of the best dragon games on the market. As it is, the amount of 'dragon' in Dragon Commander makes it entirely disingenuous to even call it such. It feels like false advertising to me. A bit of a con, if you will.\n\nIf you're buying this because you're looking for a dragon game? Trust a fellow dragon fan -- save your money. I know that us dragon fans have been longing for a game for us, but this isn't it. This is just an effort to take advantage of us by selling us a shareware compilation disguised as a dragon game. That's the most uncool thing anyone could do, really. And I certainly won't be buying from Larian in the future. I've learned my lesson.","January 27, 2015","false","36.8"," 166 of 243 people (68%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","68","166","243","17","6"

If you're looking for a good RTS game then stay away. Get something like Company of Heroes or Age of Empires instead.\nThe campaign in the game is quite short. It took me 8 hours to finish my first playthrough on normal. The game does, however, have a lot of replay value. This is thanx to the politics system: It mostly adresses a lot of nowadays matters and you can choose what laws to pass and what to disgard.\nFor an example: Legalise gay marriage, weed, let women vote etc etc. There are also 4 different prides you can choose to marry and demon offers you can choose...i know i'm gonna experiment with different choices in my 2nd and 3rd playthrough. I want to see how they all play out and what is the best way to get lots of approval from all races.\nYou can be downright sexist, evil or whatever.\n\nThe game has an excellent voice acting and this makes meddling with politics such a bliss. Each character is perfectly voice acted and this was the first thing that caught my attention in the game.\n\nThe only con with this game is that the battles suck. They are mostly 5-10 minutes long and there's no strategy involved. You quickly realise that in order to win battles you just have to charge at the enemy base immediatly. If you try to build bases, gather armies then you'll just lose because the enemy gets stronger with every second and will eventually become unbeatable.\nBeing a dragon won't help either. Your dragon will be overpowered in the first 2 minutes but gets super weak after that. You will only stay alive for a minute and then wait for respawn. That is why you have to charge at the enemies immediatly... - The strategy in the RTS battles is none existant and is a big dissapointment.\nThat is why i auto resolved most of my matches.\n\nThis is a game for people who like to make decisions and meddle with politics, not for the fans of RTS battles.\nIf you're like me and want to see all different outcomes of the decisions you can make then the game is surely worth it's full price. If you, however, will only play through it once then you'll be highly dissapointed in the 6-9h campaign and should wait for at least a 50% discount.","February 15, 2015","true","8.9"," 53 of 65 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","53","65","3","0"

I found myself enjoying the game's core concepts enough that I could overlook a lot of the poor execution, but not everyone will have the same experience.\n\nFirst off, the bad. The RTS gameplay, which forms the bulk of the game's combat systems, is a mind-numbing clickfest of swarming units around. Everything you own dies almost instantly, to the point where it feels pointless to try to micromanage your units, or even use them wisely - it becomes about trying to get the largest horde and throw it at your enemy's weakest points. Playing across the Risk-like metamap can be a tedious slog if you're waiting around to build units, and auto-resolve usually loses you far more units than necessary. I gambled with a direct strike across the entire map to my enemy's capital in the final stage because I couldn't stand the thought of grinding away at his territory for another several dozen turns; under-prepared and outnumbered, I had to fight that last battle about 10 times before winning, but it still felt worth it to not have to play the metamap anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, being able to transform into a dragon in the RTS battles is fun, especially since, after some practice, it becomes possible to win battles that are almost entirely in the enemy's favour by judicious dragon use (I easily won battles that the game's auto-resolve system gave me a 90%+ chance of losing). This ultimately ends up defeating the purpose of the RTS gameplay, though it's still pretty fun to play around with. One thing that annoyed me was the realization that the only reason the dragon is not totally invincible is because enemy projectiles will home in on you, forever, from across the entire map, which feels like a cheesy design solution.\n\nThe story, politics, and RPG elements that occur between battles on the command ship are where the game really shines. The characters are surprisingly well voiced, the art style is excellent, and the storyline and dilemmas are quite compelling, both on their own as well as in terms of their impact on the game. It's sad to see how an excellent RPG/strategy hybrid is hiding in there, barred from becoming as good as it could be by mediocre RTS design. Another six months of polish and design work could have made a world of difference.","October 11, 2014","true","14.7"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","42","49","0","1"

Divinity Dragon Commander delivers a game with a certain charm about it. (Steampnuk Fantasy anyone?)\n\n1. Let me start with the Music. It is simply Delicious!. It is real good and pleasent to listen to and also a great motivation in battle- least I thought so. I DID NOT buy the imperial edition for the golden jetpack and dragon and concept art, No, I got it for the frickin Delicious soundtrack. (It was only like $1 more for the imperial on a sale.) It was worth it, however it only included 11 soundtracks out of the 24 and it did not include my two most favorite songs. So if you want 13 more bombasticly awesome soundtracks from this game I hope you can do some .WEM file conversion!\n\n2. Graphics are so pretty the only thought that comes to my head is that one fish from spongebob screaming "MY EYES!! MY EYES!!" (if you dunno what spongebob is then I can do nothing but shed a tear for you.)\n\n3. Gameplay reminds me fondly of the Total War games but with like a fantasy twist!, but wait, whats that?? You can be in the battle yourself!? and as a frickin dragon!? Moving units on the map and taking over territory to expand your empire is a thriving desire burning inside me. Build Units, Earn Income, Obtain Research, and interestingly use strategy cards to put luck into your hands!\n\n4. Decision Making. Always a plus in my book and while you can't really tell entirely how your decisions are affecting the world around you it's more or less the thought of it and if you really believe they are. Think of it as kind of reading a book. You have to immerse yourself into it. Into your imagination. IMAGINATION. (Spongebob reference) This may be personal but making these choices based on your point of view personally may just reflect on who you are...PERSONALLY.\n\n5. The Story is long and good enough to keep my attention fully. It makes feel like I really want to be the best Emperor this world has ever seen. (I got to the point I valued my troops lives more then my dragon and would always take point and showering my units with Buffs and Regen to ensure thier survival and to put and end to a battle as quickly as possible.) More then anything though I loved how it made me feel like I really impacted millions of Fantasy Creatures lives as well as humans.

I praise Divinity II: Dragon Knight Saga and Original Sin is IMO one of the best co-op titles in steam. Even so, Dragon Commander is difficult to like as it is also difficult to hate. It mixes so many different elements and genres together (more or less successfully) and was produced so harriedly that devs must have had some compromises.\n\nMajorly gameplay is quite much adapted from 'Total war' series combaining real-time - and turn-based strategy.The game puts player into the boots of Dragon Commander, a powerful dragonbreed, and on each turn on a world map player builds units and constructions and moves his armies to invade new areas. When player and enemy have units at the same area in the end of the turn the blood will spill. In these conflicts player deals with the enemy in real-time combat and gameplay reminds the popular rts -series. Optionally, commander can let the AI sort out the battle by paying a reward one of the generals who increase the precent of success or let the army in the location fight without support.\n\nMost of my playtime I spent on battlefields personally commanding troops and the rts gameplay has its pros and cons.\n\nStarting with the pros. There is various available land -, sea - and air units and each of them have certain special abilities. The resources are collected automatically by constructing settlements on predefined places, that add some hecticism forcing player to act quickly. The genuine feature is ability to assist your troops not just by commanding but to turning a dragon when gameplay transforms into third-person-shooter game. There is also various talents to choose from: some of them are attribute increasing buffs for your units but there is also some heavy weaponry which can blast dozens of enemies at once.\n\nAnd then to the cons. The biggest thing is the lack of maps, which begin inescapably to repeat themself before finishing the game. Secondly, battles are easy to win with most simple strategies and here is a typical scenario: Build units-take a defensive position if outnumbered-destroy enemy assault-build more units-take control of the nearest resource buildings-hire more units-take a defensive position-destroy the enemy assault-take all your units and march into their capital.\nI never felt couraged to use more sophisticated tactic because I never needed one. I didn't have any use for transport ships for an example.\n\nAmong these conquests and war planning there is quite much to do and to decide in a political court also. The population of Rivellon's world is inhabited with 5 different species: Dwarves, Elfs, Imps, Lizards and Undead. As you might guess the values and preferences of these folk differ a lot from each other and it is impossible to please them all. The race which you are bowing may grant populations support on battles fought on their lands whereas the breed you are abandoning may degrace their support. Depending on case, the secondary effect of choice is how much money you make or how much units you can hire on each turn.\n\nAmusing thing is that you'll also earn a liberty to choose a wife between 4 exotic races - I chose undead Ophelia. Ehmm, I don't consider myself a necrophilic person - I did it for the empire. (lol)\n\nAll these events and scandals happening outside of the battles are fun to follow. Some politcal crisis are brilliant improvising our own modern cases and the some decisions have impact how your generals relate to you as war goes by.\n\nHowever, dealing with all this politc jumbo is not as hard as I first imagined. I always had at least the 50% support of each race and all I needed to do was to be victoriuos in battlefields and to take a side of a majority in cases. The nightmares of crisises and political challenges faded away just too easily that partly ruined the good idea.\n\nAll in all Dragon Commander deserves good rating.  Dragon Commander is a sum of many compromises and might lose a part of its potential after promising start but on the other hand it has some wonderful moments. Engaging as a dragon for your troops' support in battles was something that you don't see everyday and it was always fun to watch and hear how others were reacting when undead wanted to legalize Necromatism for an example. On its full price I can't recommend it, but on sale a fan of light strategy should give it a try.","September 18, 2015","true","26.3"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","26","29","2","0"

Admittedly, the gameplay is lackluster in both the strategy and combat phases; it was not long before I habitually skipped tactical battle for auto-resolution.  But where Divinity: Dragon Commander really shines is in the diplomacy phase – the phase of each turn where you take a step back from world conquest to deal with management of your empire through the enacting of laws and policies.  Your empire has racial factions, each with their own dominant political, social and religious sensibilities.  Sure, their representatives are largely caricatures of modern political stances, but they still manage to bring arguments to the table that push you to evaluate your choices.\n\nEvery decision will have consequences – in the very least, they will alter how favorably each faction views you, and can have other (sometimes quite unexpected) impacts as well.  Displease the dwarves too often, and you might find your royal coffers running on empty.  Make the imps happy enough, and they’ll offer up the opportunity to gain a fantastic and horrible new bomb… if only you’ll allow them to mine in the one place where the mystical material they need can be found (despite, you know, the whole “sacred elven burial site” nonsense).  Divinity: Dragon Commander was surprisingly good at making me examine if and when I would embrace practicality or expediency over my personal sense of right and wrong.\n\nThe diplomacy phase also includes dealing with your military generals, each of which bring their own personalities, problems and histories to the war room.  In addition, you will enjoy a diplomatic marriage that will bolster your approval rating, at least initially, with one of the races; but your wife adds an entirely new substory to navigate through, with multiple possible outcomes.\n\nThe diplomacy phase of this game is rich enough to not only play the game for, but to replay it until you have exhausted all the diplomatic possibilities.  And since maintaining high enough favor with a faction will open up surprising new avenues, there is a lot of possibilites to explore and enjoy.","December 1, 2014","true","76.5"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"

I purchased this game simply for my love of RTS strategy and the insane(ly good) concept of dragon combat.\n\nSo what does this game do right?\n\nThere is an interesting research system integrated into the game, research is conducted through research points that you pick up per turn depending on the territories controlled and the buildings on those territories.\n\nThe politics system is actually a lot of fun (though frustrating at times) and a large part of the game. Political decisions are made throughout the game knowingly or not.  For example if you build far many buildings in your controlled territories you can lose reputation with the elves (which are predictably nature orientated). Every turn or so you vote on some initiatives brought up by certain representatives and can lose or gain reputation points. At first you might think, so what? However, since each faction inhabits certain territories the amount of troops can build or the resources you gain per territory are highly dependent on how much that faction likes you.\n\nAdditionally, also must manage your responses to your friendly generals and the princess you choose to “woo” as well. Dialogue options between these characters lead to some pretty significant outcomes during the game so it is wise to pay attention to the characters and faction personalities.\n\nOh and by the way I can't really stress enough that each voiced character you come across has a unique personality that will develop over time with their own specific needs and wants.\n\nDragon combat, how how I love you. During the normal RTS strategy portions you can become a dragon and blaze around the combat area using specific abilities and really punishing enemies that come against you.\n\nSo what didn’t I like about this game?\n\nCombat can feel really messy without there being much strategy that just having "more" than the other opponent. Sure there are a ok sized amount of abilities for each class and each class has a counter class (or building) but it really feels under utilized.\n\nCombat on higher difficultly levels can be extremely punishing. Each territory can only draft so many troops before it is tapped out, this encourages you to expand into fresh territories. However if the enemy decides to attack a tapped out territory that doesn't have a large amount of troops stationed on it, there won't be much of a way to fight back.\n\nWhat kind of irked me as well is that no matter how many troops I had at the end of each act it seems that there is a standard set amount placed around the map when starting a new chapter.  This kind of took away from my sense of accomplishment when taking down an enemy and managing my armies.\n\nFinally, I felt the game drags a bit on the final act not really giving you much to do besides to slug it out with the final enemies until the end.  For me, this was kind of a unsatisfying conclusion and would have liked to see even more personally engaging missions involving your generals, allies, or princess.","June 6, 2015","true","33.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

It also has some awesome music. Get dis game.\nEach of the 3 areas are somewhat simplified, though; The RTS portion doesn't have as much depth from say....pretty much any other RTS on the market. The Risk/Turn-Based portion is fairly simple. And the diplomacy pretty much boils down to binary choices (though they are interesting choices and is more than just good vs. evil). But all these pieces, together, make up something greater than the sum. It lends itself to somewhat of a Civ-like "JUST ONE MORE TURN!" addiction.

It's basically 3 mini games in one, you have the risk style battle map, the animated and voiced interactions with your retinue onboard your flagship, which is meant to serve as the political/diplomacy portion. And then ofcourse the actual meat and potatoes of the game, the RTS style gameplay.\n\n1)Strategy map.\nWay too simplistic, felt very empty and lacked purpose. AI moves were predictable. I don't like the card system either, for example there is a card to commit genocide in a region of your choice. It just feels all too easy, would of been better to have raider units, which you must create and then transport to the region. But no, you just plonk down a card and suddenly the job is done.\n\n2)Ship interactions (household and military retinue)\nFully voiced and looks ok. But feels more like a slide show presentation sometimes, for example, you could be talking to one of your aids, then pick one of the limited dialog options and your aid will suddenly change stance or move location slighty instead of it being a seamless animation, it feels each bit was stiched together haphazardly.\n\n3)RTS battle game\nProbably the bit I was looking forward to the most, and the bit that disapointed me the most. The UI is clunky and way too large, it obstructs a large part of the screen. The actual fights are super easy, once you get to grips with buildings and managing your recruits, it very quickly becomes a snore fest. And the novelty of being a dragon in battle wears off after the first 5 minutes when you come to realise that being a dragon just made the game even easier.\n\nIt might be worth playing for the story, if you like that sort of thing. But if you're looking for a totalwar style game with dragons, then this is probably going to leave you with buyer's remorse.\n","December 28, 2015","false","3.2"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","30","42","2","0"

The Risk-like stragey board is servicible. The star atraction here is interacting with the characters on your ship. Reminiscent of the adventure game ship stuff from Starcraft 2, except here Dragon Commander actually comes out on top. The choices you have have little impact on gameplay, but just getting the reactions from the characters is worth it.

It IS a strategy game but an incredibly simple one, and not in a good way. There isn't much to it other than spam units and zerg rush capture points, which does involve strategy but in the same way a sandwich involves bread. Very simple, little depth, and not a huge amount of strategy.\n\nAlot of people don't care about the units they command, some people only play certain factions for the bonuses or the way they fight and so on. I, personally can't really enjoy a game unless I like the aethetics, so units in an RTS are a HUGE part for me and I probably just won't ever consider playing an entire faction just because I hate the way the units look. That said, I don't like the units in the game. I understand what they were going for, but it's weird and kind of dumb. Had what your entire army is assembled of been special units, I might be alright with it, but ALL OF YOUR UNITS ARE WALKERS. Every single one, and it's BORING. Really really really boring. The blimps and airships are fine, but ALL of the land units are so unbelievably dull and boring.\n\nMap design in this game is quite fun. Had this game been a bit strategic, it would be a classic. Bottlenecks, choke points, high ground, the works. While fights are typically decided by face smashing zergs together, over all battles are decided by who manipulates the map.\n\nSpeaking of maps, there's a campaign map. And, yes I do like campaign maps. There's not a vast collection of campaign maps to choose from, but it's forgiveable. The Campaign map in Dragon Commader is actually quite good. It's design and style is fun and makes you feel like an emporer moving his pawns about the field. It's got some depth that doesn't leave much to be desired.\n\nWassat? You said Dragons? You say\nYou say you Dragons?\nYes, you can be a Dragon.\nYou wanna be a Dragon? Cause you can be a dragon.\nWassat? You wanna know if it's fun?\nYou're a Dragon.\nYou fly around at hyperspeed and blow ♥♥♥♥ up with fire and acid.\nWhat do you want me to say? You're a dragon. Yes, it is fun.\n\nThis is all fun, but there's more. There's an almost Elder Scrolls, rpg social aspect to this game. There's a whole thing with you getting a princess and all kinds of ♥♥♥♥ and ♥♥♥♥ you I married the Dwarf you're jealous. That's what we call a run-on sentence. One of the things that's very enjoyable is the ability to make decisions within your Empire. This means that, on top of conquering other empires, you get to feel more like it's your empire slowly devouring the world. And these decisions make small, but sometimes noticeable changes to your empire. Yes, I allowed public nudity and for Elves to be industrially cremated for the purpose of Imp nukes to be mass produced.\n\nShould you buy it?\nCan you tell me another game that allows you to create a Elvish Holocaust for the sole purpose of producing Imp warheads to level entire cities while you, a dragon with a giant jetpack, swoops overhead melting everything with acid and brimstone?","September 23, 2014","true","82.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","14","15","3","0"

This game has high production values and is very polished, but it is a very very short game. There just isn't enough content. I beat the single player campaign in 12 hours on my first try on normal. There are a couple game mechanics quirks that you can exploit to make the game a breeze once you learn them.\n\nThere seems to be a push to have you play multiplayer but this isn't a popular enough game to really find others to play with. The RTS controls are mostly primitive, and dragon form doesn't really last long enough (and isn't really effective enough) compared with RTS controls to really be a big part.\n\nThat said, I still give it a thumbs up because the dialogue is witty, the voice acting is well done, the world is refreshing, and there are innovations here that I enjoy. It just all ended too soon. I have a general rule - each dollar of a game should last me at least 1 hour, so a $40 game should give me at least 40 hrs of enjoyment to be worth the price. This game is therefore a "thumbs up" at about $10-15, but not a good value after that. I will try the custom maps and maybe change my review, but given that the best part of this game is not empire management and combat, but the characters and politics engine, it really is a better fit as a single player, story-driven game.","December 14, 2014","true","12.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

Though it can improve on a few areas.\n\nThe good points are the characters, game decisions, the battle map and the story.\n\nFor one all the characters are like a cross of Steam Punk with Fantacy.  I loved the Dwarven Ambassador with a wolf belt across his back with a gold pocket watch in his vest.  As well as the Lizard man who played a well educated gentleman, complete with a monicole and ego.\nThe Princess were all hot, even the Undead princess (don't judge me).  Each one came complete with a backstory to include elements for a story development.\nThese game choices did have an effect in the game, I will point that out.  The more a race liked you, then if you owened land with that race, they would support your war effort.\n\nThe War Map was like Total War meets Risk.  Ever spot of territory gave a bonus to gold, race, research and troop production.  The way the A.I. handles itself there is a level of strategy involved.\n\nThe means of RTS were unique, the only resource were the population of the map.  Generated by a specific building type.  Plus to get the building to amass new troops (Infantry, Tanks, Naval, Airships) you capture a building plot then tell it to build that specific building.\n\nThe negative points however were things like the overal design of RTS combat, the dragon controls.\n\nThe RTS element felt more like a zerg rush mixed with Rock, Paper, Sissors.  In the end I would just amass a huge army of varied types and let them flood into the enemy stronghold.\nNot too mention the designs of the troops were very poor, imo.  Nothing unique to stnd out.  Everything was Steam Punk themed, yet everything looked like it was made out of wood and 'magic'.  the only cool troop types were the blimps and the naval ships.\n\nThe dragon controls took some getting use to.  Though as a Dragon, you can only fly and breath fire.  I was hoping for more abilities like going Godzilla on a base.  Or even just kicking around the enemy troops.  But you're restricted to flying and fire breath.\n\nIn summation, the game is not at all bad, it has possibilities to be improved upon.  But the story and game are relatively short.  I got the game and beat it in 3 days.  That's b/c I learned to farm gold and strategy cards.\nIt deserves a 3 out of 5, though in stead of a thumbs up I give it a side ways hand wave "meh".","February 13, 2015","true","29.0"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

It takes an hour or two to wrap ones head around it all. The balance of the game deteriorates the further you get into it as I found on my play-through on Normal difficulty.  It was still a very fun experience because you continuously master all of the systems and use them to utterly destroy your opponents.\n\nEveryone has been touting the game's characters and the political decisions you make based on their proposals. This is by far the best part of the game. Decision making is interesting because it often rewards you even if you thought there could have been severe detriments to your empire. Great writing and voice acting overall.\n\nThe real time strategy (rts) portion of this game has a learning curve. If you have ever played an rts that relies on heavy hotkey usage like Starcraft, you should be able to master it very quickly. The best part of the rts is playing as the dragon and gaining advantages on the AI by using it to pick off units or obliterate groups with the end game abilities. There are a lot of unit abilities you can use to gain advantages as well. Two that I recommend are the warlock meteor and the trooper's spoils of war.\n\nThe one main problem with the rts portion of the game is that if you have a greater than 60%+ chance to win, the battle boils down to selecting all of your units and attacking the enemy base right at the start. At that point I just started using the Auto-Resolve system whereby the Generals conduct battles automatically similar to the board game RISK. Unlike RISK, though, I've never had a significantly larger force lose because of dice rolls...Maps where you have 50% or less chance of winning actually take some strategy to beat, but the AI has flaws in its behavior that are exploitable, especially with the dragon. If you have less than 20% chance to win, then you might as well retreat and come back at a later turn.\n\nOverall it is a good thing that the game lets you skip useless or tedious battles.","December 5, 2013","true","21.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

It's part RTS, part empire sim, part card game, and all these mechanics play well together.  That being said, the game's core content seems to be the combat system which is engaging as the novelty of being a dragon with a jet pack doesn't fade quickly. The scenarios are rather unispired though and I found myself skipping many battles later in the game.  Aside from that, the only flaw I can say the game has is a far too heavy handed approach of introducing real world political topics into the game.  Issues such as same sex marriage, universal healthcare, etc, all show up in the game with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.  There's some designer bias in these topics but, for the most part, each decision is given as having pros and cons.   Ultimately the decision-making at these junctures are a bit jarring from the fantasy aesthitic the rest of the game presents and I can't help but feel the game would be better off without, or with at least more fantasy inspired controversy.   All-in-all the game is great fun and beautiful to look at but mediocre combat scenarios and blatently obvious political topic insertions hold the game back.","December 16, 2013","true","11.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/243950/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I'm fairly certain StarCraft 2 used some of the elements in this game to make it more appealing.\n\nI bought this game on sale thinking for the price it was seemed worth it. The RTS/first person action as well as the RPG elements in the game drew my attention this way. I got a lot more than a hybrid game. If someone is looking for a game to occupy their time with a ludicrous amount of content, this is it.\n\nThe game layout is simple was done extremely well, which makes it easy to pick up and play.  You start off in a diplomacy room, with a bunch of different species with completely different opinions. There are many diplomats and generals that are on your main ship where you command who are there to offer advice. You can see other rooms such as your throne room (when you eventually choose a wife), research rooms, and diplomatic rooms. The dialogue itself in this game is top notch, but for some players it may be overbearing. Animations were done carefully and creatively. Some diplomats, while others were talking, would make gestures in the back. When dealing with the varying diplomatic races, you have to be careful in accepting certain laws. While some diplomats will side with the legislation, others will oppose it. Those races who oppose it, your diplomatic popularity among them will be effected due to the decision. These decisions (such as instating conscription) have direct effect on you strategy, or even your gold. Generals will also have their say and may need your intervention. On the Raven (or the mother ship), the player can decide which units to unlock (through research points) or spend those points to unlock special abilities for the dragon. Like the dragon, certain units have special abilities that can turn opponents into a lady bug (why they chose that I'm not sure). Cards play sometimes a vital part within the game. Some cards disturb opponent villages, while other cards will enable you to deploy more units within a battle. The battle RTS scheme mixed in with turns (on the main strategic map) makes the game unique. I wish other developers would look to expand their horizons in this fashion. They took it even further as to give you your own dragon to control while your units fight. After you tend to diplomatic situations, you go to the strategic map room (or the bridge). You can make or move units, as well as play strategic cards to help your struggle. If an enemy has an abundance of a certain unit, cards exist to inhibit movement of certain units. Other cards exist to boost your war party, or a boost to your economy. Once the turn is ended by the player, the computers make their moves and battles. The player observes as they plan their actions. When the battles are available, the player must choose whether to send (and pay) a general to command battle or run the war themselves. By the player choosing to fight here (the dragon commander), the player may not fight in another location as their general is left up to the task. Due to that, the games decisions can be a bit rough over time as you may run the risk of losing an area if you are not proper with your battle decisions. This is a exemplary feature in game. I find the game play overall to be a simplified version of an RTS, but none the less is fun. There are no real buildings to build in random locations, rather the building foundations are given on the map and the player needs to approach them in proximity to control it. Only by having control may a player build shortly after. Calling your Dragon into battle is cool but really requires someone to read the controls or you end up button mashing everything trying to call it in (F1-F3 buttons). I find there was a good balance put into battling, planning (on the main map), as well as the diplomatic side of what's going on on the ship. The game feels well balanced. The battles may lack for some, but others will enjoy the simplistic approach.\n\nThe amount of visual effects in this game are astounding. Menu's you would find otherwise stagnant, always have something going on in the background. The characters themselves in game have awesome animations and everything from them to the environment was carefully drawn. There is no shortage of graphics here. Sounds are fulfilling and explosion sounds are varying. The dragon attack sounds may get annoying after playing a few times. Music was also extremely well done. I think when you get immersed into a game, you start feeling it's full effects when the music plays to it's tune.\n\nOverall I thought it was fun, not the best RTS out there, but gives players a different experience! If you support game diversity, and like RTS and sort of FPS mixed together, this may be for you. I would also recommend playing on easy first because damn can this game get hard. I would say that this should be a game on everyone's library (for a proper price of course :).\n\nFor future DDC games, please incorporate the ability to control one of your units! When you die, you automatically jump to another unit! Also, having generals by your side is a neat feature, especially when it comes to assignment who to fight a battle. Perhaps add RPG elements so the generals are more dynamic in abilities than static. It would add another depth to the game. Also, try to get more people playing multiplayer!\n\nRock Solid : 8/10\n\nScreenShots :\nThe first thing you will see when starting campaign\n\nWhat is must feel like being the president\n\nAt the start of a new turn, you get a quick update of what is happening around Rivellon and your diplomatic popularity\n\nThere are no supply depots to up the unit limit, rather there is a set population you can only work with\n\nYou can bring in your dragon into battle and help your units by deploying specials to inhibit the enemies\n\nA view of what a neutral foundation would look like (no dragon in this screenshot, only units)\n\nYou can command your units and fight with your dragon simultaneously\n\nThe potential wives I get to pick from.

The game didn't show, explain or make me understand what was going on.\n\nI did enjoy the RPG elements. The goblin where I could upgrade units. The magician to upgrade the dragon. The council to make decisions and the politics. Where one commander didn't like you and changed his mind after a few battles. Stuff like that great. But other than that the game was not for me.\n\nI would have enjoyed to have a more strategic way of fighting. Would be cool if each zone needed to be taken over by creating a base rather than just killing off the enemies with some RNG mechanic. I didn't like the game much at all combat wise which is the main part of the game. Thus I won't recommend it.

I got it on sale for $25 and still feel ripped off. $10 would be the max.\n\nThe strategic board and RTS are shoddy and awful (again, I went into this not expecting it to be the next Starcraft). They wouldn't even be good as free flash games.\n\nSo that leaves the conversational political sim. The political support you get for different decisions ends up not mattering. The support you get from each race only affects battle you manually resolve (maximum of one battle per turn) and even then it only affects your max army size which is never a limiting factor.\n\nSo you're left with only reading the conversations for the dialog. This is probably the strongest area of the game, but not enough to justify the whole thing. The voice acting is uniformly excellent (surprising, giving how they skimped on the gameplay portions), and some of the characters are entertaining.\n\nBut then the cracks start showing. All the political decisions are based on current political topics, but they don't even bother throwing on a layer of clever satire so it all comes off as preachy and break the immersion (would a general involved in a world wide war of genocide really care about coming out of the closet?). Heck, I'm a donating, card carrying member of the ACLU and even I found this game to be simplistic leftist preaching. Some the political views the game preaches are downright disturbing. The "good" path has you encouraging vigilante murder of people with backwards bigoted opinions, and eliminating due process fair trials for anyone accused of ♥♥♥♥. It feels like the game was written by Tumblr users eager to shred the bill of rights in the name of a twisted form of social justice.\n\nIn the end, the only redeeming aspects of the game are some of the conversations. I recommend you save your money and your time (the RTS and strategic gameplay is really really awful) and just go watch all the conversations up on Youtube.","March 12, 2014","false","15.2"," 72 of 135 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","72","135","0","1"

Everything it does, it does mediocre. It has trouble finding a true audience because if you take each of it's elements, RTS, Turn-based Strategy Maps, Unit Upgrades, Dynamic Story Progression, Politics, etc. you can easily find a better game that outmatches this one in every aspect. The real downer is that this is the only game I know of of it's kind. You'd be hard pressed to find a game that combines all of these amazing elements into one game, it's just such a pity that they didn't put more effort into them because then it would be amazing.\n\nThe Real-Time Strategy battles are very bland, the map, units, and buildings are not exciting to look at, and battles are just very uninteresting exchanges of little fireballs. The "strategy" element is virtually non-existent, it encourages Zerg tactics of just building fast and attacking fast. There's no sense of "going your own pace", the way the battles are set up, if you don't push hard early on you'll lose whatever tactical advantage you may have.\n\nUsing your dragon avatar in battle is very novel, but unfortunately it stops as being just a novelty, it rarely impacts the battle in a significant enough way and as the game progresses it becomes more of a tool to prevent enemy dragons from wrecking your own troops rather than an advantage you have over your enemies.\n\nThe political RPG aspect has some shine to it as each character is interesting, well animated, and has a real sense of personality and their own agenda. It however falls flat as you realize that most choices you make are between two arbitrary extremes that will please one side but not another, forcing you to make decisions more on which factions you want to appease than on your own personal agenda.\n\nFinally the Turn-based tactical map is also very bland and even less interesting to look at than the first Total War game (Shogun). You can do very little, limited to building a single thing per turn, and deciding which territory to move your troops between. It's not bad per se, but basically comes down to very basic chess, moving your units between where you need a defensive line and where you expect there to be an enemy vulnerability.\n\nAll in all it's not a bad game but it's very middle of the road. I can't really reccomend it to anyone but I don't want to bash it because it did take a big risk in doing what it did, combining multiple elements into a single game idea, and I personally feel it could work well if each element was given more. As it stands, it's a great concept with bland uninspired execution, but is one I feel could be done well.\n\nIf you must get it, I would suggest waiting until it's on sale.","June 30, 2014","false","2.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The look of this game is excellent, the characters are interesting, and the mixture of rpg and turn-based strategy elements blend nicely in many regards. That's where my compliments end.\n\nFirst off this game does not seem to have a pause button of any sort (Keyboard, game ui, nothing) when you are fighting the actual battles. The controls in dragon form are also rather weird in my opinion. Your dragon alos doesn't really play as big of a role in battle as one would thing. While it can help turn the tide in some cases, you are often better building regular units and dumping research into them instead of your dragon. I get this as a balance, but I expected something a bit more impressive considering it's one of the main focuses for the game.\n\nSadly, the combat is also a bit boring after awhile. You see it less as a battle of two or more armies and more as a battle between blobs. Often your best bet is to just bull rush your enemy and kill his small initial force if possible or turtle until they can no longer rebuild units.  As a rts game, I have to say that is sucks.

While Dragon Commander is composed of elements drawn from a half-dozen or so different genres, it deftly synthesizes those elements to create something truly unique and utterly satisfying.

The mass effect-esq hub part where you make decisions on issues and politics, movement phase like RISK where you move your units and produce buildings, and battle phase that you either auto-resolve it or you take part on it as RTS. The game overall is very enjoyable and the effort the developers put into the game is definitely shining in most parts.\n\nThe comments during the hub section are interesting, as all the characters in the game possesses certain kind of extremism that you have to decide upon. For the races, each races possesses certain characteristics. Undeads have religious zeal, Dwarves have tendency on mercantilism, elves are eco-liberals and traditionalists, lizards are secular and democratic, and imps tend to be technocratic and overall whacky. Generals are the same too. You have Edmund, the egotistical genius, Henry, your typical hot-head lone wolf, Catherine, a radical feminist, and Scarlett, whose sorta there (She does participate in the conflict, but never a center of it). The most intersting part is the decision making. Based on your political and religious belief, you have to shape the empire yourself. And these have real consequence on battlefield too. The racial relations based on these decisions add certain emotional investment too.\n\nI won't spoil much, but I did enjoy these decision makings and exploring story arc very much, and I consider this was the best part of the game.\n\nRISK style management is not too bad, but not too good either. It's rather generic and feels like it's tacked on. So not much positive or negative from that.\n\nHowever, the RTS..it's heaping mess. Unit balance is awful, as the units tend to group together resulting in later game those who secure most AoE units to be the most successful. Further more the excessive requirement for "micromanagement" just makes the game even more generic and makes the defend-and-snowball tactics too be uniformly the best. Dragons are not much help either. You are simply too powerful and the cost of you spawning is too cheap. As a result, almost every game is you trapping AI to funnel in it's unit into your position, demolish them using either healing ability of your dragon or directly assisting the attack, and snowball afterwards.\n\nSo if you expect a RTS game, no this is not for you. This is more like good politically active (since there's no really right or wrong answers except for few instances) visual novel with tacked on RTS game.\n\nSo there you have my review. If you like mass effect style decision making and meeting interesting character, by all means this game is great. If you are into good RTS? I'd stay with DoW series, Total War series, Homeworld series, and many others that are way more worthy than this game.","March 22","true","21.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Graphics are good.  Stories and characters are enjoyable.  Not too cartoony/hokey either.  I like the handling of military and political issues.  Early on I find it difficult to manage gold wisely buying troops vs. having a reserve to pay your generals if you happen to need them.  I really enjoy the many mini-video clips to show you how different units and abilities works so you can better understand them before you invest in them.  That greatly reduces the trial & error aspect of skill trees of these kinds of games.\n\nThe voice of demon Corvus (Alastair Parker) sounds very similar to The Mouth of Sauron (Don Messick) in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King movie.\n\nI do wish that homosexuality wasn't as significant of a political theme - I'm barely into Act 2 and already have had like 4 turns of NPC dialogs about the issue.  Political issues are understandably familiar so that you can get into it more easily. Realistically any political decision you make will thrill and anger a portion of your population.  Dealing with religious zealot Undead, hippy eco-communist Elves, greedy capitalist Dwarves, elitist Lizardmen, and ... (something I haven't quite figured out) Imps can wear you down if you just care about conquest and not governance.  Your decisions do affect bonus and penalties in the RTS part of the game.\n\nSo far the only replayability of this game lies in different role-playing choices of your wife, different decisions on political issues, and different levels of cooperation with the demon Corvus.","October 16, 2014","true","13.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Larian Studios developed and published the game on the 6th August 2013.\n\nThe game itself is unique in that it blends politics into your strategy. You can either play single player and skirmish on ten different maps for the classic RTS game or play on a board (much like Risk) where you move your units to conquer territories and gain resources. The turn-based strategy was very amusing because you could decide whether to fight in the battle yourself (dragon) or have one of your generals auto-resolve the fight. Each one giving a higher rate of success depending on the terrian and units used.\n\nBut the biggest selling point in this game is the dragon, you can control three different dragons that has varies specialties such as melee, magic or a mix of both. The game does very well to give you a feeling of empowerment when you use the dragon, some of the late game abilities can turn into battles whether you rain fire or boost your troops with buffs.\n\nHowever, this game has it's flaws. One of which is the micro-management required to use both dragon and unit abilities. For example: Warlocks (the flying blimps) have several abilities and damage the enemy. While in dragon form, you're very limited to managing your soldiers. Either selecting troops in the area or all troops. This makes it difficult to then combine both unit abilities and your own.\n\nThe game also has a beautiful narrative, characters and the political system and dialogue on this game really makes this game feel like an epic fantasy along with the OST used. Some choices you make politically can hinder or boost your performance in turn-based and real-time because of the support you have in the region.\n\nTL;DR Summery;\n\nPros -\n\n1. Fantastic Character development. Edmund for example was my favourite.\n2. Political system is very diverse, often challenging your morality vs strategic importance.\n3. The OSD is very under-rated in this game, the OST does a great job of giving you the epic fantasy awe.\n4. Voice acting in this was outstanding, Corvus was a character that had a very chilling/demon-like voice.\n5. Mechanics of the game are fluent. The game allows you to research upgrades for your troops and dragon, very fun in particular in turn-based.\n6. The dragon adds amazing replayability value to your battles, giving you the sense of empowerment and fun as you rain down fire and brimstone.\n\nCons -\n\n1. Story falls short, with the maps being recycled in turn for bigger board maps.\n2. Micro-management between varies troops and your dragon offers difficult learning curve for new players.\n3. Troops are the same for all factions. No variety in troops often means you'll be spamming units for cannon fodder until you have enough resources to build high-tier troops.\n4. The dragon brings balancing issues in multiplayer games, with some games lasting merely minutes from dragon rushing.\n5. The RTS element of the game could use work with the same maps being played over again, the camera angle feels rigid and the dragon could use more fluent movement. Unable to fluently fly except for one direction makes it hard to dog-fight other dragons.\nFor example: Using jet-pack thrusters can only mean you travel in one specific direction. You are unable to turn while using jet-pack thrusters made me feel very immobile while casting abilities and auto-attacks.\n\nRating 7-8/10\n\nHighly unique RTS game that blends both epic fantasy and politics with a refreshing sense of originality.","March 21, 2015","true","19.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Your job is to unite the world under your banner, and oust your siblings. A good ol' Monarchy story. Nothing really unique, nothing really special. Only one real plot twist, and its not exactly a twist.\n\nThe characters are fairly interesting, and truly fill in what they were set out to fill. There's a hardy, loud, angry, general. There's an arrogant to a fault general. There's a lesiban general, and there's a general who hates men. Each one truly does feel like each seperate, but I could not for the life of me connect to them. Each one is so far into their niche, that being that far into it IS the only way to connect to them. The choices you make (I believe three each) for them will give them bonus stats and somewhat change their character to a degree, but even beyond that, I still found myself hating all but one of them.\n\nThe Politicans are also very well fit characters; you have the Religious Undead, The Nature Loving Elves, The Money Loving Dwarves, Logical Lizards, and Tinkering Imps. Each unique and each bring up propositions that connect to them...most of which I found myself voting downard. Several that were proposed would only benefit that race, and all the other's would disagree with them (Two for the Undead, One for the Elves, Three for the Dwarves, Two for the Lizards, and Three for the Imps). Several major choices (Equal pay for the sexes, gay marriage, etc.), aren't even presented, but can only have your word in them by talking to certain people who are in the areas (Bridge and Bar are the most). I think in total I only passed about four or five things presented, and ended up rejecting the rest.\n\nDefining the spouse is a little tricky as I have only completed one playthrough and therefore only had one wife. Therefore I feel as though I cannot truly review this, but I can say I feel the dialouge for the Lizard Spouse is far too short (Only was about three events).\n\n(Plot Twist Spoilers)\nCorvus (to me) was the only really interesting character, as being a giant demon head wired to the ship. I do plan on doing a quick replay (as I had skipped Corvus' options in case of moral drawbacks), to find out what he offers, but seeing how the game itself became fairly easy when he was revealed...I'm not expecting much.\n\nNow for the gameplay\n\nOne part is a Risk type map, and a VERY small part of it is the actual RTS.\nYou can only take phyiscal control of one battle per turn, so unless you boil each turn to one fight (highly unlikely in chapter two), then you won't be playing a RTS, but rather an easy version of Risk.\n\nYou can only use one general as well per turn, so even with the choice of four, you only get the option once. If you've already used your RTS turn, and a general; then you're left the the basic % chance of victory presented to you.\nThe Risk map is very simple and rather easy, as all it litterally is is massing an army and take over each area per turn. There is no real strategy, as every fight (including the RTS), becomes a slugfest, that you will ended up winning most of the time.\n\nFor the RTS battles, are fairly easy as well. Chances are the only real trouble you will have are the Capitol battles, and even then there are only three enemies you have to be careful of: Warlocks, Imp Fighters, and Anti-Air Missles (which your opponent will build in their main base 75% of the time). Even though the game warns you that as a dragon form you can't take on whole armies at once....but you really can. After obtaining about four certain skills you can whipe armies off the map and then fly off and solo a base. I found myself simple flying over an army, fearing it, using a pillar of flame to burn them, then Eye of Patriarch to remove another army. Any damage taken is removed with either the pillar of healing or the self heal spell.\n\nDespite all my gripings I did enjoy it, as it is visually appealing, and some of the characters lines did make me laugh. Obviously it had my attention enough to beat it and obtain all of the units and dragon abilities.\n\nAll in all however, I do not recommend Divinity: Dragon Commander. Is it worth its $40 price tag? No. Worth it on sale however? Yes. Just make sure you have the space for it, because the visual appeal is most of what it has going for it.","April 16, 2014","false","13.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CynthiaTheHeartsCollector/recommended/243950/","CynthiaTheHeartsCollector","Shirome Artiste","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CynthiaTheHeartsCollector/","66 products in account","Time for another mini-review.\n\nThis time Dragon Commander gets the "honour" of being reviewed, as usual it'll be split up between gameplay and game itself.\n\nSo, for those that don't know the game at all, a quick summary: You're the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of the previous king. Said king got murdered by his own sons and daughters because he became an incompetent, weak-willed wimp. Now the lands are tossed into civil war, and that's where you come in. The court mage tells you to "go and conquer the world, good luck kid." Oh, and he gives you an airship that houses a demon. The game itself revolves around three chapters that tell the tale of your success. In two of the three chapters you fight your sibs, and the final chapter is you versus the demon.\nThe game itself plays around capturing territories in a way that kind of looks like a cross between Risk and Total-War series, in which you build/get armies and move them across the board. Combat is fought either via autoresolve or manual RTS-esque battles.\n\n\nNow, gameplay.\n\nGood points:\nDilemmas: The dilemmas are easy to understand, are of import even today and all advisors give well fleshed out reasons as to why you should vote "yay" or "nay". In addition, managing people's opinions of you does pay off during battles!\nAutoresolve is pretty fair, your generals cost a bit and can only be used once a turn. Quite a neat feature and in this case it's wholly possible to fairly beat the game using only autoresolve!\nResearch is important, can be tailored to play-style and holds a key role in winning.\nCards. If you've ever played Risk you know that getting a good few cards can change the game. Here the cards hold a little bit of a different role, giving you in-battle bonusses, giving the enemy in-battle negatives, giving you extra soldiers for an easy autoresolve or build/destroy on the campaign map. You'll learn to love the cards.\n\nBad points:\nManually fought battles are zerg rushes. If you don't know what zerg rushes are? Shame on you. Still, don't expect much tactical play in manual games aside from perhaps going overboard with the dragon.\nAI is...disappointing.\nThere has been quite some debate about chapter 3 being overly difficult or not, but allow me to say that chapter 2 can be exploited infinitely to end up with nigh-infinite gold and all research done, taking out a large chunk of difficulty.\nDragon form. You can either exploit the living toodles out of it, or never end up using it at all. I personally used the dragon occasionally to heal big armies, but never found that I could not possibly win without using the dragon.(And I autoresolved a lot).\n\n\nNon-gameplay related.\nGood:\nWell-fleshed out story, laced with humorous interactions, plethora of diverging storylines and choices to be made. For fans of  Mass Effect-like choice options, rejoice!\nYou get to pick a princess, what more is there to like? In all seriousness: Princess storylines are a matter of opinion, some love them but there are those that hate them too. I personally liked the storylines I've had, but it's up to you to judge in the end.\nCharacter interaction is well-thought, you'll probably come to care about at the least a few of the side characters, and with such a plethora of personalities there's bound to be someone you like.\n\nBad:\nDilemmas at times end up being a bit to complicated to just say "Yay" or "Nay" to, and at times are worded in a way that while you actually agree with the thought behind it, the way it's set up makes you disagree.\nReputation with factions are going to be near-maxed regardless of initial choices, unless you literally take EVERY opportunity to disagree with one particular faction. During my first playthrough I found myself initially disagreeing with the undead a lot, but ended up with 80% approval with them by the end of chapter 2, even though I torpedo'd almost all of their proposals.\nIt's a bit of a debatable point, as I personally disagree, but there are quite a few people that dislike some of the side character storylines. While I do not share their opinion, I feel that I'd be remiss if I were not to warn you that there ARE people that do not like said storylines, and you might end up being one of them.\n\n\nPersonal verdict:\nI had a blast with this game, well worth what I paid for it.\n7.5 out of 10, and a recommendation for people that like a mix between a RPG and a tactical game.","November 28, 2013","true","13.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The game has an interesting mix of RPG, turn-based strategy, RTS and combat. RPG elements are well done, characters are colourful and the issues discussed seem well presented and real. Unfortunately they are just a background to the conquest game. This is done in turns on a Risk-like map, unfortunately it has complexity close to Risk too... When you go into combat you get an RTS during which you can transform into a dragon to blast things away. Actually the dragon part is really, really fun, probably the best part of the game, sadly RTS part suffers from the same problems as the strategic map - it is really, really simplistic. That's understandable as parts of it you will spend as a dragon, but you can't win this way, ignoring the RTS combat and it is really bland...\n\nDragon Commander has too much put together, some of these elements are really good, some really bad, trouble is, a game like this needs to get everything right to be really enjoyable.","April 12, 2014","false","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Very very bad.\n- Dragon mode is simplistic; shoot fireballs at things until they go boom.\n- Exploitable overworld map structure\n\nOverall: Dragon Commander is a fun game, but it fails at being fun as a RTS game, which was its intended purpose.  The political system is meant to supplement the RTS, but ultimately ends up being more entertaining.  The overworld has plenty of exploitable loopholes that make cheese-winning the game easy.  However, the complex plot and the entertaining characters make the game fun, and there are enough vastly different story arcs for each princess that multiple playthroughs is a necessity.  Other reviews have said it, I'll say it too - Larian got confused about what they wanted to do, and made a visual novel/dating sim with some really lousy RTS thrown in.  But the plots are so good they actually make up for the game's shortcomings.\n\nBottom Line: Probably not worth $40, but for all it's flaws, the game is still fun.  The RTS portion is awful, but the political and character plot arcs redeem the game and give it phenomenal replay value.

You buy troops and mash them into other units to claim land you use to buy more troops or research points to unlock more troops you can buy.  You can go into RTS mode to win one battle per turn that would otherwise be hopeless, because the turn strategy game is raw dice rolls with what existing units you had on the map, while, once in RTS mode, your constructed units swiftly outnumber whatever units you had on the board game section, rendering being outnumbered by anything but the most ludicrous margins a minor temporary inconvenience.\n\nThe "political decisions" part of the game is like playing through South Park parodies of different political groups, but without any jokes, and being told to take them all seriously because you need them all to like you.  They're paper-thin cardboard cutouts of different interests with zero charm, and some of the voice acting is terrible.  I'm convinced whoever wrote the man-hating Catherine's dialogue was a man who hasn't spoken to a real woman in at least 10 years, because she both goes on endlessly about how inferior men are, but then also makes a constant stream of biggus dickus jokes while doing it.  NO ACTUAL WOMAN WOULD EVER TALK ABOUT HOW "SWOLLEN" A "♥♥♥♥" MEN ARE WHILE INSULTING THEM. It's like Wizardchan wrote the character just to talk about "how dumb feminazis are, amirite?" The imp (amoral scientists) ambassador has lines expressing disgust or rage or sorrow, but can't manage any tone other than a sedated mirth.  The undead (religious) factions talk about how mercy or compassion are the sole providence of the gods, and how caring about your subjects or trying to better your realm is a sin, basically making religion always evil all the time.  These are the most egregious cases, but generally, the game wants you to hate all its characters equally besides maybe the upgrade characters, which in turn means you have little investment in any of it.  It's terrible, because it deals with real, serious issues, but then ham-acts the setups and consequences so badly and basically demands you go for stat benefits, not your own moral compass.\n\nYour political choices rarely have the sorts of impact you'd expect other than who likes or dislikes you, and it seems these choices are geared mostly towards just making sure you keep everyone mostly on-board with you, because you suffer combat penalties (including "support" penalties that deny the ability to build units) conquering new territory if you enraged the race that dwells in those territories.\n\nAlso, humans apparently don't exist anywhere but on your ship, because they don't hold any land.\n\nThe RTS section has barely over a dozen units, your bases are built on pre-defined locations, even turrets, no worker units exist, and buildings have no upgrades or tiers. (This is so strategic mode units matter more - all units available from the start of battle.) It lacks some features from games like Supreme Commander that I really miss when I'm in dragon mode, like the ability to simply tell my factories to just keep producing specific units in a specific proportion forever, instead of having to keep popping out of dragon mode to babysit my factory because I worked through the build queue.\n\nThe tech tree makes this worse, early-game.  The air and sea units unlock later than ground units, so for a while, your only air unit is the zepplin support unit, then an interceptor unit who can only be used to shoot down other interceptors and zepplins, (which can be shot down just fine by the ground units,) and only in the mid-late game, when bombers exist, does controlling the skies actually start mattering.\n\nThe ability to fly down onto the gamefield would make some sense as a way to entice players who traditionally aren't RTS playres if and only if you really could win without worrying about the RTS components so much, but that's rather deliberately not the case.  The RTS portions of the game lack the previously-mentioned scriptability of a game like Supreme Commander, forcing micromanagement babysitting that mean that you wind up having to constantly dodge missiles, shoot at enemies, drop buffs on allies, order troop movements, keep an eye out for enemy flanking attacks or cloaked enemies, and babysit factory build queues all at the same time, and it's massively overwhelming.  You ultimately have no way of controlling your army from dragon mode except by hitting the "select all" button and generally mashing them all into one big mob that you clumsily lob at the enemy while trying to support as best you can manage.  I frequently find myself with no clue exactly how many of my units I even have left while trying to stand my ground against ceaseless waves of enemy forces.\n\nSimply not using dragon mode, on the other hand, is generally not an option.  It's just way too overpowered not to use it, especially early-game against things like troopers, which your dragon can easily shred with impunity.  Whereas shaman support units have a shield that can block 50% of damage, your dragon can drop one that lasts longer, blocks 75% of damage, and has a cooldown short enough that you can drop it on two units.  In fact, if you just buff your own troops, they're basically invincible between a shield buff reducing damage, a buff that makes them shoot faster, a buff that ups damage, a buff that makes them move faster, a passive buff that gives regeneration to every friendly nearby, and to top it all off, a skill that turns your fireballs into healing bolts that you can use to basically ensure none of your units ever drop below max health for more than a fraction of a second.\n\nOn the other hand, if you're in dragon mode, all the active abilities of units like shamans and warlocks tend to be wastes of research points, because you can't activate them in dragon mode, and would be far too busy to individually select specific units even if you had the button to do so.\n\nAlso, the dragon is surprisingly fragile against concentrated anti-air defenses like a half-dozen ironclads, and you can easily wind up in a situation where you have utterly lost control of the sea in such situations.\n\nThe end result is that battle becomes a confusing brawl where you frequently drop out of strategic situational awareness to focus upon personal conflict, only to dart back out to try to reassess what just happened while you were away. (Oh, look, a transport dropped off some troops in that minor side-base and captured it, now you have to take it back!) It makes for slippery gameplay where you never quite feel in control, and are mostly just trying to tread water, keeping an eye on everything you need to be aware of, using all your powers as they cool down, even while you're unquestionably winning.\n\nAnd this is single player... Add in another player who's also a dragon and can duel you on even terms, and you have a recipe for completely ignoring the rest of the battle.\n\nThe result is a giant chaotic mess, but it can certainly be an amusing chaotic mess.  I just wish it featured more tools to actually help players, like AI settings that let you tell units to use special abilities on their own.","October 30, 2015","true","29.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

What game is it actually/what does it contain?\n2. How do I feel about certain parts of it?\n3. Summary.\n\n1. Divinity : Dragon Commander\nThis game is an interesting mixture of turn-based strategy, RTS with a possibility of turning to TPP and continuing the fight, and to some degree a Empire builder. I will use few comparisions in order to describe it for newcommers. If You liked Total War series for the turn based strategy and the possibility to command Your troops on a RTS battlefield, but You found both parts a bit too complex this game may just fit Your taste. How is the RTS part handling? Well it can be compared to Warhammer 40K Dawn of War, but again in a more simplistic way. The places on which You build are not only limited but also fixed, and the whole game is basing on the land controll with one resource involved. The number of units avaiable is smaller and there are no fraction specyfic units. That doesn't mean that there is no micro/macro cntroll involved. In fact the 'rock-paper-scissors' mechanic seems fair enough and even the most low tech units remain usable in late-campagin matches thanks to their special abilities. Storyline? Hymmm. I can't say I did not sink into it, but it really is a rather linear story with one ending. Again I would compare it to the Witcher style of handling the storyline. You can do various things by anwsering many choices. There are no good anwsers as each option rewards ou with something and punishes You with a other one. But ultimately there are three acts, that lead the main storyline. You can either win the campagin or loose it. There is also a random campagin mode that takes out only one part of the story and gives You a chance of discovering personal plots and endings without the need to go through the same three maps again. Multiplayer. As it stands the UI is a bit lacking at the moment but still the matches give a lot of fun. With dragons fighting in the skies while micro managing their armies and macro managing the factories the RTS gets really interesting.\n\n2. My personal opinion:\nHere I must add that I have a tendency of not finishing the games, campagins wtc. but I have not only finished this campagin but also restarted it immedietly afterwards. The gameplay may be similar, but the decisionmaking behind it with the rewards system and 'Wife and Generals stories' kept me interested. After second playthrough I got a bit tired of the same three maps and AI that was not challenging on the strategical side(the RTS battles on hard mode are a different story) and I switched to a random campagin. During that playthrough I actually know that I will probably play one more Story-mode campagin and probably some random-mode campagins. Now I am slowly turning to multiplayer. There is an additional AI level but I am more interested in the on-board campagins and RTS battles without dragons. I find dragon fights interesting and probably I will set up a camapagin with friends'n'dragoons soon. Yet the Research and card systems work well enough to support the strategical struggle and create a 'Each-battle-is-different' RTS expeirence. Shame though that strategical AI is often lacking and I can loose battles only when I go to (!) RTS mode or I hold myself back, so that I won't benefit from the 'snowball effect' so much. I must admit that I did not test the Insane AI since it is not in the sotry/random mode campagins. One of my firends  that is not good at strategy/RTS games, have also mantioned that for him this game is challenging and he needed few tries to pass the story campagin on easy - but he managed to do so in the end. I would make an assumption that thanks to the differences in AI difficulty levels and Dragon Form, this game may be playable for those who want more of the TPP action and decision making and are not so keen on the strategy part. On the contrary, the UI of the Multiplayer lobby is not all that great, even though it has a fair share of options. There are bugs like a mismatching subtitle for the voice of a character or a ever pressed 'scroll your cards right' button. Sometimes I learn about game mechanics the hard way, this game really could use more tooltips or a build-in manual. I also heard opinions that the RTS battles may last long and may have a stalemate nature(for more info check out TotalBiscuit on YT). I can only respond with: it is your decision about what techs you buy and your micro/macro skill during the battle that may cause that. And it's up to your next turn decisions to shift the balance once again. Yes, it may happen but You can always retreat'n'tech or micro more;] In the end I am satisfied with my purchase and I would like to support the developer more, by buying the Imperial edition and maybe some DLC. Yet it is not as easy as it sounds. Shame.\n\nSummary(28.11.2013r.):\n+RTS is playable without the dragons.\n+No 'Right or wrong' decisions in the Empire Builder game part.\n+Huge replayability - random campagin modes.\n+Multiplayer has many options and may be used to play a more traditional type of game.\n+Enjoyable end-game / multiplayer competitivness.\n+Most parts of the game are voluntary, You can pass on the decision making, dragon handling or the RTS parts if You want to.\n+The steam guide. Proper name: Manual.\n+Great, intuitive controls. They work in RTS and Dragon mode.\n+Nicely done in-game tutorials.\n+Victorian/Steampunk/Feundal/Fantasy realm. Sometimes serous sometimes funny.\n+The game does not fear to swear or touch very serious real life problems.\n+Patches that seem to be a response to community feedback occuring.\n+Enjoyable, unconventional soundtrack.\n+In game sounds.\n+System requirements.\n+RTS map balance.\n-/+Some strategy maps are tad unbalanced.\n-/+Every side has the same units and techs.\n-No AI dragons.\n-UI may be a bit lacking - in the multiplayer especially.\n-Not so easy to find players for multi outside the friends/community groups.\n-For a Strategy games player the Turn-based AI is not challenging on the hardest difficulty.\n-No political decisions / wife mechanics / general bonuses in multi.\n-Bugs are easy to spot(no serious ones noted), some crashes may occur.\n-Few multiplayer maps.\n-Too little RTS maps - they get repeated often in campagin.\n-More than one community spot. Sometimes it is hard to find information like "How to upgrade your copy to Imperial edition" or how to help the develepor improve the game or is He intending to patch and expand this title.\n-Not enough fluff/fan/fanpage resources - I am very serious about it.\n-No official manual.","November 30, 2013","true","77.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Strategically, it bases you in an airship where you make political and research decisions (think Starcraft II) and the campaign uses a Risk-type board to choose battles (almost an exact rip-off of Rise of Nations).  The 'political' decisions that you make influence your relationships with the races under your control, but the decisions are so heavy-handed, unrelated to what is going on and ridiculously unsuited to a fantasy world that this entire part of the game feels like it was thrown in after the game was completed.  The actual combat is among the most generic I've seen in a RTS game. Most battles against the computer are either fighting off the equivelent of a zerg rush for the entire battle, or the computer getting stuck and letting you roll over them.  My best guess is that they rushed the battle design and AI because the big selling point was being able to join the battles yourself as a dragon instead.  In actual implementation, the dragon is interesting a few times, but more often than not I felt it was actually an annoyance.  Controls aren't great, but at times it is overpowered to the extent that you can take on a whole army by yourself.  Overall, there are a vast number of better options available on Steam.","April 11, 2014","false","5.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It's a lot of fun if you stick with it though. The various game mechanics don't feel like they mesh together well at first, but it's a lot more simple than it seems. The RTS portion of the game feels cheaply done sadly, but it's worth playing for everything else. All the characters are really engaging, and it's a lot of fun to make all the political decisions. One recent decision I've had to make involved the lizard councilwoman proposing a ban on public breastfeeding.

Calling it an RTS game isn't all that fair, because it combines turn based strategy and real time strategy elements into one, and that's just for the war. The biggest part of the game I enjoy is the political desicions system and how it affects your country. I enjoy interacting with the very colorful characters aboard the Raven (your ship) and making decisions that will either give me adoration or hate.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that the rounds early on in the game are basicly games of who can build more units and travel the fastest to other parts of the map for more resources. If you fail early on, it can be hard to come back, as each portion of the country you don't claim automaticly is going to be a country that benefits your opponents and you have to caputre. All in all though, a very solid game with a ton of fun.","December 13, 2013","true","22.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doggts/recommended/243950/","Doggts","Dog the Viccer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doggts/","595 products in account","While the game doesn't have strong replayability value due to its low amount of unique mechanics, I can definitely say I had a blast playing it through the entire singleplayer campaign.\n\nThe battles were fun to lead & satisfying to win, managing to destroy enemy troops as a dragon is fun as ♥♥♥♥♥ and the game's art design is wonderful. My main problem was the lack of difficulty here - the battles usually come down to who brings a larger amount of tougher units, which I think are a bit unbalanced too - despite having various abilities, it's clear that a slightly pricier battleship is gazillion times more powerful than the other, lighter ship. It's rather difficult to win fights unless you create a giant army and use that for combat. "Dragon OP, plz nerf", the enemies would say. I think the game would be better if at some point strong anti-dragon enemies were introduced. The game also features a card system - through the game you can get various cards that can help you in battle (boosting your units, damaging enemy units, mercenaries to fight for you), help your empire grow (boost to gold for one turn) or hurt the other empire (destroy his buildings).\n\nThe cherry on top of this dragon commanding cake, for me, was the political system and stories of characters on board of the ship - the generals.\nFirst, the political system - a future emperor not only has to worry about leading his units, but he also has to think of the future of his nation. Representatives of five different races live on board of your ship and will hold meetings during which you have to agree  or disagree on some of their ideas, a lot of which are valid in modern times as well - things like taxation of the church or gay rights. All races have different opinions on the issues. The system isn't big at all (quite small, in fact), but I found the issues to be rather interesting and I enjoyed pondering about my choices as I tried to keep up good relations between all the races, especially Elves and Dwarves, who usually have opposite views of discussed problems. Even though I had three races on 30%-40% approval at some point, I have to say bringing them all the way up gets easier as you progress. Your rewards are small - maintaining high relations with a specific race makes it easier to lead battles on their grounds and as a treat you can gain (or lose) bonus gold, science, motivation.\n\nCharacters of the four generals serving you, which I mentioned up above, are written well and I find all of them likable, even the character of a snobby lizard who definitely wasn't meant to be liked at all. Occasionally they will ask you for help regarding political issues or situations that may affect your relationship with them, with whole races or bring small advantages / disadvantages.\n\nWhile the game might not be worth picking it up for its full price, I can definitely recommend it whenever it's on sale.","November 7, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think everyone ought to try this game. It's got so many interesting features, ranging from the Strategic Cards, Dragon Abilities, tech trees to diplomatic relations. Definitely worth trying.\n\nPROS\n1. Interesting Game\nIt is both familiar and refreshing to see the Dragon Commander's characters. The standard Tolkien lineup of human, dwarf, elf, dragon and undead lets you expect certain stereotypes of the races. However, the slight tweaks and nuances of the races do make the game more interesting. E.g. The technical Imps (instead of goblins), the religious Undead (instead of a holy Ecclesiarch) and the business-like Dwarves (instead of a helmet and pickaxe rune monger).\n\n2. Strategic Map and Combat Map\nKudos to Larian Studios. I love the Strategic Overview and the Combat Map. The difference between macro and micro is so distinct, yet the game plays so smoothly. On the Strategic Map, the little chess pieces that you load onto the transports are so beautiful.\n\n3. Character Interactions\nToo few to count but it is pretty interesting to hear the conversations and complaints.\n\n4. The Raven\nI love the command ship. So cool. I wish I could interact with some interesting parts of the ship. E.g. The main batteries / canons, buying a cloaking module for the ship, watching the crew have conversations and gossip.\n\n5. Interaction Choices\nI was hoping for a 4 choice table whenever a tough decision has to be made. It would be arranged in a square with 2 options on top and 2 options below. Some options might even be greyed out due to one not fulfilling certain conditions.\n\n6. Political Intrigue\nA bit more juicy please. So far, I get the very dry and stale decisions which can be decided with a "flip-a-coin" contest.\n\n7. Combat Map\nLove the scroll out view. Reminds me of Supreme Commander. Love not having to do Bob-the-Builder\n\nCONS\n1. Jetpack Dragon\nThere is a Chinese saying "Drawing legs on a snake". It is a proverb of two boys who competed to draw a snake. One was so good at art, he drew a complete snake in matter of seconds. However, in his arrogance, he added legs to the snake. This, of course, lost him the competition.\n\n2. Dragon Cards\nI do not like having to bind the Dragon Card Skill from the list of skills to the 0-9 keys, if there is excess space. It should be default. Imagine if you missed binding the key, you would have wasted a Dragon card for no reason.\n\n3. Ships\nThere are some maps where you have 2 water bodies split by a land mass. This causes the reinforcements that you bring in to be stuck on the wrong side of the land mass, preventing you from hitting the enemy base. I think the name of the map might have been 2v2 Dragon Pass (I might be wrong on this). I know that naval units are hard to balance with the water body maps but I think you can solve it with water teleportation / Dragon transport.\n\n4. Campaign Act I\nIt is odd but I think that prolonging Act I is more beneficial to the player than cutting it short. If you end Act I too fast, you won't have enough research to bring over to Act II. Thus, it's actually beenficial to conquer the whole map in Act I and drag it on until you complete enough dragon/unit research.\n\n5. Combat Map\nThe view and orientation are horrible. The minimap and the orientation do not move in tandem. E.g. You move forward and the minimap moves right.\n\n6. Units\nIt's kind of boring attacking the same units that you have. I can see that both sides have a\n1. Trooper\n2. Grenadier\n3. Warlock\n4. Shaman\n5. Hunter\n6. Zeppelin\n7. Imp Fighter\n8. Transport\n9. Ironclad\n10. Dreadnaught\n11. Devastator\n12. Bombing Balloon\n13. Armour\n\nMore asymmetry please. Add more unique units to the list? I was expecting each faction to add 13 unique units to each side, at the very least. That way, you would get 39 different units, not counting unique buildings. There's a defunct game called Naval Warfare that you could take the units from.\n\n7. No Tutorial\nYou have to guess that you right click on the map in order to build units. You have to guess that it's a turn based game and you end your turn by clicking on the hourglass.\n\n8. Unintuitive Keys\nQ for Auto-attack? Why not A?\n\nSUGGESTIONS\n1. Racial Superweapons / Superpowers\nFor example, if you became extremely friendly with the Imps, you could create a super Imp Air Fortress. If you became extremely friendly with the Elves, you could get use rare Land Magic of the Elves.\n\n2. Overcoming the Limitations of Water\nScrew physics, you already have a jetpack dragon. Here's a list.\na. Airship Dreadnaughts\nThey used to be limited by water, now they fly.\n\nb. Giant Air Transports for Ships\nNow you can move ships from one water body to another, even across mountains. You could even use the Dragon.\n\nc. Ship Teleportation\nThe Hunter can already teleport. Why not teleport the ships? If this reduces the uniqueness of the Hunter, how about a whirlpool effect, just like Heroes of Might and Magic?\n\n3. Enemy Generals\nYou have 4. Maybe you can capture / convince more to your side?\n\n4. Arguments between the Diplomats and the Generals\nHow would that pan out?\n\n5. Unit Backstory\nI know that this might sound strange but it helps to flesh out the story but engaging with a story character that signifies a certain unit. E.g. Admiral Stukov from Starcraft (Battlecruiser), Sarah Kerrigan from Starcraft (Ghost)\n\n6. Certain Major Strategic Locations for the Campaign\nEvery location on the strategic map is more or less the same, save for the Capital. Perhaps, Larian could include some areas where there are certain special buildings or quests? These maps would then have a special map designed just for campaign purposes. The current method of using a multiplayer map isn't as exciting.\n\n7. Co-Op Campaign\nThis game can be played with friends vs AI. Could you add that function in?\n\n8. Multiplayer Allies\nAs far as I understand, there is no such option available. Each player takes their own position.","October 31, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowen/recommended/243950/","Lowen","Lowen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lowen/","857 products in account","The game is split into 3 parts: story and political decisions while on the airship, a risk style strategy map, and optional RTS battles where you can order troops around or directly control your dragon (with jetpack) avatar.\n\nThe RTS and strategy map parts are OK but not great. They both have a little bit of a learning curve but got really easy before the third and final campaign. The RTS battles are kind of fun at first but got old quickly, so I was autoresolving all the time near the end. Not that it mattered since I managed to win every important battle while rushing the enemy capitol and barely losing anything.\n\nThe sheer creativity of the artwork and writing while on the airship more than make up for that though. I can't get enough of the crazy political interactions between the 5 races ambassadors and 4 generals. You can also pick a princess and each one has their own plot so there's some room for replayability as well.\n\nOverall though I just can't not love a game where I play a half human half dragon with a jetpack, the undead are religious conservatives, armor units quote Manowar and Sir Mixalot lyrics, and I could marry a skeleton princess that wears lipstick if I wanted to.","November 1, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You make choices on touchy subjects and risk alienating some races while getting the support of others. The characters are really unique and the story lines that you can follow are very entertaining, and definitely one of the highlights of the games. All the characters are memorable and have amazing voice acting. And you get to pick a wife.\n\nAlso during this part of the game is a chance to unlock upgrades for your dragon. The upgrades turn you from overpowered dragon that destroys everything into an invincible god that demolishes anything it looks at. It also has upgrades for your RTS units but who cares about those when you can destroy everything yourself.\n\nPolitics: 9/10\n\n\nThe strategy part has your maneuvering your forces along a map as you try to defeat the enemy in a large scale campaign. You decide where to move, depending on what political infuences you have in the area and how your opponent advances, and which units to build with your limited resources. You also get cards which can give you an advantage in individual fights.\n\nAlso for the less RTS-inclined, you can skip the battles and just get an outcome for each fight. This is nice if you absolutely hate the RTS part, but you learn not to do that when your dragon character is part of the fight since you can easily turn a 1% chance of victory into 100% since the dragon is overpowered.\n\nEach action counts and you have to think about where you have to send each squad. You'll quickly learn just how overpowered your dragon character is and will have to decide what the best place to send him is, more than any other factor.\n\nStrategy: 6/10\n\n\nThe RTS part is the most disappointing part of the game. I know a lot of people are interested in this game because of it. but it doesn't live up to the expectations, at least not as an RTS.\n\nIf you try to play this game like a proper RTS commanding your units, you will get destroyed every single time by the AI. It is extremely difficult to outplay the AI this way, and almost never works. However, once you understand how to use your dragon powers, you only need your units to capture each area. Your dragon will destroy everything every time. It is so broken in this mode, that you will stop sending commands to your units except to send them all the way to enemy's base, and you decimate all the enemy's units while they get there.\n\nThis is the least interesting part of the game since it's completely unbalanced. That said, it's always fun to blow stuff up so it's still fun in it's own way. It's just not a good RTS.\n\nRTS:  6/10  (because you can blow stuff up as a dragon mostly)\n\n\nOverall the game is fun to play. I haven't had a chance to play it online since I mainly just wanted to play the campaign, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The story is not the most amazing thing ever, but the characters more than make up for it. I think this game tried to do too much and was therefore mediocre at everything. Perhaps for a future installation they'll fix the shortcomings and make an amazing game.\n\nOverall rating: 7/10\n\n\nThis is the perfect game for anyone who likes dragons, blowing stuff up, and humourous characters.\n\nYou will not like this game if you are looking for a serious, balanced RTS or strategy game.\n","September 26, 2015","true","20.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What you get out of it seems like it's strongly influenced by how deeply you delve into the RTS section.  I found the singleplayer campaign is also a bit short at 9 hours, which, while taken at a veeery leasurely pace, also intentionally excluded most of the RTS battles that would have massively padded it).\n\nVisual Novel (Shipboard diplomacy sections)\nI suppose the first thing I should say is the game's politics are VERY 2014 American-centric.  Thinly veiled medical MJ, sexual orientation issues, and social justice themes abound.  I could almost 1:1 match the races to poltical factions in US poltics as seen from a cynical 20-something.  It's so blatent that it's almost immersion breaking.  At one point you will be required to choose a wife for your arranged marriage.  Each prospective bride has a mildly branching story arc that ends in one of two conclusions, and these are somewhat better written, although not by much,  The same goes for each of your four generals, General Dudebro, General Racist Snob, General Femanazi, and General Badgirl.  While the generals all start out varying shades of unlikable, their character arcs are not quite as hamfisted as the fantasy UN.  Voice acting is competent throughout though rarely standout.  Visual Novel sections are also where you buy your RTS upgrades.\n\nStrategy (World map sections)\nThis is the part of the game I spent the most time with.  A region map is broken up into territories where you can station units.  Each territory can have a building on it, either a factory to produce units, a mine to increase its income, or one of the other structures to give you advantage cards.  In practice, I found the mines and taverns (they give you coupon cards for free, one-battle units) to be overwhelmingly the most useful.  Minor balance issues aside, it all looked and played very competently, if extremely easy on normal.  I lingered on act 1 and act 2 to see more visual novel development when the enemy was hopelessly outmanned and maneuvered and accidentily carried the per-turn advantages of money and research forward with no penalty.  Thus Act 3 was a steamroll that never faltered and was never close.  I think the biggest problems were that the AI wasn't aggressive enough.  It allowed me to almost without exception choose my battles and only fight when I had an overwhelming advantage.  Add to that copious mercenary cards from my many taverns, and I should have bumped the difficulty to hard at least.  I feel like there should have been a hand of cards limit to avoid stockpiling.\n\nReal Time Strategy (Burninating all the people, in their thatched roof cottages!)\nIt's odd that the heart of the game was almost completely optional!  When a territory is contested you are presented with the option to auto-resolve it or start a RTS battle.  Any general other than the Dragon Knight auto resolves, but if you choose youself as the general, you start battle.  Then starts a pretty conventional RTS.  Bases are only constructed on pre-designated locations and only by your infantry.  You have two resources, recruits and money.  Money is required for buildings and both are required for each unit contructed.  Summoning yourself (a large dragon with a jetpack) requires recruits (I jokingly suggest you eat them to transform).  While you are flying around as a dragon, you can't issue commands and your army will only follow preissued orders.  It's all very competently done, but I never got the feeling of being an unstoppable dragon.  Mostly you pick away at units until you soak up too much damage and have to flee without having accomplished much.  Wooh...\n\nOverall, it looks like the singleplayer campaign was barely more than an extended tutorial for multiplayer. If I can find a friend with it, I might even try my hand at multiplayer.  Still, I had fun with it and will probably play it again.   I just can't help but wish they had streamlined the VN parts or required RTS more forcefully.  As it is, the three gameplay modes don't really mesh all that well and prevent the game from being truly great.","November 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The strategy elements aren't hard to figure out for anyone who's played any type of RTS, and is a great game to lose some time in.\n\nThe politics of this game contribute by enhancing or hampering your controlled territories by the decisions you make, plus there are factions you can either appease or essentially treat like a tiny bug by crushing their hopes of ever being significant.\n\nAll the characters are interesting, and you have the ability to marry someone from each of the factions, including a lizard, a dwarf, and skeleton.

Most of the time real time battles involve zerg rush tactics (or much more deeper hold and advance tactics if you can unbalance the AI) such battles are also inherently optional especially if you can collect the necessary amount of cards. The strategic over world (campaign map) battles involve the mentioned card gimmick and are obtained either via the decisions you make and/or (primarily) through buildings that you can build in the overworld (campaign) map, such buildings cost gold however and multiple buildings of the same type can quickly become quite expensive which I guess is itself a tactical choice as you can never hoard a large amount of gold.\n\nFinally the game has awesome face to face NPC interactions that often revolve around real world issues and such issues are almost always presented as a comical parody. Simply put this is one of the best games ever made.","April 1","true","188.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poetassassin/recommended/243950/","poetassassin","truthwarrior","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poetassassin/","290 products in account","Fun turn based strategy game.  I enjoyed playing it when it didn’t crash. Fun characters and choices. Issues in game are similar to real life issues (ex: legalizing weed, gay marriage, eco-friendly issues, etc..) and you get to make whatever choice you want. You even get to choose a bride. Fun fun.\n\nHowever, the one big negative draw on the game is that during turns you can play only one battle regardless of how many are on the map. So if on a turn you invade 2 provinces and get invaded in 1, you have to choose which to play and hope the computer can take care of the other two. This sucks a lot because like most turn base strategies with RTS maps you do way better than the computer. So either you hope when the computer plays you way outnumber the other team so your percentage is up. You can also let a general help in one battle regardless of how many generals you have.  Even though I have 6 generals only 1 general gets to help in 1 battle and the other battles get no general at all. The other 5 generals just sit there I guess. This puts a kink in many strategies because you really have to prepare before you do a major offensive.\n\nEven though that was a long description, which I am sure doesn’t make sense, the game is still pretty fun. However, for me the crashing became too much and I didn’t finish it. I recommend the game if its super cheap. Other than that you could probably get a better game which is similar (minus being a dragon) for a better price.\n\nPros\n- Customize the dragon you play (i.e. pick your spells)\n- Fun choices\n- Cute characters\n- Fun achievements\n\nCons\n- Game crashes a lot\n- Can only play one battle even though the game may have several.\n- Overly simplistic battles (personal preference)\n","June 4","true","11.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It mainly plays off quite similarly to a game of risk, and you may chose to engage your enemies and fight your army against them in RTS style. I opted to auto-resolve most fights, as I find it bothersome to use unit abilities whereas the CP players will constantly be using them against you. It's not too much of a bother though... As an example, if you do not adress the cloaked units attacking you (without being revealed when they begin attacking) they will cause an amount of havoc. There are ways to easily counter this by either revealing them by taking command of the Dragon or buffing your units to detect cloaked units, but it is a bother to have to deal with that nonetheless - especially fighting uphill battles.\n\nOn a whole I ended up skipping engaging in the RTS as I found a small annoyance. If you put a massive army on enemy territory to fight them by taken command of the army - NOT ALL OF YOUR ARMY WILL BE THERE. I thought I was going to spawn in with the map basically covered in my units, turns out I had a mass of transports in the bottom corner and hardly any land units WTH? Totally ruined an awesome moment I had been looking forward to.\n\nThe ability to talk to your allies inbetween commanding your army was also very enjoyable - very much like SCII. The politics was sometimes boring, at other times engaging. A very nice touch in my opinion as it puts you in the position of being a bad leader to help the war effort or be a good leader and suffer in war. Balancing your decisions in favour of certain races becomes a bit troublesome especially when the undead are such extremists they disagree with everything good.\n\nThe game can sometimes be unreallistically challenging but with a strong Navy and air support you can overcome most armies quite easily. I had trouble before I realized the value of a stong Navy, after that i had very little issues. By simply stopping Transports before they reach you - you can empty an army before it reaches you. With a combo of a fast moving Air force to back you up whenever you're outmatched your base can be almost inpenetrable as long as you're shutting down certain vantage points and keeping routes to you blocked.\n\nOverall 9 or possibly 9.5/10\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game and even moreso as I got it on 80% sale.

Перед нами необычная смесь жанров RTS и RPG. Большая часть игры от RTS - завоевание территорий и иследование технологий.\nОднако самое прекрасное в ней не это, а диалоги с генералами, королевой (вашей женой) и Ваши политические решения. Фактически эта составляющая сделала Dragon Commander ни на что не похожей игрой, которая однозначно заслуживает внимания игроков. Ко всему этому добавьте великолепный сюжет, прекрасную музыку и хороший звуковой ряд и эта игра не оставит вас равнодушными.\nВ игре есть и баги - в основном графические, но не критичные - однако иногда игра может и выбросить из-за них - так что сохраняемся почаще. И ещё одно - сейвы не переходят в Steam cloud.\n\nP.S. Для любителей именно RPG составляющей - просто понизьте сложность до минимума и не спешите завершать игру, пропускайте ходы и дожидайтесь сюрпризов в виде диалогов с советниками и генералами.\nИ покажите всему миру кто вы: распущенный ханжа и тиран, который будет пресмыкатся перед политиканами - или же справедливый полководец и мудрый Владыка, способный на невероятные подвиги даже если все против.\n\nSo about game. We have unusual mix of RTS and RPG jenre. Most of the game is RTS - conquering of territories and researching of technologies.\nHowever the best part not in that but in dialogues with generals, queen (your wife) and Your political decisions. This part made Dragon Commander as unic game that don't looks like any type of games that we know. Add to this it's magnificent story, excellent music and good sounds - all this make this game unforgettable fr you.\nBut still game has few bugs with graphics - they are not critical but sometimes may crash game - so save often. Plus saves didn't store in Steam cloud.\nSo in general - this game is worth to buy. Buy it and you won't regret.\n\nP.S. For those who like RPG part - just set difficulty to "very easy" and try to not end game fast, spend lots of moves and wait for surprises as dialogues with advisors and generals.\nShow the world who you really are: dissipated hypocrite and tyran, which reptile in front of politics - or rightful commander and wise Overlord, able to do incredible deeds even all are against you.","June 16, 2014","true","86.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/petersaber/recommended/243950/","petersaber","Petersaber","http://steamcommunity.com/id/petersaber/","429 products in account","I'll keep this short. This game tries a lot of things at once. It tries to be a turn-based grand strategy, it tries to be an RTS, it tries to be a political RPG. One of these is merely average, one is decent, one is glorious.\n\nMerely average are RTS battles. While the addition of being a dragon, the rest of it is a basic spamfest of cheap units in huge quantities. It does require tactics, but most fights work in the ways of rock-paper-scissors, so it ends up in making a blob of compositions and throwing it at the enemy. If you make a good use of the Dragon, the battle will be over in a few minutes, but because AI can control multiple things at once (army, capturing buildings, abilities) and production, you'll get outspammed eventually and the battle will drag on. However, you can only enter one RTS battle each turn. My biggest issue with the (singleplayer) RTS component is that when you bring a huge army to a battle, you start with only a fraction of it, while your enemy starts with every units. An easy win become a very hard battle where you are outnumbered 10 to 1.\n\nDecent is the grand strategy component. It's quite simple, but it's competent and works well. The layout of maps makes you use strategies and calculate your moves carefully. I found it very enjoyable. What is weird is that you have 4 generals, but you can use them only once per turn, even though you use only one of them. Where do the other 3 run off to?\n\nHowever the RPG and politics are where the game excels. You can visit your ship and go to various parts of it, and talk to characters and crewmen, much like in Starcraft 2. And there is not a single uninteresting or 2D character. Same with political decisions brought to you by the council of 5 races. Each decision doesn't have a black or white answer, and each councilor makes sense when explaining his position on the issue. Strangely enough, the Lizards are the most liberal and open-minded. However, my issue here is that all decisions are absolute. There is no way to find a middle ground. For example, one of the decisions was to create a republic instead of monarchy, and while I wanted to do it, other councilors made convincing arguments how the population is just not ready and educated enough. Someone wanted me to fire half my male officers and replace them with women, and I couldn't invite women to the ranks, I could only fire these guys or tell that person to back off. However, this is a minor issue.\n\nLong story short. Dragon Commander was a highly enjoyable title. It has issues, quite a few, but overall, it's a very good game that has amazing amounts of character. There is much more depth than I descirbed. The design is awesome as well, steampunk-ish combined with technosorcerery. You don't see that often.","March 10, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cindare/recommended/243950/","Cindare","Cindare","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cindare/","154 products in account","Divinity: Dragon Commander is a real-time strategy game for people who generally don't enjoy (or, like me, are simply not very good at) RTS games.  Conscious of criticisms that D:DC lacks certain features or innovations appurtenant to the RTS genre (read: "It's not Starcraft, uuggghh"), I gave this a go and have thus far found the game varied, delightful, and eminently playable.\n\nAt its core, D:DC features three different games rolled into one.  The first is the core RTS game, wherein you fly a great big dragon with a jetpack while occasionally micromanaging troops.  The game permits letting the dragon carry a battle, because frankly I've won battles where my dudes otherwise got overrun.  I'm certain hardcore RTS gamers would balk at this as a crutch, but for a far more casual player like myself I count it as a feature.  Flying a dragon around helicopter-d*icking enemy units is just awesome, and it allows me enjoy a game that I would otherwise find needlessly frustrating.\n\nThe second game is the "Risk" element, which is a grand strategy overland map that tracks conquests and strategic movements.  On this map, the player manages income, research, and movement of troops over the map.  With adequate planning and maneuvering, you can let your NPC generals auto-resolve battles with a probability slider indicating the likelihood of success.  Alternately, you can take a skirmish into the RTS game, which is especially helpful for swinging unlikely battles to your favor by way of your dragon stomping all over enemy units.  The game is usually won or lost on this portion of the game, though I suppose players who are generally good at RTS games will quickly master the strategic map.\n\nThe third game is a political simulator.  As an upstart monarch, it is necessary to occasionally tend to civic matters.  The player's decisions on a wide variety of issues, from trade policy and conscription to women's suffrage and gay marriage.  Your decisions affect the allegiances of constituent races, which are loosely analogous to real-life political interest groups.  The elves are leftist environmentalists.  The dwarves are laissez-faire capitalists.  The lizardfolk are libertarian republicans.  The imps are mad scientists and sociopaths.  And the undead are religious conservatives.  One can either balance issues in order to keep everyone relatively happy, or forsake certain interest groups in favor of others.\n\nIn all the game is varied, fluid, and fun.  I picked this up on sale, and in retrospect this is a game that I would have paid full price for at launch.  I can definitely see myself playing the heck out of Divinity: Dragon Commander in the days to come.","April 23, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This may/may not bother some people....my opinions (key word is "opinion") on the game is below:\n\nPros:\n-Good mix of strategy/RPG/RTS gameplay (there are even cards you can use to give yourself bonuses)\n-Cool characters, interesting enough story...characters react to your choices\n-Graphics are good, unit-types are interesting and can be upgraded to do different things\n\nCons:\n-Can be buggy sometimes which is slighty annoying\n-Not much of a guide on what to do, throws you into a mess of gameplay that can have a steep learning curve (some may like this)\n-Modern day controversy doesn't always mix well with the fantasy setting\n\nI'll expand on that last point some. First off this game gets a thumbs up because it is simply a good game, just fun to play and all around enjoyable. However the constant political overtones (I felt) regularly took away from the feel and setting. Sometimes it seems like after every battle you return to your ship only to be asked about government healthcare, medicinal herb usage, imp euthanasia, or gay marriage for the elves. These sorts of issues are pretty consistent as you play and regardless of what your political opinions might be you will most likely find yourself distracted by planet earth issues as you are fighting to unite the people of the fantasy world of DC. Now this will be pretty appealing to some people, how this game incorporates real-life issues into the game and makes you see how they affect fantasy races. It is a pretty cool and interesting experiment they are doing here. For me though it just doesn't always work, when I play games like this I usually like to detach myself from the controversies we experience as humans. I suppose I would feel it was more appropriate encountering these types of issues in a game setting that we as humans can relate to and are familiar with. Maybe in something like the Sims or Gone Home, which also deals with gay issues. I will admit that I do like seeing the outcome of my decisions on those that serve me, I only wish the decisions I was making were more relevant to their world than ours. Religion is portrayed, perhaps expectedly, pretty poorly (the only religious voice is an undead representative...subtle symbolism of some kind?) and his advice is often so fargone and unresonable that you would have to be completely insane to take it under serious consideration (the lesbian undead artist needs to have all her work destroyed, kill all the heathens, etc, etc..). The (stereo)typical arguments are all here too ("rich people are evil"...."gay-marriage means people will be having sex with sheep next") and sometimes I felt like I was watching people arguing on Fox News/CNN rather than playing a game. Ultimately a cool idea by the devs but a very distracting one from the overall experience, still a good game though if you peel away those layers.","July 1, 2014","true","11.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

To put it shortly it is a game consisting of 3 different elements. A boardgame as the likes of RISK where you manage and build troops and try to take over the whole board by conquering your enemies capitals. You can also use cards that give you advantages, like prevent certain types of units from moving, lets you build a structure for free or grants you additional units. You can either auto-resolve the fights if you want. if you decide to auto-reoslve the battle you will see a small animation depicting which units are being destroyed but you can also do the battling yourself, which leads to the next portion of the game.\n\nIf you decide to go to the battle yourself you will be taken to the RTS section of the game, which works similar to traditional RTS's in most regards, albeit it is bit more simple than some of the more complicated RTS games out there. You see, you can't really build freely, since each map has a certain amount of building sites on which you can build various structures, again, the structures lack a bit of variety, as there is only a few structures to choose from (3 ground unit factories, a naval factory, a aerial factory, a recruitment citadel which basically will work as your resource harvester and 3 types of turrets). However, the fun comes from acually being able to jump into the battlefield yourself as a dragon donning a jetpack. There are 3 of which you can choose from, a support type, an offensive tanky type and a middle ground from these two. I have played most of my time as the support type, so most of the time I would jump into the battle when I was making a big push into the enemy base and heal and buff my troops while they did most of the damage. It is very fun to fight as a dragon with a jetpack mind you, and totally badass as well, the controls work nicely and the animations look good for the most part. I think this would be a good time to mention the music, which I find to be fantastic. It is very epic and energetic to get you in the right mood to swoop in with your dragon and take down the enemy and when you are on the boardgame section or in your ship the music is nice and funky.\n\nWhich leads to the 3rd section of the game. The political part or decision making. Once you finish the RTS part, you will be greeted with a newspaper that will more often than not make fun of our last political decision, which is always quite a bit of fun, because no matter what they will always make fun of you. Then you get to be a part of making some large or smaller scale decisions about your empire, or to be empire, like what you will legalize or abolish. You have 5 different races in the game, each with their own diplomatic representative who will either like or dislike your final decisions, not favoring a specific race is a good idea, since the more a race likes you, the easier it is to take over and defend areas that are populated by them. And if a particular race hates you it is going to be tougher to defend an area that is mostly populated by that race as you will have a shortage on recruits there. As many others have mentioned you will get to decide upon very modern problems, some of which are still discussed today or were decided upon a few years ago. This part is a lot of fun, since you get to talk to the races representatives who have very distinct and colorful personalities, which makes this part arguably the most fun. Indeed the voice acting and character models are all very well made. The lip syncing is awesome, making the characters feel much more alive. Unlike in most other RTS's where you do your unit upgrades on the field, here you do that during this this phase, when you are in your ship. Here you get to spend your tech points to upgrade your troops and your dragon with various attributes and abilities, although, sometimes it feels like some of the units may have a bit too many abilities, since I can't keep up with that level of micromanagement as I already have my set of dragon abilities to take care of.\n\nIt is really a great game, a ame I wouldn't have regretted putting down the 40 euros in on its release date. It is a shame that there isn't anyone playing the multiplayer anymore though, so I really cannot say what the multiplayer feels like, oh well, maybe someday.","July 3, 2014","true","17.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you can overlook the underdeveloped (but still serviceable and fun enough) RTS part of the game, then you'll find a refreshing mix of "RTS + Panzer Dragoon + Risk + Crusader Kings + Fox News + Tumblr + Japanese dating sim where you marry a skeleton or a lizard princess" to quote another reviewer. Campaign took me 20 hours on normal, and I'd happily play it through again on a harder difficulty if my steam library backlog wasn't so mighty. Replayability is good due to different choices you can make as emperor / different princesses to marry / different tactics to use. Has it's problems, but no more than a lot of other games I've sunk countless hours into. Haven't played multiplayer so can't comment on it.\n\nGood:\n- OK story, decent characters who have decent voice acting (rarer than you'd think)\n- Good research/upgrade system for troops and dragon powers\n- Fun dragon combat\n- Game components work well together\n- Nice colourful visual style (subjective to a degree I guess)\n\nBad:\n- Weak RTS component\n- Poor tutorial system (there's good guide on steam you may want to check out, among others)\n- A few balance issues, but not game-breaking\n- Campaign ending is underwhelming (though the fun is in the journey, no?)\n\nIn the end, the goods outweigh the bads, and the bads don't prevent you from having a fun experience with the game.\n\nPersonal tips:\n- Change the game speed to 'slowest', this helps A LOT for RTS battles\n- During RTS battles, rotate the camera so it's facing North and keep it that way, this makes the mini-map more usable and navigating the map a lot easier.\n- Don't forget to use your dragon form, it's fun! Watch out though, you can get ripped apart fast by anti-air if you don't avoid them or dodge well.\n- Read a guide or two, a lot of things aren't really explained well or at all.","July 10, 2014","true","19.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Conversational elements of the game's campaign are well-written and well-voice acted.

There's a strategic map with territories to capture and resources to manage, and each turn the player earns resources that they can use to purchase new units and tech. The units can be moved around the strategic map to claim territory, and when a battle breaks out, the player is taken to an RTS map to play out the battle, with their initial position being stronger or weaker depending on a number of factors, like the units they had present on the strategic map, their approval among the population of the region, and how long they've held the territory (if defending). The player is also able to earn (or buy) a selection of 'cards' that can be played on territories or before battles to swing the odds in their favor - things like hiring mercenaries for the duration of the battle, imposing penalties on enemy units, buffing their own units, or causing effects on the strategic map like altered population or extra gold earned.\n\nThe single player campaign features 3 chapters, each consisting of a separate strategic map to conquer, but in addition, the player is frequently brought matters of state to address, or approached about the personal affairs of the generals in their army or other crewmembers of The Raven, an airship from the player commands. While I generally find this sort of thing to be rather tedious in similar games, I actually enjoyed it quite a bit in Dragon Commander. The issues are interesting and varied, and have consequences regardless of what side the player takes, so there doesn't feel like there's a clear 'right' and 'wrong' side to take in any issue. The characters have personality and it's quite easy to start caring about them - I'd say the character development is better than most RTS / TBS games.\n\nThe real gimmick (from which the game derives its name) is that during the RTS battles, the player is able to transform into a dragon and fly around the battlefield killing things or assisting their own units. Research points can be spent (during the strategic phase) to gain additional abilities for your dragon form, such as massive fireballs, damage reducing shields, or stealth detection. Since, as a dragon, the player can fly very quickly around the map and generally rain death upon most units, it ends up playing a much more active role than the 'commander' unit in most RTS games (Supreme Commander, for instance), and it's quite satisfying to tear around the battlefield dishing out destruction. Otherwise completely unwinnable battles can be won by deploying some of the potent dragon abilities at key points.\n\nOverall, Dragon Commander is a fun game with a few gimmicks to set it apart from otherwise similar titles, and if you're a fan of RTS / TBS games, it's worth picking up.","January 23, 2014","true","17.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

All of the are good/okay, but if you are looking for a good RTS there are better, if you want a good strategy(4x) game there are again other options.  And the Dragon flight/combat isn't all that great either, still satisfying, but it got stale somewhat quickly for me.\n\nI'm going to focus on the single player because after finishing it I didn't really have the desire to try multiplayer, as some minor spoilers ahead.\n\nFor me there was just a lot of annoyances that just didn't make it as enjoyable as I was hoping it was going to be.  For starters the difficulty caught me by surprise.  When I first started playing I tried it on normal, this was a mistake for me.  I'm not a good RTS/4x TBS player at the best of times and the way this game starts (enemy has a ton of territory and units, you have nothing) did not help matters.  After getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me I gave it another shot on a lower setting (Casual makes the Dragon flying/combat part of the game incredibly satisfying).\n\nAs an extension to the last point, starting the game at a big deficit isn't a bad idea and can work but the biggest problem for me was that it happens 3 times.  You start the story at a deficit and then get huge only to finish the first map/story arc and move into the second phase and start from nothing again against an enemy that holds a ton of units/territory.  It was silly enough to happen one time BUT THEN it happens AGAIN after the second map/story arc.  The third time you start with a few more territories/unit, but again you are at a huge deficit, it's okay that the game starts out that way, but to do it two more times feels lazy.\n\nAnother thing was that I got hit with more than a few crashes.  But the biggest one for me was that I had finished the second arc of the game/story(With frequent saves along the way), started out the third arc and then saved/quit for the night.  When I hit the continue button, it was like I had never did any of it, all my saves gone.  I tried all the saves and found one auto save that thankfully brought me back to my most recent progress.\n\nLastly, in the story arc you are given series of moral choices by your council.  While I enjoyed them for the most part, they didn't exactly add anything for me.  Maybe in the harder difficulties a -3 gold/+2% luck would mean a lot but for the lower difficulties it didn't really matter.  So I could easily juggle the choices and ended with all 5 factions at around 90% or above favorable making the choices feel more about math than the morals involved.  I would have liked to see the choices mean more, even at lower difficulties, maybe with revolts in territories or additional units joining or something, but for me I just seen it as a background thing and added a light fun/humorous touch to the campaign.  Also the Wife choosing thing felt unfinished.  Picked wife, had two or three conversations and nothing ever happened after that, no side quests, no challenges she put forth, just hung out in her room and said had another boring/straight forward case before her.  The generals were a nice though and added some flavor to the story, but for the most part on the lower difficulties I ignored them entirely, why would I want them commanding the army when I get to fly around as a Dragon?  Or why give up gold when I can click on the Imperial Army tab to auto finish the battle when it's at 100% or close to 100%?\n\nI think the game is an all-around good game, but if I give it my own recommendation I'd say no, because I didn't have much fun playing it.

The RTS component is complete garbage, zerg-rush, zerg-rush, hope you setup and are good with hot-keys.  If you are, it's boring, simplistic, and utterly predictable.  If you aren't, it's frustrating.  If you actually like any kind of strategy in your Real-Time Strategy games, this isn't the game for you.\n\nThe "Strategy" component of the game, between the battles is very light.  It's fairly shallow, but tries to hide this behind manditory "psuedo-RPG" interactions where you get to be alternately insulted and sucked up to by the people supposedly on your side.  The writing for the story and dialog is weak, the characters never change or remember anything you've done in the past except as a numerical percentage that adds bonuses/penalties in in the RTS mode.\n\nThe visuals and voice acting are very good, but those are not enough to save the game from itself.

The storyline and political intrigue are fascinating. All of this will fade into a bitter, crusted memory, however, once you realize just how utterly ramshackle the balancing is, how precognizant you'll need to be to devise a workable strategy and how massively unfair the battles can get, even after you figure out how to slow the game down enough to actually strategize during the real-time sections. And you will need to go into those, or you'll literally have no chance of winning -which, incidentally, is the same chance you'll often have even if you do fight the battle in real-time, only with a heaping helping of frustration on top. Then if you survive long enough to summon yourself -that's odd, isn't it? Having to wait for yourself to arrive!- ...Then you'll realize that if you breathe too much fire, as in enough to actually dent half the units in the game, then you'll overheat and have to cool down. So in short, this game is a terrible, atrocious waste of a magnificent OST and a choice-studded storyline; more than anything, it makes one wish the devs had had at least some clue as to how one creates fun gameplay.","July 5, 2014","false","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of the Divinity universe overall, so when I heard about this I had to pick it up and try it. Obviously, the Divinity game world's strongest genre is RPG, so it was interesting to hear of a RPG/Strategy hybrid set in one of my favorite RPG universes. I also love strategy games, and I love making political decisions in games...so I tried this.\n\nSome people say they were disappointed, and although I guess I can see what they were disappointed in (the game touches upon so many aspects of a few great genres, so it doesn't delve too deep into any of them), this game is a hybrid of sorts, and is very interesting to boot, so I expected this. As a huge strategy fan, I wasn't expecting this game to blow AoE II out of the water, so I wasn't disappointed. This game delivered exactly what I wanted it to. The strategy aspects aren't greatly complex, though the game has a naturally harder difficulty due to its action-oriented AI (it DOES have four difficulties, though, for those looking for a more casual playthrough). Best of all, because you are the dragon commander, you are able to spawn as a dragon (you also get access to lots of special abilities and upgrades!) and follow your troops into battle to help them take over the map, which is awesome. I really don't have to explain why. :)\n\nThe game is really into getting you involved in political decisions where you decide everything from whether or not to allow gay marriage, to allowing the church to charge civilians for "forgiveness," to sacrificing worker safety in order to create outlandish war machines. You have a team of councillors that all chime in to help you decide, and each councillor represents a race that you can either make happy or unhappy with your decisions. This affects what type of bonuses and benefits you get that either help or hinder your troops on the strategy map. Basically, this game has quite a few little pieces to it that all work together very well, in my opinion. I immensely enjoyed speaking to my councillors and getting to know all of the interesting characters I was introduced to (it was arguably my favorite part). And as is a Divinity staple, the dialogue in this game is top notch, so it is always a joy to read, and the voice acting is also incredible.\n\nPart strategy, part card game, part politically charged RPG, Divinity: Dragon Commander is a fantastic game with high replay value for the storyline decisions alone, if nothing else. I am so glad I bought this game and experienced its highly original concept for myself. I highly recommend it!\n\nEdit 4/29/2016: I've noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful. As I always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers, I would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information I've left out, or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered.

If you're liberal, you're probably going to enjoy this, if you're conservative the game will essentially villify you.\n\nI began just detesting how it pandered to one side of the political spectrum so hard. And I did notice an incredibly cheap shot which I assume was American bashing (They ask you to sign a document stating "All men are created equal" which I KNOW was derived from the constitution, and then after I signed it, everyone hated me because all of a sudden everyone was taxed at the same rate, which isn't even what happens in America).\n\nMy issue with the game stems into the following: The European company that made this game put their own political opinions and agenda in it. It's one thing to leave a sense of justice up to the player, it's another to say everyone who disagrees with your company is a bigot (which actually is a form of biggotry.) It's fine to have your own agenda and write your tumblr blog posts about how perfect it is, provided you keep that out of a videogame.\n\nWhen the skeleton (I assume represents a conservative old man) requests that you brand people with slave marks on their right hand, the dwarf (represents a corprative rich person) says it's a bad idea simply because "A drinking hand is sacred!" These jokes aren't funny, they're frankly unsettling.\n\nThe excuses they use to insult conservatives are honestly disturbing. Their own insults "elves are incredibly attractive tree-lovers" are really not that insulting. The jokes they made against their own party were "haha that elf got mad at her husband for walking into another persons garden." The jokes they made against the conservatives were SHOTS FIRED you pro slavery greedy monsters.\n\nI decided to play to the extremes on both sides between conservative and liberal. Being fair, I actually prefer the bonuses you get from conservative choices, +% victory odds, +more gold +cheaper troops\n\nHowever if you argue against gay marriage, the writers CLEARLY call you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, with a very mary-sue like girl saying "Can't you see that you're so wrong?" over and over.\n\nWheras it mostly applauds you for doing the opposite.\n\nThe multiplayer is a bit frustrating, and when you play it rewards Zerg tactics which I consider very unhealthy.\n\nIn the campaign you literally kill your siblings without a thought, it doesn't really even describe you killing them, it's like they had some plot elements together but forgot to add them. they are all at war with one another, though I've really only noticed them attacking me and my armies.\n\nThere are no negotiations. Your opponent will always be at war with you, you can't request a cease fire or anything along those lines like you might in every other strategy game. I assume the devs were just too lazy.\n\nThe difficulties between acts aren't the issue, the exploits are. You can easily exploit the game to give you tons of cards to one-sidedly execute the enemies. The campaign is a joke at best. If they put a cap on the mercenary cards you could get, it might be balanced, but they don't.\n\nHaving said that the quality of animations, voicework, and graphics were all wonderful, but the gameplay, story, and political mary-suisms make this game not recommended at best.","September 7, 2015","false","39.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

The end.\n2) I bought it on sale and only paid a bit over $5\n\nNow the bad.\n1)For a game called Dragon Commander the "dragon" play seems mostly like an afterthought. You are basically just an airborne hovering turret that can cast buffs and debuffs on units. This is admittedly part of what makes the RTS side interesting but a dragon flight simulator this is not. No dog fights, no barrel rolls. Most of the game can be played without ever becoming a dragon.\n\n2) The political and social side of this game is PAINFULL if you are anything other than a liberal progressive. There is no balance to the gameplay here and the developers biases bleed all over this aspect of the game. As a free-market libertarian the only time I didn't ♥♥♥♥ everyone off was with my support of gay rights. At the very least there should be an option to disable this aspect of the game and play it as a pure RTS.\n\nI have a love hate relationship with this game. When I am on the strategic map or in combat I love it. When I'm on the Raven I hate it. Over all though I cannot recommend this game as I can't see myself enduring too many more hours of ideological pedagogy from the uber-left.

I actually like the strategic game board more than most other games I've played, and the dialogue and characters all have voice acting and at least some amount of characterization, which is pretty nice.\n\nThe actually battles, which unfortunetly are a large part of the game, have a user interface ad overall setup that is frankly unpleasant to deal with and not fun at all.\n\nHere are a brief list of the pros:\n-The dragon transformation works well and playing in dragon form is pretty fun. The transition between normal rts mode and dragon mode is mostly seamless. Given that this is a major differentiator between this and other games I do have to give some props.\n-The unit effects are pretty nice. General graphics are good.\n\nThe cons (mostly interface related):\n-Scrolling is a pain, because the map orientation doesn't change with the camera rotation. You can't use the minimap because up becomes down, sideways, and every direction in between, and it is almost impossible to keep track of what else is going on when units that look like they are coming from below your base are actually up and to the left.\n-The above minimap issues make it very difficult to form strategies and think about what is going on, because unit and base positions are so difficult to keep in mind.\n-Units that are moving towards enemies will not fight back unless explicitly told to. This is actually pretty common among strategy games, and it wouldn't be a problem except that there is no obvious visual indicator to say that a unit is attacking or just moving near an enemy. It is possible to lose whole armies because you clicked near an enemy instead of on them. Attack moving is a partial solution, but unit attack ranges are so long that parts of your army can get caught attacking non-critical targets on the way to a fight.\n-Unit movement is slow and feels clumsy. I guess it is more "realistic," but not my cup of tea.\n-Controlling your units in dragon form becomes even more difficult. With certain hotkeys it is possible to control your nearby units, but it feels really clumsy and there are no visual indicators to tell when units are moving or not. It is difficult to check on your units in dragon form because your camera is restrained to your moving first person view.\n-Probably the worst part of the dragon form controls is that you cannot produce new units while in dragon form. You are forced to either create long queues of units to make (which you often don't have the resources for) or switch between being a dragon and scrolling back to your base to issue more commands (using the mouse because the minimap is impossible).\n-Somewhat minor, but the hotkeys are a little strange. Q is the attack hotkey, not A, etc.\n-Obviously the AI has none of these problems. This creates frustrating situations where the AI is attacking on two or more fronts and you can't even issue commands to your units because the controls are so clumsy.\n\nAll these may seem minor but they really build up. It's a shame because the game is almost really good, but it just isn't fun because of all the issues in the actual implementation. I might try to play the game a little more, try to figure out the controls and see if that helps any, but I doubt it. It doesn't feel like the commitment will be worth it when there are simply more fun games out there.","December 25, 2014","false","1.0"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

Units have to be everywhere and it's a mess.  The research and units are lack luster. The "Auto-Resolve combat" is a joke. You get 3 commanders and can only use one of the 3?\n\nAnd the combat, this is where it really sucker punches you and where I drew the line after having to do it for the upteenth time because it's one of the core parts of the game. First thing is that you have a few units that you start with followed by a mad rush to the recuritment centers and usually within the first 2 minutes. The units aren't interesting. They don't look cool or have fun abilities.  Enmasse seemed the best way to use them anyways. It kind of feels like a half finished total conversion mod inplanted in a game.\n\nBut wait, you're a dragon! With......a jetpack. That right there kinda angered me. You're supposed to be this huge majestic dragon in the sky breathing fire on everyone and instead it's almost a comical unit. The Dragon is powerful enough but not overly powerful. His abilities are cool but you felt like this annoying random air unit that went everywhere then some commander.\n\nI don't know, I wanted to love this game.

You do not build bases rather have a troop capture it then build one of 5 buildings ( One for Light, heavy etc) creating units is fast with it being five seconds at most to create a unit. The main ponit of dragon commander (and downfall) is the dragon mode you can take in battle allowing you to turn into a dragon with skills to use on the enemy, instead of building a balanced army of troops and using tactics you instead Ram all troops you have into the enemys and turn into a dragon to push. Every battle turns into a wait game to use dragon mode then attack and unless the enemy has a huge amount of counter air you will auto win within the first attack. [Side Note: While dragon form breaks the RTS element you still get to ♥♥♥♥ING BE A DRAGON AND NOT A WYRM OR SOME ♥♥♥♥  DRAGON POWERS]\n\nNow the non RTS part is the more intresting part of the game and shows the writing of the game, you do your best to appease the NPCS making desiscions that affect your campain (like reduced cost of hiring units for the rest of the campain at the cost of max population in your army). Now about the waifu/love instrest there are four different ones each with there own questlines and have different endings depending on choices you make that will also affect the campain.\n\nThe game does come with skirimish mode but I would rather play another RTS for a better experaince, replayablity is mainly on the choice side of things.\n\nOverall rating would be 7/10  from a team that is used to RPG's the game shine's on the writing it lacks the main ponit of the genre the strategy. I would also recommend only getting this on sale  I dont recommend full price.","July 3, 2014","true","24.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

This is probablu due to the game not being able to handle my frequent abuse of the "dodge" command (right mouse-button) or too long uses of the jetpack boost (space).\nThen onto the game itself.\nAs this is a political-strategy/RTS game (you will have your fair share of both), it needs to be reviewd as such.\nSadly, the RTS part is not as polished and well done as one would hope of a game that titles itself as an RTS. Sure, it is great fun to fly around in your dragon form (yes, it's RTS + TPS-elements) and just f*ck up your enemies, but there are preformance issues (listed above, that only occur in the RTS-moments), as well as a quite unbalanced fighting mechanic. Yes, there are many different types of troops to choose from, that each counter another and so on, but once you get to the point where you can manufacture "Juggernauts", the game becomes easy enough for a infant on drugs to win any battle.\nSo, how come I still recommend this one?\nDespite the RTS parts being not-completely-satisfying at times, what keeps this game floating is the political system.\nUndead, Elves, Dwarfs, Lizards and Imps all want to have their say in your daily doings, wanting to shape your future empire into the best possible one for their own race. Your chioces will either gain you good or bad standing with each of theese races, which in turn alter your possibility to recruit soilders in different areas where different races live.\nThis system of politics is done well enough to take focus away from the flawed RTS battles and give you loads of fun toying with the councillors' dilemmas.\nBecause let's all face it, we all want to do make that one choice that makes 4 out of 5 races hate you because, well, for the sheer hell of it!","June 28, 2014","true","22.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You are an emperor of your own land and you have to make your own choices for it.\nThere are five races in this world lisards, imps, elves, dorfes and undead, will you favor one and anger the rest will you allow gay marriage and build environment friendly war maschines it's up to you to decide, but be aware your choices effect you strategy.\nFor example if you want to defent a providence of elves you might have possitive or negative strategy bonus from it depending on whether or not the elves like you making your every decision count .\nThe strategic part is also hanled well first you have a turned based map where you buy and move your units and counqer the providences of you enemies.\nEach providen's bring's you some of research points and money, research points can be used to unlock new units and upgrade the ones you have as well use to gein new abilities for you dragon form to use on the battlefield wille money can be use to buy unit's from your factory or new buildings for your providences , you can build an observatory or a mine to get more of each however you can only have one building in each area so you must be carefull .\nIf by the end of your tern you have invade an enemy's providence or the opposite you'll have to fight the there are 2 ways to fight one is to have your army or your generals fight for you or take them down yourself by controning your army in a real time battle similar to the starcraft but with dragons you can apear in your dragon form in the fight and help you troops.\nYour goal is to conquer the world ( of course!!! ) and defeat your evil siblings , the game only has one ending how ever it has tons of your personal endings  very for from your marriage partner to whethere or not you'll allow gender equality ading tons of replay value to it.\nhow ever it does have it's problems the strategy is prety simplistic whith only 3 unit tipes for troopers, tanks, ships and air ballons which can all be unlocked easily and the map get's very borring sometimes and ruins any exitment you might have to fight, so don't expect a hardcore tactical expirience how ever it's a very good game and i hope i see an awesome sequel wich will fix the simplistic stratigy over all it get's my rating of 8/10 a great game wich can successfully combine strategy and rpg ellements i defenatly recomend it","July 12, 2014","true","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Your father, the Emperor of Rivellon, has been murdered, and his kingdom is split between the children that tried to usurp his throne. It is now up to the illigitimate child, of both dragon and man, to defeat the children, unite the lands, and claim the throne.\n\nThe story it's self is quite well-written and humorous, mixing serious matters and a light-hearted undertone. The political part is by far the most excellent part of the game, forcing you to hear your advisors side, as well as forging your own opinion. This also parodies current world matters, such as gay marriage, women rights, arranged marraige and so on.The action comes into play when in the middle of a battle, you can turn the tide by switching into a dragon, The RPG elements allow custimization of your dragon as well as its abilities, and your own armies and bonuses to them.\n\nHowever the most under developed part is the RTS part, very close to the StarCraft style. The game encourages "Zerg Rush" style gameplay because otherwise your battles will last forever and never end, and will mostly end in a lack of workers to make more units. In conclusion Dragon Commander could be so much more, by immensely improving on it's RTS elements, and eliminating the "Zerg Rush" need to win.\n\nIf you like Board Games, RTS, Political simulators, or even action games, I encourage you to try it. If your not good at RTS, just let the computer do it for you. You won't regret it.\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","10.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game combined a lot of elements that I love into a game I couldn't wait to buy, one of the few I've ever preordered. I quite enjoyed Larian's Divinity II and thus had faith that they'd do well with this game as well, and they lived up to expectations. Once you finish the campaign you can make a custom one that avoids the cutscenes and seperate acts, making for a lot of replayability so you can explore the many political decisions set before you. The strategic overview is simple but funtions quite well, the units on said overview map coming with you into the RTS battles in contested territories. The RTS component itself is much simpler than most as it comprises a single resource, recruits, that is shared amoung all the players. Controlling more Citadels means you get a larger portion of this pool, and should a battle exhaust this resource it comes down to who can manage what they got from the pool better. Of course my personal favourite part of the game is entering the battle yourself as a dragon, and if played well you can significantly change the flow of battle, often strong enough to strafe around and destroy smaller groups of units. You have limited RTS control in dragon form however, and may have to exit dragon mode to execute further commands, though transitioning back and forth is quite fluid.","December 15, 2013","true","53.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Your left with a game, that you know is rubbish and yet I'm still playing it... so since I can't decide, lets dissect the game in the hopes that you can decide weather to buy it or not.\nHaving played 50+ hours of Divinity II (RPG), was looking forward to this faster, RTS style game play of Divinity Dragon Commander….\nFirst impressions weren’t good. Opening cut scene I liked at first told through a style of cardboard cut-out 2D puppet show but when it finished, it felt like it was missing quite abit of information, I felt it should have switched to a 3D CGI cut scene going into more depths the final moments leading up to the start of the game.\nInstead you’re thrown into the game, with a lot of questions on what exactly is going on.\nAt that point, it didn’t get any better, the 1st RTS battle you go into, instead of an optional tutorial mission, that you could skip, your given boring videos to watch.\nThe battle itself, though probably not just the fault of this game, more the fault of RTS games of late, where instead of building your base and your forces (ah the days of Command & Conquer), basically all you do is spam the unit build button repeatedly, as this is a battle of numbers over tactics, the AI will quickly send its forces straight for you, literally minutes into the battle, so basically build your forces quick, until you can spawn your Dragon.\nAfter a timer, you can call your Dragon into battle, though not very effective against buildings, your Dragon can easily wipe out enemy forces by itself, using the Dodge button to avoid missiles, clearing a path for your forces to destroy the enemies buildings, in particle the Anti-Air turrets allowing your Dragon freedom of movement. In a lot of cases, once you gain the advantage the AI just gives up, though this is part of the experience, as if your near to losing a count down timer starts up, personally I'd rather go down fighting or at least given the choice to surrender or maybe retreat.\nSaying that, considering how rubbish the RTS experience is, it’s probably a good thing that you can finish the battle as soon as possible.\nSo if this had been a demo I was playing, that would have been the end of it, a crappy game, not worth a 2nd glance.\nHowever, I had bought this game (luckily on sale), so I pressed on and found, the characters you interact with, the politics side of the game most interesting, so that I was willing to suffer an RTS battle to see what would happen next and what choices you might have to make.\nSadly these choices only really effect who likes and dislikes you and apart from a newspaper article at the start of each turn you don’t see any lasting effects of these choices, though the choices don’t always have the most obvious of outcomes. MAYBE these choices will have some dramatic effect on the end of the game, if you can suffer the RTS to get there.\nBut saying that, there is also conversations choices and these, since you interact with, have more impact, if only in witty comebacks or outcomes, I found myself when given one choice, saving my game and then choosing the option I would of least gone with and hitting the end turn button without actually playing the game, to see the result, which just gave me another interesting choice and found myself, just hitting the end turn button for least 10 turns to see what would happen next!\nSo if the politics sided of the game, combinded with the RPG choices interests you AND you think you can cope with the boring RTS, give it a go but only on sale, besides you do get to fly as a Dragon, lol.","February 14, 2015","false","31.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And for a while, for like 2 chapters or so of the game, I did!  Then, like so much other AAA bullcrap that comes out these days, the game ran out of steam and stopped being interesting.  Don't get me wrong, it looks amazing and all that, and the concept is a great one.  Even the first part of the execution is very well done.  It's just that it never really gets any meat on its bones.  It's all surface, all shell.  No center.\n\nExamples:  You get the ability to turn into a dragon wearing a jetpack during the RTS battles and help out your troops.  Sounds great, but all your dragon abilities are weak and stupid, you die really quickly, and while you're in dragon form, controlling your troops is a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nYou get to choose which woman to marry (it'd be nice if I could've PLAYED as one, maybe they'd have some husband options or given me the choice to be gay one way or the other, or anything other than what's there), but then after she has like, one sidequest that takes place entirely in dialogue, that's it.  Your queen does exactly 1 thing.  Well, two things.  She's got a quest that does nothing, and she's got clothed boobs for you to look at as she says the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing every time you visit her chamber.  That's it.\n\nThe RTS portions lack strategy.  Good board positioning between battles is about as tactical as it gets.  The story starts off sounding interesting but never really goes anywhere.  And then just when you think it's over, a stupid thing happens, not for any good reason mind you, and then you're still playing it, but nothing interesting is happening apart from just... more game.  Your generals all have maybe one interesting quest that they do, as well.  The political decisions were a nice concept, but then they have VERY minimal impact on gameplay.  It's all just shuffling around numbers.  Show me some CONSEQUENCES!  I consistently just did whatever I wanted, politically, and everyone loved me at the end of the game anyway.  I never had to change the way I played the game outside of the room where you Make The Pointless Decisions.  That shouldn't happen.  There's not enough tech or dragon abilities to research, either.  You'll have them all, easily, well before the end of the game.  It's like it was developed by lots of people, none of whom were talking to each other, and they all had like a page of notes at most to work from for content.\n\nVery disappointing.  Lots of potential, utterly wasted.","July 5, 2014","false","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The problem is your dragon is incredibly powerful, and you can just fireball everything to death very quickly. luckily it's countered by you only being able to participate in one battle per turn.\n\nIt's a good one, I'd say it's worth at least 25 dollars, get it if it's on sale.

In reality, I'd suggest it on a whim, while warning that it really should be bought when it's on sale... Or free...\n\nThe gameplay is interesting, though a bit annoying at times. The political simulation bit, involving marriage of princesses and keeping relations high with various races is interesting. Yet at the same time it's time consuming and provides very little to the actual strategy and flow of the rest of the game.\n\nThe combat is nice, flows very easily when you are in the Dragon Commander role. Flying through the sky, blowing up every little thing that gets into your path is always nice. The controls for it are simple, and work very well. On the other hand, the real time strategy part is lacking. Once you get a steamroll going, your opponent can't stop you. Likewise, the computer/other player can do the same to you. If you lack a strong army to start the round off with, then you will get dominated.\n\nThe cards add useful effects, but are a bit limited in variety.

At that point in time I remove myself from said table and promptly exit the premises reminding myself never to be duped again.\n\nSo as I am eating the radishes that is Dragon Commander I find I am served with actual food, graham crackers. Dragon commander has a pretty interesting way of mixing empire managment, a card game, RTS, 3rd person (DRAGON) combat and some simplistic relationship building between your queen and generals. All of it is solid, except the RTS that's terrible and not just because I don't do RTS...it's bad.\n\nOverall it's a well rounded experience though replayability isn't that great unless you have other player dragons to torch..but eh...what can you say.\n\n3 out of 5 Chiliwigs","September 6, 2013","true","41.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The world and cast is very colourful and genuinely engaging. The campaign strategy and RTS elements are quite simple but enjoyable nonetheless.\n\nThe highlight is without a doubt role-playing an Emperor in a fascinating and hilarious steampunk fantasy world. The dialogue is well written and the voice acting is terrific. The choices you confront can be pretty tough and interesting.

In reality, I'd suggest it on a whim, while warning that it really should be bought when it's on sale... Or free...\n\nThe gameplay is interesting, though a bit annoying at times. The political simulation bit, involving marriage of princesses and keeping relations high with various races is interesting. Yet at the same time it's time consuming and provides very little to the actual strategy and flow of the rest of the game.\n\nThe combat is nice, flows very easily when you are in the Dragon Commander role. Flying through the sky, blowing up every little thing that gets into your path is always nice. The controls for it are simple, and work very well. On the other hand, the real time strategy part is lacking. Once you get a steamroll going, your opponent can't stop you. Likewise, the computer/other player can do the same to you. If you lack a strong army to start the round off with, then you will get dominated.\n\nThe cards add useful effects, but are a bit limited in variety. Mostly they add units, make units cheaper, or sabatoge the enemy.\n\nThe graphics are very nice, very lifelike with the animations. But not enough to keep you distracted from the annoying aspects of the game.\n\nAll in all, I give it a 3/5. It's not great, but it isn't horrible.

For one the strategy map at first confused the hell out of me and took me off guard, for people whom have ever played RISK such as myself I actually liked it and felt it was a nice change from most typical maps you see in most strategy games.\n\nI must critize the combat though in RTS, it's not only unfair most of the time with the AI merely rushing you at every oppurtunity but also the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t odds you have to fight against with them clearly obtaining unfair advantages even in later game play, I never seem to feel like I have the upper hand going into it unless the odds are overwhelming this caused me to dread the RTS element the jetpack was actually a lot of fun but that doesn't save it from being a definate negative element as the other factors lead me to automatically reslove most of the time.\n\nBut high praise for the story and the way it progress though for those willing to risk a (kind of?) spoiler the ending is BULLS**T I felt ripped off with the ending. The journey there however. Stunning. I just felt that end kind of left me wanting, but honestly that doesn't really detract from it.

Nearly all the issues that you are to deal with is political garbage brought in directly from Tumblr and the like.

A nice mashup of total war and dawn of war, but after that? It all goes down hill.\n\nThe characters are almost universally 2 dimensional. Once you've spoken to them once or twice, you know immediately how they'll react to any given situation without even having to talk to them. They're purly defined by their sterotypes. The bigotted lizard is always bigotted, the sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ general is always a sexist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the icequeen manhating general is always an icequeen manhater and that's the only thing that ♥♥♥♥ing defines her decisions. It's infuriating. The two most believable characters from the 1st chapter are the '♥♥♥♥/vixen' general, and the Imp Ambassador. While both are probably meant to come off as 'lol random!' they actually come off as believable because they have reasons for their beliefs and decisions that are above and beyond simple sterotypes. I mean, come on. A character has to be VERY badly written when the mad scientist character and the token wildcat female party member are less formulaic than said character is.\n\nAlso the stuff in anachronystic. A lot of the political decisions make NO sense in context. There's a world war going on. While some of these decisions would make sense when you own more than one country, or even more than one province, when you're just trying to get a foot hold, making a call on gay marriage, for example, is simply not what people are going to be concerned with, at least not on the highest levels of government. Your ambassadors are going to be more worried about the impacts of war on their populations, refugee populations, criminal ♥♥♥♥. Getting the FOUNDATION of your new empire running would take precedence. Establishing public order, getting laws established, all of those things.\n\nFinally, the game shows some obviously lazy programming, art, and UI managment. THe game resets the difficulty to normal between games rather than switching it, so you need to check on the difficulty every time you reopen Dragon Commander. The Undead are literally skeleton textures pasted onto humanoid body skeltons and polygons, so that you have bones and jaws moving as if they were made of flesh and muscle, not solid calcified bone.\n\nI -really- wanted to like Divinity: Dragon Commander. It was SUCH a cool concept. But it failed so badly in execution on the small things, such as writing and art, that I'm having a hard time suspending my disbelief. Every time the dwarf acts like a neo-con ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over incredibly stupid ♥♥♥♥ during a time of ♥♥♥♥ing war, every time the undead is an intollerant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, every time the elf is a hippie even when it would probably cost the lives of his own dudes. All of it just takes me out of the experience.\n\nThey also could have used a more robust system of imperial politicing. Allowing us to have multiple choices, accepting proposals in part or in full, or even tacking on things to it. Making compromises and settling the thing fully. Not just a simple yay-nay system, with all of the decisions inevitably being 'are you liberal or conservative!'\n\nWhat if I don't want to deport convicts? What if I want to send them to Imp war foundries to help the war effort? What if I want to have limited conscription or at the very least incentivise joining the war effort rather than just ripping people out of their houses and homes?\n\nThere was so much potential in Dragon Commander. And it feels wasted on this subpar, rushed game.","December 29, 2013","false","3.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

It is beyond badly designed. You will start out owning 1 country with only enough resources for a few( like 3) combat units. Your opponent will start off with 6 countries and every time without fail (it's even in the map they show on their first video) the enemy will grab one of the only two neutral countries you are able to grab at the beginning of the game. So it will have 7 countries with the army that those countries can provide and then the AI will not hesitate to take your capital and make you lose the game (with its very first turn, that is how close the enemy is WHEN YOU START THE GAME) with all 24 of it's units to your meager 3. I restarted the campaign 4 times to see if I was just unlucky. Nope every single time I was SWARMED with so many enemy units it was literally impossible to keep up. You only produce about 6 gold per turn to buy units while your opponent gets 30+.\n\nUtterly bad concept for game designers. There should be several buffer zones between you and the opponent until you can figure out what is what. The RTS portion of the game is utter garbage, it will consist of who can button mash the most units faster than the other. No it will not tell you what the hell each building is or what your resources are it will just throw you into a skirmish and give you a crash course on what the hell each building is or does (and not explain why each building is important and which ones you need to build to counter your opponent or how many resources each one costs or how you can capture the stupid little land plots OR tell you which building produces which unit). There is absolutely 0 time for you to get used to the game mechanics because the AI will just bum rush you with every unit it can spawn.\n\nThere is 0 tactical skill needes it's literally A click and whoever spawns the most units wins. It's so dumb plus the "advantage" you have with your dragon is poultry. It takes 4-5 shots to kill even one unit and they will make hundreds of them.\n\nDo NOT get this game you won't get farther than a few turns.","June 21, 2015","false","1.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

Most people will find the dialogue excessively wordy, but it's pretty rare to ever hear that comment about a game. Dialogue choices do impact the game, and I made multiple save points so that I could go back and explore the other outcomes. The game very frequently forces you to make the best choice out of several bad choices, and tries to really punch you in the morals at every opportunity. It leans heavily on real-world allegory, and reminds me a lot like being in a commanding role on Deep Space 9 or Babylon 5, but in a fantasy/steampunk setting.\n\nThe rest of the game is fairly standard turn-based overmap strategy, and real-time tactical combat. The overmap game is very simple, although you'll feel burned by some of the "rules" in your first playthrough - the map expands and resets your assets, which can leave you in awkward positions at the start of the next story phase. The tactical combat is generic, however the dragon-mode spices things up. I found myself frustrated at all the limitations on the dragon game mechanics, especially since it's one of the most unique (and heavily advertised) features of the game.\n\nOverall I recommend the game to any RTS, RPG, or moral dilemma fan. This game has left me dreaming of a perfect world where the Divinity RPG/story components are married with the solid strategy of a game like StarCraft II.","May 23, 2014","true","23.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

This is RTS that is great in everything except for RTS batteles themselves. It has dozens of great characters, lots of good humor and awesome style (sereously, just look at how awesome map is, with it's animated detailes and wooden figures, representing units), but lacks in it's RTS component. I'm not telling that it's horribly bad, RTS battles were really exiting at first with turning into dragon stuff and all, but I quickly got borerd of them and started to use autoresolve as frequently as possible, because AI can't present even a little challange, after you get hang of things, more or less (and I played on hard difficulty btw). Yes, RTS has some depth to it, but you won't need most of units and their abilities against AI. Online play is a totaly different thing. With real opponent you can have more than one fun battle and even play a full compain. Yes, and bugs, lots of bugs.\n\nDespite  those minuses, I still think thats it's a great game and will recommend it to anybody who won't be scared with concept of RTS-RPG-TBS hybrid. Where else you can decide to allow or not having citizen giant bears for pets, marry an udead princess and turn into a dragon and fly into the sunset? But here's my advice: put diffuculty settings to casual and enjoy great story.

There's a ton of units to choose from, all with well-animated steampunk flavor, but many of them are locked by out-of-map research options. I quickly realized that the first 2-3 units can do almost all the work I ever needed, and that was boring.\n\nAnd that's really the problem with DDC. the core RTS fighting is just booooooorrrrriiiiiing. I think at some point the developers realized this, as they seem to have spent quite a bit of development time coming up with ways for me to avoid the boring top-down play. Hence they have the 'dragon' mechanic, allowing you to turn into a dragon with a jetpack(cool idea I guess), and an MMO-esque hotbar of powers to roast enemies with, as well as allowing your generals to auto-resolve the combat for you, giving you a % boost depending on their particular skills to the outcome.\n\nBut even that gets old quick. The RTS play is your standard(ugh, I hate that this is standard now) click specific spots to build from a radial tree of buildings(ala LOTR's RTS, etc. So no starcraft base building). I -do- like the 'population' mechanic, in that both sides have an upper number to how many units can ever be built in a single match(and once you run out, no more units can be built) Though it did help me find the boring, but incredibly effective style of 'sit in my base as a dragon, roast enemies until the timer goes down, rinse, repeat' that allowed me to defeat any army the enemy threw at me as long as I managed my resources even half decently, up to and including enemy capitals with significantly larger starting forces then my own. There's no time limit that I can see while being a dragon other than being defeated and well, you're a hyper-powerful dragon. Using a few units as bait you can divebomb enemies essentially at will, since their AI doesn't have very good threat detection.\n\nThe game really shines in the parts of it that have nothing to do with combat. Every Dragon Commander gets to make policy among your advisors, generals, and general hanger-ons. The characters are larger then life and incredibly hammy in terms of writing, but it works for the sparking super-steampunk atmosphere the game cultivates. Prissy elves that demand you rever nature and gay rights, Dwarves that are all about money and booze, hper-religious undead, scientific, war-hungry Imps and socialistic, upper-crust lizardfolk  all vie for your attention and favor, which supposedly changes how certain territories produce gold and research for your in-combat gameplay. Unfortunately, it didn't really seem to do much other then I lost out on a gold piece or two, and with how easy the combat was I didn't miss it at all.\n\nThere isn't ANY option to play a female commander, which is a let down, so if you're into playing a pretty empress you'll be sorely dissappointed. This is surprisingly bizarre not just because we've come to expect options for faceless main character customization before(the only character model you as emperor even have is a giant, scaled monster after all), but because the game makes constant attempts to have you influence policy for gender equality(for or against). You can't even make the argument that only a male heir can become the emperor, since in the campaign itself your 'sisters' are also attemptingto take the throne, so clearly that isn't a barrier for rule.\n\nYou also get to choose a 'princess' to marry from the other races(Wierdly, your advisor declares you'll be a racist for choosing a human mate, despite being a half dragon. Probably because there's no human politician you get a bonus to, since humans oddly have no bearing on the civilian happiness-index, yet appear everywhere on your ship and were the species where the last emperor came from).\n\nDespite my sadness at them not allowing you to choose an Imp princess(they're really the best faction IMO- science and pragmatic explosions are fun, and having sex with an undead animated skeleton is apparently more ok for the Devs then a tiny pink goblin), I found the princess options rather fun, since only one of them really even cares about you as anything other than a money-sink or political tool. This starts a dating-sim esque setting that pops up over the course of the campaign, which I honestly found myself way more interested in, to the point I started auto-resolving every fight and skipping turns to keep going.\n\nAll in all I found DDC a sub-par RTS, but a hilariously over-written political dating sim. I think if they ever make a sequel, axing the combat in favor of making choices for your generals to hand out would be far more enjoyable, since the combat just sucks all fun out of the campaign, even when auto-resolving, since it wastes time I could have been making social decisions over things like gay rights, animal control, and government scholarships. Since none of the good/bad writing makes it over into the campaign map, it also sucks the flavor out of the game as well. If you like RTS play, skip this title, ut if you like quirky storylines and don't mind the lack of a female main character option, it's worth it on sale.","May 1, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Dragon Comander combines political decisions and large scale conquest. a decision you make in your throne room can have huge effects on the battle field whether its making units absurdly cheap or making the inhabitants of a cretian country give you less aid. often I found my self in a situation where i could make a decision i agreed with and would offend one of the five races or one that would gain me support even though i disagreed with it.

I just bought the Divinity Anthology and I am currently waiting for it to come in the mail. Divinity: Dragon Commander was enjoyable. This is the first time I've ever seen a strategy game like this. It has included all of my faviorte elements of games I enjoyed today, such as Mass Effect, Risk, the Total War series, and put them together into one big pot. The RTS battles were a bit difficult though, even on casual. With the enemy troops constantly zerg rushing, camera controls being awful, and with not the best computer out there, I found the RTS battles extremely difficult, so I avoided them during the campaign part of the game. The controls in RTS will probably take some time getting use to, especially for new players playing RTS games for the first time. Just using the turtorial alone to get a feel of the game isn't enough, you'll need to pratice a bit with skirmish battles., that and the tutorial is very lacking. I wish they included much more useful tips in it.\n\nPlaying as a dragon with a jet pack is really fun in the RTS battles, my only complaint is how difficult it is to handle your troops and micro manage as a dragon. Not to mention selecting them is a bit difficult. I died quite a few times when I attempting to get the hang of things. The dragon can be a life savor though if you're inexperience. Overall, I enjoyed the Risk like board in the campaign mode, and I really enjoyed the politics and how it affected your army, gold, and troop morale. I attempted to play the game as a good character and it was difficult having to pick the higher road when in return you had to sacrifice resources. Sometimes, the high road can hit you badly with its outcomes. This is perhaps the first time I've seen a stratagey game with rpg elements, I really enjoyed the different characters and their personalities. It's important to interact with your generals as much as you can, seeing as finishing their stories will improve your chances on the battle field. I didn't realize unil the end of Act II that your actions can affect the personality changes in your generals, and that there is more than one ending for them, and the princessess that you can marry which makes the replay value in this game high, seeing as the choices you make can lead to different outcomes. With the Imperial pack, there is a chart/diagram that can show you the different outcomes for each character, not to mention some behind the scene stuff, concept rp, and a dlc.\n\nI highly recommend this game for others; this is something refreshing in the strategy genre. There were a few things that I had quirks about, like the rewarding for zerg rushing, how insanely powerful your dragon can become when maxed out and control issues, but overall, I believe the good parts of the game out weigh the bad part. I wouldn't give it a ten out of ten, but it's a lovely game to have in your library. Hopefully, the other Divinity games will be too. For certain, I'll have to make a guide and indepth review for this game in the future.","January 9, 2014","true","31.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Base building RTS, Grand stratagy and a Ruling style sim. The latter 2 are functional and enjoyable, especially the charicter interactions and dialogue. Your actions in that area matter and has a colourful and unique setting. The RTS element is lacking, unit spamming and grinding, but the dragon combat is fun and makes a change from the norm. In short this game needs a bigger, better longer developed successor to be a complete package, but given how good the other 2 main elements are I have to reccomend this as a unique gaming experience and and an original idea in practise.","January 20, 2014","true","13.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Game is very fun, with the best part being the political choices and impact they will have. You also have to chose a wife, with the choices being quite funny (But holding a big political impact) The battles are awesome, and if you are getting tired of them you can always have your imperial army or one of your generals battle for you. (For a cost) Having beaten the game, I just wish the campaign was a wee bit longer. All in all, great game. Would give it a solid 4 out of 5 stars. The only gripes I had with the game is that research points become useless fairly quickly (You can max out almost everything before you even hit the second map) and a lot of the dragon abilities seem useless. I would of enjoyed it more if I could of spent research points on existing skills to make them a bit stronger. A idea, have the dragon skills start off weaker. Then allow you to slowly upgrade them in exchange for research points. Think I ended the game with over 450 research points I couldn't do anything with.\n\nHaven't tried the multiplayer yet, waiting for a few friends to pick up the game.

It plays well, with minor bugs, but has the potensial for many hours of awesome gameplay and replayability. I would recommend this for the RTS nerd that wants a little extra to bring in the mix. It's more simplistic in the main RTS part of the game (reminds me of the CnC series in a way) and mixes it with both turnbased terretory expansion (ala Total war series) and a 3rd person shooter within the main battle. And on top of that is a very interesting RPG element that makes awesome choises with different outcomes.\nThe AI would be awesome if it was a little better balanced, for new players can easly plow through both easy and normal, but once you start on hard, it quickly become way to hard, and all AI target you, rather then each other.\nThis game is very cool to show of, and the multiplayer shows the true potential of it. tons of fun, and a great intro to something that might become an Multiplayer classic.\n\nwould like to see more map variety, and factions. other than that it hits a solid 9/10 for me.","April 29, 2014","true","30.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I have a lot of fun playing the game and it's really nice to play it with other players too.\n\nSo there are 3 big features in the game.\n\nThe politic part in the solo where you make choices as chief. It is really interesting for the impact it can have on your army and the world and for the fun it has too. Sometimes the politics ask you very strange or useless things and they are fighting each other to make you choose their decision. This parti is very well written and the story very nice.\n\nThe strategy map turn based. Interesting part too. The maps are really beautiful and it can be very strategic. There is a card system too where you can use some cards to build buildings on the map, decrease the price of the units in a place, or even mercenary cards to help you in a fight you are disadvantaged. The map , the strategy, and the cards make it really nice and interesting.\n\nThe RTS. The maps are nice, the different units and capacity too and the fights are really fun. Being able to help your unit by changing in dragon in real time is so good. But I find it a little fast and not always well balanced.\n\nTo conclude this game is a pearl. You have to play it and have fun with it . Yes all the part are not always well balanced and the RTS is not the best RTS, the strategy map the best strategy map etc... BUT all this combined make this game one of the best game i've played. Judging the game only with one aspect ( like a lot of people do with the rts part ) is bad i think because the game is not only a RTS. The RTS is a part of the game, like the strategy or the politics and it's their combinaison who make this game so good. This is an independant studio so they haven't millions it's why every parti is nice and fun but would need some enhancement.\n\nPlay It :D","January 11, 2014","true","55.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

You also get to discuss politics with your Generals with realworld topics about war, racism, sexism, religion and more. Eveyone has their own opinion and you get to decide either by doing what you think is "right" or by playing the politics game and manipulation your alliances.\n\nIt's pretty profund in some aspects but sadly, at the time i first played it, the RTS part of the game suffered from a lack of polish as base building and capturing was tedious and pointless when you only needed to spam your fireballs around the map and be agile. Units do have strengths and weaknesses but ultinately, it's not really a question of strategy but if you participate actively as a dragon or not.\n\nStill fun though.","December 19, 2013","true","27.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

These decisions have a effect on how you are recieved by the politicians, but can also alter public support, gold or research per turn etc..

The balance isn't perfect - it takes way too long to beat the game at the rate you do things, not that I mind a long and heartfelt battle, but I was having nothing new to do when I got into the second act.\n\nThese are a few of the things I saw, could go into more but won't :)\n\nThe baseline?

While it's a little bit easy to just turn into a dragon and melt your opponent's entire army, it still feels fun. The controls remain responsive enough, and the steampunk era clothing and technology tickles me in all the right places.\n\nHowever, this is still a very rough cut game. It's strategy is to just have more units for the most part, and the AI is quickly outsmarted by the smallest amount of micro. You can win battles you should be assured to lose just by moving damaged units back, as the AI will either stop firing to try and kill that unit still, thus advancing into your entire army, or give up on the target, which allows you to essentially laugh off any unfavorable engagement with the right clicking.\n\nI am, however, a little bit discouraged by the way some of the things are phrased in the campaign.\n\nPolitical choices are a plain black and white, and the Dwarves always end up on the losing side of minority when it comes to decision making, leaving you to try and keep them all around 40%, or to just ruin one race's political standing entirely, without hope for recompense. I feel as if there should have been a few more options that 'Yay' or 'Nay' to some of these choices, and more information given to the player.\n\nThe races do each play a delightfully radical faction each, and do seem to personify their races quite well, I never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually think of a beardless dwarf as a dwarf, but it happened. The radicalism in diplomats can be offsetting though, I'm not quite sure how they get away with talking to you after you make a decision they dont enjoy either, as it's quite treasonous talk, but it does give a good idea to if they enjoyed or didn't enjoy your decision.\n\nIs it worth the money though? Maybe.\n\nIf the game goes on sale, feel free to purchase away, at it's full price though, show caution, as this game could use a good year more in development to be as polished as I wish it was. Granted it would result in a much larger game to have further choices and the like, but I think it'd be just that much more deliciously unique then. If you enjoyed the choice system of Fable 3's second half though, feel free to purchase away immediately however, as it's more of that, but in a RTS.","April 13, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While it's a little bit easy to just turn into a dragon and melt your opponent's entire army, it still feels fun. The controls remain responsive enough, and the steampunk era clothing and technology tickles me in all the right places.\n\nHowever, this is still a very rough cut game. It's strategy is to just have more units for the most part, and the AI is quickly outsmarted by the smallest amount of micro. You can win battles you should be assured to lose just by moving damaged units back, as the AI will either stop firing to try and kill that unit still, thus advancing into your entire army, or give up on the target, which allows you to essentially laugh off any unfavorable engagement with the right clicking.\n\nI am, however, a little bit discouraged by the way some of the things are phrased in the campaign.\n\nPolitical choices are a plain black and white, and the Dwarves always end up on the losing side of minority when it comes to decision making, leaving you to try and keep them all around 40%, or to just ruin one race's political standing entirely, without hope for recompense. I feel as if there should have been a few more options that 'Yay' or 'Nay' to some of these choices, and more information given to the player.\n\nThe races do each play a delightfully radical faction each, and do seem to personify their races quite well, I never thought I'd see the day where I'd actually think of a beardless dwarf as a dwarf, but it happened. The radicalism in diplomats can be offsetting though, I'm not quite sure how they get away with talking to you after you make a decision they dont enjoy either, as it's quite treasonous talk, but it does give a good idea to if they enjoyed or didn't enjoy your decision.\n\nIs it worth the money though? Maybe.\n\nIf the game goes on sale, feel free to purchase away, at it's full price though, show caution, as this game could use a good year more in development to be as polished as I wish it was. Granted it would result in a much larger game to have further choices and the like, but I think it'd be just that much more deliciously unique then. If you enjoyed the choice system of Fable 3's second half though, feel free to purchase away immediately however, as it's more of that, but in a RTS.","April 13, 2014","true","10.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I can say that it sets the story very well, and I found the characters interesting (though for some it might not be). However, as a new player to Dragon Commander, I found it very hard to play with almost to nothing tutorials. The only tutorials they really have is a pop-up screen (for the conquest part) and videos for the RTS component.\n\nFor those looking for a similar RTS style I would say that it would be close to Dawn of War, except you are limited to the number of buildings you have. But by far the worst part of this game is it's tutorial for the RTS. All they did was put a video in, watch the video (you had to click on it instead of it coming up before the battle) and send you on your way. The videos didn't even explain much. There wasn't even like an easy RTS mission to set you up so that you can get familiar with the style, it just throws you right in. Also I have no idea how the cards work.\n\nIt's a shame that I am not interested in playing this game anymore because some elements of it seem really well put but they just went lazy on some parts that wouldn't exactly help a new player to the game.","May 5","false","6.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InAmberClad/recommended/243950/","InAmberClad","InAmberClad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InAmberClad/","2094 products in account","Also known as Political Simulator 2013.\n\nDivinity: Dragon Commander places you in the role of well, as the name applies, a Dragon Commander in charge of an army (duh)!\n\nThe game is divided into several parts, much like the Strategy games of today. The first phase involves you walking around your command ship, talking to various politicians, your generals and the adorable little imp to research upgrades for your army.\n\nAfter talking to them, you head on the battle phase of the game. This is where you're thrown into a map for you to manage your armies, which country builds what unit or structure, the movement of your armies and the activation of player cards (which gives you a slight advantage in combat).\n\nCombat is much like Star Wars: Empire at War -- You start off with a bunch of units, keep sending them to their deaths to try to achieve victory and call in more reinforcements when needed. Reinforcements are based on the amount of population you have in that particular area where the fighting is. Your fight is over the sea? Too bad, you'll have to make do with your current fleet and can expect no reinforcements for that fight.\n\nThe most interesting part about this is that you can morph into a Dragon as and when you want to join the battle, throwing fireballs down at people, healing your own armies or just to fly around being silly. You might find it overpowered in the first few levels. However, do expect to get shot down within a few seconds by a barrage of missiles should you try and charge the enemy army head on in dragon form later on in the levels.\n\nOf course, you can opt for the lazy option of clicking "auto-resolve" battle. The outcome of the battle is determined by the amount of troops you have and the general leading them. Quite more than often, I find myself clicking on that button just because I want to know more about the story than actual fighting.\n\nBesides fighting, you can settle down with some tea and biscuits with the various politicans, arguing over petty things like nudity being banned. I mean, who the heck cares when there's a flippin' war going on? Nope. Politicans will be politicians and thus will keep pestering you for your decisions. Your decisions WILL have an impact on the combat of the game, be it increased gold or having a certain race support you when fighting in their land.\n\nWhat I'll remember about this game would definately be the character voice acting. Quite often, I find myself listening to the long essays that several characters have to say. Music isn't half bad either--catchy, upbeat and pretty fun to listen to when you're commanding armies in the heat of battle.\n\nDragon Commander shines in it's aspect of story-telling and character developement. However, if you're looking for a solid RTS fight--this isn't the game for you.\n\nOverall however, Divinity: Dragon Commander is definately worth the pick up for it's price.\n\nAnd hey! It's on sale as I write this. So yes, it's definately worth the money.","April 13, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","1"

The RTS has gamebreaking bug renders the game not-playable. And you can't save mid game. All RTS games have save option, but this hybrid of bull ♥♥♥♥ has not, somebody was high while doing the hole redneck style.\n\nPlease find the link here http://larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=474590\n\nThe bug aside, even if the game works, this game still sucks, there is no fun in it. Only a freak of a gamer enjoy all three gameplays in one single game. Beside, the interface is not self-explaintory The tutorial does little to explain the tatics, sim and real time strategy gameplay.\n\nIn the Realt time strategy, the unit available work with rock paper scissors logic, much like in age of empire II. But the graphic and the gameplay mechanic makes it very uninteresting to track what your foe is producing to attack you. The whole experience is like learning to write musics without singing and playing an instrument.\n\nDON"T BE FOOLED BY THE FIRST PERSON DRAGON CONTROL in PIC, it plays very little role in the whole game. AND once you have it summoned in the game, you lose control of all your other units - unlike control mechanism in Warcraft 3 where you can control the hero unit AND all other unit at the same time.\n\nIf you enjoy tatics, but don't like RTS, this sucks. If you like RTS, but can't do tatics, this game is a false promise. If you think that dragon is cool to look at, let it be clear that it's a porn actress which used to be a hairy man to straight men audioences - the hole is unfertily fake of digging and the boobs don't squirt milk.\n\nDon't buy this, unless you want to be screwed in mind and wallet.","January 3","false","3.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

The answers you give will influence how your wife will become. Or the ultimate personal hapiness of some of your generals.\ni kinda was reminded of the early sid meiers "pirates!" game  which blended so many different genres so well together. Dragon Commander does the same.\nand if you do not like one of those mentioned elements before, you always have options to ignore those you dont like!\n\nDont like the story part? Then play the mode without story.\n\nDont like researching? Just start a game and give yourself enough tech-points to unlock everything in the beginning.\n\nDont like the RTS part? Then let the battles be fought by the AI. This "autoresolve" works great and very balanced in this game, which is quite unique. I found that the Campaign Map rules seem to work quite similar to the rules of the "Axis and Allies" or "Conquest of Nerath" board games, so you can get much joy out of them if you are a fan of such a thing without touching the RTS part at all.\n\n\nWhat makes this game great:\none reason why the mix is working that perfectly is an intriguing story and some very funny writing for the characters. this funny writing also comes into play for the political choices.\ni really got immersed in the story, and this is also down to the fact with all the possibilities of marriages that you have.\n\nthe replayability of this game is biiiig. normally i dont touch a game again nowadays.... i am too much a veteran for that, and being grown up takes its toll on gaming time and stuff, but after finishing the campaign here, i immediatly started a second one and i cant wait to this time be a bit more "evil", maybe even sacrifice my wife.\n\n\ni had it on my radar since release but now finally bought it and i am glad i did.\ni salute the developers!","May 27, 2014","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It's the most fun being in a position of power and choosing who to support and who not to support and seeing the consequences with the different races having different opinions about you.\n\nAnd all the characters you meet are so well developed and entertaining.

Turnbased strategy map + RTS combo, with lots of political intruiges inbetween the turns. It's the political parts that make the game!\n\nThe core mechanics is that of a turn based strategy game similar to boardgames, and the combat is done RTS style. For people familiar with Total War, this is not something new at all.\n\nThe difference between this game and total war is a few very meaningful things. First of all, you can only personally partake in ONE combat per turn, which REALLY speeds the game up, and doesn't make you as tired of the RTS moments of the game, which often happens in Total War, when you have HUGE armies all over the map and have to do 20 combats per turn. Controlling the combat becomes a strategical advantage, and you need to utilize this for the right combat per turn, and you can't attack as much. It works great as a game mechanic in this type of games. Makes the game LOT less tedious.\n\nSecondly in the combats you take part in, you can turn into a flying dragon that gives you a massive advantage over the enemy. While being a dragon you are in third person and controlling armies become very awkward. It's a decently interesting mechanic, but execution of it is not perfect. It's a bit similar to Sacrifice in this, but not nearly as well polished.\n\nThe RTS combat is the type with base building. You start with the units you get from strategy map, and you make a base and can only build on certain points of the map, and it's important you take control of the map. It works OK, but becomes very macro focused game play. And if you are outnumbered from units you start with on strategical map, the enemy just rushes you over and you lose, and during first 2 minutes you can use the dragon. It's decently balanced in that. The game have a type of resource used to build units, and it's finite, so eventually you will just have the units you have. If you control more nodes than opponent, you will steal resources from him once the shared finite resource is depleted, so the game is focused on map control mainly.\n\nThe downside of the RTS combat is the controls, it's VERY clumsy, and there is just too much to do. It's very similar to Starcraft 1, which was a great game of its time, but that was 20 years ago. There is just so many things you can and want to do, but unless you are really really nimble with your fingers and heavily utilize control-groups you will struggle to control your units. Most units also have spells to cast, and none of them are on auto-cast, and combined with the macro-focused game play, and the game becomes very APM-centric. And to top it off it all get even worse in dragon form where you have more limited control. If anything I wish the game had slightly better UI, easier to control combat, it would be much more enjoyable then.\n\nThis is just the core mechanics of the game, and it's not what makes the game good. That part of the game is just OK, it works somewhat, but is not outstanding or special. What makes this game special is the political intruige between the turns. You as an emperor have to decide on policies for the world, and it's thinly veiled parallells to our world, with common political topics being brought up, like feminism, legalization of weed, religious issues, environmental etc. The different races have different political standings, and overall this is what makes the game great. It's a very smart game, and it will give you pros and cons of all the decisions you make. I've not seen a game like it. It's seriously awesome.\n\nOverall this is a Total War game done right, with heavily spiced up flavouring between the turns. If you like the genre you will LOVE this game.","August 28, 2014","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thats where you'll move your troops and play your cards to try to conquer a region; The RTS section - After you move your troops to attack or if you have to defend, you can choose to play cards and let the battle auto resolve with the help of one of your generals or you can choose to go into battle yourself and that is where you can turn into a dragon to help your units.\n\nUnfortunately the RTS section is a bit messy and stiffy. This section is really fast paced, there is no fog of war, the camera controls are bad, the maps are small and you are quite limited to what you can do. You have to capture predetermined points on the map to start getting recruits and to build factories. There is a limited number of recruit that you can gather and wins the player who manages to maintain a greater number of units built. The dragon is cool, but it is too weak and dies very fast. The RTS section is the one I disliked the most. I found it quite boring and a pain in the ♥♥♥, so I turned the difficult to casual to focus on the section I really liked, the RPG one. Too bad you are still forced play the RTS sections as you can use auto resolve only once per turn. The turn based strategy map and the card sistems are not something out of the ordinary and the strenght is on the RPG sections, with great characters and choices that have real consequences on the theather of war.\n\nI think that with this game the developers tried to fire at too many directions, with a weak third person shooter (as a dragon), a bad RTS, a ok turn based strategy and card systems and a good RPG wraped up with a great sound track and pretty graphics into a average game.

It took about 15 hours to win the game and its a good amount. the politics are fun and are reasonable and not outrages. I am happy about the devs mostly did not use their own views on the politics. the RTS of the game is not the best. you can win every game if the AI waits to fight until you get dragon form. The RTS is simple but fun.\n\nDragon form is OP with the right skills and sometimes really hard to keep up with.\n\nMy biggest problem is when you get far into the game i found  a way to win every fight with auto resolve. that really made the game easy, and i was playing on normal.\n\nAll in all the game is fun and REALLY easy to learn.

The first two Divinity games were D3 clones, then their second game was an over the shoulder action RPG where you were an adventurer/dragon, then this game was a multiplayer/single player RTS game that let you turn your overhead camera into a dragon with a jetpack, THEN they made Original Sin Divinity (or whatever that one is called) and was a co-op tactics game.\n\nThis game, however, succeeded at being fun, so there's that.\n\nIn Dragon Commander, you play as the Emperor, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son of the previous emperor who was just murdered by his four other ♥♥♥♥ children, who are now busy trying to murder each other to be the new emperor. You also happen to be a dragon because your mother was a dragon pretending to be a human because magic.\n\nThe game plays three seperate ways in both game modes: First, you play the Tactics mode, where you look at the countries you control and either create units, buildings, or play strategy cards to improve your chances in victory. Secondly, you can either choose to let your AI generals kill the enemy or deal with it yourself whereupon you're thrown into a rather well made RTS game with the usual unit fights, although victory is assured by either destroying the enemy base or by emptying the resource pool and one team running out of soldiers. Thirdly, while playing the second type, you can turn into a dragon and lay waste to the enemy.\n\nSurprisingly being a dragon and a commander at the same time controls rather well. You can control the army by either mouse control or (in dragon mode) a bunch of hotkeys that let you cycle and control/use units fluidly. The dragon itself is both overpowered and easily killed. You can destroy enemy soldiers without much trouble, but anti air units (which are common and well built) will murder you gleefully if you're not paying attention.\n\nResearch and story are both rather enjoyable. It's almost an M-18 movie with a PG-13 tone, so you get contrasting tones and emotions that give you either a smile or a confused frown. Not much else to say there, really, I mean the story's easily ignorable but there's some fun stuff going on in it regardless.\n\nPersonally I went for the game because it said "You get to be a ♥♥♥♥ing dragon murdering steam tanks with a jetpack." And that is exactly what happens. If nothing else, it's enjoyably honest.","April 30, 2015","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be an emperor and rule your own kingdom. Fight with your armies in the war for the throne as you zoom around the battlefield raining hellish barrages of fireballs at your enemies. Be a tyrant or a generous ruler with your political decisions. And certainly one of the best aspects of the game, marry a pretty princess. Dragon Commander has been much anticipated and it delivers on every single aspect promised. Its not a Total War game so don't expect the battles and RTS elements to be as deep. Combine minimalistic RTS elements, strategic battles, cards which give bonus effects and abilities, dragon combat, and Mass Effect styled RPG elements into a whole and this neat and shiny package is what one would get. Its not exactly the best in each genre that make up the entire game but it has a little something new to offer to each part. Charming dialogue, decent graphics, good combat and RTS overall.

The more you play, the more you see just the amount of sheer love and hard work that went into this wonderful gem of a game that I would call one of my favorite games of the last few years. Dragons are so satisfying to use (although it can trivialize battles a great deal, but then again you are a dragon with a jetpack.) The unit themselves have their own unique flavors and playstyles that make it easy to overlook how few there actually are. Politics are a great way to break up time amongst the Raven, and your side character array is made up of a merry cast that grow on you as you spend time with them and hear their problems.\n\nThere are some cons to all these of course, mainly the way the AI handles campaigns and some policies. This game favors blitzing through battles and campaigns. Failure to do so will often lead to the enemy getting too strong that not even your overpowered Dragon can handle them. Campaign wise, if you stamp out the enemy too quickly, they may fall into a rut of not counter attacking back and accepting their fate.  If you take too long, you may find yourself hopelessly outclassed against an overwhelming array of troops at their forces versus your village militia. Politics, while fun, suffer from a YES or NO system that can cause you to end up with neither choices feeling satisfying, while a more grey area could have been more of a benefit.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 8.5/10 (in normal, non gaming journalism scoring system). This is indeed a great experience that is extremely lovely and rad, but it has small design choices that bring down the experience ever so slightly. That being said, I am now a major fan of Larian and Divinity due to this game and do not regret the 3 purchases I have made towards this game. Dragon Commander is a diamond that deserves a special spot on the shelves where you can look upon it fondly for the true classic it is.","March 29, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The UI doesn't feel over encumbered, without limiting your control over the game. Tutorials are short, sweet and easy to get the hang of. The ability to control your army while offering it assistance as the titler Dragon Commander is a great feature. His Third Person Gameplay doesn't feel tacked on in any way either, it feels like a proper solid element in it's own right.\n\nOn top of that all of that, the management of the factions ambassadors gives even more depth. There is a large amount of varied, interesting characters to meet, greet and discuss with on your command ship. They don't feel forced, and can sometimes be a joy to interact with. I get a lot of pleasure having a large battle, then coming back to sort out a trade agreement or some such with the ambassadors only adds to my enjoyment.\n\nI'd highly recommend this to anyone fond of Management/RTS games. However, if you want to play it mainly for the Dragon, Management or the pure RTS Gameplay, you have to take into account that each is only a part of this game. You will have to do all three; manage your Empire, as well as your army, upgrades and your Dragon form.\n\nThe last thing I will say is; if you want this game I have another suggestion. Buy the boxed version new! I bought it when it first came out, cheaper then any digital download version I saw. The box itself is a very nicely put together thing with a lot of detail, no slap dash cheap boxing. The main thing about it though is the box copy comes with both Steam and GOG versions of the game. The Disk is the steam version, but there is also a Redeem code for a full digital version of the game for GOG.

Turnbased strategy map + RTS combo, with lots of political intruiges inbetween the turns. It's the political parts that make the game!\n\nThe core mechanics is that of a turn based strategy game similar to boardgames, and the combat is done RTS style. For people familiar with Total War, this is not something new at all.\n\nThe difference between this game and total war is a few very meaningful things. First of all, you can only personally partake in ONE combat per turn, which REALLY speeds the game up, and doesn't make you as tired of the RTS moments of the game, which often happens in Total War, when you have HUGE armies all over the map and have to do 20 combats per turn. Controlling the combat becomes a strategical advantage, and you need to utilize this for the right combat per turn, and you can't attack as much. It works great as a game mechanic in this type of games. Makes the game LOT less tedious.\n\nSecondly in the combats you take part in, you can turn into a flying dragon that gives you a massive advantage over the enemy. While being a dragon you are in third person and controlling armies become very awkward. It's a decently interesting mechanic, but execution of it is not perfect. It's a bit similar to Sacrifice in this, but not nearly as well polished.\n\nThe RTS combat is the type with base building. You start with the units you get from strategy map, and you make a base and can only build on certain points of the map, and it's important you take control of the map. It works OK, but becomes very macro focused game play. And if you are outnumbered from units you start with on strategical map, the enemy just rushes you over and you lose, and during first 2 minutes you can use the dragon. It's decently balanced in that. The game have a type of resource used to build units, and it's finite, so eventually you will just have the units you have. If you control more nodes than opponent, you will steal resources from him once the shared finite resource is depleted, so the game is focused on map control mainly.\n\nThe downside of the RTS combat is the controls, it's VERY clumsy, and there is just too much to do. It's very similar to Starcraft 1, which was a great game of its time, but that was 20 years ago. There is just so many things you can and want to do, but unless you are really really nimble with your fingers and heavily utilize control-groups you will struggle to control your units. Most units also have spells to cast, and none of them are on auto-cast, and combined with the macro-focused game play, and the game becomes very APM-centric. And to top it off it all get even worse in dragon form where you have more limited control. If anything I wish the game had slightly better UI, easier to control combat, it would be much more enjoyable then.\n\nThis is just the core mechanics of the game, and it's not what makes the game good. That part of the game is just OK, it works somewhat, but is not outstanding or special. What makes this game special is the political intruige between the turns. You as an emperor have to decide on policies for the world, and it's thinly veiled parallells to our world, with common political topics being brought up, like feminism, legalization of weed, religious issues, environmental etc. The different races have different political standings, and overall this is what makes the game great. It's a very smart game, and it will give you pros and cons of all the decisions you make. I've not seen a game like it. It's seriously awesome.\n\nOverall this is a Total War game done right, with heavily spiced up flavouring between the turns. If you like the genre you will LOVE this game.","August 28, 2014","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunutely, one side is pretty awful.\n\nThe game is divided into the story driven, non combat based and relationship building aspect; and then the RTS combat and risk map like world view.\n\nI have to say, I honestly really like the non combat stuff. The characters are fun, they are a poke at the stereotypes of today whilst offering a little bit of comedic social commentry. The characters are great, the dilemas you get are great and they even have a point to them, as each desicsion you make has consequences for resource aquirement, combat and other things.\n\nWhere it falls flat on its face is the RTS combat. By christ it sucks. Its entire concept is basically built around zerg rushing and turtling your forces. very little stratigic combat involved here. Yeah, being a dragon is kinda a cool twist but it takes away from being an RTS and it turns it into a click fest action game. Tries to do too much, whilst also doing almost nothing. Saddening really. On the plus side, once you get your generals you can shelve off battles to them. Though, you can only use any general once per turn, as in once you use a general on any battle that turn you may use no other generals. Why? I dont understand.\n\nAll in all, I would only recommend it to players who can really get immersed into the non combat stuff.

Being king makes you feel the burden of what you do and have an effect on the world around you as they are effected (equal pay means you lose more money while gaining more motivation, becomming a republic means people like you but face harder challanges.)\n\nI Love this game and had an absoulute ball. thier are many different twists and turns that are involved that I can't not reccomend  even with it's faults. If you like the idea of being a king and a Flying dragon badass...This is for you.\n\nHail To The King Baby!\n","June 13, 2014","true","14.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If there's one thing that Larian studios has shown it's a sort of inconsistency in genre of their games, but not in a bad way; with each follow-up they take advantage of the new wave of technological advancements open to them, and they've done a hell of a good job with this one.  Don't expect a hack and slash RPG like Baldr's Gate or Diablo like the original; this is a Real Time Strategy game...but surprisingly not at its core.\n\nFor the short version, check below, and beware; the long version may have spoilers:\n\nThe story takes place in Rivellon like the other games, though whether it takes place before or after the events of the second games is unknown (at least to me).  You play as the illegitimate son of a murdered Emperor and a female dragon, and have been chosen by the king's greatest advisor to be the savior of the empire; an empire otherwise riddled with your own half-crazed siblings all of whom want a piece of your draconic flesh.  You can't do this alone of course; you have generals there to help guide you, and advisors to help you keep the people happy...at the cost of potentially others under your care.  Fear not though, for you even have a wife whose marriage ties can give you great benefits with her chosen race, though even she has drama; after all, the worries of the common folk are nothing compared to the worries of the royals, and as the son-born-out-of-wedlock of a dead emperor, your worries are pretty big indeed.\n\nThe plus is story and character development; each of them being amazing individuals.  Of course, there is one downside; some of them have drama isssues that you need to take up in order to ensure the safety and well-being of your empire, and the issues, unfortunately, can end in two completely different extremes.  For example, Scarlett is one of your generals; young, springy, and itching to fight, she's well worth having in times of need.  But you get hints that she's a little more than what she seems...and it turns out that she's been hiding a very controversial secret about herself...no spoilers, but you get the idea.  I agreed and disagreed with some of her viewpoints, and feared I could either lose her or risk getting my pants set aflame by some very opinionated advisor nobles for agreeing with her.  In the end though, I found a compromise that I actually liked, and she turned out the better for it.\n\nThen there's Catherine...*facepalm* where do I begin with her?  Well, she's feminist; formerly a queen of her own country which was a very strict Amazonian society, where women rule and men serve only to hold up the society and help make babies.  In short, any extremist Feminist's pipe dream...and dear Lord, I wanted to have the option to boot her off of my ship in mid-air.  The trouble was, I agreed with some of her plights; she had issues going on that were important, and I'm the kind of guy who respects women and am totally for equal treatment...now, that wasn't the problem.  The problem was that whenever she approached me regarding this...she did what any feminist does; acts like it's my fault because I have a pair of...well, let's be polite, because I'm male and because she's female.  Automatically an issue I had no clue about was my fault just because I was a man...Word to the wise, unless it is their fault, never approach a stubborn man and tell them something is.  If it were up to me, with the stuff she pulled, I would have had her court martialed, flogged, and stripped of title and rank and forced to work a scullery maid, and that's if she was LUCKY...geez...\n\nAnyway, that aside, this is a good game.  I can't wait to finish it, it's going really well thus far.  I definitely recommend giving it a go, full price or otherwise, especially since it's graphically beautiful as well as fun.  Getting to play as a dragon in between commanding armies to fight one another is an amazing breath of fresh air, and one of my favorite parts of this game...\n\nSo, short version: pros and cons\n\nPros\n\n+ Great Story/Setting\n+ Great gameplay mechanics\n+ Awesome graphics\n+ Great sounds, soundtrack, and voice acting\n+ Awesome characters\n+ Never a dull moment\n\nCons\n\n- Extreme left or right decisions in politics\n- Puts some modern issues in the extreme a little too up front (e.g. Yorrick's pious religious attitude...we religious folks aren't all like that just so you know)\n- Some of the interactions between yourself and your queen end a little too quickly...got done with the Dwarf queen before I even finished killing off the first enemy faction, two more to go after that.\n\nAll in all, I give this an 8.5/10","September 28, 2014","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Be an emperor and rule your own kingdom. Fight with your armies in the war for the throne as you zoom around the battlefield raining hellish barrages of fireballs at your enemies. Be a tyrant or a generous ruler with your political decisions. And certainly one of the best aspects of the game, marry a pretty princess. Dragon Commander has been much anticipated and it delivers on every single aspect promised. Its not a Total War game so don't expect the battles and RTS elements to be as deep. Combine minimalistic RTS elements, strategic battles, cards which give bonus effects and abilities, dragon combat, and Mass Effect styled RPG elements into a whole and this neat and shiny package is what one would get. Its not exactly the best in each genre that make up the entire game but it has a little something new to offer to each part. Charming dialogue, decent graphics, good combat and RTS overall.

The more you play, the more you see just the amount of sheer love and hard work that went into this wonderful gem of a game that I would call one of my favorite games of the last few years. Dragons are so satisfying to use (although it can trivialize battles a great deal, but then again you are a dragon with a jetpack.) The unit themselves have their own unique flavors and playstyles that make it easy to overlook how few there actually are. Politics are a great way to break up time amongst the Raven, and your side character array is made up of a merry cast that grow on you as you spend time with them and hear their problems.\n\nThere are some cons to all these of course, mainly the way the AI handles campaigns and some policies. This game favors blitzing through battles and campaigns. Failure to do so will often lead to the enemy getting too strong that not even your overpowered Dragon can handle them. Campaign wise, if you stamp out the enemy too quickly, they may fall into a rut of not counter attacking back and accepting their fate.  If you take too long, you may find yourself hopelessly outclassed against an overwhelming array of troops at their forces versus your village militia. Politics, while fun, suffer from a YES or NO system that can cause you to end up with neither choices feeling satisfying, while a more grey area could have been more of a benefit.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 8.5/10 (in normal, non gaming journalism scoring system). This is indeed a great experience that is extremely lovely and rad, but it has small design choices that bring down the experience ever so slightly. That being said, I am now a major fan of Larian and Divinity due to this game and do not regret the 3 purchases I have made towards this game. Dragon Commander is a diamond that deserves a special spot on the shelves where you can look upon it fondly for the true classic it is.","March 29, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is glorious for any fans of strategy.\n\nMy major gripes are with the rather blah main story, you'll get most of your story fix from just interacting with your crew and friends than the "plot" as it were, some moral choices and characters that ARE as stupid and pointless as they seem, a lack of differentiation between the hero and enemy on the field of battle, and generally being a pain to actually get going...it took me three days to make it work on my laptop.\n\nThat being said, once this game gets rolling, it is supremely fun.

Thats where you'll move your troops and play your cards to try to conquer a region; The RTS section - After you move your troops to attack or if you have to defend, you can choose to play cards and let the battle auto resolve with the help of one of your generals or you can choose to go into battle yourself and that is where you can turn into a dragon to help your units.\n\nUnfortunately the RTS section is a bit messy and stiffy. This section is really fast paced, there is no fog of war, the camera controls are bad, the maps are small and you are quite limited to what you can do. You have to capture predetermined points on the map to start getting recruits and to build factories. There is a limited number of recruit that you can gather and wins the player who manages to maintain a greater number of units built. The dragon is cool, but it is too weak and dies very fast.

Too bad you are still forced play the RTS sections as you can use auto resolve only once per turn. The turn based strategy map and the card sistems are not something out of the ordinary and the strenght is on the RPG sections, with great characters and choices that have real consequences on the theather of war.\n\nI think that with this game the developers tried to fire at too many directions, with a weak third person shooter (as a dragon), a bad RTS, a ok turn based strategy and card systems and a good RPG wraped up with a great sound track and pretty graphics into a average game. So, if it is on sale why the ♥♥♥♥ not?","July 23, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How you carry dialogues with your crew - generals, ambassadors, your queen - and what political decisions you make (to set up public healthcare or even... ban violent books and games) changes your relations with 5 races of Rivellon and situation on Risk map. This, along with troops you bring, decide how the situation will handle in RTS battles you gonna take (if you have low popularity with race living in land you invade or defend, you might not get enough conscripts to defeat enemy - opposite situation is possible as well). This include one-use cards you might gather during gameplay and which alter battles in various ways - by giving you new skills, additional troops or buffing/debuffing various types of units.\n\nMain campaign might be short, consider how good you are at such games - but there are always custom ones available.","July 7, 2014","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That would be the question I’d ask, for those inquiring about this game.\nThe nitty gritty of Dragon Commander, is that it’s a videogame implementation of a risk-type strategy boardgame, in a paperback fantasy setting, with solid characters and dialog, and an optional RTS mode. Whew, that sure was a sentence.\n\nWhile the overarching story is something you’d find in a Dragon Lance novel, your generals and councilors will be engaged in CYOA-style stories that develop the land of Rivellon, and your role within it. There’s incredible polish in everything from voice acting, animation, and visual design. As it’s not “Fire Emblem” long, nor “Fire Emblem” hard, I found myself stalling my forces, just so I could engage in more political decisions / view more character moments.\n\nSo, I mentioned an RTS mode, earlier. Outside of deploying units on the map and essentially rolling the dice- risk-style, you can personally lead one battle, per turn, as a dragon. It plays as a fairly difficult RTS. I didn’t have fun with it, but I tend to be quite poor at RTS’s. It’s thankfully completely optional in beating the game, and probably best used as a way to change an unlikely battle’s odds. I kept wishing I could pause and direct orders.\n\nI will say that it’s RTS implementation is pretty novel. It’s kinda like Brutal Legend, in of that you can engage the world directly as a unit, in the midst of managing soldiers. All in all, I would definitely recommend Divinity: Dragon Commander for a long weekend.","June 30, 2014","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds fun, right?\nWell, it is, at times. The political aspect of the game is quite fun. Your advisors present an issue, like gay marriage, environmental protection, yada yada yada, and you decide who of the two advisors to side with. The gameplay benefits of either choice are nice, but never too gamebreaking, so you can basically pick whatever the hell you want, which make the whole aspect quite enjoyable.\nThe whole ruling aspects takes place aboard your demon ship, and that’s where you will meet all of the supporting cast. The characters are quite fun to interact with, and I ended quite fond of them, especially some of the romance choices.\nBut the battle aspect…\nIn every map, you start with a simple Base vs Base scenario, expand to take other bases, start making armies to overwhelm the enemy, the usual. You also can shapeshift into a dragon to fight yourself. While fun, managing both the base and your army in that form is atrocious (I never managed anything more than a simple “Spawn more units and attack move  Here”, but that might just be me), and you quickly learn large enemy armies will instantly shoot you out of the sky. So you end up either sticking to the back of your army, casting buffs, or flying around to harass enemy buildings. Dragon mode perhaps gains depth in Dragon vs Dragon battles, but those are Multiplayer only, and never appear in the campaign.\nThe battle system also gets horribly broken. The amount of units you can produce each map is limited, and that goes both for you and the enemy. This forces you to play smart – or abuse the system, horribly.\nYou see, there is a flying unit called the Zeppelin, which DOUBLEs the range of all units under it. There is also a long range artillery ship, that absolutely demolishes everything it fires at. And, once under a Zeppelin, it also outranges every single unit and tower in the game.\nI have won every harder map by simply producing 5 of those and putting them under a Zeppelin, slowly withering away the PCs unit reserves. It was quite depressing. I did experiment with different strategies, but the army tends to be so annoying to manage, every time I was starting to get low on reserves I always ended up falling back to the unkillable artillery combo. Besides sometimes it was the only way.\nThe reason for that is basically because the creator decided to phone it in at the end. The campaign has a reasonable progression in the first two acts, with obvious enemies of clear motivation (if horribly underdeveloped. Signs of potential boss battles are all around the place, but you never get any). But once you get to act three, the game reuses all the old maps and the enemies get a ridiculous buff, which I think was the developers idea of difficulty spike.\n\nAll in all, the political aspect was so fun I actually played the campaign twice, but the battle system is so atrocious I cannot recommend this game unless on massive sale, and even then, it’s not the best of picks.","September 5, 2015","false","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes some of Risk, some Starcraft 2, some Mass Effect and adds a jetpack wearing dragon to the mix to make a memorable gem that balances out serious and comedic moments as you go from blasting enemies on the battlefield to discussing whether or to legalize a certain plant for medical purposes, this and many other political issues in the game are downright parodies of the issues in present day politics, almost making the game an unintentional period piece of our current day and age. The RTS portion can be a little lackluster, but the ability to jump in in the form of a jetpack wearing dragon to fight alongside our forces to tip the scales makes it cooler, and for those who dont want to deal with that and enjoy the admittedly more fun empire running segments it can be auto resolved in a manner similar to the Total War series, with your chances of victory being boosted by paying your general and your various cards.\n\nAt the end of the day it is a jack of all trades, master of none but the gestalt ends up being greater than the sum of the parts making th experience memorable and makes you want to play the campaign again and again to see how differently things can go and to interact with the very amusing characters in the empire running segments. For strategy fans its worth a buy, for those new to the genre it would be a good gateway to some of the bigger franchises.","April 15, 2014","true","22.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prokog/recommended/243950/","prokog","Confederate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prokog/","78 products in account","A gift from a friend, this game is a bit of an odd-ball mix of Real-Time Strategy and Turn-Base Strategy. Divinity: Dragon Commander is the story of a fallen kingdom where the children murdered the king to fight for the throne (think of Brutus knifing Caeser during the days of the Roman Empire and you'll get the idea) and you, as one good child who didn't take part in the murder, must now take up arms against your siblings and claim the throne for yourself from their tyrannical grasp. Interesting catch is that you're half-dragon; cue the blood and flames.\n\nThe game is played out in 3 stages of interaction: political with your generals and the people's council representatives; the world map where like Risk and Civilization you move your armies around and secure territory to gain the advantage; and in a RTS during each battle you choose to directly manage yourself on a country's map, where you recruit your forces, build bases and even involve yourself as a dragon (in third-person view) in the battle blasting away at your enemies or healing your forces.\n\nOf these 3 stages of gameplay, the RTS is the weakest (it's no Dawn of War, which is the closest RTS to match its style) where it basically falls down to pure numbers overwhelming the enemy control points. But this stage of gameplay can also be the most exciting when you get yourself involved on the battlefield as the dragon, since you can still build forces and command your troops while in this third-person perspective: being the dragon can literally turn the battle when you've only got the slimmest chance of winning the day. The catch is that you can only command one battle yourself per action turn of the second stage of gameplay: where you are you're committed and your generals have to cover another location (again, where they are committed too for that turn), while your army commanders sort themselves out for everywhere else. This second stage of gameplay on the world map is where most of the game takes place, so you have to watch your forces and resource management keenly, playing "political advantage" game cards when possible that you earn from special buildings you can place in your territory. But just as you can do this, so can your CPU enemies back to you so you have to be ready for that too.\n\nThe final stage of gamplay deserves a seperate mention as the political game with your generals and the people's council on board your command ship can have the most influence on your success (or lack of it). Treat your generals right and they will gain abilities to match your desired morals that you lead by; treat them poorly and they many mutiny. Likewise handle the people's council with care as their support determines how the people of their nations that you claim as territory will treat you as the game goes on: treat them poorly and they'll rise up against you to help your enemies through sabotage, guerrilla warfare and even subversion of your other territories with the rival races. Through this stage of the gameplay a role-playing element exists where you can enter into a political marriage with princesses of four of the five races to improve with your relations with them, but they have their own political needs too that must be managed. Finally this stage of gameplay also covers upgrades that you can give to your military and to your dragon powers to aid you on the other gameplay stages.\n\nSpecial mention must be given to the voice acting and music: for a small development team, it is excellent and the voice acting really sells the game for the interactions with your generals and the people's council.\n\nThis is one of the longest game reviews I've done because this is one of the varied games I've yet played that has been released on Steam. My recommendation requires this as it'll either be a game you love or hate: strategy fans will really enjoy this game, role-playing fans may be interested in a new experience that is also a "soft" lead into RTS games, while everyone else may find it a tad dull. Check it out if you're curious, but I've certainly being enjoying it.","August 18, 2013","true","26.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool190/recommended/243950/","joecool190","Joecool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/joecool190/","747 products in account","This game is quite fun and the gameplay is solid; my only complaint is that while incorporating many game styles (RTS, turn based conquest, and choose your own adventure dialog) it feels slightly shallow. The RTS aspect of the game is very fun, and the ability of turning into a dragon to lead your armies gives the battles a lot of playablity allowing you to switch constantly between a traditional RTS style or more or of a MOBA style. The RTS mechanics of the game are pretty simple however compared to something like Starcraft with battle being over control nodes for bases, and around 15 units which both the player and AI use; so I don't expect this is a game you could pour hundreds of hours into the multiplier before getting bored. The turn based part of the game plays very much like a game of risk where conquest can be won though a RTS battle, so again it's simple but still effective. Everything else in the game plays out in dialog on your battleship with your generals, advisers and a princess  and they all have great personalities (you either love them or hate, but you care) so it keeps the dialog interesting and offers a lot of choices to keep multiple play through fresh. I enjoyed the game quite a bit, and while it has some shortcomings I would definitely recommend trying this game out, it is better then the sum of all it's parts.","November 28, 2013","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrXLink/recommended/243950/","MrXLink","*-Dragon-* MrXLink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrXLink/","160 products in account","Remember Age of Mythology? Yeah, it's been that long since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like Grand Strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a DRAGON, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time.\n\nHonestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode. This can work out really well, but the power in Dragon Commander's RTS mode lies not in its complexity. More like its simplicity.\n\nIn total, there are but 13 units that can be created, balancing each other out quite reasonably, and each having the possibility of being upgraded thrice. One main resource, a population cap, building sites and some natural obstacles. Although this may sound quite basic (which it is), the actual gameplay proves to be very interesting and many different strategies apply. Plus, the Dragon is a massive gamechanger. Dragon mode can either save your life or ruin it because of improper microing while being one. 3 Dragons with their own abilities fight for the additional variety.\n\nNot only does the simply epic Dragon mode, a USP that's been praised to the heavens, contribute to the most valuable aspects of the game; the strategy mode (which is basically RISK combined with cards and special abilities) and especially the single player campaign also make this game as epic as it is.\n\nIn single player, not only do you have to fight your enemies in strategy mode as well as RTS mode, but the entire storyline around Dragon Commander demands that you will take on the right to make important political, moral and economical decisions that have direct impact on gameplay factors such as research, currency, abilities, luck, popularity etc. There are always races disagreeing with you. After all, being the emperor of a world housing undead, elves, imps, dwarves and lizards is bound to cause conflicts that will always have adverse and beneficial effects at the same time. Now it is up to you to keep the balance right. Give it a try, it's not as easy as you may think.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say that Dragon Commander is a surprisingly effective game regarding gameplay and mechanics, sadly quite underpopulated on multiplayer ends. Narrative-wise, the game is very immersive and allows for quite the suspension of disbelief. The characters in singleplayer (like our ultimate posh friend general Edmund) as well as the models and environment in the entire game look astonishing for its genre. Not that much lag issues in multiplayer, and if there are people online it's quite fun to challenge each other. With a blend of RTS and TBS/Grand Strategy, and the addition of your personal touch of Dragon, invoking challenging and innovative strategy gameplay, I'd most definitely say it is worth acquiring this game. It is expensive, I give you that, but it's most certainly not a disappointment. In fact, it's quite the gem.","November 21, 2013","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although never quite reaching the heights it aspires to, this is nevertheless a very entertaining title that manages to create a world in which you can argue about gay marriage with skeletons before transforming into a jetpack-wearing dragon, and somehow not make it feel as ridiculous as it sounds.","November 29, 2013","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're a half-dragon, seeking to retake your dead father's kingdom from your siblings from a floating ship known as "The Raven." On board your ship, you'll meet with councilors from each of the five races in the game besides humans (dwarves, elves, lizards, imps, undead) to make political decisions to run your exapnding empire. You'll also be tasked with moving your armies around on a Risk-style map, playing cards earned through gameplay to help your forces and hinder your enemy's. Finally, when armies meet on the map, you'll have to command your forces in battle in simplified RTS combat, with the gimmick of being able to transform into a dragon to turn the tide of battle in your favor.\n\nThe best part of the game is making political decisions to run your empire, and the consequences those decisions entail. Will you implement national healthcare? Deport foreign criminals simply because they're foreign? These are typically not easy decisions to make, as they all have pros and cons. It does get a bit limited--you can only make "yes" or "no" answers to everything. But it's still a very interesing commentary on modern politics. If you're unable to compromise your own views, for example, to keep the other races satisfied, it'll be more difficult for you to raise forces in regions dominated by that race.\n\nThe RISK style map is basically what you expect. You maneuover your armies around, taking territories and attempting to outsmart the AI- which, so far for me, hasn't been terribly difficult. You can build one building in each territory, from a selection of around 7 or 8. These range from war factories to recruit units with to Wizard Towers that generate cards to give you an advantage in battle.\n\nWhen you confront another army on the map, you can choose to lead your forces into battle, or one of your generals. The RTS-combat is very simple-- there are only around 4 buildings you can build, and one type of resource- recuits. Your main goal is to capture a Recruit plot outside your starting base. If you do this, you'll quickly be able to outproduce your enemy and it won't be long before you overwhelm them. At first, these battles are fun, but they grow repetitive, and you'll find yourself wishing you could skip them entirely. You can, of course, if you elect to have your generals fight for you, Total War- autoresolve style. Unfortunately, this can lead to lost battles that you would otherwise win.\n\nThe RTS-part's main gimmick- transforming into a dragon-- is fun at first, and creates an interesting mechanic in RTS battles. You can't quene up units while in dragon form, so if you stay transformed too long, you may find yourself out of allied troops to fight with and the battle may turn against you. At the same time, the dragon is powerful and can turn a losing battle into a winning one. Most times, though, the nature of the RTS battles renders the dragon a utility unit. To win, you'll need to outproduce your enemy, and if you're doing that, the battle will quickly snowball in your favor anyways.\n\nDivinity: Dragon Commander is a fantastic game. The RTS portion is unfortunately a little weak and gets in the way of the game's more fun empire managing and political decision making, but I would still highly recommend it to strategy enthusiasts.","December 21, 2013","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's at least 5 different genres smashed into one game, and somehow comes out the other side better for it.\n\nThe bulk of the game plays like Risk, but where you can choose to manually resolve battles in a Dawn of War style RTS.  They also tie in the original RPG series by allowing you to spawn yourself as a dragon on the battlefield during the RTS segments, which can be very effective if done at the right times.  Also, your dragon has a jetpack now.  On top of that, you get empire management between rounds, where you have to make choices to keep your generals and the ambassadors of the 5 races of the world happy and supporting you.  And choosing how to spend your research points to upgrade units and/or your dragon form.\n\nIn the end, I picked up the game because I liked previous Divinity games and I was intrigued, but I ended up with a surprisingly good hybrid that has almost nothing to do with the series it's based on except for the setting.","December 25, 2013","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thats where you'll move your troops and play your cards to try to conquer a region; The RTS section - After you move your troops to attack or if you have to defend, you can choose to play cards and let the battle auto resolve with the help of one of your generals or you can choose to go into battle yourself and that is where you can turn into a dragon to help your units.\n\nUnfortunately the RTS section is a bit messy and stiffy. This section is really fast paced, there is no fog of war, the camera controls are bad, the maps are small and you are quite limited to what you can do. You have to capture predetermined points on the map to start getting recruits and to build factories. There is a limited number of recruit that you can gather and wins the player who manages to maintain a greater number of units built. The dragon is cool, but it is too weak and dies very fast. The RTS section is the one I disliked the most. I found it quite boring and a pain in the ♥♥♥, so I turned the difficult to casual to focus on the section I really liked, the RPG one. Too bad you are still forced play the RTS sections as you can use auto resolve only once per turn. The turn based strategy map and the card sistems are not something out of the ordinary and the strenght is on the RPG sections, with great characters and choices that have real consequences on the theather of war.\n\nI think that with this game the developers tried to fire at too many directions, with a weak third person shooter (as a dragon), a bad RTS, a ok turn based strategy and card systems and a good RPG wraped up with a great sound track and pretty graphics into a average game. So, if it is on sale why the ♥♥♥♥ not?","July 23, 2014","true","22.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunutely, one side is pretty awful.\n\nThe game is divided into the story driven, non combat based and relationship building aspect; and then the RTS combat and risk map like world view.\n\nI have to say, I honestly really like the non combat stuff. The characters are fun, they are a poke at the stereotypes of today whilst offering a little bit of comedic social commentry. The characters are great, the dilemas you get are great and they even have a point to them, as each desicsion you make has consequences for resource aquirement, combat and other things.\n\nWhere it falls flat on its face is the RTS combat. By christ it sucks. Its entire concept is basically built around zerg rushing and turtling your forces. very little stratigic combat involved here. Yeah, being a dragon is kinda a cool twist but it takes away from being an RTS and it turns it into a click fest action game. Tries to do too much, whilst also doing almost nothing. Saddening really. On the plus side, once you get your generals you can shelve off battles to them. Though, you can only use any general once per turn, as in once you use a general on any battle that turn you may use no other generals. Why? I dont understand.\n\nAll in all, I would only recommend it to players who can really get immersed into the non combat stuff. If you are looking for an incredible RTS experience, you will not find it here. However, personally I think the non combat aspects outway the combat.","June 11, 2014","true","33.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game starts strong with teaching you the very basics of the game in a controlled, easy enviroment, before tossing you over the rails into a sea of the craziest happenings. The major aspect of the game is played in a style akin to Risk, with large pools of troops being moved around a world map to capture zones and ultimately the goal of taking control over the whole globe. When two armies clash in a single zone, that's when you get to actually play the RTS aspect. Warning though, the type of RTS that comes with D:DC is displaced by the fact you control yourself as a DRAGON. Yep, you heard me.\n\nWhile the above goes on, you get to deal with a council of representives of the multiple races in the Divinity world. You'll get polled for all sorts of controversial topics, with its open arguments from the liberal and conservative side of your table. Throw in a political marrige with a wife having her own problems, a wizard who's screwing around inside a demon's mind, and a rather cheery goblin who loves to create weapons of mass distruction for you leaves this game as one that doesn't take itself to seriously. And if doesn't take itself too seriously, why should you? Just keep back, play the game, and enjoy the laughs.","June 21, 2014","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For strategy games thats what Divinty: Dragon Commander is. It's quite ambitious in how it brings together concepts that you've probably seen in other games, separately. It takes some of Risk, some Starcraft 2, some Mass Effect and adds a jetpack wearing dragon to the mix to make a memorable gem that balances out serious and comedic moments as you go from blasting enemies on the battlefield to discussing whether or to legalize a certain plant for medical purposes, this and many other political issues in the game are downright parodies of the issues in present day politics, almost making the game an unintentional period piece of our current day and age. The RTS portion can be a little lackluster, but the ability to jump in in the form of a jetpack wearing dragon to fight alongside our forces to tip the scales makes it cooler, and for those who dont want to deal with that and enjoy the admittedly more fun empire running segments it can be auto resolved in a manner similar to the Total War series, with your chances of victory being boosted by paying your general and your various cards.\n\nAt the end of the day it is a jack of all trades, master of none but the gestalt ends up being greater than the sum of the parts making th experience memorable and makes you want to play the campaign again and again to see how differently things can go and to interact with the very amusing characters in the empire running segments.

Be a tyrant or a generous ruler with your political decisions. And certainly one of the best aspects of the game, marry a pretty princess. Dragon Commander has been much anticipated and it delivers on every single aspect promised. Its not a Total War game so don't expect the battles and RTS elements to be as deep. Combine minimalistic RTS elements, strategic battles, cards which give bonus effects and abilities, dragon combat, and Mass Effect styled RPG elements into a whole and this neat and shiny package is what one would get. Its not exactly the best in each genre that make up the entire game but it has a little something new to offer to each part. Charming dialogue, decent graphics, good combat and RTS overall.

The more you play, the more you see just the amount of sheer love and hard work that went into this wonderful gem of a game that I would call one of my favorite games of the last few years. Dragons are so satisfying to use (although it can trivialize battles a great deal, but then again you are a dragon with a jetpack.) The unit themselves have their own unique flavors and playstyles that make it easy to overlook how few there actually are. Politics are a great way to break up time amongst the Raven, and your side character array is made up of a merry cast that grow on you as you spend time with them and hear their problems.\n\nThere are some cons to all these of course, mainly the way the AI handles campaigns and some policies. This game favors blitzing through battles and campaigns. Failure to do so will often lead to the enemy getting too strong that not even your overpowered Dragon can handle them. Campaign wise, if you stamp out the enemy too quickly, they may fall into a rut of not counter attacking back and accepting their fate.  If you take too long, you may find yourself hopelessly outclassed against an overwhelming array of troops at their forces versus your village militia. Politics, while fun, suffer from a YES or NO system that can cause you to end up with neither choices feeling satisfying, while a more grey area could have been more of a benefit.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 8.5/10 (in normal, non gaming journalism scoring system). This is indeed a great experience that is extremely lovely and rad, but it has small design choices that bring down the experience ever so slightly. That being said, I am now a major fan of Larian and Divinity due to this game and do not regret the 3 purchases I have made towards this game. Dragon Commander is a diamond that deserves a special spot on the shelves where you can look upon it fondly for the true classic it is.","March 29, 2015","true","34.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the most fun being in a position of power and choosing who to support and who not to support and seeing the consequences with the different races having different opinions about you.\n\nAnd all the characters you meet are so well developed and entertaining.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrXLink/recommended/243950/","MrXLink","*-Dragon-* MrXLink","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrXLink/","160 products in account","Remember Age of Mythology? Yeah, it's been that long since there's been an RTS game of such quality. Divinity: Dragon Commander reaches awfully close to these borders of my personal most favourite RTS game. Combine this with a huge Risk-like Grand Strategy mode and there, it hit the spot. I am not (read: try not to be) overly biased due to the fact that this game allows you to turn into a DRAGON, aiding your troops by supporting, attacking and even commanding unit production, direction and spawning at the very same time.\n\nHonestly, I do like the complicated RTS games nowadays. Think of Civ V and so on. However, such games attempt to cram complex mechanics, charts and resources all into one complicated game mode. This can work out really well, but the power in Dragon Commander's RTS mode lies not in its complexity. More like its simplicity.\n\nIn total, there are but 13 units that can be created, balancing each other out quite reasonably, and each having the possibility of being upgraded thrice. One main resource, a population cap, building sites and some natural obstacles. Although this may sound quite basic (which it is), the actual gameplay proves to be very interesting and many different strategies apply. Plus, the Dragon is a massive gamechanger. Dragon mode can either save your life or ruin it because of improper microing while being one. 3 Dragons with their own abilities fight for the additional variety.\n\nNot only does the simply epic Dragon mode, a USP that's been praised to the heavens, contribute to the most valuable aspects of the game; the strategy mode (which is basically RISK combined with cards and special abilities) and especially the single player campaign also make this game as epic as it is.\n\nIn single player, not only do you have to fight your enemies in strategy mode as well as RTS mode, but the entire storyline around Dragon Commander demands that you will take on the right to make important political, moral and economical decisions that have direct impact on gameplay factors such as research, currency, abilities, luck, popularity etc. There are always races disagreeing with you. After all, being the emperor of a world housing undead, elves, imps, dwarves and lizards is bound to cause conflicts that will always have adverse and beneficial effects at the same time. Now it is up to you to keep the balance right. Give it a try, it's not as easy as you may think.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say that Dragon Commander is a surprisingly effective game regarding gameplay and mechanics, sadly quite underpopulated on multiplayer ends. Narrative-wise, the game is very immersive and allows for quite the suspension of disbelief. The characters in singleplayer (like our ultimate posh friend general Edmund) as well as the models and environment in the entire game look astonishing for its genre. Not that much lag issues in multiplayer, and if there are people online it's quite fun to challenge each other. With a blend of RTS and TBS/Grand Strategy, and the addition of your personal touch of Dragon, invoking challenging and innovative strategy gameplay, I'd most definitely say it is worth acquiring this game. It is expensive, I give you that, but it's most certainly not a disappointment. In fact, it's quite the gem.","November 21, 2013","true","31.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/recommended/243950/","DoctorTeo","Doctor Teo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DoctorTeo/","613 products in account","Divinity: Dragon Commander is an RTS/RPG hybrid game developed by Larian studios, the fellows who created Divine Divinity and Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga before going on to create the well received Divinity: Original Sin.\n\nAt heart, Dragon Commander is an RTS game - you gather resources, make buildings, build units, and go roll over your enemy's stuff.\n\nThe game may appear simple, but Larian studios decided to add a lot of risky mechanics to spice up their game. This RTS throws in a twist, one loyal to the game's name: playing as the Dragon Commander, you have the ability to drop onto the battle field personally, flying around the battle field in third person and raining down fire on your opponents. This is possibly one of the only RTS games where you have the ability to summon a super unit you control so directly.\n\nThe execution of the Dragon Commander mechanic is mixed. It's an unfathomably cool idea, and having access to the dragon makes for a very fun 'super' button to push. On the other hand, actually commanding your army is more difficult in this stage - making army selections can't be done with the mouse anymore and casting unit spells becomes a bit of a headache, never mind selecting buildings and creating units out of them. Another side effect is, since the Dragon is partially controlled by the WASD keys, units will not have spells or fuctions bound to those 4 keys, making it less comfortable for those RTS players who like playing with a 'grid' setup (where abilities are hotkeyed according to where they are on the menu).\n\nAs a pure RTS, the game is weak. The maps do not have wide varieties of objectives, the units are awkward to control, and the mini-map doesn't do much to help navigate. All units supposedly have strengths over others, but there are some which are clearly universaly better than others. One bonus though: free camera control, including the ability to zoom, turn, and even look upwards, a rarity in RTS games!\n\nHowever, despite the RTS portion of the game being weak, there is an added element which adds depth when playing the story mode: the RPG/political side of the game. Earning favor with races means that any time you hold an RTS battle in a country primarily populated with that race you will have a higher maximum army count, as well as more production from that country when you win. It is very possible that if you fail to ever compromise with a race's demands you will enter fights with a max army size a fraction of your opponent's, upon which your only hope of winning the fight is to rush them. The fact that the roleplay element of the game affects the gameplay element is a very tasteful touch which helps put importance to the political debacles presented.\n\nSure, the politics side of the game is not executed in the best way possible and some of the decisions you are presented are obviously better than others, but it's still interesting. You are often presented with decisions such as whether you want to install a public healthcare system, tax the church system, add regulations to limit freedom of the press, etc. Most of the decisions are very tongue-in-cheek versions of current real life issues, and the choices made affect resources and gameplay. Interestingly enough, most of the more 'good' choices end up making the game harder, so compromising with the councillors you do not like is sometimes a necessity in order to have reasonable approval ratings in regions where fights are likely to occur. There are dozens upon dozens of choices to make, decisions branch out into relevant new choices, the characters have a wide variety of personalities, the voice acting is believable, and there is an enormous amount of dialogue that will simply not be seen in a single playthrough. This is all completely optional: everything can be skipped, clicked through, or ignored to get back to the RTS portion, though I wish more games had these kinds of options.\n\nAll in all, the game is a bit of a power fantasy - except unlike games which turn you into a super-powered being who can screw the lives of evey person in sight (GTA, AC, TES, etc), you get the added perk of being able to screw with the lives of every person out of sight too, and they can't do a thing about it because you're the Dragon Commander/Emperor with incendiary respiration. However, despite having so many glitches and design flaws, and despite the game's concept precluding it from being taken seriously by RTS enthusiasts, at the end of the day the game is just fun. It does a lot of things that no other game of its kind has tried, and though it has not done it in the best way possible, it's the kind of game that makes one hope for a more polished and refined second attempt. As a serious game it has failed, but as a fun romp it has succeeded.\n\nI mean come on, Dragon on the battle field. For all the game's flaws, it's hard to say no to that.","November 2, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sounds fun, right?\nWell, it is, at times. The political aspect of the game is quite fun. Your advisors present an issue, like gay marriage, environmental protection, yada yada yada, and you decide who of the two advisors to side with. The gameplay benefits of either choice are nice, but never too gamebreaking, so you can basically pick whatever the hell you want, which make the whole aspect quite enjoyable.\nThe whole ruling aspects takes place aboard your demon ship, and that’s where you will meet all of the supporting cast. The characters are quite fun to interact with, and I ended quite fond of them, especially some of the romance choices.\nBut the battle aspect…\nIn every map, you start with a simple Base vs Base scenario, expand to take other bases, start making armies to overwhelm the enemy, the usual. You also can shapeshift into a dragon to fight yourself. While fun, managing both the base and your army in that form is atrocious (I never managed anything more than a simple “Spawn more units and attack move  Here”, but that might just be me), and you quickly learn large enemy armies will instantly shoot you out of the sky. So you end up either sticking to the back of your army, casting buffs, or flying around to harass enemy buildings. Dragon mode perhaps gains depth in Dragon vs Dragon battles, but those are Multiplayer only, and never appear in the campaign.\nThe battle system also gets horribly broken. The amount of units you can produce each map is limited, and that goes both for you and the enemy. This forces you to play smart – or abuse the system, horribly.\nYou see, there is a flying unit called the Zeppelin, which DOUBLEs the range of all units under it. There is also a long range artillery ship, that absolutely demolishes everything it fires at. And, once under a Zeppelin, it also outranges every single unit and tower in the game.\nI have won every harder map by simply producing 5 of those and putting them under a Zeppelin, slowly withering away the PCs unit reserves. It was quite depressing. I did experiment with different strategies, but the army tends to be so annoying to manage, every time I was starting to get low on reserves I always ended up falling back to the unkillable artillery combo. Besides sometimes it was the only way.\nThe reason for that is basically because the creator decided to phone it in at the end. The campaign has a reasonable progression in the first two acts, with obvious enemies of clear motivation (if horribly underdeveloped. Signs of potential boss battles are all around the place, but you never get any). But once you get to act three, the game reuses all the old maps and the enemies get a ridiculous buff, which I think was the developers idea of difficulty spike.\n\nAll in all, the political aspect was so fun I actually played the campaign twice, but the battle system is so atrocious I cannot recommend this game unless on massive sale, and even then, it’s not the best of picks.","September 5, 2015","false","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When your units end their turn in the same region as enemy troops, the game switches to a real-time mode where you fly around shooting fireballs while little soldiers run around on the field below you. But for some reason, now you can also build troops and buildings! But instead of using gold, you have a different resource called 'recruits' which you build up by capturing buildings called 'Recruitment Centers'. And it seems like the amount of troops you build during the engagement is much larger than the amounts you started with by pushing pieces around on the board. And now I have to keep popping out of the dragon to create new units and order them to do something useful. Extremely stressful and not interesting. These guys should have kept unit creation only in the turn-based game (so that the units you start a fight with are all you get) and let the player have fun with maybe an extremely simple set of commands to give orders in combat.\n\nTL;DR: Blowing things up as a dragon is fun.

Your ship, for example, is played as sort of an RPG. You talk with people, level up stuff, purchase new tech and units. Then, there is a part of the game (Planning stage), that is played similar to "Risk". You have your global map and you move your units from one sector to another. Defend your territory, advance into enemy territory, etc. Once you finish your turn and the battle begins, the game is played like a classic RTS. You capture zones, build constructions like barracks, turrets, etc. You get units and press onward to crush your enemy. But the interesting thing is that you can switch into your dragon form and take control over the battlefield directly, switching the game mode into sort of an action game. So... I guess this game have a little bit of everything? Oh...\n\nAlmost forgot: There are also politics, influence, cards you can play to add a certain effect for something and tons and tons of stuff the devs put into this game. It's pretty detailed, it runs smoothly, I did not seen any bugs at all and it is fun to play.

Research adds a bit of differential between factions, but that's it.\n\nOtherwise there's a nice political subgame with options for making broad imperial decisions the ramifications of which have an effect on gameplay, and intereactions with a characterized crew/cabinet.\n\nMuch of the game can be played simply auto-resolving battles and your generals come in handy for just that (though their wages are insane). Each turn you can take control of a RTS battle and take to the skies as your dragon. Various upgrades for your dragon can make it a game changing leader, a strike bomber, a support healer, or a mix therein.\n\nThis game is slick, it's pretty, it's the best execution of this kind of gimmick since Sacrifice.\n\nMultiplayer will add a great deal to its replayability if you can get some friends to play with.\n\nYou're likely to get 15 odd very pleasant hours out of this game and then if you're like me you're likely to come back to it to see other princesses etc. (P.S. No gendering options are present. You are male and you are afforded chattel princesses.)\n\nAlso the music is just great, if a smidge repetetive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/K2-XT/recommended/243950/","K2-XT","K2-XT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/K2-XT/","227 products in account","Divinity: Dragon Commander is a great game. I absolutley loved each moment I had with the game. Even when I was being beaten back harshly by the AI on my attempt to start the game on the hardest difficulty, it brought a smile to my face to know that a game is attempting to be challenging nowadays. Thus, please note: This game is hard at the beginning. You start off with two territories, a few armies, and face an enemy that has much more resouces and territory than you do. All the while, you have to juggle the political field with counselors that present problems, choose a wife, and manage your generals. There's also a neat bit where you have to balance gaining resources with losing most of your population. There are three main aspects to the game: Risk, RTS, and Diplomacy.\n\nRisk\nThis game does a fantastic turn-based war map, on par with the old-fashioned Risk board game. It's literally presented as a board game, as you move unit pieces around a map on the bridge of your ship. Everything seems balanced here, as different units constitute different percentages of winning. Assigning generals to the battle will help the battle's odds, but the true varying factor is, indeed, you.\n\nRTS\nYes, you can personally oversee each battle on your own. In the battle, you switch back and forth from commanding your armies to turning into a dragon and fighting them yourself. A timer begins each map (which is rather annoying), in which you must build up the largest force possible to counter the enemy until you can intervene and help your troops on the ground. The RTS feels SOOOO much like Starcraft 2, and fans will probably like it as much as I did. I did not feel that the dragon controls were awkard, and easily commanded my armies as a dragon. Of course, once the battle is done, you must return to the ships, where you are expected to be a diplomat.\n\nDiplomacy\nAfter each battle, matters arise on your ship. Whether one of your generals is fighting for feminism, gay rights, or censorship, you must attend and solve the situation. After that, counselors from Elves, Imps, Undead, Dwarves, and Lizards will constantly fight over issues such as weapon restrictions, violent media, and religious worship. After that, YOU GET TO CHOOSE A WIFE. EACH ONE IS INTERESTING! JUST DON'T CHOOSE THE LIZARD WIFE! Each wife brings forth unique quests and storylines, which further enhance the depth of the universe. One battles with family matters, another with the traditions of her people, and another experiments with ethics and medicine. It's all very interesting and a joy.\n\nConclusion\nDivinity: Dragon Commander is a great game that has fantastic RTS, Diplomacy, and War-Map gameplay. The only complaint that I have about it is how unequal the counselors are. Every choice seems to be everyone vs. the undead and dwarves. Therefore, if you are conservitave, this game will villify you on 3/5 races. This game actually seems like a great advertisment for liberal beliefs. However, I still loved it, and didn't take it too seriously.\n\n9/10","November 6, 2015","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unless you don't like fun. You do like fun, don't you?\n\nThe game itself is an odd blend of politics, Risk, and a classic RTS game. You play each turn by first exploring your ship, settling political issues that crop up, upgrading your units and/or dragon, as well as talking with your queen when she has the time. The characters you have to interact with are all quite unique and interesting. While they're not exactly complex beings (most of them have a few core personality traits they stick to relentlessly), your own choices in the politics and personal situations you are called to decide upon can have a marked effect on their personality by the end of the game. (I'm looking at you Edmund!!)\n\nThe next parts of a turn is where Risk comes into play. You build units and move them between the various territories inked out on, quite frankly, lovely maps. There's not a ton to say about this portion of the game. It's very fluid and the game makes sure you don't spend a ton of time here. A few of my peeves actually come from this section of the game. The camera jerks you around between areas when showing your opponent's moves and zooms in inapproriately, keeping you from seeing everything that is happening. Thankfully, you'll have plenty of time to review the board on your next turn, but it's still jarring.\n\nFinally, you get to the RTS section of a turn. This can be a ton of fun as this is where you'll have the chance to direct the units you brought into the map, build even more units using a pool of resources everyone must fight over, and most importantly of all, turn into a freaking dragon. Unless it's before the first few minutes have elapsed, or you don't have a certain amount of resources. Okay, so the dragon aspect of the game that gets pushed so hard isn't invulnerable or all-mighty, but honestly I liked that. You have to work with both troops and your dragon, especially as the difficulty cranks up.\n\nEverything meshes together to become a lot of fun to play with an excellent replay value to boot. Even the single player campaign can be replayed several times before you see everything. Those political and personal matters that I mentioned you having to deal with are randomized. Even making difference choices on the same decisions can dramatically change your tactics.\n\nOkay, TLDR bullet point time.\n\nOverall score: 8/10\nPros:\n- Awesome political system that directly imacts your overall strategy.\n- Colorful and fun characters to interact with.\n- Game AI unafraid to teach you a lesson if you get arrogant.\n- Enough variety of units to allow you to decide your own tactics.\n- Completely replayable, even the single player campaign.\n- Hot keys allow you to continue controlling and building your army even in Dragon Mode.\n- Simply inspired Voice Acting for each and every character.\n\nCons:\n- Naval units as a whole are a bit of an afterthought.\n- You can certainly feel that a few features were cut from the game. (Looking at you Imp Princess and Orc Race!)\n- Surprisingly short single player campaign.","December 23, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your advisors present an issue, like gay marriage, environmental protection, yada yada yada, and you decide who of the two advisors to side with. The gameplay benefits of either choice are nice, but never too gamebreaking, so you can basically pick whatever the hell you want, which make the whole aspect quite enjoyable.\nThe whole ruling aspects takes place aboard your demon ship, and that’s where you will meet all of the supporting cast. The characters are quite fun to interact with, and I ended quite fond of them, especially some of the romance choices.\nBut the battle aspect…\nIn every map, you start with a simple Base vs Base scenario, expand to take other bases, start making armies to overwhelm the enemy, the usual. You also can shapeshift into a dragon to fight yourself. While fun, managing both the base and your army in that form is atrocious (I never managed anything more than a simple “Spawn more units and attack move  Here”, but that might just be me), and you quickly learn large enemy armies will instantly shoot you out of the sky. So you end up either sticking to the back of your army, casting buffs, or flying around to harass enemy buildings. Dragon mode perhaps gains depth in Dragon vs Dragon battles, but those are Multiplayer only, and never appear in the campaign.\nThe battle system also gets horribly broken. The amount of units you can produce each map is limited, and that goes both for you and the enemy. This forces you to play smart – or abuse the system, horribly.\nYou see, there is a flying unit called the Zeppelin, which DOUBLEs the range of all units under it. There is also a long range artillery ship, that absolutely demolishes everything it fires at. And, once under a Zeppelin, it also outranges every single unit and tower in the game.\nI have won every harder map by simply producing 5 of those and putting them under a Zeppelin, slowly withering away the PCs unit reserves. It was quite depressing. I did experiment with different strategies, but the army tends to be so annoying to manage, every time I was starting to get low on reserves I always ended up falling back to the unkillable artillery combo. Besides sometimes it was the only way.\nThe reason for that is basically because the creator decided to phone it in at the end. The campaign has a reasonable progression in the first two acts, with obvious enemies of clear motivation (if horribly underdeveloped. Signs of potential boss battles are all around the place, but you never get any). But once you get to act three, the game reuses all the old maps and the enemies get a ridiculous buff, which I think was the developers idea of difficulty spike.\n\nAll in all, the political aspect was so fun I actually played the campaign twice, but the battle system is so atrocious I cannot recommend this game unless on massive sale, and even then, it’s not the best of picks.","September 5, 2015","false","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When your units end their turn in the same region as enemy troops, the game switches to a real-time mode where you fly around shooting fireballs while little soldiers run around on the field below you. But for some reason, now you can also build troops and buildings! But instead of using gold, you have a different resource called 'recruits' which you build up by capturing buildings called 'Recruitment Centers'. And it seems like the amount of troops you build during the engagement is much larger than the amounts you started with by pushing pieces around on the board. And now I have to keep popping out of the dragon to create new units and order them to do something useful. Extremely stressful and not interesting. These guys should have kept unit creation only in the turn-based game (so that the units you start a fight with are all you get) and let the player have fun with maybe an extremely simple set of commands to give orders in combat.\n\nTL;DR: Blowing things up as a dragon is fun.

I avoided it as my Gfx card sux and this game CTD(crashes to desktop) often when I zoom out and there doesn't seem to be a fix(I did look, but found nothing). The dragon doesn't seem OP, when I did use it once, infact it kept dying so this is not some silly RotR  action game where ur character kills everyone on its own*scof*.  However, the dragon does seem to have a lot of customisaton(as much research as there is for battlefield units)... shame you cant  get it as an AI controlled unit... I think the dragon is the reason why the support units are too powerful, they are a counter to  it...  Apparently you can play people online with this, which will make for interesting pvp as cpu never uses dragon (as far as i can see).\n\nThe battle ground units, out side of support are pretty good i guess... there are soOO many abilites and all 95% need researching from the start, many of the units cannot be used easily against many other types, and though it does still smell of C&C's rifle men, rocketmen, buggy,tank .. hierarchy, it is both different and not quite the same... Riflemen in this instance are extremely powerful units and are not worth discarding... This is a very good thing, so given all i did was win via RTS battles, I thought RTS on this was good and yes, its more interesting than some of the newer C&C titles  haha!\n\nHmm, some of the music is quite trippy, it can be nice; there is a wide variety of music in this, some of it not something I would call great, but some is good... All other sounds, are great, and many of the political scenes are  vocally acted and well done.... It adds to the fact that the script is actually well written I thought, the story is quite entertaining...\n\nThough it is far from perfect in every side of the polygon that it covers, some of these thigns include a really bad bias towards support units in rts mode and ( as mentioned; they can be invincible... really bad balance!)  and the game has definetly got some nasty bugs in there, one as mentioned above with my my poor gfx set up.  Antoher is evident when you force a large battle(i.e. attacking a Captial).. The engine just cant cope and kind of punishes you as it crashes your abilty to create units ( all you see are unit build bars that trail off the screen :P) whilst your opponent seems to churn them units out un waveringly, like a groupee clic's verbal diahorria.\n\n\nWill rewrite this later\n\n\n\n","November 25, 2015","true","35.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Political choices and personal interactions influence the wider world, leaving behind a legacy from your character. Auto-resolve allows you to delegate the responsibilities of battle to your army, or to your extremely skilled generals. Alternatively, you may lead your forces personally in one battle per round, inspiring and protecting your troops, demoralizing and demolishing your enemies, all in your resplendent draconic glory.\n\nPolitics allows you to gain greater advantages in your territories, while giving an idea of what actual political decisions are like, as someone will always dislike you for the decision you make.\n\nWhile the game could also be called an rpg for the storyline that centers on your character, roleplay takes a backseat to  battle and expansion. However, for what the game is, the roleplay is nicely done, allowing you to flesh out your character's likes, dislikes, and opinions through political decisions and character interactions. The relationships between you and your spouse can be particularly rewarding.\n\nAll in all, this isn't a game for players expecting a hardcore version of any of the genres it's composed of, but an excellent choice for anyone who enjoys a variety in their games...and those with fantasies of ruling a vast empire with an iron fist.","November 3, 2015","true","33.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This RTS throws in a twist, one loyal to the game's name: playing as the Dragon Commander, you have the ability to drop onto the battle field personally, flying around the battle field in third person and raining down fire on your opponents. This is possibly one of the only RTS games where you have the ability to summon a super unit you control so directly.\n\nThe execution of the Dragon Commander mechanic is mixed. It's an unfathomably cool idea, and having access to the dragon makes for a very fun 'super' button to push. On the other hand, actually commanding your army is more difficult in this stage - making army selections can't be done with the mouse anymore and casting unit spells becomes a bit of a headache, never mind selecting buildings and creating units out of them. Another side effect is, since the Dragon is partially controlled by the WASD keys, units will not have spells or fuctions bound to those 4 keys, making it less comfortable for those RTS players who like playing with a 'grid' setup (where abilities are hotkeyed according to where they are on the menu).\n\nAs a pure RTS, the game is weak. The maps do not have wide varieties of objectives, the units are awkward to control, and the mini-map doesn't do much to help navigate. All units supposedly have strengths over others, but there are some which are clearly universaly better than others. One bonus though: free camera control, including the ability to zoom, turn, and even look upwards, a rarity in RTS games!\n\nHowever, despite the RTS portion of the game being weak, there is an added element which adds depth when playing the story mode: the RPG/political side of the game. Earning favor with races means that any time you hold an RTS battle in a country primarily populated with that race you will have a higher maximum army count, as well as more production from that country when you win. It is very possible that if you fail to ever compromise with a race's demands you will enter fights with a max army size a fraction of your opponent's, upon which your only hope of winning the fight is to rush them. The fact that the roleplay element of the game affects the gameplay element is a very tasteful touch which helps put importance to the political debacles presented.\n\nSure, the politics side of the game is not executed in the best way possible and some of the decisions you are presented are obviously better than others, but it's still interesting. You are often presented with decisions such as whether you want to install a public healthcare system, tax the church system, add regulations to limit freedom of the press, etc. Most of the decisions are very tongue-in-cheek versions of current real life issues, and the choices made affect resources and gameplay. Interestingly enough, most of the more 'good' choices end up making the game harder, so compromising with the councillors you do not like is sometimes a necessity in order to have reasonable approval ratings in regions where fights are likely to occur. There are dozens upon dozens of choices to make, decisions branch out into relevant new choices, the characters have a wide variety of personalities, the voice acting is believable, and there is an enormous amount of dialogue that will simply not be seen in a single playthrough. This is all completely optional: everything can be skipped, clicked through, or ignored to get back to the RTS portion, though I wish more games had these kinds of options.\n\nAll in all, the game is a bit of a power fantasy - except unlike games which turn you into a super-powered being who can screw the lives of evey person in sight (GTA, AC, TES, etc), you get the added perk of being able to screw with the lives of every person out of sight too, and they can't do a thing about it because you're the Dragon Commander/Emperor with incendiary respiration. However, despite having so many glitches and design flaws, and despite the game's concept precluding it from being taken seriously by RTS enthusiasts, at the end of the day the game is just fun. It does a lot of things that no other game of its kind has tried, and though it has not done it in the best way possible, it's the kind of game that makes one hope for a more polished and refined second attempt. As a serious game it has failed, but as a fun romp it has succeeded.\n\nI mean come on, Dragon on the battle field. For all the game's flaws, it's hard to say no to that.","November 2, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None of the aspects are terribly deep, but it's really blended together well.\nThere is a minor political aspect in which you make choices as to how your kingdom will run, your decisions will give you different benefits and drawbacks in the strategy side of the game and alter your reputation with the four factions.\nThe characters are absolutely hilarious, the banter between them is far from politically correct and nothing is off limits.\nNot my favorite game in the Divinity universe but your collection absolutely isn't complete without it.

As an RTS, its an unfeasable zerg rush simulator.  If you take the time to build your base, you will lose.  If you focus on capturing the map, you will lose.  The only strategy is to rush your enemy before it gets some semblance of a foothold.\n\nOn that note, the enemy can trigger all their abilities at once, while yours have to be done manually, invididually.  The enemy can use all of their buildings, command their troops, and use their abilities all at the same time, making things more onesided as time goes on.\n\nIf you have the bright idea to bring out your dragon, you will quickly be demolished.  You don't do nearly enough damage, and being a dragon in battle is more of a hinderence than a help.  One you can't leave being in dragon form unless you get yourself killed, so you might even get the pleasure of watching your base get destroyed while you struggle to control your units and buildings from above.\n\nApparently the RPG aspect of the game is either great or abysmal depending on who you ask.  The reviews suggest it between a waifu simulator and a radical tumblr propaganda piece, but you have to get past the rest of the game, which frankly, isn't worth the time or effort, to find out.\n\nDon't buy it unless its on sale.

The devs really want you to know that, so you'll spend a fair amount of time learning that elves like to smoke the green stuff and dwarves detest universal healthcare. Fortunately it doesn't ruin the game's immersion... because it's really not that immersive to begin with. No small number of mistakes in ability descriptions and other in-game text, to boot.\n\nYour generals will do a roll-of-the-dice job at resolving battles for you, so on the Risk-style map your options are to either amass a force that even in the most inept hands could still overpower the enemy and let an AI general take care of the battle for you, or invade with a laughably underpowered force but control the army yourself, RTS-style. If you can stay alive for the first 2 minutes of battle, you'll then be able to transform into a dragon and with even a modicum of FPS-skill obliterate the entire enemy force.\n\nThe RTS depth is kiddie pool. Spam unit construction and send them all in a big blob at the enemy base. If they aren't able to take care of it on their own, again, you're a dragon in the sky, raining down AOE death on the AI's clumsily clumped units. When they finally get respectable anti-air units around Chapter 2, you'll have to disengage occasionally and invest in the dragon skills that give better health and HP regen, but ultimately, it just doesn't feel like this game reaches satisfying enough heights to justify the sheer number of times you're going to have to go through the "Build a factory", "Spam units", "Select all units and mass attack on enemy base", "Support them from the skies" routine. That glimmer of fun from the first few battles quickly fades into monotony. Cut all that out in favor of the auto-resolve AI generals, and all you're left with is modified Risk interspersed with obnoxious inflamatory topics of debate in the throne room.\n\nThe Pros? Those first few flights as a dragon, singlehandedly nullifying the enemy's army investment. Quality voice acting. A fresh take on RTS controls--learning how to manage the hotkeys while also flying and fighting is a new experience. Princesses!","May 29","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I loved that game, but it won't run on modern hardware. I really wanted a new game that combines a turn based strategic map and a real-time strategy. This has that. It also has political elements, and you can turn into a dragon. Plus, it's Steampunk, so I was 100% sold.\n\nSo I loved the setup and the execution almost lives up to it. Because there are four different games in one, each version isn't as in-depth as it would be if that were the sole focus of the game. I really like the RTS game and the turn-based strategy helps with researching more units / upgrades, or getting cards to swing close fights. However, the actual strategy map is rather simplistic. I would have liked it if I could have more control over the starting setup for the RTS by building more buildings on the strategy map, for example.\n\nOn a side note, there were some things cut from the final game due to deadlines, like more dragon customization (You still get to pick from one of three starting dragons.) more princesses, being able to play as a female dragon, etc. I really hope the game sold well enough to warrant a sequel, because I would love a more in-depth version of this game.\n\nThat said, I recommend buying it.","June 2","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
