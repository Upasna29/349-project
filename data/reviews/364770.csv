What you see in the store page video is pretty much what you get: run, jump shoot. There are a few limited-shot special guns along the way but I didn't think they added a whole lot to the game play.\n\nThere were a few parts that took many tries to get through but the HP and life system is forgiving. And if you run out of lives you only start that level over.\n\nIt is very well done. The graphics and music are very nice. I'd like to see a sequel with more weapons, maybe some skills to upgrade, etc.\n\nMy Logitech controller worked fine.\n\nMy only issues are:\n\n1) When I switched levels, it leaves full screen, makes the mouse visible and puts it in the center of the screen.\n\n2) Sometimes when you fall on spikes or off the bottom of the screen, it puts you on the edge of where you fell off, hanging by your 1-pixel toenails. It's very easy to fall back off again.\n\n3) The boss health does not reset when you lose a life, so you can just keep going back and wear him down. It does reset if you get "Game Over". I'm not sure if it is better this way, but it made the bosses seem a bit too easy. Most of them still gave me a "Game Over" at least once.\n\nI beat it on normal in about 3 hours but I did not go down any of the optional paths for gems or extra lives. There is also a "Professional" and "Childrens" difficulty but I've not tried them yet.\n\n\n","April 22, 2015","true","3.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","0"

It is not for platforming newbs. I had a bit of trouble getting the settings right. Going into full screen wouldn't work and this led to many alt+F4 closes before I could even get to play the game. The best option is to stay in windowed mode and increase the size of the window in the settings. Overall the gameplay is smooth and is as you would expect a high-quality platformer to be. Swimming proved to be a bit difficult to master until I learned that holding "Jump" while swimming would cause you to continually ascend. This made it easier. I look forward to burning my spare time on this over the next couple weeks.","April 21, 2015","true","6.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Yes, it's that short, which is one of the primary reasons I can't strongly recommend it.\n\nThe visuals are soft and colorful 16-bit graphics which I can't fault much, though the character designs are awful, since they're basically all circles with hands and feet. Controls are tight and responsive for the most part, though the main character has a bit too much hang time when jumping, which can make quick mid-air maneuvering tricky.\n\nIf you have experience with these types of games -- the Mega Man series, for example -- then the challenge in Super Furball is virtually nonexistent. Checkpoints are generous, retaining all your progress right down to the enemies you've killed, and you're given a new bushel of extra lives each time you start a level, meaning you have plenty of chances to fail with minimal consequence. I never once got a Game Over.\n\nThe game does offer leaderboards that rank players' best times, but even this doesn't offer much challenge, as the community is so small, you might end up at the top by default since almost no one has played the level you just beat.\n\nSettings are minimal; you can't even configure controls. The ending is literally a joke. Only buy this if you're desperate for a platform shooter.","June 15, 2015","false","4.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","1"

A skilled player can complete the game on the hardest difficulty level in less than three hours.  The levels are well designed, and it's a good bit of fun but the game lacks replay value.  Also the Game Over screen looks cheaply made.  A good effort for a small team.","July 5, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

I got this game because I liked the aesthetic. Unfortunately that's all the game has going for it. When I finally managed to get the game to work after numerous reboots, I was met with a repetive soundtrack, stiff movement, and mind numbing gameplay. One of the first enemies I came across was a palate swap of the main character. What does that tell you about the "work" that went into the game.\n\nNot to mention the numerous problems that people are having just getting the game to run. I had to reboot about 10 times before finally being able to play. Going to fullscreen would freeze the game and the first time I tried playing, the screen went completely black while sound effects continued. And as far as I know, the dev has done nothing to fix these issues. And I assure you, it's not just me. A quick look at the discussions will tell you that.\n\nI'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I got duped into this lazily made game just because I liked the way it looked. Don't be fooled.","November 23, 2015","false","7.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/364770/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Super Furball is a 2D action platformer in where some dude in a tank blows up your house and a statue of a furball comes to life to take revenge. The areas near him are filled with other evil black furballs that want to kill you. To defend yourself you have an energy gun with unlimited ammo to blast your way past your foes. Enemies also have energy guns so it becomes a duel of who shoots first and is able to land a hit three times that will prevail. That becomes much harder to pull off when the enemies have the high ground and you are forced to jump to their height to land your shoots. Luckily both you and them can only shoot horizontally so you need to be right in front of another to shoot them. Hidden within the levels are a few different more power guns like a plasma thrower which works like a flame thrower and a Repeater that fires three bullets in a single shot. You will have to be careful when firing with these as they have very limited ammo and will disappear rather quickly.\n\nThe levels have plenty of endless pits that will spell your doom if you are unlucky enough to fall into one. There are other hazards scattered around like bouncing mines, missiles being randomly shot from a turret and mines randomly floating in the water. Your little furball has the ability to swim without the fear of drowning so you can take your time navigating underwater. Red gems are everywhere in the level and collecting a life grants you an extra life though they are often placed in very dangerous locations. This is not an easy game by any means and will have your head if you play recklessly. It will help a lot to keep your eyes open for any secrets that can be found like extra lives, guns or just letting you skip a difficult area. Once you finish the first mission you will be taken to the main overworld where you can walk around and go to the next mission or replay previous ones. The next level is where the bad begins and I was unable to continue past the second level due to a glitch.\n\nSecond levels starts off well enough and starts to ramp up the difficulty which is all well and good. Unfortunately once you reach a place with a snake pillar there is no way to progress any further. I'm guessing that pillar is supposed to go down but after multiple times retrying that level it never did and I was not able to play past the second mission. I was not able to play the game to give a detailed review and I do not know things like if the repetitive, slightly annoying music gets any better, if the levels are varied and how the boss fights are. From what I've played it did seem like a fun game with solid controls but I obviously can't recommend a game by playing two levels alone. I don't know if this is a common issue though looking through the Steam forums it does seem like the game has other problems like crashing and being unable to start which I have not experienced. It did not seem like a bad game but I will not recommend it due to this and would advise that buyers beware.","December 18, 2015","false","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"
