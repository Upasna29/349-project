The devs are great about listening to the players and seem to have a genuine desire to put out a great game.  As with most Early Access titles, there are some bugs to be worked out.\n\nThe battle gameplay is engaging and the story is interesting and immediately draws you in from the instant you start the intro.  The graphics and sound are solid and the gameplay seems very smooth and optimized.  I feel I most definitely got my money's worth purchasing on release day and the thought that it will be improved and expanded on has me very optimistic for the future of this title.","March 1","true","50.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

And this is exactly what The Sentient does, putting the player in control of a fleet of humans as they search the galaxy for the means to research, expand, and survive.

However at this time it is very pre-pre-alpha.  I would have suggested that they hold out a bit longer in development before throwing it out to early access.  Unfortunately at this time I cannot reccomend this game because of the amount of bugs.  You will try to save but most likely the save will have some sort of error and you will have to continually start over and over again.  I would try again in a few months.  I do think there is potential for the devs to have a very fun game.  I hope they can make it work because it seems like it could be a winner.","March 2","false","2.9"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","2"

I can usually overlook dated graphics for gameplay but this one makes it hard. I cannot recommend it as it currently stands. Crew will not do what they are scheduled to do many times. They are starving and walk right up to an empty cafetera, go in, make a commant about how hungry they are, and walk right back out. This needs a lot of cleanup before it should be purchased. I'm going to hold onto it and not ask for a refund right away hoping that the devs will take care of some of the more glaring issues in the very near future.","April 12","false","2.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

You might think it's a game about managing and piloting a spaceship but instead you will be babysitting each one of the rejects that you are unfortunate enough to end up with as crew.\n\nIt's horrendously buggy too, from interface screwups to weird behavior and sometimes just straight up getting screwed because your crew will be unable to enter rooms to do things like sleep or use the bathroom.\n\nCan't recommend this now, not sure whether it'd be recommendable in future. It's the sims meets FTL, with no attempt to make something new or at least not so reductive.","March 22","false","17.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","3"

There is a little decision making involved here, because you have to decide whether you want to spent your precious weapon energy on the less effective gun or if you just shoot with one gun instead, but besides that there is not a lot going on. Your crew will just sit at their stations and there is no need to order them around (in fact, it would be a terrible idea to do so).\n\nLoot: Very boring loot. You only get supplies and research points (which you can spend back on earth, if you make it w/o dying).\n\nReasearch: Probably the most meaningful decision to make are when deciding what to research. You have two trees (Controls and Weapons) and some of the technologies will alter your gameplay quite a bit (new weapons, new ship types etc.).\n\nShip design: You can change where which room is, how big they are and what is in there. This is vey important for the outcome of your mission but at the same time it is very obvious what a good design is and what not (especially on the starter ship). Also the interface is a little fiddely. If you are into designing 2d rooms, you might enjoy this part however.\n\nCrew management: Hiring the right crew members is weird, since some of them are just plain better then others. They have a lot of different stats and perks though, which makes the system quite complex. When you did set up a schedule for them there is not much left to do when in space, though.\n\nMore details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TREGYO69OI","March 14","false","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I do let’s play vids and changing all my settings for one game is not worth it to me. But that is just me.\nPast that, the game has an interesting storyline. No it is not a FTL clone, but it does take some solid elements from FTL and enhances them. This is not a bad game at all, it just needs to have some technical issues fleshed out a bit.\n","February 29","true","0.7"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","1"
