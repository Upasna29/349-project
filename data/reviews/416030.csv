It's more something i've just been playing while watching some YT vids.  Also, I will say I used a 360 controller, the controls both keyboard or controller, I think could use some touch ups.  But at this point I've gotten use to the 360 controller.\n\nBtw, once you get to the best tools, you can chop tree's, or harvest rocks in 1 second.\n\nThis game has 2 parts to it.  On one side you're building your village, and crafting new items & buildings, to give you access to more items/buildings.  Take note, I didn't realize this, but some buildings require you to be at a certain level (discussed later).  Basically you have your tools, ranging from axe to sword.  Each level increases dmg down, along with length of time it takes to harvest.  The first time you harvest a tree, you just click once, but it will take a long time.  You have to realize that you don't really want to do much harvesting, let your villagers do that...which they retrieve items from the jobs you've assigned them to on an hourly basis in game (in game hour = 1 min real time).\n\nThe other side is a simple dungeon diving exercise.  You'll see a dungeon entrance on your map, you can go down and kill things.  Killing things earns your XP, which earns you levels.  Start out with killing the bunnies and squirrels above ground first, and watch out when you're level 1, those squirrels hurt.  Then aim for armor/sword...to help kill faster.  As you go down further into the dungeon, the levels get larger, monsters get harder.  Save often (not something I really need to say for an rpg, but I said it anyways).  However, as you gain levels, from killing things, check to see if there are new buildings or new tools/weapons to be built.  Some buildings/items can't be built until you're a specific level.\n\nOverall I've really enjoyed playing, and I'm still not done.","January 5","true","12.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

So I changed my review to a positive review\n\nYour Quest is a pixelated 2D stratergy/survival game. You start out with nothing but wooden tools, and you work to progress your way to better tools and weapons, as well as building and maintaining a successful village of your own creation! It really is "Your Quest" because you can build your village like you want it.\n\nAs a fan of retro 2D pixelated games like this, I find this game to be extremely satisfying in both visuals and mechanics. The movement is a bit slow, but other than that I think this game is very well made in those aspects.\n\nThere is a simple yet effective crafting system and another simple building system. I'm a huge fan of the way the developer set these up, because they're not confusing in the slightest but they also get the job done well\n\nOne thing outside of the game that really impresses me is the developer's interactivity with the community. He listens to suggestions and actually recently fixed a bug pointed out in a steam review.\n\nAll and all, I'd recommend picking this game up. I'm curious to see what's in store in the future.","December 12, 2015","true","7.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","12"

It's still a bit buggy as the author is still adding/removing/breaking/fixing features.\n\nEDIT: The game is now stable with no new features being added regularly to cause breakage.\n\nMy only complaint about the gameplay would be that the charm of A Dark Room was that you could set it and let your supplies accumulate while you did other things, but the slowness of the decorating means you are active the whole time if you want a nice looking village.  It's a good game if you need a mind-numbing, theraputic relaxation game that doesn't require much thought or effort, but you still want the illusion of accomplishment.\n\nEDIT: Now that the "Advanced Equipment" menu has been fixed (in ~24 hours after it was broken by an update) I was able to make better equipment to remove/place tiles much faster meaning the building is not as slow once the game picks up and you have more time to relax.","January 3","true","17.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I really enjoy the building methodilody. I am kind of disapointed in its graphics. I understand the genre but I feel as if it were zoomed in a bit more with less textures from the trees that you could tighten up the quality of the characters. Somewhat similar to Diablo. For that I have a hard time playing through because of it. Gets hard on the eyes and Im on a fairly big monitor with high resolutions. I also think the time could be sped up a bit on the mining aspects. ONe of the biggest downfalls of Warcraft was the time it took. AI think i could chop down a tree quicker in real life. LOL. IN all fairness. Im not sure the engine its built on But I love the genre so Im not gonna stop playing it just because of that.\\n","March 30","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It delivers what it promises... a casual, 2D Strategy/RPG.\n\nYou gather resources, fight, build, craft... the movement IS slow, but its pretty much in line with similar 2D games. The crafting and harvesting time is slow, but only at first. As you progress and are able to build better and better tools, things change.\n\nI think that may be the root of the negative reviews... people who are used to instant gratification or a pay2win store where they can just purchase the top level gear and bypass having to work your way up in a game\n\nThis game is fun. But make no mistake, it is a casual game (perfect for watching videos or having a drink or BOTH).\n\nWhat really struck me about this game, is the genuine feeling of accomplishment I got when I was finally able to build a new building, or craft a new item. But what really stuck with me was the feeling I got when I finally had a little village going which was basically self sufficient. They were gathering enough resources on their own to support themselves without me needing to add in additional food. It felt good.\n\nOn the developer side: wow!\n\nQuick replies and fixes when bugs are reported. I reported a bug and within an hour I had a reply from the developer, and a fix was applied shortly after.\n\n\nIf youre looking for a fun distraction or a really enjoyable time waste (you wont feel like the time was wasted), this game is well worth the $4.99. If you see it on sale for less than that, BUY IT YOU FOOL!!!\n\nThank me later. Or not at all.

But after an hour of playing I realized that the problem wasn't the controls, it was the pace of the game. Since the whole point of the game is to build a village untill your ready to conquer a dungeon, you spend most your time building and gathering resources. But it takes forever to do that, and it shouldn't. I thought after I got workers to collect wood and stone for me, it would be less time consuming to collect enough resources needed to build houses for my village. Wich is true, but it still takes about a minute to put down a damn fence or remove a field, Wich is a problem because when your building or removing something, you can't move. Basically what I'm saying is most the time your staring at your screen as your removing something or building something, and being someone who is used to fast paced gameplay, I find this extremely boring.

Let's try it out!".\n\nSo, this is a kind of RPG where you play a character lost in a forest and with a quest. Which one, you ask? Creating a village and protecting it from monsters.\nSimple pitch for a simple game.\nAt the beginning, you'll be starting with minimal equipment and a guy named "mentor" who gives you small missions and advices. Soon enough, you'll be cutting trees, building a house, hunting squirrels and plowing fields...\nNothing very original, neither specially bad, you might say!\nSo why the bad grade and recommendation?\n\nThe first thing that hit me was the music.\nNot being a big fan of MIDI tunes doesn't help, but the score of this game is kind of dull and uninspired. A few tracks are  better than the others, but it gets boring and repetitive real quick.\nSo I went into the menu and cut it out after thirty-five minutes of gameplay.\n\nThe second thing was the lack of animations.\nNote that in this game, they are not really of importance. But, well, it's all very stiff. And slow. Yes. Your character must be the son of a turtle and an snail, cause taking a few steps from its house to the next tree takes him almost one hour of its time. And it can't run.\nTalking about time, I hope you got loads to lose, cause when you go to your house to rest your character, it just idle in front of the house, doing nothing, and the time passes as if you were still playing.\nAfter I had a few villagers and some bread, I never rested again.\n\nWhat hit me next was the save system.\n6 slots, no control over them. So, when you save the game, better remember what was the previous spot, cause you'll be reloading a few times to find the good savestate. It lacks a log showing you which save is which.\n\nAnd so I was hit again (my nose started to bleed). This time by the ressource management system.\nWhy on earth do the same house needs 350 logs when the previous, which was its exact copy, needed only 300 of them, and so on? Are they playing JENGA with the logs? Making mountains of toothpicks?\nI rapidly found out the answer. It virtually adds some lifespan to the game, which would be quite short if not for this kind of subterfuges.\n\nSo? It's a mobile game concept. It's like playing a fartphone app like "TRIBEZ AND CASTLEZ", minus the "pay-to-win" part.\nAnd I don't like this kind of games.\nToo repetitive.\nBoring.\nAnd pointless.","March 24","false","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Enjoyable. a bit repeatable and boring, and slow at first. End-game is very fast on the other hand.\n\nSoundtrack: 9/10 [i totally loved it. Very immersive]\nGameplay: 6/10 [Slow at first. Has great potential for more content.]\nGraphics: 8/10 [Verily well done pixel art graphics. I wish they added item sprites additionally]\nGUI: 5/10 [On one hand you have everything, on other, too much. Played on 1366x768 resolution. at end-game some options were out of visible range and i couldn't chose them (?)]\nController Support: 10/10 [used xbox360 controller. Very enjoyable, easy, at first a bit hard to remember some functions binded to buttons, everything is explained though]\nExtra: -3 for bugs. Game crashed a LOT of times, mostly in dungeons, had to save every few enemies so i didn't lose progress. after finishing game, there was screen "you won", music, and couldn't do anything. Sometimes when fighting enemy, the game glitched and other enemies were moving, able to attack you despite being already in fight with the first enemy (weird glitch).\n\nSummary: 35/50 worth buying on discounts. I got it for free. Probably won't have bought it ever. Game is much more fun than what you can see on video/pictures.","April 15","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
