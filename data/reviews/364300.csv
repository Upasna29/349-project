My main enjoyment with a game is being able to go through the content.\n\nI'm going to address my commented items below, in order, for clarity's sake:\n\nMining:  They have made one large improvement to mining that I think is quite good - your ship no longer takes hull damage EVERY drone that hits an event.  It takes three events for this to happen now.  While a vast improvement, I am still confused how my ship in space takes hull damage from planet-based mining.  (Developer:  An easy workaround here is to a) do shipboard systems damage related to drone work, like the main computer, and the engines, or b) have a large credit expenditure for the retrieval and repair of said broken/exploded drones; if no money is available, they lose the drone and it's drilling chance for a number of turns until your engines make another).  I still lost 8 hull to a mining incident, which made me hesitant to continue mining, even though it was my main source up upgradable parts.\n\nAway Teams:  Despite efforts, I never ran into an away team dialogue.  I can't comment on this one, sorry!\n\nJumping to Planets:  Happily, this seems to be fixed!  I jumped to a dozen different places and wasn't damaged for simply moving myself along! Yay!\n\nShip Combat:  This is the big sinker/floater, still.  While I wasn't destroyed on my first encounter I was destroyed on my second encounter.  And, after restarting I was destroyed again on my first encounter by... Psionics.  A giant space squid?  Great... but don't make it the damned spaghetti monster with shield-penetrating triple wave psionic beams at literally the second planet I fly to!\n\nAlso, while I'm on space combat:  Boarding parties should scale with my crew/ship abilities.  I don't know, maybe make an algorithm based on the level of my ship's systems for toughness of boarding parties?  And, if there is already something like that, please dial it back a touch.  I had to continuously repair this one open gash in my ship hull in a tiny 2-slot room while trying to defend my ship from another ship while trying to beat down a boarding party.  Moving crew between my (destroyed, and still trying to fix that, too) healing room, and the hull rupture at the very furthest point of my ship was infuriatingly slow... no sense of urgency from my crewmembers who seemed to think that walking is about as brisk a pace as is possible.  While this whole way of combat is fun sometimes, it's not fun when you know you're just really slowly losing the fight.  If this was simply a review of combat it'd be a solid thumbs down.\n\nPop Up Dialogues:  They didn't kill me every time, or cost me money.  So, that's quite a bit better!\n\nOther things I noticed:  Damage indicators have been VASTLY improved.  The captain still appears to be the only one that doesn't just stand around when put on a station; but, I'm still not certain if he's doing anything to give a positive benefit or stat to the station he's on.  I also noticed many little changes here and there that have added to the ambience of the game, however, they aren't game changers in and of themselves.\n\nOverall:  The game is definitely getting to where it needs to go, and while this is a vast improvement on the previous iterations it's still not really hitting the mark at the core of it's gameplay.  With some more combat improvements the game could definitely be a hard hitter.  (Developers:  If you want me input on those items, you can feel free to contact me directly.)\n\nIt's getting there, it really is.\n\n\nI wrote this review on May 5th, 2016.  Almost exactly one year after the previous review.  And, still:  Hopefully in a few months when you read this they'll have a playable game out there, and my opinion will be outdated, again!\n\nUntil then, happy gaming in whatever game you choose!\n\nTL:DR\n\nMuch has changed, combat still frustrates, ship go boom, crew go poof, shinier game, buy it? maybe, devs working hard, captain is a mad scientist.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPREVIOUS REVIEW\n\n\nYou're going to want to hold off on buying this one...\n\nI think I'd really like this game a LOT more than Faster Than Light if it wasn't so damnably annoying.\n\nYou want to mine the planet?  Don't... you'll somehow get hull damage, even though you sent a mining drone to the surface.\n\nYou want to send an away team to that ship with no life signs?  Don't... you'll lose a crew member.\n\nYou want to jump to the next planet?  Don't... you'll once again get hull damage.\n\nI've travelled through about 5-6 different "sectors" of 12-15 "systems" so far, and I've had to Alt + F4 the game because I got a random shipboard fire (from who the hell knows where...) and it wouldn't zoom in on my ship, so I couldn't assign crew to fix it.\n\nIt doesn't matter, though.  I was about to close it out anyway.\n\nEvery single move you make in this game is infuriating, annoying, and irritating.\n\nLet's take mining for example... you have four SEPARATE drones you send down, but if just one of them hits some event your ship WAY up in orbit takes hull damage, and you lose everything you've mined from previous drones in that encounter.\n\nLet's take ship combat... my first time playing the first ship I encounted used psionics on my crew, pierced my shields, and used hull breaches to destroy me in about 15 seconds.  My VERY first encounter... A little excessive for my weak shields and 2 weak weapons...\n\nHow about pop up dialogs?  You will (90% of the time) lose out on these.  You'll lose credits, crew, or hull.  Usually hull... they LOVE destroying your hull in this game.\n\nThis game DOES have the ability to be good... even better than Faster Than Light (which it seems to be a glossy version of), but they'll need to add configurable ships, better ship damage feedback (instead of that silly wheel on the ground to tell you how damaged your components are), and make it so that ANY crew can take a station... not just your captain.\n\nThey also need to make the game 250% less irritating (hull damage, drone mining, crew deaths, etc, etc, etc).\n\nBUT!   If they can fix it... and I realize it's (incredibly) early alpha... maybe they can pull a game off.\n\nI bought this knowing that the 5 thumbs ups before me were all from developers.  They always pull that crap with their own games... so I decided to take one for the team.\n\nI wrote this review on May 14th, 2015.  Hopefully in a few months when you read this they'll have a playable game out there, and my opinion will be outdated.\n\nUntil then, happy gaming in whatever game you choose.","May 14, 2015","false","1.5"," 460 of 491 people (94%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","94","460","491","29","8"

I am presently replaying the game again to experience the changes that have been made and will update the review to reflect once I've beaten the game or put in enough hours into the game. Kudos to the Devs for continuing to fine tune and push updates to their game.\n\nUpdate ends\n\nThis is an extremely hesitant not recommended and let me tell you exactly why. Many of you guys reading the review section are almost undoubtedly fans of FTL and you are wondering. Is this a blatant ripoff? Are there any differences? If so, do they make Space Rogue stand out enough on its own to justify a purchase?\n\nIn my opinion right now, no. But, it has potential to be as good and even better than FTL and this is from a guy who played the ♥♥♥♥ out of FTL several times with and without mods and beaten it several times. (Didn’t play on steam). I managed to reach the second last zone in Space Rogue  several times in the campaign and they have a lot of work to do if they want to surpass FTL.\n\nDifferences\n\nPower – This is a difference that primarily affects battle. In FTL, power is doled out by you to the various systems and this adds a layer of strategy in battles where you can boost the power to your shields, weapons and engines but at the cost of taking power away from other systems like the medbay.\n\nIn space rogue, there is 0 power management as each system will have power independent to the other systems and how much power available depends on how much you upgrade each system with Tritanium, a separate resource from credits which you acquire from mining. Without power management, Battles become less hectic and chaotic but also more focused. Some may find this a positive, I personally find this a negative.\n\nBattle – Battle is largely the same as FTL and veterans will be familiar with hull breaches, enemy troops teleporting onboard, fires and the way shields and hull damage works. Weapon types are also fairly similar but there are some unique to Space Rogue but not many.\n\nCrew - There are 3 kinds of crew available to you. The captain who is well, the captain of the ship, engineers and warriors. Unlike FTL where different crew members can man stations and improve its efficacy, the captain is the ONLY crew member who can man a station.\n\nWhy this is so is beyond me, as the ability to man stations with your crew members and have them become more skilled and level up is a fantastic part of FTL. There are different species but the only difference between the species stats. So, unless you are a data/stats min max kind of person, it will reach a point where you go eh whatever and pick randomly. Crew is a missed opportunity here and needs more work to be more engaging and more relevant to the ship instead of being wrench monkeys or gun drones.\n\nResources - The amount of resources you get throughout the game is so pitiful to the point where I was backtracking through cleared systems just to grind out to credits and tritanium I needed. By the way, levelling up your crew costs you credits which.... is stupid and extremely cost prohibitive.\n\nRandom events – This is where FTL and Space Rogue take a different approach. FTL’s random events could have devastating effects, but never does it go “oh you know what? I think your hull doesn’t have enough holes. Here, lets fix that by having a system randomly explode and oh yeah fires too cause why not”. Think I’m exaggerating? Heh no. I found it infuriating and blatantly unfair that my ship could suffer damage literally just by travelling to another planet.\n\nThis is of course the worst example of what could happen, but there are a ton of other encounters and most of them seem to end badly for me one way or another. Sometimes I do come away with a nice haul of credits but most of the time.....\n\nNow lets talk about mining. *Huge sigh* Mining is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ expensive as it costs credits to send a drill down to a suitable planet. I’ve mined literally every single planet that could be mined and even backtracked to earlier systems just to see if i can scrounge up some tritanium to upgrade my ship and holy ♥♥♥♥, let me tell you that mining is stupidly unfair and not fun. Send a drone down, lol it hit the planet too hard and made a whole planets worth of ore sink so deep that it becomes un-minable just because your drone landed a little too hard.\n\nOh the drone below the planet surface explodes for no reason (yup that’s the reason you are given, your drone blows up for reasons unknown) and not only do you lose ALL the resources you mine, but your ship IN ORBIT ABOVE THE PLANET SOMEHOW TAKES DAMAGE TOO. Send your drone down, lol some mockconglers shoot it down and tell you to run off and there is nothing you can do about it. Oh hang on, your drone actually made it to the surface, that’s fine I’ll start drilling.... oh ♥♥♥♥ I found unstable tritanium and your drone immediately blows up and again your ship takes damage. Oh crap, I found a trap on the planet THAT SUCKS MONEY OUT OF MY SHIP IN ORBIT.\n\nAfter reading all that, you might think, well I’ll just not mine. Well you won’t get very far since mining is literally the only efficient way to get tritanium which is needed to upgrade your ship and since mining is stupidly unfair and unfun, its very likely that mining will cause you to lose both credits and hull integrity and set you back even further than before.\n\nAside from the stupid random events and how most of them are basically out to screw you over in every way imaginable, the game is pretty damn fun. While it may seem like I didn't enjoy it at all, I did get the "FTL feel" back again but way too many problems. The progression needs work. The difficulty spike is pretty crazy and I had to flee many battles to backtrack to systems I already conquered to scour them for credits and tritanium to get my ship to a level where I would not get blown up instantly.\n\nThe game does have a lot of potential and I believe it could be great if the devs make the improvements that Space Rogue sorely needs as it moves along in early access. But right now, Its just an echo of a great song that is FTL.","May 19, 2015","false","10.9"," 245 of 263 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","245","263","12","5"

I realize it is early access but like so many EA games it seems to have gotten of track early and doesn't show signs of getting back on track.\n\nJust a of the things that make the game less than enjoyable.\n\nToo many choices without information as to the outcome.\n\nUpgrading crew offers no choices so it should be automatic.  Why waste the player's time?\n\nVery cute graphics that obscure rather than reveal what the player is to do. For instance, weapon targets are not highlighted on the primary enemy graphic.  Damaged systems are indicated by tiny icons in upper left screen instead of on primary graphic.\n\nNo sense of progress.  Neither is there the conflict of resource management that underlies FTL.\n\nCrew merely  repair damage and fight boarders.  No specialized skills.  No  crew posts so no real reason to choose any one over another\n\nToo much focus on graphics at cost of game play.  There is no sense of progress.

Yes, Space Rogue...\nYou'd be forgiven for thinking at first that FTL had just undergone a facelift. The game plays very, very similarly. Welcome to Space Rogue, another entrant in the opening wave of "FTL-Likes" to go along with Convoy. It's been quite some time since FTL came out, and to be fair nobody has really gone out of their way to try and cook up what FTL achieved, indeed, FTL set the bar so ridiculously high there was a sense anyone trying would have to differentiate themselves pretty hard lest they wind up being seen as a poor version of FTL. So far we've had things like Death Skid Marks (Excellent), Convoy (Reasonable) and now we have Space Rogue. Space Rogue however hews closest to FTL's formula, in so much as it puts you in command of a ship which you fly through sectors of space.\n\nIt looks nice but er, door control, power subsystems, events that don't want to immediately murder me?\nIn the current iteration of SR, events are taken from a nice diverse pool, and most of them end up with combat. Unlike FTL there's not a lot of subtlety going on, the vast majority of the time you'll be murdering whatever gets in your way, or you'll be getting rewarded FOR murdering whatever got in your way. There are the rare, thankful occasions when that's not the case, but in this game, combat is the norm, not the exception.\n\nThis would be fine if combat was solid and satisfying, currently it's rudimentary. It takes a lot of cues from FTL (with the PiP view of the enemy ship) to allow for specific targetting of areas of the enemy ship, but unlike FTL there's no real benefit to nuking the enemy engines, life support or navigation. Right now the only things that matter are shields and weapon systems, and maybe the medic bay if you have the right facilities.\n\nBut for the downsides, there's some flashes of light on the edge of space...\nThis is a shame because in some areas it genuinely improves over FTL's combat model, such as the concept of ammo weapons having a shorter reload between shots and then a "long" reload as the clip is refilled with ammo. There's program "Cartridges" which allow you to conduct cyber warfare on your opponents, such as setting fire to target bays, puncturing sections of the ship, and sending their crew into a panic. These are seriously good steps forward.\n\nEqually there's the navigation system, unlike FTL you're not time constrained, so you'll be moving back and forth between sectors, completing quests. Right now it's a very barebones system, with planets you've cleaned out not being of importance or note once you've dealt with them, but there's always the possibility of systems becoming event markers so that after an extended period, sectors become more difficult, forcing you to keep pressing onwards and preventing you from farming for easy planets and mining opportunities.\n\nThe scaffolds are in place, but there's a lot to go...\nThere's potential here to be sure, there's definitely a good idea of where the game is going, and there are some intriguing possibilities in the future. Right now however, it's a case of "It's a lot like FTL but... not really as good." and that makes it entirely impossible to recommend -yet-. I say yet because there's a patch due in the next couple of weeks, in other words, put this on your wishlist, and watch this space. There's a very good chance that the game will start improving significantly, and that my opinion of it will move more towards a cautious recommendation, and then eventually a wholehearted recommendation.\n\nVerdict : Wishlist it. Wait. Watch. This is one for the future. Right now you'd be investing in potential, but in the future, this may be FTL 2.0, if the devs can take the feedback they've got and convert it into results.","May 31, 2015","true","2.8"," 83 of 120 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","83","120","5","4"

Unfortunately, Space Rogue is held up to the high standards of Faster Than Light (FTL), even though it is a different company, designing a completely separate game. It does, however, have large amounts of borrowed UI and  game mechanics, making it appear much like FTL. The game is very similar to FTL in many respects and at the same time it is its own game. If you enjoyed FTL and want to try a new type of strategy for this budding genre, this game will probably be fun for you. If you're expecting a 100% clone, you will be disappointed (and why aren't you just playing more FTL?).\n\nJudging the game purely from a genre standpoint, it holds its own. There is a level of difficulty and challenge to everything you do. The game's strategy is deeper than space battles and economics, as it requires you to weigh in risk and probability. I've read several reviews complaining about the amount of failed events you find, but to be honest, I felt like it added another layer of challenge. Even if you skip events to breeze by without extra hull damage or lingering effects, eventually, you will find yourself wanting more Tritanium (A critical resource) than you can't always collect by doing missions or battling pirates.\n\nI look forward to playing more of this game and I can't wait to see what the developers continue to do with it.","March 28","true","13.4"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

The potential is there, but it needs plenty more work.\n\nPros: Nice graphics. That's essentially it. (And the room-on-fire animations need work!)\n\nCons: Crashes a lot, at least the Mac version does. Two complete lock-ups in an hour and a half of play. I've not tried the Windows version, but it's safe to assume that is no more stable. Takes over the entire Mac in full-screen mode, preventing task-switching. And windowed mode is, like with 99% of games, utterly unplayable due to not fitting properly on the screen (i.e. there's no borderless option).\n\nLimited keyboard control, e.g. dialogs require mouse input. Mouse control is a bit laggy and unresponsive. The music (at least the initial title music) is repetitive and annoying. Selecting your crew and moving them around is clunky compared to FTL's interface.\n\nIt's difficult to see what your drones are doing due to the zoomed-in perspective, although granted the zoom level can be adjusted somewhat. But the graphics are designed to be viewed large and close-up. Due to their isometric design, it's not always clear what's going on. It can also be difficult to tell your crewmembers apart at a glance, but I guess that'll come with practice.\n\nCan't de-power rooms, which is a nice micro-management mechanic in FTL. Also there's no manual door control, so you can't defeat boarders by flushing the atmosphere. Missile-based weapons don't use ammunition either, which essentially means they're identical to lasers, except pass through shields. So why would anyone use lasers?\n\nUpgrade window doesn't tell you the effects of a subsystem upgrade until you have bought it.\n\nI don't like the cartridges, they're of limited use and fiddly. They're like the curses in Diablo - you have to keep re-casting them.\n\nBottom line, they seem to have taken FTL, beefed up the graphics, and simplified the gameplay. Granted, improving on FTL (at least the iOS version) is a difficult task; but the fact remains that Space Rogue - while not a "bad" game - is nowhere near as good. Yet.\n\nOh yes... and their support email address, as given by Steam's game support page, DOES NOT WORK!","May 11","false","1.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I think the developers released it a little too early because:\n\nAreas that desperately need development.\n1) It is riddled with game ending bugs that will lead to unavoidable crew deaths/ship explosions. They have an auto-save feature that lets you reload in case this happens but some of the bugs will corrupt your save game and you have to start over.\n2) Many of the events are still very rudimentary. e.g. Would you like to stop at this space station? Yes/No. Yes. You       scratch someone's ship and lose x amount of credits. You have no option to choose what you do at the space station and once the event is over you cannot return to it. That's just one event example.\n3) The UI during combat often obscures ship rooms both on enemy and player ships making targeting/repairing very annoying.\n\nWhy I recommend it:\n1) This game is NOT FTL and should only be compared to it in that the format is the same. After you take FTL out of the equation, it's a decent game.\n2) When the above deficiencies are corrected this game is going to be awesome.\n3) This game has potential to be the best game of its type at this time. They have a mod manager tab in the start menu which will allow users to augment this game and further improve its playability.\n","August 27, 2015","true","61.9"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","0"

Thousands of years passed and many of strategy games evolved to thousands of strategy games on computers, on paper. There are also  'tactical' games which came out of strategy ones. They differ much or not.\n\nI'm observing the next 'step' of FTL-like game mechanic but not the clone. It could be Warcraft-like mechanic with many units-ships which their pros and cons against each other with space station which makes them or it could be something with shooting involved mechanic. That's JUST a matter of choice.\n\nWhy I'm talking about it in this way? I saw many comments like 'awww, it's just another FTL', 'I'd play FTL better', 'They didn't make any new features' etc.\nJust imagine it's a new genre and play again. Don't judge it from the point of 'cloned' game, it's NOT. There are plenty of different features: non-linear gameplay, starting conditions, friendly simple graphics, and many-many of little ones that you'll find when you play more than couple of minutes.\n\nBesides:\na) the game is STILL in development;\nb) developers ARE REALLY listening to what people write. And you can trace how crucially it changed from start to the point of 'now'.\n\nSo it's up for us: to help improving it or keep judging 'Unreal' to be a clone of 'Quake'. It really has a great potential and may be we'll see more 'FTL-like' genre games.\n\nPROS:\n- non-linear gameplay\n- you can choose the level of difficulty by setting starting conditions\n- nice simple graphics\n- plenty of events\n- nice music\n- FTL-like gameplay\n- still in developement, has a potential\n\nCONS:\n- balance (just my opinion)\n- just sandbox, no deep campaign (I would prefer that)","April 12","true","19.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Its still in early access so, as should be expected, its yet to be fully fleshed out with content and the some of the basic mechanics are still a little buggy and unrealized. And yes, it will crash here and there. But as I said, these are to be expected. However you can indeed experience the superstructure, if you will, of the game in a few short hours. Lacking in content, you aren't likely to be captivated endlessly, but I am of the belief that a solid core exists here.\n\nWhat it doesn't share with FTL, may be what excites me the most about this games development. Yes, its prettier, it also tries to broaden out events, and offers a simple mining system, all of which are still rudimentary. But it does seems to show some creativity from Red Dawn to take some of what was good about FTL and hopefully incorporate their vision into it as well.\nAfter having played this game a bit and tried it, I have to say that I'm still excited for its potential rather than what it is today.\nI'm going to give it a thumbs up on that basis.","May 23, 2015","true","3.7"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

Production values are very good overall and far more polished then many EA games. Basic video options but everything that was required including 4k+ and AA support. UI layout seemed well designed and control system was intuitive. Often overlooked by non-English developers is translation and spelling which had no issues either. Soundtrack also impressed me and really added to the atmosphere. Fans of FTL there is a lot you should love about Space Rogue. Do think it's priced a little high but I'm not someone who put 100-1000hrs into FTL either. If you are that person the value seems to be there but depends on future content as well.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcqY4n2SM-4\nGameplay involved jumping around the galaxy while heading toward your main objective. Every planet visited triggers a random event of which the game claims to have included around 200 or so. I didn't run into any that seemed familiar after several hrs of play. Clearing each sector gives you the the ability to heal your crew members, patch up the ship, install upgrades and level up crew members. Currently the game includes a basic tutorial and campaign. Campaigns seemed to be made of many solar systems with a single jumpate at the end. Each solar system also contained at least 1 central trade station where you are able to buy and sell along with repairing your ship.\n\nStorepage mentioned it was randomly generated so I put it to the test and created around 10 new games, all of which were entirely different. Main plot line, planets, galaxies, faction reputations and wars all seemed to change dramatically between sessions. Much like all rogue-likes the RNG system can be a complete pain in the rear sometimes but it does go both ways. Several games I played did manage to get stomped quickly at the start. As long as you hit a few planets successfully will soon receive upgrades or be given extra crew members through minor victories making life in space much easier.\n\nWith mod support along with listening to community feedback the sky is the limit. Should keep fans of the genre going for some time. Feel free to ask any further questions, will do my best to answer them asap. Cheers folks and happy gaming. :)\n\n(fresh game/longer video)\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa4CsKl2OFg","May 14, 2015","true","5.5"," 46 of 90 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","46","90","4","2"

I died twice in a row quite miserably before I realized this. Some exapmles; no gas to worry about wasting, moving backwards is totally doable, no rocket ammo, and other important expectations that will hold you back at first.\n\nOverall:\nA interestting indie game that is priced quite well considering the content and comparing it to other similar titles. I would recomend this game at its current stage, definatly playable. However, I am one of those people that would prefer to wait till the actual game is realesed before I dive into it fully. However, it seems to me that the game is close enough to completion to start enjoying it.\n\nEarly Access Tips:\n\n*** The way FTL had a save your guys to certian spots button was very useful. After every battle it is a pain moving each guy back to the spot I want them in for the start of the next encouter. So a save to spot and a move to saved spot button would be VERY helpful.\n\n* The final boss fight of the game should be much harder. Like a final test of your ship and skills.\n\n*  I like the fixes to the layout of the battle screen but there are a few more chages that would be nice. If you have a link/email I could forward the pictures I would show you what I mean. Maybe my screen is to small and the game is meant to be played on a desktop computer. My 15.4" Mac seems to small but not so the the point the game is not playable but just would be nice if i could move the view around in various ways. (the zoom in and out during the battle screen is much appreciated).\n\n** The store pop up that confirms if you wish to confirm your purchase gets a bit tedious. It would be nice if it was not there but the more reasonable method would be to leave it there by default but have an option in the options menu to turn it off. When I try to buy up the stock of tritaniam it is a pain to have to go back and forth each time which is when I really wish I could turn it off.\n\n* I like how levelin up your charactars cost nothing anymore.\n\n* Still not sure how sending my drill down to the planet would damage my hull when it fails but it does not happen often plus the mining is much improved. I like all the extra info.\n\n* There are a few mispelled words during the story text on the first misison. And by few I mean like one in the entire box. (at least that I noticed).","June 24, 2015","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

Yes, the similarity to FTL almost hits you over the head, race/species, battle scenarios, and ship interiors are among the things that scream FTL! ...but one can argue that any game of similar genre will have a similar design. There are quite a few differences however, whether they're good or bad depends on your expectations. If you're expecting a FTL clone with a face lift you might be disappointed, in my 15 hours of play time I found Space Rogue to be a much simpler game, but this might just be due to the fact that I have been unable to move past lvl 2 space (because of bugs that force you to restart), or perhaps the game is meant to be more suited for a younger crowd and/or casual gamers. Then again we have to remember that it is an early access release, and for all we know it might still be missing a lot of its content.\n\nEven though its very enjoyable to play in its current state, there are plenty of things that remind you its an early access game. You know little things like your captain walking right off your ship only to die in the cold vacuum of space, which of course means game over. Your boarding crew disappearing with the (very much intact) enemy ship after defeating the enemy crew, or getting stuck in a bugged battle only to quit and reload your game in the very same spot with no way to move forward. So there are some bugs that will force you to restart your adventure, and the lack of crew/ship customization options as start of game make restarting the game a killjoy.\n\nMy advice to anyone finding the Mining mini-game more frustrating than fun is to start a custom game with more Credits rewards and less XP rewards. The game considers this a fair trade for the balance score of 1, and you'll find that your crew still levels up fairly fast, and now you might even have the credits to level some of them up. Though mainly it'll make mining, or rather repetitively failing at it, less of a hassle when you have the funds to try and try again. I have no knowledge of what the odds actually are of landing your mining probe and mining, but it surely feels like they're stacked against you, but as long as you think of it in terms of 50/50 chance, and make peace with the fact that you'll fail half the time no matter what, you'll be more likely to laugh it off than curse at your screen.\n\nThis game is definitively still a work in progress, but shows a lot of potential, and is already a lot of fun to play around with,","May 21, 2015","true","39.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","4","12","2","0"

Even the rooms and the pacing of combat have the same general concept.  "Space Rogue" does take it a step farther in a few places, giving you the ability to mine planets for minerals (just to cite one example), though you can't grind for minerals by revisiting planets you've already been to.  In addition to this, the customization options for when you're setting up said sandbox are fairly vast.  All of these things appeal to my inner sci-fi geek...I mean, what "Star Trek" fan doesn't dream of commanding their own ship?  I think it's safe to say that if you enjoyed "FTL" (it's one of my favorites), then you'll like "Space Rogue" too.  The price is a bit steep considering that the differences between this and "FTL" are few and far between...I sincerely hope that more content is coming to justify the price variance between the two games.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zLQvEh0fAE","May 14, 2015","true","4.6"," 13 of 32 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","13","32","2","0"
