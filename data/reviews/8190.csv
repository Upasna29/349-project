Though extremely repetitive, this has kept me entertained for 90+ hours. (and over 150+ hours on the free multiplayer mod)\n\nPROS\n+ HUGE world map; we're talking 400 sq. miles (20 miles x 20 miles)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=560068093\n+ Great graphics (esp for 2010) that still hold up a half-decade later\n+ Most PC's can easily handle this; a $100 GPU will max it out at 60 fps\n+ Lots of mods available\n+ JC2MP, which adds much more things to do (and is free / 30mb)\n+ Blowing up ♥♥♥♥ is fun\n+ Lots of vehicles to utilize\n+ Perfect Draw Distance; you will always see the entire world!\n+ Nice weather system\n+ One of the best Sandbox games out there\n+ Affordable; 15$ normally; 2~5$ on sale\n\nCONS\n- Extremely repetitive; you're basically just blowing up stuff for most of the game\n- Dialogue / Missions are cheesy / bad\n- World is far from ugly / barren, but there's few secrets / interesting points of interest\n- Driving isn't the best\n- Combat can get out of hand fast\n- Little to do outside chaotic acts\n\nThis game will run very well on most computers as long as they have some power. If you can play CSGO at all you can play this. I have a lower mid-range PC (GTX 750 Ti / crappy old 3.0 Quad core AMD) and I have this maxed out at 60 fps at 1080p\n\nIf you love sandbox games this is a must-have, especially if it goes on sale.\n\nOverall, a B+ ~ A- game; it's a must-have for any sandbox fan.","May 25, 2014","true","91.2"," 739 of 778 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","739","778","15","18"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/recommended/8190/","winterdog","WinterDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/","178 products in account","Open-world action game as it should be. Just Cause 2 has that great feeling of absolute freedom - go anywhere, drive anywhere, fly anywhere! You can get to any place on the huge map in just few seconds, you can be defeated without any penalties - this game is here to entertain you, not to blow your mind or make you angry at your keyboard.\n\nTwo unique devices underlying the awesomeness of Just Cause 2 are grappling hook and infinitely respawning parachute (infinitely resp...? aw, forget it). Tons of fun guaranteed! Every action game should have it - I really missed them in Far Cry 3. ;-) It brings so much variety and joy in moving and fighting that you'll be travelling for hours here and there just to use them again and again.\n\nThe world is really good. Yes, most of the cities and villages are copy-pasted, but there are so many different regions on the map with different climate, weather and views that you'll never get bored. Graphics is on the level too, especially fire and explosions - you'll get addicted to blowing things up! Story and quests are not the strongest part of the game, but they do their job. Another feature worth mentioning is the hidden items' search radar - in my opinion, really great idea. It is finally interesting to find stuff by yourself without spending hours in vain or using guide from the Internet.\n\nThere are some cons, of course. Enemies respawning out of nowhere behind your back can be really annoying sometimes. Weapon arsenal is not so big, besides, the lack of ammunition for some weapons leaves you with even less choices. Main story is very short and optional quest lines are not so long either. But there are many things to do on the map - different challenges, races, liquidation contracts... Finally, there's still (and I guess it will be there forever) a bug that prevents you from getting the cherished 100% completion of the game (by the game's internal statistics, not the Steam's one). Thankfully there's only achievement for 75% completion, so no worries, achievement hunters - you'll get your perfect Steam game. ;-)\n\nIf you like free roaming in beautiful open-world game, spending time in parachute challenges, races and outpost fightings, searching for hundreds of collectibles and upgrades, spreading chaos by blowing stuff up or just flying around and enjoing you freedom - you'll definitely love Just Cause 2.\n\n------------------------------\n\nЭкшн с открытым миром - такой, каким он должен быть. Just Cause 2 дарит чувство абсолютной свободы - иди куда хочешь, рули куда хочешь, лети куда заблагорассудится. В любую точку огромной карты можно добраться за секунды, никаких штрафов за гибель героя - эта игра призвана развлекать вас, а не взрывать мозг или доводить до бешенства.\n\nДва уникальных девайса, делающих игру такой шикарной - гарпун и бесконечно восстанавливающийся парашют (бесконечно восстан...? а, неважно). Веселье гарантировано! Эти штуки должны быть в каждом экшене - как мне не доставало их в Far Cry 3!.. ;-) Простое перемещение по миру и заурядные перестрелки становятся настолько разнообразней и веселей, что вы будете путешествовать туда-сюда только для того, чтобы снова воспользоваться ими.\n\nМир игры по-настоящему хорош. Да, большая часть городков и деревень сделана копи-пастом. Но на карте столько разных мест со своим климатом, погодой, видами вокруг, что скучно не будет. Графика тоже на уровне, особенно огонь и взрывы - вы полюбите разносить всё в щепки! Сюжет и побочные квесты не сильная сторона игры, но своё дело они делают. Отдельного упоминания стоит система поиска скрытых предметов с помощью радара - на мой взгляд, отличное решение! В кои-то веки интересно искать ценные предметы самому, а не бегать часами там, где ничего нет, или сверяться с готовой картой из Инета.\n\nКонечно, есть некоторые минусы. Враги, респавнящиеся из ниоткуда прямо за спиной, порой жутко раздражают. Арсенал не так уж велик, а нехватка патронов для некоторых пушек ещё сильнее ограничивает в выборе. Основная сюжетная линия очень коротка, да и дополнительные квесты проходятся быстро. Тем не менее, заняться есть чем - всяких испытаний, гонок и контрактов на устранение на карте хватает. Наконец, достичь заветного 100%-го прохождения игры (игра ведёт свою внутреннюю статистику, не связаную со Steam) не получится из-за бага, который, очевидно, никто уже не исправит. К счастью, Steam-достижение есть только за 75%-ое прохождение, так что будьте спокойны, охотники за ачивами - вы сможете получить в коллекцию ещё одну "идеальную" игру. ;-)\n\nЕсли вам нравится рассекать по открытому красивому миру, проводить время за парашютными испытаниями, гонками и сражениями за военные базы, искать сотни спрятанных предметов и апгрейдов, сеять хаос, взрывая всё вокруг, или просто летать, наслаждаясь видом и собственной свободой, вам определённо понравится Just Cause 2.","November 26, 2013","true","71.2"," 321 of 355 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","321","355","0","17"

In the space of a few moments, you can grapple to a hovering helicopter; beat up the pilot and hijack the chopper; blow up a cluster of fuel tanks; put the chopper on a collision course with an enormous antenna; jump out at the last moment; and watch the resulting explosion as you parachute down to the saddle of a moving motorcycle below. But in the life of Rico Rodriguez, such events are just another day at the office, though in this case, the office is the gigantic island nation of Panau, where three gangs vie to wrest control from a corrupt government. This is a big game that gives you a lot to do and a lot of crazy ways to do it. When Just Cause 2 gives you the freedom to do the things you want in the way you want, it shines in all its preposterousness and good humor. When missions and challenges shoehorn you into specific actions, however, the same loose mechanics that make the open-world exploration such a joy become a frustrating burden.","January 25, 2015","true","8.4"," 122 of 125 people (98%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","98","122","125","28","0"

See, I've always loved destruction in games/movies/etc. So when I see something like that, I know I must own the game.\n\nUnfair First ImpressionsI've seen a lot of different unfair first impressions for this game. The first, and most simple being, the fact that someone may not have liked the original Just Cause game. Therefor it leads to an automatic thought that any sequel will be just as bad, or worse. I can understand this, but believe me, Just Cause 2 makes everything better.\n\nSecond, I've heard that the game can get low reviews and less players because of it's story. I know some people are looking for games for their story. However, not everyone is. You can have a game like Just Cause 2 where the story is bad but the gameplay is good, very good.\n\nThird, because it's a third person shooter style of game. Which can turn some people away.\n\nReview Of "Just Cause 2"Just Cause 2 is a massive open world, sandbox, TPS game, that comes with a full story, side missions, bonus missions, and so many collectables that you'll die before finding all of them.\n\nThe world of Just Cause 2 is massive (Panau). One of biggest I have ever seen! Stretching across desert terrain and mountains, snowy mountains and terrain, jungle and marsh, ocean, urban areas, and military bases. One downside to the world of Just Cause 2 is that it may be very big, but it's not well populated with stuff. Meaning, all that jungle and desert, 90% of it will not have anything in it besides sand and trees. So you may find the world itself being very boring at times. However, the rest of the game makes up for that. In the world of Just Cause 2, there are urban areas to explore. Villages that may hold resources and ammo to big cities that contain higher costing vehicles & helicopters. Places like airports where you can obtain a passenger jet. There are military bases you can liberate by destroying & collecting all things within it. These bases could consist of ports, vehicle factories, little infantry camps, to big fortress type places.\n\nYou can get around the world of Just Cause 2 with many things. First of all, you can use your grappling hook to get to higher places, then you can use your parachute to glide down or travel across land faster. Not only is that the most basic of travel, there are vehicles...a lot. There are a little over 100 vehicles in Just Cause 2. Anything from ATV's, motorcycles, cars, trucks, boats, armored cars, planes, helicopters, etc. The list goes on. One thing that I do not care for in the vehicle department is the vehicle physics. The vehicle isn't really that responsive, or reliable. You can hit the movement key lightly and the vehicle will spin out, even at low speeds.\n\nYou can defend yourself with weapons like SMG's, shotguns, etc. There really aren't many weapons to use in the default game unless you purchase DLC. However, there is still so much content in the game, you don't actually need DLC so the DLC is just there for bonus weapons & vehicles. I would like it if Just Cause 2 had more weapons in the default game. With how big the world is, having more weapons gives you more options to do things with.\n\nThis isn't really the game that plays like a TPS game. You don't run up to a base and get behind cover then start attacking. The AI is kind of stupid, and the same time, they work well. There really isn't any stealth. The concept behind Just Cause 2 is that you drive in for fly in, kill everything, and walk away from a massive explosion.\n\nAs for the story and side missions. The story itself is generic and not really exciting, except for the final mission. There are only six missions I believe, maybe more. However, to unlock story missions you must gain chaos which can be obtained by destroying key points in military bases, fighting the military, collecting things, or completing side missions. There are a lot of side missions to choose from three different sub factions who you'll find fighting the military at times. The side missions themselves can actually be unique and fun, however the briefing itself is low. Every mission start, you'll stand there and the leader of the sub faction will drive by, tell you what you need to do, and then drive away. Not a word said.\n\nDon't get me wrong, Just Cause 2 is a great game, it just may not be what you are looking for.\n\nContent In Just Cause 2 (Bonus Missions & Collectables)In the world of Just Cause 2, you have bonus missions alongside "side missions". These mainly consist of races, for all vehicle types.\n\nOther then that, you have thousands of collectables. These can be little pickups for the sub factions, or little resource crates that boost your stats, like giving you weapon parts to upgrade your weapons, or armor parts to give you more health, etc.\n\nTo gain 100% in Just Cause 2 requires you to collect every piece of sub faction items and resources, also, destroying key military structures in an area. Each area you discover will give you a progress bar, when everything has been collected or destroyed, the progress bar will reach 100% and that area is clear. However, the PC version of Just Cause 2 experienced a bug where a few items & structures do not spawn in the game. Therefor it is impossible to beat the game 100% without a mod. The devs apparently do not care to fix this easily fixed problem.\n\nPro's & Con's (Overall Rating)Just Cause 2 is an open world TPS that provides a wide variety of collectables and fun destruction. You can spend hours on the game before ever reaching 15% for full completion. Despite needing a mod to fully beat the game 100%. There has alos been a community mod released that allows people to play together in the world of Panau.\n\nPro's:\n+Massive open world.\n+Loads of collectables for hours of game time.\n+Fun destruction system.\n+Addicting "I must find everything" style.\n+DLC is not required to play.\n+Nice variety of vehicles.\n\nCon's:\n-Mod needed for full completion.\n-Enemy will spam helicopters.\n-Mostly boring empty world.\n-Strange vehicle mechanics.\n-Low leveled main story & side mission briefing.\n\n\nOverall Rating: About A 12/15 (A Nice Game That's Worth A Pickup)\n\nCredits & DisclaimerThank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.\n\nRemember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.","October 26, 2014","true","220.6"," 199 of 239 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","199","239","9","18"

There is tons of cities, factories, bases and even references here and there in the game. Despite the size of the terrain  you can navigate it fairly quickly due to having the awesome grapple hook and parachute mechanics. The movement from how you can move from one vehicles to other vehicles and the way you can use hooks in a variety of ways to mess with your enemies makes the game really fun and dynamic.\n\nStory\nThough lets be clear the story is not great at all, its just there to justify you exploding everything possible on the island and accumulating as much chaos as possible. The story is so wacky that its fun putting you in crazy situations\n\nBlack Market\nCalling the black market kind of gets annoying however because you constantly have to watch the cinematic for the intro of it and outro depending on what options you picked. So everytime you want weapons,vehicles or just using it for fast travel you will be watching the short clips. Every. Single. Time.

Why? Just 'cause.\n\nJust Cause 2 is one of the best games around for exciting open-world mayhem. Nice graphics and animations, a diverse gameworld, and an interesting atmosphere establish an enjoyable explorative experience. The world is loaded with collectibles to find, vehicles to commandeer, and things to blow up. And it is headlined with exciting, distinctive gameplay chock-full of mayhem and destruction. If you are into sandbox mayhem, this should be a sure thing for you; and even more casual fans of the genre should easily enjoy this game too, because it is just so outright fun.\n\nNow Just Cause 2, as is apparent by the title, is the sequel to the first Just Cause game. The first game was decent, and I had some fun playing it. But to be honest: anything it can do, this can do better. Both games use the same core concepts for gameplay, except the ideas were certainly executed better in Just Cause 2. So you really don’t have to worry too much about missing anything worthwhile if you would prefer skipping over the first game entirely. Even the narrative of Just Cause 2 is almost entirely unconnected to the first game’s story, so reading a brief synopsis should be more than sufficient for you to fully enjoy the experience. Having said all of that, though, if you really enjoy the genre, then you may want to check out the first game too.\n\nAnyway, the strongest attribute of Just Cause 2 has to be the riotous gameplay. You move around in an over-the-shoulder view while on foot, with various firearms at your disposal for taking out militants. And the patented grappling-hook mechanic allows some innovative ways to take down foes, bringing a distinctive novelty to the combat. Furthermore, shortly into the campaign, a wide variety of vehicles (cars, boats, helicopters, planes, and more) becomes available. These are great not only for your basic traveling needs, but also to perform ridiculous and hilarious stunts. And of course, the grappling-hook and parachute combination can be used to explore the gameworld in the signature Just Cause fashion that affords the franchise its unique identity. And with the myriad of collectibles to find, structures to destroy, statistics to record, and achievements to unlock: there is no shortage of things to do.\n\nAnd I suppose if the gameplay is the best attribute of the game, then the gameworld presentation is a very close second. The graphics are pristine and the landscape is packed with diverse sceneries and environments. From mountain peaks to desert valleys, it has it all. The animations and effects are also mostly well designed, which enhances the gratification of bringing a wake of destruction through every last place you visit. And the world is humongous. Even with a jet it can take a while to cross the map. Luckily there is a fast travel system that allows you to begin a sky-dive from above any location you have visited. It integrates perfectly with the game, taking what would be tedious and flipping it into one of the most enjoyable things to do. Just Cause 2 easily has one of the most entertaining gameworlds to explore.\n\nBut even with all of this going on, the game starts off with a very focused and linear mission that allows you to be introduced to the main narrative elements of the campaign. You will come to find, however, that the story aspects of Just Cause 2 are minimal, and mostly mediocre. So you definitely shouldn’t go into it expecting to be told an elaborate story. But despite that, the narrative flows and the various missions are certainly enjoyable. The missions are purposeful and focused, which can be a refreshingly stark contrast to the mindless mayhem side of the game. But while there is a decent amount of total missions including the extras, there are very few main storyline missions, which does hold the overall experience back a bit. So there is some room for improvement.\n\nUltimately, Just Cause 2 is a good example of what can be done in video games when great concepts meet great execution. It is such an all-around fun and distinctive experience that I would recommend everyone give it some consideration; and if you are a fan of the genre, then it should be a no-brainer.\n\nAnd as an addendum: there is now a free multiplayer mod DLC. With the mod, the opportunity for hilarious stunts and mayhem is increased exponentially as numerous players can all play in the same sandbox at once. As a free bonus, it is a pretty sweet addition and can be a lot of fun if you like that kind of thing. Luckily, if it doesn’t sound like your thing, it is also easy to completely ignore since the mod installs as a separate “app” on Steam with separate statistics and achievements tracking.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","April 27","true","63.4"," 88 of 91 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","88","91","5","4"

JC2 is so insanely fun because it completely indulges the player while minimizing the tedious elements of open world games.\n\nOther open world games require slow walking, but JC2 gives you over 50 vehicles (cars, tanks, fighter jets, and more) plus your essential grappling hook and parachute. If you’re hoofing it, you’re doing it wrong. Rather, open up the anywhere-accessible black market and buy a helicopter with dual-machine guns.\n\nJC2’s biggest achievement is how it makes you feel totally in control, able to go anywhere and do anything. There are no invisible walls or disconnected “levels”. And visually, JC2 is really, really attractive. The weather and water are standouts still looking good years after release. The artwork is all very well-crafted, with amazing attention to detail.\n\nThe story is fun, too, with a very B-movie feel, intentionally hokey, but it works very well because of very solid voice work. The game also has a great self-awareness, featuring a hilarious dictator who will make you chuckle as he spouts his pontifications from loud speakers.\n\nAre there downsides? A few. You run out of ammo often, but after 5 hours or so you learn to simply order new guns. There’s no stealth elements but that’s ok. Very few buildings have accessible interiors but no biggie.\n\nOverall, the large scope, consistent quality, and accessible controls of JC2 make it one of the purest video games ever created. When you’re tired of “serious” games let JC2 cleanse your gaming palette.","December 28, 2013","true","56.1"," 92 of 99 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","92","99","0","2"

The game focuses on destruction, deep controls and doing whatever craziness you'd like to do. You play as Rico Rodriguez and you've been sent in by the government to mess things up like a kitten in tissue paper on an island nation that seems giant by gaming standards. You have the option work for different factions / gangs that have their own agendas. The gangs are a nice touch and you'll see them battle each other on the island while civilians run and hide. Its a nice AI dichotomy.\n\nSince the game is set on a bunch of giant islands, the terrain is gorgeous and diverse. You'll see lush green jungles beneath icy mountains, then go into those icy mountains and down into sandy deserts. After that, you can take a boat for a ride across beautiful blue waters, then hijack a jet and surf on top of it into a golden sunset while dodging missiles. Everywhere in this game is a gorgeous place and there are tons of places to visit and blow up. There doesn't seem to be any interiors, but that is fitting for a game so beautiful with good traversal diversity.\n\nThe controls are deep, but they allow you to do a lot more than your average over the shoulder sandbox shooter. You have your standard, run, jump, gunfire, reload, grenade, toggle guns, toggle grenades buttons, but you also have the infamous grapple hook. This hook is what the Bionic Commando reboot was missing. Double pressing it will send you instantly zipping to wherever it latched onto. Traversal is made super easy, climbing up buildings with the hook, but not just that, but you have a parachute that is used to glide around. Simply hit the jump button while in the air to deploy the chute. Pressing and holding the grappling hook will grapple something, but then when you hold it, aim at something else and release the button, you've now tethered two things together, which results in hilarity. Tether a moving car to the ground, to watch the car flip over. Tether a NPC to a rocketing propane tank and watch them blast off. Not just that, but there is plenty of car combat. Normal games would have you just get in a car, not this game, you can get on top of the car to shoot things, or you can slip down in front or behind the car to shoot things using the car for cover as its moving. You can take over moving vehicles, with easy quick time events that show a struggle instead of just kicking a person out from behind the wheel.\n\nCombat is pretty easy, you just aim the cursor and fire. There is no aim button, if your cursor is remotely near anyone or anything, you will see a red highlight around the logical target. So if you the player have terrible aim, Rico Rodriguez will still shoot the target. In terms of holding guns, you can hold one two handed gun and two one handed guns. There are throwable explosives and you can toggle between two types. You can also melee enemies with the grappling hook.\n\nWith so much control freedom, you can tackle missions any way that you want. Such as a car chase mission where you need to escort the driver, do you grappling hook vehicle to vehicle, taking out enemies and struggling to knock out the driver? Do you tether the other vehicles to the ground and watch them crash, or do you use your parachute to hover over the action and blow up the other vehicles? The choice is yours. It is an excellent game to do what you want.\n\nMissions themselves give you easy to follow objectives as if they were steps to follow. Open the gate, take out that rocket launcher, take out those snipers, pick up that item, grapple onto that helicopter, and so on. The objectives are marked with red and easily found with how far away they are. If you try to deviate too far from a mission location, the game will warn you and start a 10 second counter. This keeps the intensity on and prevents people like me from exploiting things.\n\nOutside of missions, there are plenty of things to do and they're all marked on your map. Well you need to visit the location marked on your map before you find what it is there to do. Things such as races, time trials, destroy bases and loot villages. Destroying locations and looting villages each has a percentage attached to it. To loot a village, you need to find 100% of things hidden there. Things like vehicle parts, weapon parts, cash boxes and even liberate the village from propaganda buses. Thankfully when you get near something findable, it will show up pointing out where you are, but you need to be very near it. This saves you from detailed searching. It is the same for ammo boxes and health cabinets.\n\nAs for the bases, you need to find things and blow up things such as towers, generators, gas tanks, communication towers and surface-to-air missile launchers, each will make up 100%. It is fun for explorers to seek out every nook and cranny, but I can understand if getting 100% would feel like a chore.\n\nWhen you create chaos or break any sort of law, the local military will be sent after you. At first it'll be simple things hunting you down, but if you keep creating chaos, your 'heat' level will go up and more soldiers will come after you. How do you reduce your heat level? Hide. Yep hide in the jungle and after time your red heat will go to orange heat and start dropping down. This is good for keeping the focus on what you were doing before you created heat. With plenty of jungle in the game, it is pretty easy to ditch any heat you might have.\n\nSadly the enemies feel pretty dumb. No one takes cover when you're putting bullets into them, even if enemies are next to cover, but I guess people play for the fun of doing what they want, not the challenge. In car chases enemy vehicles will just ram other objects. It leads to some laughable moment. They'll just drive off cliffs when you hit the brakes. I can understand scripted events like running into a gas station, but otherwise it is hilariously bad.\n\nThe game is pretty easy even on normal with regenerating health. Not just that, but health pickups from cabinets seem well placed. If you die, you go to the last checkpoint. Sometimes the checkpoints are further back than you think, but that's the only thing that really presents a punishment in the game.\n\nThe real downside to the game is that it seems to crash once every few hours back to the desktop. Luckily the game has an autosave feature.\n\nTo top all of that off, there is a free Multiplayer MOD that allows every player into one world together for chaos to ensue. Is it worth $15? Sure.... but it has been on sale before at $2.50. Keep that in mind.","August 26, 2014","true","7.8"," 78 of 86 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","78","86","0","0"

I've played for 11 hours and only scratched the tip of the surface of the upper crust of how much there is to offer.  One of my go to games when I want to blow stuff up.\n\nThe game can get a bit repetitive, but come on who doesn't have fun crawling into an attack helicopter and laying waste to the world.

From the ridiculous story, to the mechanics, to the all-out action, to the cheesy characterisations, this game is 100% ludicrous good fun.\n\nIt's at its best when you're in the middle of the action with explosives and vehicles erupting left right and  centre - there is certainly no shortage or vehicles, weapons, explosive tanks, and enemies to engage with. Do you want to surf a 747? You can. Do you want to fly as high as possible and then just skydive for a nice 5 or 6 minutes? You can. Do you want to hijack a chopper mid-air and use it to destroy an oil refinery just for the thrill of it? You can. This is up there as one of the most fun sandbox games to date.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the world is pretty shallow, and for all the locations and collectibles, the breadth of the gameplay is fairly limited. It's not a living, breathing world like the GTA worlds - the environment (which looks wonderful and varied enough in terms of climate and locations) is inhabited by people without personalities, and who exist only to be shot at, blown up, or otherwise maimed. The missions are compelling to a degree, although there is a degree of repetition in the faction missions that would become grating if the action wasn't so fun. However, I didn't at any point on XBOX or PC find myself compelled to 100% the game, as this involves hours of repetition with little tangible reward. This is felt the most when the end-game is at hand, and there's not a lot to motivate you to play beyond the completion of the missions.\n\nThe story isn't very compelling or coherent, but it is bad to the point of *almost* coming around to good again, of which credit should be given to the writers for just going with it (a climactic battle that happens while clinging to a ballistic missile in flight?!). However, the dialogue itself is pretty bland and boring, and the sense of humour that they're going for doesn't always hit the mark.\n\nIn summary, the JC2 is huge and stunningly beautiful, and the action is ever-present and very fun, which makes this a vast improvement over its predecessor, and lets it stand apart from the other open-world games of its time. In saying that, it lacks the personality of the world that GTA nailed, and the sense of humour that Saints Row did so well, which leaves it feeling comparatively empty at its core. However, if you're looking for spectacle, the game is well-priced and looks amazing, and there's a lot you can do and see in this game that can't be found elsewhere.\n\nFor the price, I highly recommend it.","October 4, 2014","true","31.3"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","88","35","40","4","3"

It was what I understood as a quality game experience, as early as the first announcements for JC3 were announced I would be scanning Steam store for a possible entry, without success. Now, easily 3 years since those announcements; I receive the SQUARE ENIX e-mail declaring the new Just 'Cause 3 is coming soon.\n\nI am excited; Just 'Cause 2 was to me in "shootemup" terms what Assassin's Creed is for "hack'n'slash". I found it awesome,\nvery playable [in-fact some of the first DLC I ever purchased online was from Just 'Cause 2]. I also recall my reaction seeing this could not be played on XP operating systems.\n\nIt would be unfair ignoring Just 'Cause 1 , like with Witcher 1, I was largely impressed with Just 'Cause 1; not as much THOUGH. I prefer Just 'Cause 2 more than 1, and I prefer Witcher 1 more than Witcher 2 [Just 'Cause 1 & Witcher 1 feel the same in game-play although the one is medieval and the other more modern-day].  The quality of Just 'Cause 2 was high, or HD [high definition], like AC1 and onward. That's WHAT caught my attention with Just 'Cause 2! The qaulity today of this game is very high.\n\nThis game got me excited about ALAN WAKE games (they look alike).\nThen gratefully, square enix integrated our hero [Rico Rodriguez] into other games like Sleeping Dogs, his clothing and handgun, like Adam Jensen of Deus Ex into Hitman Absolution and Tomb Raider.\n\nAt the time of release,\nI understand THIS game to be one of the Pioneers of HD 3rd person gaming.\nThankfully,\nthese days we are now receiving feeds from XBOX,\nlike Ryse:Son of Rome.\nSo this sort of thing is more common.\n\nHighlights\n-DLC jetpack parachute, (great toy)\n-Grapple hook abilities,\n-Open World with lot's to discover\n-check out the little scorpions running around Panau\n-in anticipation of Just 'Cause 3\n\n\nGame on  :-)","February 18, 2015","true","191.0"," 40 of 49 people (82%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","82","40","49","8","2"

It is the sequel to the 2006 video game Just Cause.\n\nThe player is free to roam the game's open world, not having to focus on the game's storyline. Progress in the game is measured with Chaos, which is earned by completing missions, destroying government property, collecting items for the factions and reaching 100% completion in settlements and military bases. Chaos unlocks new agency missions and stronghold takeovers. Chaos and stronghold takeovers expand the factions' area of influence, which unlocks faction missions and race challenges.\n\nInitially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, the player encounters a black market supplier, from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased, with an option to have them delivered to the player's location via helicopter. As more Chaos is gained, additional weapons, vehicles, and the extraction option become available on the black market. All weapons and vehicles on the black market have parameters that can be upgraded in several steps, by building upgrades with weapon and vehicle components found within the game world. There are over 2,000 parts that the player can acquire.\n\nOverall by my experience, this Game is a Must-Have so I would Rate it:\n\nRate 11/10","June 23, 2015","true","1.6"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","32","37","4","0"

To me, it collides beatifulness of sights, marvels of almost supernatural flights, and uglyness of c.i.a. operative agenda. For sandbox game, it looks almost perfect.\n\nBut I'll start from bad side.\nStory are weak, alike with any subsequent missions of "Just cause", and it's because of game pattern - CIA operative wreaking havoc and destruction on peaceful countryside for USA profit and domination. That's a little more complicated than muscling drug deals, car thefts and bank robbing, like usual gta-like stuff, don't you think? Ok, there was "Mercenaries" and brilliant "the Saboteur", and I liked them! But in those games you were aiming primarily to military objects, and were penalized for civilian casulties. Conscience sleeps well on that. But as for "just case", you blowing power and water supplies in cities and villages. You are coherently destroing all of life-suppoting communications in country for such irrelevant aim as "chaos". Oh, and for drug deals - which CIA operative ever don't get envolved in that? Worse than that is only agenda of "Prototype" game, where civilians are just food, and only thing protagonist cares about is himself. But enough of that.\n\nQuestion is - is it playable?\n\nNo doubt! There are so many strong points by those this game, shipped 5 years ago, are still no.1!\n\nGame process itself feels very, very exciting, especially if you like big size deals in sandboxes. Landscapes looks great, greater than in recent Far Cry 3. And you can fly it over and over, by rotary planes, jets, helicopters and on your own by magic "always ready" parachute combined with grappling hook (powered with same magic of everediness). Array of climat zones, from tropican seasides to the coldest highs of mountains, jungles, skyscraper cities, farms and villages, monasteries, industrial zones, even "mile-high" floating casino. Variety of cars, boats, guns... and plenty of space and challenges to enjoy it.\n\nGenerally, its a top-high gta-like sandbox game, made for freeriding. And you know many people who likes GTA definetly that way - way of freeride skirmish. Buy it on occasion and have fun with it, when you feel rush for flying or blowing things.\n\nOverall 7.5/10 (only for lack of good story and abomination of CIA agenda)\n\nPlus 10/10 chaos points for multiplayer!

If you finished everything, just spend your time driving around the massive map, finding all the eastereggs like Pie Island, The Bubble Gun, or the Hot Air Balloon. The possibilities in this game is damn near endless.\nThe story was great, wasn't too long and wasn't too short, was definitely worth doing regardless of people not even doing the story in the first place.\nI cannot recommend this game enough and can be toyed with for hours.\nI am so very hyped about Just Cause 3 which is coming out in 2015.\nIf you do not have this game already, it is usually on sale for less then $6 USD and rarely stays $15.\nIf you want a game to mess around with when you have no internet.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualVictory/recommended/8190/","VirtualVictory","VirtualVictory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualVictory/","83 products in account","Just Cause 2 takes place in South East Asia on the Panau islands. You play the role of a man named Rico Rodriguez sent to track down a dangerous American. However, in order to get the information you need you work with the 3 rebel/criminal factions, the Reapers, the Roaches and the Ular boys against the country's oppressive government.\n\nJust Cause 2 is a beautiful game, sure, but looking back I honestly would want to take the over 100 hours I spent on completing this game to 100% back. It's a grind fest, all Just Cause 2 consists of is collecting weapon parts, vehicle parts and destroying a number of things to reach 100% completion in any given settlement. There isn't very much replayability once you've completed every settlement to 100%.\n\nAspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Praising\n● Destructive environments. The majority of trees and shacks in the environment will come tumbling down if you use explosives or crash into them with a vehicle.\n\n● Creative transportation. The idea of using a parachute while using your grappling hook to slingshot your way across the landscape it quite creative and exclusive to Just Cause 2. I often find this method of transportation superior to using conventional land vehicles.\n\n● Plenty of vehicles to drive! Cars, bikes, atvs, boats, helicopters and planes are all in this game.\n\n\nAspects of Just Cause 2 Worth Criticizing\n● No licensed music. You often take licensed music in other open world games for granted but after playing through Just Cause 2 for over 105 hours, it makes you realize that it's the only thing keeping you sane. It couldn't have cost that much to license music from obscure artists or at least implement a feature where you can manually install music tracks and listen to them through your PDA while you're zipping around Panau, could it?\n\n● Horrid voice acting. It's debatable but it can only be seen clearly if you have experienced a multitude of other products to compare. Personally, I see it better than Ride to Hell Retribution although Bolo Santosi and the npcs you have to escort through stronghold take overs are the cringe worthy.","November 18, 2014","true","111.7"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Ridiculous action sequences, over-the-top explosions, and lots of angry Pinoy infantry.\n\nThe Gameplay is split up between freeform exploration including cars and bikes, planes, boats, helicopters and skydiving (with unlimited butt parachutes for paragliding purposes, complements of Uncle Sam) and a little bit more structured missions with objectves that need to be checked off before the mission can proceed towards completion. How you go about these objectives (neutralize targets, rescue VIP's, capture locations or vehicles) is often left up to you, provided you don't stray too far from a designated mission area. Weapons are multitudinous and varied; your standard assault rifles, pistols and submachine guns as well as rocket launchers, grenades, triggered explosives, and the more exotic hookshot weapon which allows you to attach opponents to the ceiling, a vehicle, or each other, as well as move around quickly in both horizontal and vertical movement.\n\nThe Story revolves around Rico Rodriguez, spy and mercenary hired by the US (off the record, of course). Your job: Cause chaos and destruction across the tiny island nation of Panau, whose new president Baby Panay (Yes, seriously) has started to isolate the nation and build up the Panauan military. This has caused the purposely nebulous Agency to be called in, to destabilize the nation and install a puppet for a head of state. It is all utterly ridiculous, stock Bond novel stuff with lots more explosions and thankfully less Bond-babe-bedding. The fact that all of this terrorism carried out in the name of the US turns out to all be because of the newly discovered and massive Panau oil fields, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. All of that blood on your hands, and it was simply to protect national fuel interests.\n\nIn Conclusion\n\nPlay this game:\n* If you're looking for a fun, light, free-form experience\n* For the flying mechanics\n* Because explosions.\n* For the graphics. Visually, this game is a marvel. Prettiest environments and ambient effects in any game of its generation!\n\nDon't play this game:\n* For the story. So asinine, so childish, so ripped from better sources\n* For the voice acting. Egregious examples: Bolo Santosi, Tom Sheldon and military radio ops.\n* If you like a challenge. As a long-time "casual" player, I find most missions a breeze right up until the end\n* For the missions. Where the game really shines is freeform exploration and combat. Clear out a base, will ya!","August 20, 2015","true","117.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","16","18","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/recommended/8190/","dons20","TRU±PlayMaker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dons20/","569 products in account","IntroductionJust Cause 2 is an amazing, open-world sandbox-esque game with breathtaking visuals and massive explosions to boot. This game takes a lot of what makes a game like Grand Theft Auto good, adds a grappling hook, and puts in much more destruction into the world. If for some reason you're getting this game instead of Just Cause 3, then you're still going to have an awesome time.\n\nPlease note that I have played this game for quite a long time before I owned it on Steam so my hours do not match up with my actual game time.\n\nGameplay\nStory\nYou are Rico Rodriguez, your typical badass gun with a gun (and a grappling hook). Set after the events of the first game, you're essentially trying to overthrow this evil dictator and confront your old mentor. I'll state right off the bat, that the first game sucks, and the story in the first and second games sucks as well. Where the GTA series has had a pretty good storyline, Just Cause didn't get that bit right yet. You are likely not going to be very interested in the story if at all, and it's fairly tedious to do the missions for reasons I'll explain later on. On the off chance you do like the story, there are some interesting missions and places you have to go, which are honestly pretty fun. But just know, the story isn't the selling point of this game.\n\nCombat & Exploration\nWhat you will most likely play Just Cause 2 for, is the insanely explosive combat, and the highly immersive, open world that it provides. From the open seas, to densely populated towns. From the cold mountain peaks, to the warm valleys below; this game has it all. I've played countless times just simply free-roaming and admiring the beauty of every environment. But what's a beautiful environment without some kick-♥♥♥ explosions am I right?\n\nJust Cause 2 features a variety of weapons and vehicles at your disposal. Simply order a drop from your handy black market supplier, or raid a base and steal all their weapons and grab your favourite car from anyone you see. The choice is yours. Combine all this with your multi-use grappling hook, and you can quickly imagine all the possibilities in game. Don't like a soldier looking at you funny? Hook him to your car and take him for a ride. Need a lift? Hook your car to an airplane before it takes off. Two guys, one gun? Hook them together and let the magic happen itself. :^)\n\nMy only concern with the weapon/vehicle system was that it felt a bit difficult to acquire the exact weapon/vehicle you wanted. The drop system was very expensive and income was very slow. For a sandbox style game, it felt very anti-sandbox to have those limits in the game. Just Cause 3 has fixed this issue. But don't let that deter you, there is a lot of raw fun to be had in this game, and you'll spend hours in it just trying out everything your mind can imagine.\n\nMultiplayer\nMost people play the multiplayer mode, which is a free DLC to obtain on Steam. If you thought single-player was fun, you're definitely going to love multiplayer. It's everything in single-player multiplied by the number of players in the game.\n\nVisualsFor a game released in 2010, Just Cause 2 is beautiful. The graphics hold up extremely well and even surpass a lot of games that are out right now. It's very well optimized and will run on almost anything that isn't over 2 years old at this point. Explosions are stunning, while skydiving gives you the sense of speed that it should as you plummet into the earth/sea at super high speeds, only to pull your parachute at the last second and admire the spot where you would have died instead.\n\nAudioMusic is okay, sound effects are pretty great, voice-overs suck. Much of the audio isn't really the selling point of Just Cause 2. I feel like there could have been more here, but at least the sound-effects carry it most of the time. You'll be entertained quite a bit, but you may notice that there is definite room for improvement.\n\nSummaryJust Cause 2 is one of the best games of its time, and is still insanely fun even now. Its graphics hold up extremely well and has one of the largest game maps in existence. Whenever you tire of playing alone, the free multiplayer dlc will add countless hours of fun once again, and will lead to some of the best moments in gaming. Despite a few sub-par aspects of the game (story, voice-acting, etc), this is a game you will have endless hours of fun in, and you'll barely remember anything negative about the game.\n\nIf you like a really good open-world game with super-fun gameplay, look no further than Just Cause 2.\n\n9/10 - Must buy.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

This is the first "Open World" game with guns I've really liked and therefore, I can't understand some of the negative reviews here. However, if you know more about sandbox games than me, you should probably not read on (or leave a negative comment).\n\nwhat's this crap all about?Well, the game doesn't really have much of a story line. You play as Rico Rodriguez and go on an undercover mission to find out the truth about your corrupt island. While you're doing the short 7 missions, you might as well just end up destroying your entire world. ...just 'cause.\n\nplayingAfter having completed the basics, you can embrace the awesome scenery of the island (my GTX 660 can run it on ultra). Although the game is older than 6 years now, the graphics look great and some of today's games should really be jealous. The screenshots on steam ain't lying! And now, your adventure is only just beginning. While doing the obligatory running job for your mafia bosses, you can wreak havoc in every city and village, destroy statues and blow up gas stations, win car races and do awesome stunts on your bike. You can climb the highest mountain or fly there, because you've got a friend working for the black market who'll supply you with anything your heart desires... if you've got the necessary cash, of course. come on, nothing is free in this world, dude.\n\nThe map consist of several interlinked locations and you'll need to discover them before you can fast travel. In every city, village, whatever it may be, you can find parts for the market which can then be bought, i.e. you may want to get that fighter jet one day. Keep looking, babe. You just need to open more boxes. If you have a look at the steam achievements, you can already get a good overview over what the game has to offer. Destroying objects with whatever you've got, killing the military in countless ways, and driving your ♥♥♥ sore. Let's get to this new location! Flying? No, I'd rather use my hook like Tarzan and walk on foot.\n\nwhy you should buy this gameif you've ended up here, you probably have your reasons. maybe you've heard about the fps drops with the latest Just Cause (3), or maybe you just want to feel nostalgic (like I did), you're probably right here. if you're looking for a sandbox game with little story and the opportunity to do just whatever the hell you want to do, this is the right thing. it will run smoothly on anything similar to GTX 660, and if you're fan of blowing up stuff, you won't be disappointed. Just keep in mind that the choices lie with you. if you get bored playing this game, you may not be used to the freedom this game provides you with. This is not Skyrim and the game is not about the story. I recommend playing 30min every day and keep enjoying the game, because, certainly, not everybody will enjoy playing this for 10 hours straight. Know what you're getting into, man (girl?). I play it for the sexy butts.","May 21","true","28.7"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","13","13","2","0"

Just Cause 2 is a beautiful, fun and surprisingly well optimized rampage through a massive world that easily puts even MMORPGs to shame.  You can go anywhere, steal anything and the destruction of both property and watching a car you just tethered to a windmill as it tumbles through the air is beefy and satisfying.  The grappling hook in the game is easily the best tool in gaming since HL2's Gravity Gun, if not better.  It aids in traversing terrain easily, providing a ride when combined with your unlimited stunt parachute, or in combat with clever, hilarious ways using classic grappling, or tethering two things together, including people.

Ignore the hours on my record, I played this game for hundreds more on the PS3.Why do I love it you may ask? Let me tell you a story of something that happened completely dynamically, as well as a pros and cons review of Michael Bay's Wet Dream: The Video Game\n~~~\nI had just purchased a rocket launcher that could fire four rockets at once from the black market. With this i decided to have a bit of fun. I was parachuting along when i saw a gas station, which i promptly blew up. The military then sent two squad cars and a man on a mortorcylce. I hopped on top of one care where a man was hanging out of the side shooting at me. I shot a grappling hook into his chest and tethered him to the other car where he was dragged along and ran over by a taxi cab. I rode on top of this car, shooting at the other car when i leaped onto the miltary motorcylce that was following us, tossing the soldier onto the ground so he could get run over by one of his fellow soldiers. I rode this away until i reached a four way intersection where i set several cars around, making my base. Everytime a car drove towards me i'd blow it up with the rocket launcher. This went on until I heard a radio signal saying "We are dropping like flies! Send air support!",  which is when I knew that the fun was only beginning. I grappled onto the first helicopter i saw, with a man hanging off of the side and shooting at me. I shot him in the face then threw the driver out onto the ground. I then began attacking their other helicopters with my own. This was only the beginning.\nAnother two helicopters showed up, these ones with heat seaking missiles. I was shot down and parachuted into a nearby jungle. A couple men on motorcycles chased me into the forest where i was riding a bike of my own, zig-zagging through the trees. This chase continued until we reached a cliff. I drove off the cliff and gracefully leaped off of the flaming bike and soared through the air. I landed on a nearby highway where some rebels were attacking more miltary. I ran up to join in the fight when i got shot with a shotgun once, killing me and ending my run.\n\ntl;dr I was badass.\n~~~\nPROS:\n+Beautiful asthetically speaking.\n+COLOSSAL map.\n+Fun, action packed gameplay.\n+Cheesy and hilarious(ly bad) dialogue (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).\n+Cheesy story (intentionally so as to bring back memories of cheesy 80's action B movies).\n+Lots of easter eggs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/8190/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nJust Cause 2 was my first experience with a  "third-person action shooter". I enjoyed the quality, the way I describe the game is with the following formula: Skyrim plus Grand Theft Auto multiplied by Explosions/Torgue minus any type of interesting story whatsoever, and let's throw in terrible airplane controls on a keyboard to boot!\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Welcome to Panau, you are Rico Rodriguez, a spy in the service of the United states. Or as I like to call him "the stereo typical action hero". Playing through this game I didn't look at most of the explosions so I did a good job being a badass. As you progress through the story you end up helping three factions lead an uprising in Panau against the current dictator "Baby".\nAs far as "Just Causes" go, I wouldn't call this game anywhere near a just cause, the only time that I was impressed with the game was at the end of the main story where the hero does something that I could actually respect and gave a pretty good reason for it. Other then that I heard enough "Merica!" "Because Freedom!" "Because secret agents!" "Rico do this action hero thing" "Uncle Sam" lines to make me want to eat the American Flag. Because Patriotism!\nIf I haven't made it clear, I found the story very dull and boring, I was looking forward to finishing the story because then I can free roam all around this massive map and blow stuff up. More on free roaming in the Game Play section!\n\nGame Play: First a few notes about the controls. They are a little tricky to get used to, I found myself struggling to figure out what cover I can hide behind, and I would accidently jump out of vehicles or off objects trying to find the right move. This could be mostly to blame for being a Keyboard and mouse gamer.\nThe strongest controls for the game is the combination of the parachute and grappling hook. There were numerous times that I would shout to my siblings in the other room "I'm spider man with a hang-glider!" because that's just how the controls felt, but it was very fun and never gets dull soaring around in the sky with the occasional shot to pull me forward.\nPlease pause for a moment in loving memory of "Atratzu who tried to fly a plane... and crashed, like several hundred times..."    Mmmmkay, the controls for the planes are terrible, I crash like it's my job too.\nOkay now for the quality that made this game shine: Free roaming. I have always loved freedom in a game to do pretty much whatever I want, the story doesn't last very long on this game you can wrap stuff up in a day and have the main story done. to get 100% in the world... I cannot imagine doing it, there's just so much to explore and blow up.\nThe OCD 100% completionist part of my brain is exploding while I play this game because there's so much to explore, collect, and blow up. I really do love that type of quality in a game, I loved it in skyrim, I love it in Just Cause 2.\n\nAchievements: The achievements in this game often times require you to do things you wouldn't usually think to do. I never tired to drag someone behind my car with my grapple hook...  or string someone up against a wall and then shoot him to death. So the achievements are dynamic and interesting. But of course there are the standard achievements too: beat the game on this difficulty, do all these quests, complete the story, get 75% completion, etc.\n\nPrice: Just Cause 2 is $14.99, I've played a total of 38 hours (as of 09/05/14) that is a very good price, but as always I recommend waiting for the game to go on sale. I bought this game in a humblebundle, the quality is outstanding for the amount I paid. And there's no way I'm close to finished with this game. I imagine the game will rack up near to 50+ hours. I intend to come back to it to keep playing over time.\n\nConclusion: I felt like I was in a terrible action movie where everything is over the top, which at first I wanted to call out on the game... but it was doing it on purpose. So why insult something that's trying to be over the top? In the end I fell in love with the game.\nRegardless of the terrible annoying story (in my opinion, it was terrible and annoying, some people probably loved it and thought it was deep with metaphoric meaning.), sometimes clunky keyboard controls... all the terrible fireball-plane crashes I had... I still will keep coming back for more. I think this game is worth a buy and playing at least for a little bit.\nThis game is probably best suited for people who like action games of any kind, the 3rd person perspective might catch you by surprise, so don't expect sniping or any scopes: all you have are cross hairs. If you know you like action games, and like free roaming with a parachute and grappling hook, this game is right up your alleyway.\n\nEdit/Update 11/12/14 - All achievements earned after playing for about 90 hours.","September 5, 2014","true","89.4"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","2"

Mainly because my computer has always had issues with it, and Just Cause 2 pretty much improves the first game in all levels. Just Cause 2 is a third-person action game, and when I say action game I mean crazy jumping-from-airplanes-and-blowing-up-cities - sort of an action game. Rico, the protagonist, is like James Bond on steroids. You can pretty much do whatever you want, in a world at least twenty times (!) bigger than San Andreas, and five times bigger than World of Warcraft.\n\nPick your vehicle; helicopter, airplane, sports car, moped, tuk tuk etc. and pick a random location; beach, jungle, city, highway, mountain etc. to ram, stunt, blow up, crash, projectile etc. with it. Or just hook yourself to someones boat and enjoy the eyecandies of this tropical paradise. Or hook the same guy's boat into an airplane, and see him take off. Or hook the airplane to a skyscraper and see it torpedo into a ball of flames. Your choice.\n\nThe grappling hook, amongst other things, is what lift this game up from the pleasant, boring and realistic open-world games. You can use this Godly thing to pretty much survive any situation. Are you falling from insane height? No problem, just hook towards the ground and survive - Or just precipitate your parachute, that works too. It lacks actually physics though, you can't use your hook to decapitate moped drivers for example, a feature that I would want for Just Cause 3!\n\nSure the game is far from being realistic and serious, but with great looks, insanely huge map and more vehicles and weapons than you can count - who cares if it's unrealistic? You can stand on a plane while towing another one mid-air, for God's sake! I completely recommend this title if you are even remotely intersted in action, open-world and/or just plain time-consuming roaming and freedom. There is currently a third-party mod in the works, adding Multiplayer. It adds a whole new meaning to the already balls-chaotic world, and makes it go beyond the edge.\n\nPick this game up, if you have not already! It's been on a billion sales.","December 7, 2012","true","83.5"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtnapalm/recommended/8190/","sgtnapalm","Cherchez la Steak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgtnapalm/","272 products in account","Just Cause 2 is one of the most enjoyable games I’ve ever played, with nearly every piece of this game resonating with me on some level. From the narmy, b-movie aesthetic with stereotypical characters who love nothing more than to chew the scenery and a plot that seems like it was lifted directly out of a James Bond rip-off; to a stunningly beautiful, gargantuan tropical paradise to explore and destroy at my own pace; and finally to the ludicrous over-the-top action that unfolds at every single skirmish, this game left an indelible mark on me that few games have come close to matching.\n\nWhile the game’s story is about as shallow as it comes and lasts for only a handful of hours if you really wanted to push through the story, that’s not where the game’s fun lies; exploring, experimenting, and eradicating all that stands in your way at your own pace is the true joy. The game is absolutely massive; it will be dozens of hours before you even came close to completing a mere half of the map. Unfortunately, you may find this tedious after a while as many of the bases and villages are duplicates of each other. Thankfully, each quadrant of the island has a different aesthetic to it, from the sweltering, arid deserts to the bustling metropolitan areas to the snow-capped mountains to the tropical shores, the nation of Panau seems to have a little bit of everything. This will help to take the tedium out of the game.\n\nYou will be wanting to spend time on this island, too. I cannot stress how wonderful and truly massive it feels; clocking it at roughly four hundred square miles, Panau is easily the largest world I’ve ever seen in an action video game. And while the visual style is not photorealistic, it does an absurdly exceptional job at creating a sense of scale. When skydiving for the first time, I was breathtaken at how small I felt in relation to the rest of the world.\n\nThis feeling will never quite go away, even after hundreds of skydives. You will be doing a lot of skydiving; the parachute and grappling hook was my de-facto method of map traversal. It is a ludicrous way to travel in a ludicrous game; the larger-than-life action will be sure to excite. You can creatively destroy all that stands in your way through a combination of traditional weapons and vehicles to some non-traditional gadgets, such as the aforementioned grappling hook and some special secret agent toys to pilot and shoot. Shooting out tires, tethering enemies to moving cars and rockets, C4 detonations, and high-speed car chases where you rapidly negotiate your way around several still moving cars will become the commonplace.\n\nWhile the paper-thin excuse plot and repetitive nature of the game may leave a bad taste in many players’ mouths, I believe that the gorgeous environment and exciting action as well as the ability to set your own pace means that this game has definitely become one of my favorite games of all time.","December 1, 2013","true","83.6"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

This is the first of many reviews to come about the latest installments of franchises that are coming back in the near future.\n\nSTORYYou play as Rico Rodriguez, one of the Agency's main operatives, as he is sent to the island of Panau to oust Panay from office, as well as track down and assassinate his old mentor, Tom Sheldon, who the Agency fears has gone rogue after disappearing during the regime change. In order to find Sheldon, Rico allies himself with the three dominant criminal gangs on the island: the Roaches, an organized crime syndicate, the Reapers, an insurgent Socialist militia and the Ular Boys, an ultranationalist rebel group that espouses traditionalism and opposes foreign influence.\nThe story is over-the-top and the dialogue is really cheesy. The story serves only to justify you being a terrorist who destroys power plants, ventilation systems, dams, military bases and many more objects. Save for a few moments in the 7 Story Missions, it is not memorable.\n\nGRAPHICSEven though it has been 5 years since the game was first released, it still looks damn great on PC: the island is colourful, the explosions are vibrant, the draw distance is long and the water feels realistic. The only things that have always been the problem with the game are the facial textures and animations. Other than that, you will have a gorgeous experience that will run at 60fps even on a toaster.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe goal is to cause as much chaos as you can by destroying military facilities and everything related to that. Right from the get-go you can explore the 400 square miles of Panau, discovering the 368 locations, engaging in high-speed chases by water, plane or car, hijacking enemy vehicles to crash into oil rigs... There is a lot of variety in what you can do and how.\nThe big game changer is the grappling hook, which can be used to gain speed while using your unlimited parachutes, to pull enemies from ledges, to attach a speeding vehicle to the ground so that it flies in the air, to attach an enemy to the ceiling and turning him into a human piñata, and so on. You can also carry three weapons (two sidearms, one big gun) and both grenades and sticky bombs.\nThere is the black market, which can be used to order and upgrade weapons and vehicles, or as a way to fast travel. But I strongly recommend that, because each time that you go from one place to the other, you are bound to find an hidden collectible, a new location, or a new badass vehicle that you hadn't tried already.\nThe side activities that you complete for the gangs are very similar to one another, and usually consist of escorting someone, finding an object in a base or destroying a base or two. There are also races that are varied and very fun to play.\nThe game is a ton of fun, and you won't regret the time you'll spend with it.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game tends to be very challenging even on the easiest settings, thanks to strong and numerous enemies that will pursue you, as well as an unforgiving checkpoint system in the missions.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is hugely underrated, but really strong and energizing, while the voice acting is one of the cheesiest since the original Resident Evil. But since it seems like they made that on purpose, I'll let it slide.\nThe sound effects are great, with clear distinctions from one gun to the other, and with some hugely satisfying explosions.\n\nREPLAYABILITYA huge map, tons of collectibles, multiple missions and 50 Steam achievements are bound to make you play this game for a long time to come, especially if you are waiting for Just Cause 3's release.\n\nOverall, this is a phenomenal game to play, with an amazing open world, fluid and varied combat, multiple collectibles, strong soundtrack and beautiful vistas. This is a game that I love, and I strongly recommend buying to everyone who loves action games.

It fixes all Stearing Issues,even planes are awesome to play with it!!!\n\nPro:\n-The Game has a HUGE(1000 square kilometres),beautiful and open Map.\n-The Story isn't innovative,but pretty funny and well made.\n-The Main Character is a cool,badass Agent who's always up for a Joke(ALWAYS!)!\n-There are tons of different Vehicles,from boats to cars,from helicopters to airplanes!\n-The controls are really easy to learn,after 10 minutes everybody should be able to play like an expert!\n-You can have it for 15€(About 20 Dollars!),and EVERYBODY has do admit that this is a hell of a low price!\n-You can waste hours just by running over the map and don't even start the Story(except for the first 2 Missions)\n-The Plane/Helicopter controls are awesome(except for the Si-47 Leopard Fighter Jet!)\n\nContra:\n-The car/bycicle controls are not really good,only a few vehicles have good controls!\n-The Missions get boring after a while because they are always the same.\n\nSo these were all the Points i had to say about the Game,and in my Opinion,it is definitely a Game everybody should own or at least had played it once!It is really fun,and it doesnt gets boring even after reaching 100% because of the huge Mod Community!\n\nI hope i could help you Guys with this Review!","December 23, 2013","true","50.9"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","2"

Thus making the combat in the game tiresome and irritating at times, seeing as you'll find your self sprinting for cover or looking for a health pack on a building more than you will be actually fighting.\n- Missions are redundant stronghold missions play out the same almost all the time, escort technician/demolitionist to point B, right off the bat the gate is down in the stronghold gotta open before you can proceed. Always ends in you protecting the technician from a barrage of enemies ending in the stronghold commander.","December 5, 2015","true","14.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","2"

It offers a huge area with different, let's say, "climatic zones". You will be able to visit a snowy land, a desert, islands and a temperated climate lands of Panau. What's more, there are a lot of villages and cities to explore, including the capital city. All this covered in well-made graphic going hand in hand with nice optimalization. Breathtaking landscapes were the best in my oppinion.\n\nRico, the protagonist, can use a lot of weapons to spread destruction and fire. Carabines, shotguns, grenade launchers, regular grenades... there are many of them, you will surely find one that's suitable for you.\nApart from the main campaign offering spectacular missions that are like from the best action movies, there are a lot of sidequests connected with different factions of Panau. I won't tell you their names as for I don't want to spoil.\n\nIn the beginning of this review I wrote "in general I can recommend...". I wrote it, because it's true, but not only. I'd like to write about some things I didn't like. Firstly, many missions that are repetitive and make you think as if you were doing it for another time. Second thing - from circa middle part from the game it got boring for me. It takes too much time to get destruction points to unlock next main quest and exploring is not as appealing as it was before.\nI haven't played multiplayer yet, so I won't write about it, although I heard from my friends that it's good.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are more positives about this game than negatives, that's why I can boldly recommend it as a good, well-made and beautiful looking product.","March 21, 2015","true","27.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

You never know what to expect from the locales , or if the stuff you are currently eating includes 1 or more domestic animals inside it.\n\nStory:\n\nThe Game has you starring as Rico, formerly known as "Scorpio", an buff, stereotypical white latino.Your job is being a ♥♥♥♥ to the self aclaimed new president "Panay", which is trying to distance panau, the island you play on, from the western world. He's doing that by the obvious way. Establishing his own dominance via painting every single combustable/explosive in his signature colours. Red and white. Why that is important ? You wont ask me again when you have already read this review further. Your Job is trying to "Liberate" Panau for 'murica'.Doing that is quite easy. Blowning up gas containers, facilities, military bases, all nice stuff.\n\nGameplay:\n\nAs you can guess, the game doesnt take itself too serious, however, this might not be as much of an flaw, as you might imagine in the first place. Did I mention that Rico has a Grappling hook ? No ? Well, in the context of the "serious" plot, Scorpio has this weird ♥♥♥ thingy, that allows him to do ridiculous stuff, like attaching two enemies onto each other , and giggle at their frustration, as they get smashed against each other, trying to get the hook loose, that is piercing through their flesh. Sounds like fun, now doesnt it, you jerk ? Well, to be honest, it is. It's a blast. Using the grapling hook to pull yourself onto vehicles, get around, or just do the before mentioned with cars, planes, boats..you get the Idea. On top of it all, you get  the most reliable parachute in the world. Using it in combination with your personal zipping device, you can fly through the air to get to new places, extent your life by a few more seconds, or dodge great threats all together.\nAs for the goal of the game, your job is to cause chaos. You do that via the before mentioned blowing up of important infrastructures, that are all conveniently marked by Panays Signature colours. By doing that, you will unlock more Items for the so called Black market. A mysterious delivery service, that is run by the " Sloth demon", and delivers everything you could ask for in a game like this, like cars, weapons,planes  aswell as extracting you too any previously discovered location. With the right amount of chaos, you will constantly unlock new stuff to buy there, and  if you're lucky enough to dfin new vehicle/ weapon parts on your journey, you can even go as far as upgrading the Items you buy from him. Havent I told you, how much this abscense of a real story brightens up the game ? See ? Awesome.I sincerely wish that there were more games like this.\n\nGraphics and PC performance, mods, and tweaking:\n\nJust cause 2 is an relatively old game, as you might have guessed already.That however doesnt keep it from having a solid technical build quality. The environment look nice, especially in places with a lot of fauna, Ricos clothing is very detailed, and nothing clips through him (*Cough* Assassins Creed*Cough*) , and the draw distance is very nice.Surprisingly enough, the water is looking awesome, if you have an corresponding Nvidia Card. I sugest atleast having an GTX 280, because it´s rendered via cuda cores, but it runs just as well on AMd cards of the same quality. For a DirectX 10 Game, the lighting is very beatiful, and eyecandy such as Godrays enhances the overall experience.Panau is very detailed, and optic fidelity can be found everywhere. from the harsh mountain tops, that are covered in snow, to the green jungle,small villages, and deserts, the game looks absolutely gorgeous.It´s colourful, cramped with detail, and fun to play in.\n\nAs for the mod side of things, you can find a lot of interesting stuff besides all the cheats, vehicle, and weapon mods.\nGuessing that your PC is fast enough, I would sugest to Use Sweet FX, if I were you. Sweet Fx is a mod, which allows modern Anti Aliasing technologies, such as FXAA, and SGSSAA, to be forced into a game, which doesnt natively support said options. It also can be tweaked to your liking , and there are many user created presets for it, which enhance saturation, contrast, and overall optical Fidelity a lot.\n\nSpeaking of optical enhancers, how well does the game actually run ? To be honest, it runs like a charm. my GTX470 always can keep up smooth 60 Frames per second, while having sweet FX, and the ingame MSAA to work with.there is no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t frame cap, no forced Vsync, a nice Field of view, and advanced graphical options, to tweak the game to your liking.\n\nConclusion:\n\nJust Cause 2 delivers what it promises. Action without any compromises. It isnt held back by its serious plot, social commentary, or anything similar to those dfancy ♥♥♥ triple A Titles you always hear about. It´s just pure fun with an Story construct build beneath it. Did I even mention the multiplayer mod ? So far, all i can say is that I am really enjoying this game.\nIt was definitely worth every cent I spend on it, and I can only give my recommendation for it to you. If you enjoy mindless action, hilarious situations, and all out rampages, then this game is for you. buy it.\n\n9.5/10 for racist Asian accents.","June 23, 2014","true","31.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

My favorite character in the show was Twister, for his great haircut.  I was always so inspired by the show that I too decided to ride skateboards in the skatepark.  I went out and spent $700 on buying different wheels for my skateboard, and ended up choosing the one's that were blue, for they were my favorite color at the time.  I threw out the rest of the wheels and headed for the skatepark that was located about seven miles from my house.  It was a long walk, but I knew it would all be worth it.  After my arrival, I headed up for the biggest ramp and made my first attempt.  I fell face first because I didn't put the wheels on correctly and my nose cracked and was bent in the wrong direction.  There was blood gushing everywhere and I thought I was going to die.  I was unable to see out of my left eye, so I thought something had happened to that as well.  Some kid came up to me and pulled out his cell phone and started to dial 911.  An ambulence soon arrived and I was taken to the emergency room.  At this point, I had passed out, but was told the rest of the story.  I had a broken nose and my left eye was dangling out of my head by it's optic nerve.  The doctors at the hospital placed my eyeball back in place without any hygenic precautions.  Once it was back in place, it was soon discovered that there was multiple infections, and that I would have to have my eye removed.  As of today, I have a disformed nose and only my right eye.  However, Just Cause 2 is good, and you should buy this game.","November 28, 2015","true","0.3"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","59","29","49","38","5"

They all give you missions that consist most of the times in destroying huge military facilities. You can drive every single vehicle in the game and shoot pretty much every imaginable weapon. You also have a complete freedom on how to do the missions, although I don't think you can do them stealthy, I never tried, but if you buy this game you won't want to sneak around anyways.\nThe huge island the game takes place on is called Panau and you have every imaginable landscape on it. There is a desert, mountains, woods etc... All of these landscapes are accessable with the unique gadjet given to you: the graplehook. It allows you to climb and get wherever you want and is a great solution for such a complete game.\n\nThe best feature of the game however, is the multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/8190/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I've played Just Cause 2 originally on xbox 360 and put more than 20+ hours into it. Panau is a big beautiful island with lots to see and as Rico AKA The Scorpio as your tour guide. Rico is a mercenary looking for someone on the island and is drafted to help local gangs reign chaos in an attempt to complete his own personal mission.\n\nJust Cause 2 follows somewhat of a GTA game play scheme. Notable differences include driving and the obvious attachment of a hook shot / grapple. This grapple is what makes Just Cause, Just Cause. This thing can literally attach to anything within a certain distance. This includes automobiles, helicopters, buildings, boats, trees, mountains and literally anything you can think of. Upon grappling onto a car, Rico can perform "stunt jumps" in which he is able to maneuver himself on and around the car. This comes handy in case you are being fired at and need some extra cover. When attaching oneself to a helicopter, Rico can chill underneath or just like a car, attempt to hijack it. There are a few QTE (quick time events) that need to be performed in order to successfully high jack any moving vehicle. You can also grapple enemies if you're really feeling it. Alternatively, Rico can attach his grapple to two objects. Say you want to shoot at an explode-able object but it's not quite close enough to the enemies. Rico can shoot his grapple at the barrel and then attach it nearby or on the enemy. Once the barrel is shot and starts flying, the grapple will pull it towards the enemy. It's an extremely cool feature but with a few flaws. If you're trying to get cars that pass by to run into it, it doesn't really work. For one reason or another the game made it so you cannot simply have people running into the grapple. What you may do though is use it against cars or helicopters. Being chased? Not a problem. Attach to the car then attach to the road or any tree that's nearby and watch them flip. Driving is sort of it's own unique thing in the game. When the car is flipping over multiple times I like how they did that effect, but I do not like how they made the driving scheme. It seems a little stiff and controls sometimes don't react as you want them to. Shooting is quite basic in the game and auto-targeting seems welcomed.You may zoom in while shooting and even dual wield certain weapons. Weapons can be swapped for different weapons and three slots are available to fill up. Smaller automatics and pistols can swapped out for one another (one slot). Bigger shotguns or automatics can be switched (second slot). The third slot consists of grenades or C4 (both which can be carried at the same time). Shooting is decently fun but can get old. You can crouch and roll to evade fire from enemies but there is no real cover system. It would have been nice if they added something like Gears of Wars has in regards to taking cover. What is notable in this game is that lots can be blown up. Sadly, it's not on a Mercenaries 2 : world in flames sort of demolition (which I think to this date is still the best) but JC2 still has it's moments. There is fun in mindless violence of blowing entire enemy bases up (from radio towers, electrical stations, gas tanks, enemy vehicles and towers). What you can do damage to is sort of limited. In Mercenaries 2 you could blow up an entire oil rig. In JC2, that oil rig has only certain aspects you can take out. Whether this is good or bad is determined by you. By pressing down on the D-pad you may call up "the sloth demon" aka your personal distributor of weapons, vehicles and extraction if needed. They really gave the player a chance to enjoy a wide variety on their menu but most unlock only after a certain amount of progress has been made (be it collecting crates, completing missions or blowing government equipment up). Anything here also costs a pretty penny!\n\nThe game is known for it's beautiful graphics especially demonstrating the beauty of being able to encapsulate the entire island in the background. Even though it's not the next gen sort of graphics, it still provides for an enjoyable sight to see. The display for the weapon meters are excellently done. Even though you may run out of ammo a lot, you'll know exactly how much you have left.  Sounds are varied (explosions are finally sounding different) and comments are made by either Rico, enemies and even civilians. They organized the map in a way that is extremely easy to figure out where you are and where you want to go. They were even kind enough to indicate where potential hidden locations could be.\n\nOverall, a fantastic game. Even with a few minor flaws the gamer is sure to enjoy Just Cause 2.\n\n\nRATING : 7.9/10\n\nWould have been 8 if they fixed a few grappling issues. Not only that, if you hit a civilian full throttle in a truck they won't fall off their bike. They just bounce away in the air. Kinda weird ain't it?\n\n\nScreenShots\nDo you like helicopters\n\nBe quick on your toes when the QTE's turn up\n\nDo you like fighter planes\n\nThis is actually a lot funner than it looks\n\nDo you like commercial airliners that is on fire","January 17","true","4.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiihku/recommended/8190/","tiihku","kaaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tiihku/","110 products in account","A just cause of 'just because'.\nOne of the classical overly-explosive action games, this game is a great throwback to the old 80's Rambo-esque movies and mixes traditional third person destruction derby with open world (group of islands) adventure. A tropical GTA of sorts. The basic gameplay consists of destroying evil goverment's property, i.e. water and fuel supplies in random villages, races with every medium possible and both storyline and faction quests. As mentioned earlier, this game embraces the goofy righteousness and lets you wreak havoc upon both the goverment and its civilians with little difference.\n\nTechnically this game is a port from original PS3 game, but from my experience it runs great. Even on my laptop I had stable performance on lower graphical settings and the game looks still fantastic for a game of its age (in my mind that's yesterday).\n\nThe positive points of this game lie in it's great map design, freedom of gameplay done right (main story is there to create atmosphere and not to restrict features) and a certain kind of 'comfyness' if you're weird enough to get nostalgic about games of this era. (I could also talk about personal experiences I have when this game came out and I played a ton of it w/ my friend but buzzwords are way cooler.) I think Just Cause 2 does what it does so well that I'm probably never going to buy another game that tries to accomplish the same. (For me this is a big deal, especially since the third part of the series just came out)\nThere aren't much negative stuff for me to say. The game has it's bugs and flaws, but for me it would be such a nitpick on stuff that didn't affect my experience. It does what it promises well, but for people who want a more sensible plot and structural gameplay this might be a short experience.","April 17","true","58.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

I've never ever played yet at "bigger" world than Panau is. It's so big that Panau contains desert, jungle and snowy mountains. It'll take you at least 10 minutes to jet it over and at least 10 hours to walk it through.\n\nAnd complexity of things you can do there ? GTA Series are nothing in comparision with this. There're over 350 towns and villages, more than 120 military bases contains big airports, harbors, radar stations and other stuff. More than 100 cars and planes to drive. More than 2k items to collect. If you want to reach 100% completition, you gotta work out your ♥♥♥ and still won't reach that without modding the game because 6 items from 2k are missing...\n\nYeah, there are only 7 main missions without relevant story, but 49 faction missions, 50 challenges, 30 bridge limbing and another stuff which's not really important no name.\n\nTo make it short, this game is great.

This is a very good game, definitely worth it price. You have complete freedom over what you want to do, when you want to. The story was too short, the plot was terrible, and the voice acting was atrocious. You must also know that THIS IS A SANDBOX GAME. You make your own fun, and if you're creative enough, you'll love this game. Graphics: 10/10 Gameplay: 9/10 Fun factor: 10/10 Badassness: 10/10. Overall: 100000/10. I mean 10/10.\n\n[UPDATE]\nYeah...

Most gamers will tell you that the story is terrible, but it's actually not too bad, even if it IS very repetitive.\n\nThe thing with this game is the free roam open world gameplay. It has a feel of freedom like no other games ever. The "grappling hook+parachute" combo is terrific if you want to move quickly and easily. You can drive cars, boats, planes, helicopter, jets. You can grapple a statue head to an attack chopper, pilot the chopper, blow up a few fuel shafts on the run, drop the statue head on a car, aim the chopper to a tower, eject from the chopper, watch it blow the crap up, parachute down to the ground, pick up a RPG, blow the crap out of every car, plane, chopper, whatever, grapple to a car, go full speed on the highway until you reach a ramp, jump up to the sky, eject from the car, grapple to a plane, get the pilot out of his seat, take over with a grand ending with a beautiful sunset over Panau Island.","May 19, 2013","true","299.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","4"

You star as Rico Rodriguez, a man with the task of assassinating his former mentor who has turned crazy. Along the way you will meet several groups of revolutionary armies, such as the Reapers and the Ular Boys, who will send you on missions to hack military bases, takeover strongholds or assassinate colonels. The game is fast-paced and action packed. The main highlights of the game I found were the grappling hook and parachute. Rico is equipped with these from the get-go, and aiming at a certain spot on the ground with the grapple will send you flying off into that direction. Together with the easily deployable parachute, you hardly need cars to travel around the island of Panau.\n\nA minor downside to this game is the loading times. You will be left waiting awhile before entering the world, but is all worth it once in. One feature that is very helpful is the addition of the Black Market. Call for a chopper if you need weapons, vehicles or need to be flown to any previously discovered location (very helpful for Stronghold Takeovers). There are not an excessive amount of weapons in the game, ranging from the light and common pistol and submachine gun, to more powerful guns like shotguns and detached mounted guns (with insanely helpful infinite ammunition).\n\nThere are also a large array of vehicles available to steal and hijack, from the cheap rusty Tuk-Tuk all the way up to the Chevalier 999. You can also find tanks, fully loaded with unlimited ammo of guns and autocannons, as well as helicopters and planes with the like.\n\nOverall, Just Cause 2 is an aesthetically astounding, open world adventure, and Avalanche Studios has done an amazing effort at pulling off a gaming spectacle. If you like a game where one minute you are parachuting out of the sky and next minute you are speeding down the deserted Panauan highway with the cops on your tail, this game is for you. The amount of things to do and see are amazing, and I thoroughly enjoyed this game and will be playing it for a lot more hours to come.","January 3, 2014","true","80.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

However, I can say with 100% confidence that it is the most fun open-world game I have ever played in my entire life. Just Cause 2 holds this high honor on my personal favorites list for a number of reasons:\n\n1. Just Cause 2's world is breathtakingly beautiful. In my opinion, this makes it superior to any of the Grand Theft Auto game worlds, as they are gritty and urban, while the fictional Asian island of Panau is filled with lush tropical landscapes, barren deserts, and even snow-covered mountains.\n\n2. Just Cause 2's selection of vehicles is extremely eclectic, and all of the cars, boats, planes, motorcycles and helicopters are insanely fun to use. My personal favorite is the DLC addon "Tuk-Tuk Boom-Boom."\n\n3. Just Cause 2's selection of weapons is also extremely eclectic and each weapon is fun to use. Tearing apart the Panauan military (and helpless civilians) is ceaselessly satisfying and feels like playing a zany action movie akin to Machete or even Tropic Thunder.\n\n4. Just Cause 2's missions are reliably fun. Some of them may be somewhat generic, but each one is worth playing in its own right. On top of the main story missions, there are three criminal factions to do dirty work for in the form of "Faction Missions."\n\n5. Just Cause 2 has extreme replayability, as it's fun to hop into just to cause destruction and have fun, with the varying map locations to tear apart (over 300 scattered across the massive map).\n\n6. Just Cause 2's modding community is absolutely amazing, offering new character skins, extra weapons and vehicles, and fun cheats. My personal favorite mods are the Extreme Heat mod, which makes the military much more formidible and erratic, and the Insane Civilian Mod, which causes the civillian NPCs to mimic the actions of the military, creating widespread chaos.\n\nMy personal score for Just Cause 2 is 9.75/10.

What I think should be improved however is the prices of weapons, that is should be harder to find collectibles and maybe a few more secret weapons and Easter Eggs.

But in honesty you do not buy Just Cause 2 for its depth, but rather for the action, the carnage, the pretty explosions, and the pleasant vistas of Panau itself. In many respects Just Cause 2 builds on the premise of Mercenaries and Mercenaries 2; joinable factions, main story missions, side missions, supply drops, vehicle drops, weapon upgrades and the ever present regieme installations, bases, airfields and towns that can be taken one at a time. Either going in solo or working for the various opposition factions does make you feel like you are toppling the regieme one satisfying step at a time. Also be pleasantly surprised by excellent frames per second on the highest of graphics settings; one of the most visually stunning yet stable platforms made for the PC.","June 11, 2015","true","47.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

However, I can say with 100% confidence that it is the most fun open-world game I have ever played in my entire life. Just Cause 2 holds this high honor on my personal favorites list for a number of reasons:\n\n1. Just Cause 2's world is breathtakingly beautiful. In my opinion, this makes it superior to any of the Grand Theft Auto game worlds, as they are gritty and urban, while the fictional Asian island of Panau is filled with lush tropical landscapes, barren deserts, and even snow-covered mountains.\n\n2. Just Cause 2's selection of vehicles is extremely eclectic, and all of the cars, boats, planes, motorcycles and helicopters are insanely fun to use. My personal favorite is the DLC addon "Tuk-Tuk Boom-Boom."\n\n3. Just Cause 2's selection of weapons is also extremely eclectic and each weapon is fun to use. Tearing apart the Panauan military (and helpless civilians) is ceaselessly satisfying and feels like playing a zany action movie akin to Machete or even Tropic Thunder.\n\n4. Just Cause 2's missions are reliably fun. Some of them may be somewhat generic, but each one is worth playing in its own right. On top of the main story missions, there are three criminal factions to do dirty work for in the form of "Faction Missions."\n\n5. Just Cause 2 has extreme replayability, as it's fun to hop into just to cause destruction and have fun, with the varying map locations to tear apart (over 300 scattered across the massive map).\n\n6. Just Cause 2's modding community is absolutely amazing, offering new character skins, extra weapons and vehicles, and fun cheats. My personal favorite mods are the Extreme Heat mod, which makes the military much more formidible and erratic, and the Insane Civilian Mod, which causes the civillian NPCs to mimic the actions of the military, creating widespread chaos.\n\nMy personal score for Just Cause 2 is 9.75/10. It's a fantastic gaming experience for even more reasons than I've listed, and I strongly encourage everyone with access to M-rated games to play it.\nPosted: April 23.","May 15, 2014","true","115.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

But still game crashes at least once or twice a play session.\n\nSure you can purchase vehicles, but it seems like a waste of money, I bought a plane having never flown one yet and not even being sure of the controls, ended up crashing it into the ocean, so goodbye to 60k and  if you die you lose them as well, if they blow up they are gone for good. I hate how you can't store purchased vehicles anywhere. I've played other games where you can save your vehicles in a garage even if they blow up. I just don't bother buying vehicles.\n\nThe environment is beautiful and detailed, I love exploring it and diving underwater just because the water looks so nice.\n\nI like creating chaos and trying to complete all achievements.\n\n\nI'd rate it 7/10.

The map at times feels almost TOO big for the amount of content availible on it. Driving cars, just like Saint's Row 4, is horrible in terms of feel, but thankfully there's almost no reason to have to drive a car. Voice-acting is really horrible in terms of believability but is alright in terms of fidelity. The story is pretty empty and gives you no incentive to really play it for the sake of the storyline. The value of this game has greatly increased since the multiplayer mod is availible on Steam.\n\nTLDR; Good gameplay, Bad storyline/VA.\n\nThe DLC is garbage and I wouldn't recommend that anyone gets it.\nThe base game is like $2.99 when it goes on sale, so it's definitely worth it then.","June 16, 2014","true","9.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stgerger/recommended/8190/","stgerger","StGerGer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stgerger/","74 products in account","This game is, in my opinion, the best one available for PC, although I have a limited frame of reference. It's not overly violent - or at least if you choose for it to not be. You are rarely outright forced to kill anyone, although it is sometimes the easiest route. However, lots of the missions are very repetitive, but the best one is stealing an armored car and pretty much destroying a highway with it before giving it to the gang who sent you. This could be my definition of a perfect game, if a few things were changed. First off, my definition of a perfect game would be an open world parkour-integrated stealth game with many options for how to go about things, with an engrossing but quick-moving story line (and an epic soundtrack). This game is obviously open world, and it's got very good combat mechanics, even though I generally don't like TPS games. It can be played with a stealth style, but the extremely OP minigun can be fun if you feel like taking the direct route. I almost always take a stealth route because it makes the game more fun. There are some parkour elements, but really not enough to satisfy what I like. Vehicles are very fun to drive, it's one of my favorite things to do. The story could be better, but I'm easily entertained by game's stories, so I find it good. It is, however, a very, very slow game. You have to blow a lot of stuff up to progress, and if you're like me and you want to explore everywhere, it can take you a while to do anything. For example, right now I have 20 hours logged and 11% progress. (In game, not achievements.) Moving on, the map is wonderful. The only thing that really bothers me is the inability to go in any large buildings. That's the only way this game could really improve a lot. The graphics are beautiful, especially for a game that's (I think) 3 years old. Often when I'm playing I'll take a screenshot of Rico floating over a mountain range at sunset, because the game really is that beautiful. Honestly this game is very good looking, and performance is suprisingly good. On my laptop (Basic stats: Intel Core i5, Intel Integrated Graphics, 6GB RAM, and 7200 RPM hard drive) the game runs around 30 fps, although battery life is pretty much instant death. 30 fps may not sound that great, but really I don't even notice it. It doesn't affect how well I play the game, so I don't bother with it. The only time I've ever noticed lag is during cutscenes, when the audio and video get seriously out of sync. Oh well. Soundtrack is well done too.\n\n--Summary--\nPretty freaking amazing. 10/10.\n99/100 for not having enough parkour and no going inside buildings.","March 28, 2014","true","52.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I've sunk hours in on console and on PC, and it is a fantastic open world game. People are going to compare it to Grand Theft Auto, of course, and while in some areas you can, you really can't in others. The map is unbelievably large, and the storyline itself advances through ♥♥♥♥ing up everything you come across in whatever way you deem necessary for it to come down or explode. You can grapple all over the place and you have unlimited parachutes plus the ability to steal ANY vehicle in this game - if it moves, you can steal it. Anything from little bikes up to massive jet liner airplanes.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Hell yes. This is the most fun you will ever have in an open world setting. No restrictions, no linear story crap (unless you REALLY want to, and even then it's pretty damn open), just good old fashioned fun.","May 18, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, it can become repetive after some time. But oh god, it is so much fun. It is one of those games that you can just pop in for a few hours and kill some time and have fun - there is always another settlement to "clear" (meaning - collect all the collectibles and blow everything up), another race to win, another vehicle to drive. And it's beautiful. Panau is a place I could live - if it weren't for the crazy dictator or the equally crazy American agent trying to "liberate" your country.

It is one of the only games where I wanted to do the story instead of just roaming around, not that roaming around isent awesome in this game. A complaint I have is that there is not alot of weapons, just generic guns like sniper rifle and assault rifle.  There is plenty of vehicals in the game, also plenty of stuff to blow up and mess around with. Another problem is that the campain missions are all the same, but the side missions are all differenet and they help show you around the map.

I've sunk hours in on console and on PC, and it is a fantastic open world game. People are going to compare it to Grand Theft Auto, of course, and while in some areas you can, you really can't in others. The map is unbelievably large, and the storyline itself advances through ♥♥♥♥ing up everything you come across in whatever way you deem necessary for it to come down or explode. You can grapple all over the place and you have unlimited parachutes plus the ability to steal ANY vehicle in this game - if it moves, you can steal it. Anything from little bikes up to massive jet liner airplanes.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Hell yes. This is the most fun you will ever have in an open world setting.

Improving in almost every conceivable way, it turned a game which was riddled with problems and a repetitive nature into an enjoyable experience. It's far from perfect, story falling into the stupid and cliche once more, but at least somewhat satirical this time, if it was meant to be taken seriously then the voice acting certainly didn't help. Just Cause 2 can also crash on systems well above recommended requirements albeit rare.\n\nBesides those points, there's a lot to like. The soundtrack is better than ever and perfect for the game. Graphics are great and polished, assuming you can overlook the forced depth of field (developers please stop this.) The world is expansive yet detailed with various areas like mountain regions, cities and deserts to explore and complete. Quality of gameplay as a whole has improved drastically with better controls, intuitive combat including use of grapple, better side activates, missions and creative bosses.\n\nAvalanche studios put real effort in between JC1 and 2 and it shows. It's a much more enjoyable game, sure it can be repetitive going for 100%, but I still got a solid 18 hours out of the game without completing it fully. So I recommend picking it up for anyone interested in an open world sandbox all about causing chaos then go for it.","March 16","true","18.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Improving in almost every conceivable way, it turned a game which was riddled with problems and a repetitive nature into an enjoyable experience. It's far from perfect, story falling into the stupid and cliche once more, but at least somewhat satirical this time, if it was meant to be taken seriously then the voice acting certainly didn't help. Just Cause 2 can also crash on systems well above recommended requirements albeit rare.\n\nBesides those points, there's a lot to like. The soundtrack is better than ever and perfect for the game. Graphics are great and polished, assuming you can overlook the forced depth of field (developers please stop this.) The world is expansive yet detailed with various areas like mountain regions, cities and deserts to explore and complete. Quality of gameplay as a whole has improved drastically with better controls, intuitive combat including use of grapple, better side activates, missions and creative bosses.\n\nAvalanche studios put real effort in between JC1 and 2 and it shows. It's a much more enjoyable game, sure it can be repetitive going for 100%, but I still got a solid 18 hours out of the game without completing it fully. So I recommend picking it up for anyone interested in an open world sandbox all about causing chaos then go for it.","March 16","true","18.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'M NOT REVIEWING IT WITH ONLY 4 HOURS OF PLAYTIME---\n\nJust Cause 2... where to start? This is arguably, for me, the ultimate sandbox game. Perhaps trumped only by Just Cause 3, which I am yet to purchase, however, have played. The game sees you attempt to overthrow the corrupt government of Panau. How do you do this, exactly? By blowing stuff up. That is your main objective in this game. Cause chaos. For me, the campaign was not too important. Is it good? Yes. Is it great? Perhaps not. However, the campaign seems to just be a passing fad, and, although the dialog is well written, it is not memorable. Just Cause 2, however, offers an expansive open world, full of immense posibilities, from military bases and airports, from the smallest of villages to the huge capital city, and don\'t even get me started on the graphics. Even now, this game, from 2010, trumps many games released today, and the fact that even fairly low end (by today\'s standards) PCs can run it, makes it a viable alternative to the likes of GTA V, which requires a relatively demanding PC to run. My advice to you: Buy this game, now. At just £9.99, it is an ABSOLUTE STEAL! This game is great for people who don\'t have a great PC, or are just looking to try the series, not wanting to spend large amounts of money on Just Cause 3, or even those of you who just love blowing things up. FAN-♥♥♥♥ING-TASTIC. Oh, and, while you\'re at it, get the multiplayer mod.

It's main trademark is the grappling hook, that can be used to pull yourself to objects far away or pull objects towards you.\n\nPros:\n+ Vast environment with distances that feel realistic. Driving 10 kilometers feels like driving 10 kilometers in real life. Downside of this is that the world feels a little empty and repetative at times.\n+ All the major weapon classes are represented and you can upgrade your gear.\n+ Pretty good story.\n+ Memorable character build and rich dialogues.\n+ The local propaganda radio reflects on your latest actions, trying to cover everything up.\n+ Playing a villain was served in a satisfactory, humorous manner, that suited the whole story.\n\n\nCons:\n- Missions start to feel repetative very quickly, falling roughly into 3 categories:\n1. Go kill everyone and blow everything up in a particular place.\n2. Help some gangsters get to a fortified camp and protect them until they take it over.\n3. Destroy something/someone in a limited timeframe.\n- A few bugs like falling through a bridge or not being able to get out of a turned over car.\n\nVerdict\nIt's not amongst my favorite games, far from it. Travelling the distances was a pain and the repetative missions got tiresome quickly. On the other hand, unleashing havok has a quality of it's own and the game surely has a ton of content to keep your hands tied for some 20+ hours.","February 24","true","53.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Physics in this game are marvelous, i mean.... You're on foot, you jump and open your parachute.... And you climb mountains with.... parachute and get awarded with achievement. A.L. is also fantastic. I climbed a solitaire once and all of a sudden plane crashed on the building and it killed me (I'm not making this up). It's literally 9/11, so realistic. Graphics are quite good and game runs decently well on my toaster. And now best for last, voice acting. You thought Resident Evil 1 and Sonic Adventure 1 had outstanding voice acting? Then you never played this. I'm also pretty sure this is biggest sand box game ever (not sure about JC3). But it's little bit too big. Free falls are so long, i had time to go buy some food, watch whole Godfather trilogy and get CRAZY!!! ranking in Crazy Taxi. But, if you love explosions, half full/empty open world and stunts, it's definitely worth a try.","January 4","true","15.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The multiplayer mod which comes with the game, Is also amazing. I am glad that the guys who made the mod, made it. There is a wide range of guns featuring from pistols to crazy rocket launchers. There is also a wide range of vehicles, featuring from motorbikes to military rocket-launching bullet-shooting helicopters. Although there isn't quite alot of replayability, You cannot tell anyone it isn't fun grappling on to helicopters and blowing s#*t up. You'd be lying.

In essence, it is an action movie turned into a game, and in the best way I've seen in my years. Irreprievably overpowered gadgets, an open world large enough to keep you constantly on the run, driving vehicles, flying vehicles, standing on top of vehicles, standing on top of flying vehicles, and a goal at hand: to free the oppressed people of a small, fictional island from the tyranny of their dictator.\n\nThinking about buying this game?

The storyline is gripping and addictive. I’ve never got board of this game since I got it and I’ve been loving it ever since. Even though it is not the newest game on the market, it is still one of the best. Just Cause 2 is up there in my Top 3 favourite games ever, yeah, it means that much to me! From stealing fighter jets to driving a fire engine, you can literally do anything. One of my favourite things to do is massive road trips across the map, I know, it might be a bit sad but I find it fun! It works so well because the map is that big. I only realised that the PC map is a lot bigger that the console map a couple of months ago! At least I think it is. In conclusion, it is amazing game and I recommend to everyone to buy it because it is one of the best games I have ever played.

Slow","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095449797/","59 products in account","So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. When it just came out, someone said it was awesome. And I gotta say, I am not dissapointed.\n\nThe game lacks realism on certain parts of the game, for example the grappling and the infinite parachutes. It is those things that makes the game awesome. It is a bit hard to get used to in the beginning of the game, but once you are used to it, you are glad you have it.\n\nThis game as a third person shooter is also a succes. Again, a bit difficult to get used to the dualwielding/single wielding hotkeys. The dual wielding is awesome in the middle of fights, because if you use it correctly, you aren't out of ammo most of the time.\n\nNo game is perfect, neither is this game. The stronghold takeovers are pretty repetitive, there aren't many of them, but all of them are the same: same goals, same order of objectives. The only difference is the difficulty.\n\nThe missions are mostly unique. I really enjoyed most of them. Some of them take a long time because it is a long mission or because some of them are kinda difficult. The shorter ones are usually pretty easy: Go there, do this and you are done. But there is a nice variety of missions.\n\nOverall, if you like third person shooters and or weird games, then I strongly recommend this game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, so I don't know how good that is.","December 23, 2014","true","78.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So, basically, you can manage to ignore all these stupid things if you play for short periods of time...and it is worth playing...so much stuff to blow up, and a huge, diverse map...its just too bad it has so many obnoxious and frustrating problems.","April 23, 2014","true","31.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When you have to constantly travel, and it takes decades to get from point A to B even in a helicopter, then it just gets a bit boring. The fast travel mechanic is okay but i dont like how it just dumps you in the air above a village or something.\n\nBut the size is also awesome. nothing is close by, therefore the strange and diverse biomes actually make sense unlike a certin block building sandbox game that gives 10 year olds boners. The vehicle variety is fairly large, but if you have a helicopter of tank then u are just compleatly OP.

The open world will consume hours of your life, the grappling hook is insanley fun to use, and the fact that just about everyone wants to kill you and/or can be killed makes this great for any lover of the GTA-style-kill-any-man-woman-or-creature-that-looks-at-you-funny method of gameplay style. So if you like over the top, open world, psychopath simulators; why are you still reading this? Go buy this game!","February 6, 2015","true","45.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are 3 factions, which gives you different missions and dialogue. The 3 factions are: The Reapers, The Ular Boys, and The Roaches. You also have your main missions, which lead you to the ending (if it wasn't self - explanitory). But that isn't what makes the game super fun. You have a huge country to explore: Panau. After quite awhile, you unlock a bunch of badass equipment, vehicles, and even have an extraction helicopter that can bring you to places you already discovered. You can fly a plane from one corner of the world, to the opposite end of the world. There are boats, helicopters, ATV's, motorcycles, etc. And, how could I forget, the grappling hook. The grappling hook is used to do all kinds of things. When you skydive, if you plan your grappling hook properly, you can break your fall! You can latch on the enemies and pull them to you! Anyways, that's all I can explain. But this game's a blast. You should buy it; full price or not! JUST BUY IT!

The controls are fluent and feel really nice. The missions are a bit repetitive apart from the story missions, which make up less than 20% of the game. You have to complete minor missions before you can progress in the story line. However, you only need a handful of minor missions to unlock all the story missions. That's the one major flaw in this game, it doesn't push you to do a lot of minor missions, you can rush through the story line is less than 15 hours. After that, there is a HUGE amount of sidemissions and collectibles to keep you busy. Not as much fun as the story but still well worth your time. The graphics are very nice, especially considering this game is a couple of years old already.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/recommended/8190/","cxero","Cxero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cxero/","76 products in account","Just Cause 2 is an impressive sandbox game with a gigantic map. It's pretty cool! I'll give it a review.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nJust Cause 2's gameplay like a stereotypical action movie - turned up to eleven. It's got an open-world GTA-like format with cars, planes, guns, and boats. The map is HUGE. It makes Grand Theft Auto's playing field look tiny. If traversing a map this big sounds difficult, dno't worry - you play as a dude called Rico, who is basically the latino spiderman. As Rico, you can use your grappling hook as much as you like to grab onto anything and launch yourself in that direction. A really cool feature is that you can latch your grappling hook onto a car to hijack it extremely quickly. You can also do crazy stunts and deploy parachutes whenever you like. That's right - Rico basically farts parachutes. There's lots of guns, explosions, and all kinds of crazy things. You can do missions, but to unlock missions you must cause lots of chaos first - which is good because blowing up things while in police pursuit is EXTREMELY fun.\n\nPRESENTATION:\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous. The island of Panau looks amazing and relaxing. The explosions are huge and dramatic. The gunplay looks cool and cinematic. There's not much I can really say about the graphics except that they look great in all aspects. Perhaps not the most realistic, but the game is a few years old, so it's to be expected. Music is nice but there's not much variety so it may get a bit repetetive.\n\nSTORY:\nNot the game's strongest suit. The story is rather lacking compared to something like Fallout or Half-Life. Sure, it's there, but it's not pulitzer-prize caliber stuff. The story never gets in the way of the gameplay because it's really not that important.\n\nI'd have to say that Just Cause 2 is definitely worth buying. It's fun and allows for hours of non-stop gameplay. If you like Grand Theft auto or similar open-world games, you should definitely try this one. Just cause 2 isn't perfect, but it is one big fun, explosion-packed adventure with tons of things to destroy and bad guys to defeat. Can't wait until Just Cause 3 comes out!","March 4, 2015","true","31.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gorgeous graphics and non-stop action!\n\nThe story of the game is intentionally stupid, a homage to 80's action movies, full of one-liners and evil guys with awful aiming. Don't take it seriously because it's not what makes this game great. What makes it amazing is that the main objective of this game is to cause CHAOS, and there's a lot of ways to do it, which gives you a lot of place to improvise and have fun. Missions are OK, some are better than others, some are just a copy-paste of previous ones, but doesn't matter, all are fun. Even if you are not interested in completing you can have fun because there's a lot of other things to do like racing (air, road and even on water), find collectibles, destroy enemy bases, etc.\n\nThe map is HUGE and very detailed, you can play hundreds of hours and you will still find interesting places to visit.  Don't hesitate to buy it if you like sandbox games! is a MUST!","May 5, 2012","true","42.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

You see it for sale, think "this looks quite silly, might give it 10 minutes." 3 years later you are still rolling around laughing when you drive a motorbike into a helicopter and grapple onto another one. Full of all the insane action hero madness you will ever need, but instead of watching steven segal doing the action, you get to! with a multitude of vehicles and weapons to go and terrorise the government of panau island. And when i say island, I mean a full island. Massive and varied landscapes ranging from snowy mountains to cities to airports. If insane action hero madness gets a bit repetative with the same weapons and vehicles, Just Cause 2 has you covered with DLC! From Monster trucks for ploughing down streets to a giant gun that shoots out air, DLC is varied and gives more hours of fun. "But Official_joeliecus, I only enjoy games where I can meet a stranger and blow his face off with a shotgun" you say to me through a screen... somehow... Well, someone else has got you covered with that. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer Mod! Take those years of gameplay and spend more years of gameplay with someone else of whom has given years of their life to fun. Go and have a cargo plane race. Go and crash cars into each other, Twisted metal style. Go and ramp off of your friends boat in a boat, jump out and shoot him in the testicles, or overies (not sexist).

Jumping around with your grappling hook and parachuting from tree to tree to avoid gunfire is just one of the many aspects of this game that makes it notable.\n\nStoryline is thin and will be finished quite promptly and unfortunately, once you've gotten to that point, it just loses its fun-value\n\nThe repetitiveness of the missions, atrocious voice acting, and overall lack of effort that seems to have been put into just about everything except fun game mechanics can leave a stale taste in one’s mouth. Flying around causing aimless chaos is fun for a few hours, but when you realize that's the only entertaining element the game has to offer you get bored quickly.\n","May 18, 2014","true","11.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Three potential storylines (all playable simultaneously), can buy weapons and vehicles, lots of destruction, and cop chases.\n\nThe map is MASSIVE, i flew for 5 real time minutes, and i had barely crossed a quarter of the map.\n\nThe game is truly Open World, where you can assualt military bases and complete sections of the map at your own speed.\n\nWeaknesses? Yeah, there are a few. AI is limited. Grappling hook has unrealistic reach, and some physics that are questionable.\n\nOverall, a great game that doesnt take itself seriously, but presents a good, time consuming, action-filled third person shooter.\n\nCan attach people to Oxygen tanks and shoot the tanks into the air. 10/10","June 23, 2014","true","6.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't wait to explore every inch of this and wreck it like the kid on xbox live did to my mom" This is the driving point of JC2.\n\nJust Cause 2 has a fairly simple story: go into the country and wreck the corrupt government so a new one can take it's place. To Progress in the story and unlock missions, you will need to cause chaos on the vast Island of Panoi. Everything is unlocked from the start (for the most part) so you just get out there and blow stuff up, and when I say blow stuff up I REALLY blow stuff up. The explosions in the game are freaking beautiful, heck everything in it is freaking beautiful, even on low settings. In the words of Nerd3, it's action movie: the game... everything has the potential to be obliterated!\n\nPanoi consists of three main islands: an Urban/city area, a desert area, and a Jungle and Mountainous area. Just half of the desert area is roughly the size of the GTA: San Andreas map. Only half. Take a moment to think about how much space the whole world has. Yeah, a lot.\n\nThe overall gameplay is smooth and fun, whether you're doing a campaign mission, one of the thousands of side missions, or just screwing around. The HUD is limited, so there's lots of screen room to sight see. Just Cause two has insane variety in between missions as well. Side mission might require you to defend or escort someone, story missions have you taking on the government, and hundereds of bases for you to conquor inbetween. And what makes things better? Going from mission to mission is half the fun. Cops will chase you, you can steal any vehicle from ATV to Cargo Plane, all while pulling off insane stunts. The idea of having a grappling hook to pull yourself with a parachute as the main transportation is a genious idea that makes surprised, since we haven't seen it in any other game. Plus, the dedicated modders of the game just make it a millions time better plus 2.\n\nTL;DR: Get out there, let the societal defiling commence! Whether your skydiving, driving, flying, boating, or shooting everything, you are bound to have a good time on Just Cause 2. If that's not enough, now there's a MULTIPLAYER mod so you can do all the stuff with your friends and other people! Buy. This. Game. It. Will. Be. Worth. It.","January 6, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The controls are fluent and feel really nice. The missions are a bit repetitive apart from the story missions, which make up less than 20% of the game. You have to complete minor missions before you can progress in the story line. However, you only need a handful of minor missions to unlock all the story missions. That's the one major flaw in this game, it doesn't push you to do a lot of minor missions, you can rush through the story line is less than 15 hours. After that, there is a HUGE amount of sidemissions and collectibles to keep you busy. Not as much fun as the story but still well worth your time. The graphics are very nice, especially considering this game is a couple of years old already. Goes around on steam for less than 10 bucks, this one is a no-brainer for anyone loving shooting, action and an open world to explore.","January 8, 2014","true","82.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Slow","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095449797/","59 products in account","So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. When it just came out, someone said it was awesome. And I gotta say, I am not dissapointed.\n\nThe game lacks realism on certain parts of the game, for example the grappling and the infinite parachutes. It is those things that makes the game awesome. It is a bit hard to get used to in the beginning of the game, but once you are used to it, you are glad you have it.\n\nThis game as a third person shooter is also a succes. Again, a bit difficult to get used to the dualwielding/single wielding hotkeys. The dual wielding is awesome in the middle of fights, because if you use it correctly, you aren't out of ammo most of the time.\n\nNo game is perfect, neither is this game. The stronghold takeovers are pretty repetitive, there aren't many of them, but all of them are the same: same goals, same order of objectives. The only difference is the difficulty.\n\nThe missions are mostly unique. I really enjoyed most of them. Some of them take a long time because it is a long mission or because some of them are kinda difficult. The shorter ones are usually pretty easy: Go there, do this and you are done. But there is a nice variety of missions.\n\nOverall, if you like third person shooters and or weird games, then I strongly recommend this game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, so I don't know how good that is.","December 23, 2014","true","78.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The acting (or voice acting) is terrible.  The graphics are quite dated.  You can blow up a building with a couple of shots from your desert eagle.  You can basically fly using your tractor cable.\n\nBut the game is simply fun!  I don't usually like games that are too unrealistic.  But in this case I think the game works because the developers understood that it was meant to be an unrealistic and crazy action game.\n\nUnfortunately, the game crashes frequently.  In 87 minutes of game play it has crashed on me 3 times with a “just cause 2 has stopped working” message.  I'm not sure if it's because the game wasn't made for Windows 8 and is having compatibility issues or if it's just buggy.  However, the latter seems most likely as a quick Google search reveals a long list of bug complaints that have gone unfixed for years.  So for that reason I put the game at 3/5 stars.\n\nLink to bugs http://justcause.wikia.com/wiki/Just_Cause_2_Bugs_and_glitches","August 21, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Filled with gunfights and explosions, you play as an American secret agent/black ops who goes and tears up a Southeast Asian dictatorship.\nThis comes in the form of an open-world(the map is huge) 3rd person shooter with: campaign missions; mini-missions done for revolutionary groups and mafias with simple escort, collect, hijack, destroy, and kill objects; races; military bases and cities with infastructure to destroy, leaders to kill, and upgrades to collect; sprinkled around the map.\nCombat isn't too challenging, as you soak up any damage you can get. You can either: zip, roll, and jump around, whacking people, throwing around with your zipline, and shooting people; or do it the boring way.\nYou also got your cars, your boats, your helicopters, your planes, and your military veichles to use in it too.\nYou can also just raise some havoc, as in most open world games.\nVoice acting is pretty bad, and the very large map isn't too exciting to explore.","June 20, 2014","true","65.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

There's also a 3rd party multiplayer mod in development www.jc-mp.com\n......\nI'm a huge fan of open world games, from the original GTA way back in the 90's right up to it's latest incarnation GTAIV. I've also enjoyed Shenmue, Dragon Quest, Bully, Fallout, Farcry, Spiderman, Burnout, Arkham City..... any genre, any platform- it's easily my favourite type of gameworld. But the mechanics make a game and Just Cause 2 has the most fun mechanics I've ever played with. The possibilities are only limited to your imagination....... and skill.\n......\nWanna steal a fighterjet? Cool, Rico can do that. Wanna fly that plane toward a bridge, jump on top and surf the jet under the bridge? Fine, Rico can do that. Wanna jump from a building flying through death defying gaps and before hitting the ground, release your parachute and walk away unharmed? Rico can do that one too. Really, once you get the hang of the controls the game comes to life in a way I've experienced in no other.\n......\nThat would be my recommendation over if it wasn't for one final thing. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. It's exactly what it sounds like and so much more. This is a mod that allows over 2000 players to join a single server, playing together on the same map. Nobody should allow themselves to ignore the fact that this really is a landmark in gaming. Never has a game of action orientated 3rd person shooting/jumping/driving been played on this scale. The closest would be something like GTAIV multiplayer on PC with up to 32 players. 2000+ Players is a whole new league above and beyond what I ever thought possible. You should try it > www.jc-mp.com","January 14, 2013","true","427.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","5"

Slow","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095449797/","59 products in account","So I bought this game not really knowing what to expect. When it just came out, someone said it was awesome. And I gotta say, I am not dissapointed.\n\nThe game lacks realism on certain parts of the game, for example the grappling and the infinite parachutes. It is those things that makes the game awesome. It is a bit hard to get used to in the beginning of the game, but once you are used to it, you are glad you have it.\n\nThis game as a third person shooter is also a succes. Again, a bit difficult to get used to the dualwielding/single wielding hotkeys. The dual wielding is awesome in the middle of fights, because if you use it correctly, you aren't out of ammo most of the time.\n\nNo game is perfect, neither is this game. The stronghold takeovers are pretty repetitive, there aren't many of them, but all of them are the same: same goals, same order of objectives. The only difference is the difficulty.\n\nThe missions are mostly unique. I really enjoyed most of them. Some of them take a long time because it is a long mission or because some of them are kinda difficult. The shorter ones are usually pretty easy: Go there, do this and you are done. But there is a nice variety of missions.\n\nOverall, if you like third person shooters and or weird games, then I strongly recommend this game. I haven't play multiplayer yet, so I don't know how good that is.","December 23, 2014","true","78.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is necessary to have a story, but it doesn't mean it is a good one. Quite frankly this is one of the worst stories I have ever had the enjoyment of playing. BUT story doesn't mean ♥♥♥♥ in this game and you can tell. This game is about doing whatever you want because JUST CAUSE. Wanna strap a vehicle to a Passenger plane and watch physics break down? Do you want to give the middle finger to physics and logic? Do you wish to play a sandbox with a little more? Well I sure as hell do. My word is this game something special. Without the Grapple Hook this game would be nothing special. But hey you have a Grapple Hook which kicks the Hook Shot's ♥♥♥. With this ungodly tool you become the most versatile being in the game. Think of this like Spiderman, but you don't cry like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. You can cling to walls and shoot "webs" and swing around not giving a single ♥♥♥♥. On a more serious note I love driving around the map taking in the magnificence of Panau Island and it is easily one of the more rewarding factors in the game. You'll discover over 350+ locations in which you can watch burn as you cause untolds amount of choas and havoc. Something else worth metioning is the mods. The mods are easy to work and are all hilarious. Some make you a god other add to the games graphics. Needless to say without mods the game is still fine on its own. Mods only exist to "spice" things up in the Just Cause Universe. Oh yeah there's multiplayer. I would wait on the Multiplayer until you have played around in Singleplayer. Multiplayer is Singleplayer but with way more players (No ♥♥♥♥ :\). In conclusion this game is the near perfection of large scale sandbox with plenty of hilarious moments and some seriously addicting gmaeplay.

The map is gigantic and has a lot of things to do in it, like taking over military bases and the corrupt government property by blowing the crap out of them until there's nothing left to destroy or just jumping around with your grapple hook and exploring the map with your parachute.\nThe main story is very interesting even though it's kinda short but once you complete it, there's still more than enough to do until you have reached a 100% completion of the game.\nIf you find yourself in the middle of a mountain or a desert, you can just call the black market dealer (Tom Sheldon) at any time and buy a vehicle or even guns from him. Not only can you buy them but you can even upgrade them with the vehicle/weapon parts that can be found and collected all over the map.\nHelicopters with mounted rocket launchers and mini-guns, badass SUVs with mounted guns that can be operated by an ally or a rocket launcher that shoots 2 rockets per second or even a sniper rifle that will send your enemies a few feet in the air as you hit them, the choice of destruction is yours.\nAnnihilate, conquer and become a legendary hero who ends the corrupt dictatorship of Panau once and for all.\n\nP.S.

Using it while also shooting down some rag tag militia might be even more fun.\n\nYou get a fair share of vehicles and weapons to wreck mayhem everywhere.

You have an entire country to explore and vandalise at your leisure. Use your hook-shot to nab a fighter jet out of the air for a quick travel solution. (Although I've never managed to 'land' a plane in this game, but maybe I'm missing the point slightly.)\n\nJust Cause 2 is a silly, gravity-defying, ballsy, slightly-racist shoot'em up.

At that time I didn't mind the soldiers, or the government, or the rebels. It's the scorpian I have a problem with. He goes around town attaching people to lamp posts and uses a weird leaf blower thing to send them into space like it was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NASA. Probably because he destroyed our actual space program.\n\nRico, usually on missions you are reckless, and we tolerate that... but Panau. DO YOU EVEN KNOW THE COSTS WE HAVE UNDER YOU'RE NAME\nMoney?

The things that makes this game so awesome are the giangantic sandbox and the open world. Nothing is more relaxing then to hang and/or drive around in the map and blowing stuff up. You can just pull someone out of a car while you are going 120 km/h on the freeway, then fly away with your parachute and watch the car explode below you. I can't say much about the story because I only did about three missions. Don't regret a minute I played. I can't wait for Just Cause 3.\n\nEDIT: Now i successfully finished the story and multiple side missions, I can say that there actually is a pretty good story, what I did not expect. The main story is perfectly balanced with the time you spend creating chaos in throughout the map. This is due to the fact that you must create a certain amount of chaos before you can start playing the next mission. This way you will never start a mission when your weapons are not yet upgraded to the level that is necessary.\n\n9/10","June 27, 2015","true","80.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sadly, I did this, but I still love it to death.\n\nThroughout the game, you're pretty freaking overpowered, but you're still weak enough at the beginning for you to feel that growing power as you progress. You cause chaos in Panau Just Cause you can. The government is a corrupt totalitarian superpower that needs to be stopped, and you do that in the most fun way possible. You assassinate colonels, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, and in general cause total societal collapse.\n\nThe fun is just so much more with the number of vehicles you can drive, including many different airplanes and helicopters. The Black Market is your way of buying weapons and vehicles or hitching a ride across the MASSIVE game-world you're playing in. You can explore this freaking huge world if you'd like, but not all of it is all that interesting, even if it's all beautiful.\n\nThis game is definitely worth the money.","September 16, 2012","true","23.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","6"

That's pretty well all that needs to be said but I'll say a bit more.\n\nThe grappling hook in this game may be one of the single best/fun mechanics I've ever played with in a game.  Hooking vehicles, boats, planes and more together is just plain fun.  Using it while also shooting down some rag tag militia might be even more fun.\n\nYou get a fair share of vehicles and weapons to wreck mayhem everywhere.  There's also a lot of missions and story that keep you interested in causing more mayhem.  As well you get a gigantic island with lots of variety to the terrian and good deal of towns/cities to play in and cause further mayhem.\n\nWith all that mayhem you cause you may generate a fair amount of attention from the local authorities, but thats okay, cause using your grappling hook to get out of those situations is just as fun as when you used your grappling hook to get into the situation.\n\nGet this game and enjoy the hell out of it like everyone else has.\n","January 6, 2015","true","91.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is a phenomenal game.\n\nWhile the story is nothing to write home about and the controls can feel a bit wonky at times, the gratification that comes from grappling a jeep to the road and causing it to flip into the air or decimating harbors and army bases with a minigun are simply unmatched among games I've played.\n\nThis game's main "gimmick" is your grappling hook that spits in the face of physics and basic logic. This 1 inch cord has enough power to hold a car to a helicopter without breaking and defies the concept of momentum, letting you jump off a skyscraper and grapple onto the road below without being harmed. The game also features a respectable arsenal of upgradable weapons and vehicles to terrorize the island nation of Panau with.\n\nThere are few negatives that I can come up with for this game, but there are some minor issues:\n\nWhen you fall from a tall place, you transition into "falling mode" and controls shift accordingly. The distance it takes to transition seems inconsistent and can result in cheap damage.\n\nThe DLC seems a bit overdone. I'm not a huge fan of DLC in the first place, and I bought the full version that includes the DLC, but I didn't feel like it added much to the game.\n\nThe game is actually incomplete. The developers accidentally left out a few of the collectables, making it impossible to 100% the game ingame, you can still get all the Steam achievements though. I'm honestly puzzled as to why the devs haven't fixed this issue, since it should be a really easy fix.\n\nLastly, and this may not be a bad thing for some people, Panau is big. Too big. Allow me to elaborate, I have played this game for 131 hours and I'm only about 75% of the way done. The conquering of towns and military bases is a blast at first and retains its enjoyability well, but I don't see myself 100%ing the game any time soon.\n\nDespite these complaints, I've gotten 131 hours of solid enjoyment out of this title and will definitely be playing it more. If this game looks like fun to you and you won't be too bothered by its problems, then this is easily worth its asking price.","May 3","true","142.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For you it offers a purity of form with regard to Just Cause 2's gameplay.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice with Just Cause 2 is how flowy everything is. From stealing cars to grappling on airplanes, to stealing an airplane while jumping from another airplane. All this is at the heart of Just Cause 2, and it really illistrates itself as "Why did I just do that? Just cause...".\n\nAction, destruction, chaos are at the heart of this game. Almost to it's detrement since the story tries to portray you as a liberator when you play as almost a conquerer. Your objectives are to destroy vital infastructure and you regularly bathe the island in lethal radiation just to complete a mission.
