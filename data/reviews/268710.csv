I'd rather immerse myself in the virtual reality of *now*.... without someone breathing down my neck about 2035 and whether it will fit in with our post-real neo-simplistic social cloud-based pseudo lives that we are already living in.\n\nWhat gets me "steamed" is that fact that once you buy the movie, you can no longer play the demo version. And when I want to "show off" to my real life friends and show them Zero Point... I have to sit and wait for the whole thing to play out... I'd rather just show them the 2 minute demo (Which has all the goods part BTW), and then "show off" some other cool aspect of VR that are on steam.\n\nEven at sale price, the demo is better.

Not the end of the world, but still, having to do that is unecessary.\n\nSo - devs, update this asap to 0.7 or later.\n\nThis is not a game (as one could have guessed), it is more of a documentary / tech demo to show what is possible with 360' VR video. The video isnt of the highest resoultion and fast head movement makes the video a bit fuzzy, but clears up once your head pans around slowly again. The military scenes shows an unadjusted video line and while that is a small detail, it still breaks immersion - something that video producers of the future have to think about.\n\nMy favourite scene was when the camera was walking around, you could really get a sense of presense. I actually started to giggle when i saw the bison walk up to "me" and put its nose in my face.\n\nIs it worth it? Well, if you can spare a minute to uninstall the latest version of  the oculus Runtime and downgrade to version 0.4.4, you have something cool to show your friends and family. While this is just a techdemo, it is still a nice experience worth €4, and the sense of presens is way better than any IMAX movie which costs about the same. But this one is in your own home.\n\nJust dont forget to upgrade your Oculus runtime drivers after you are done.\n","October 14, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

There isn't really any connection at all to the different scenes you are put into throughout the documentary, however if that doesn't bother you then enjoy the ride! If anything, their random nature is to help prove the point that the guys are saying about how many endless possibilites there are for VR to have.\n\nSome scenes stand out more than others, and honestly some of them can be truly fascinating. One scene in particular made me feel incredibly present in the setting, and really pretty uncomfortable (in a good way, haha!).\n\nAll-in-all, if you're going to buy it then just make sure to know beforehand that this is more like a tech demo for what film in VR can be, and that this ultimately proves that there is a very bright and exciting future ahead for that. If you go into this with that knowledge I really believe you'll find this to be a great, enjoyable, and fascinating experience. There is some really great material in this short film, and even with its slightly pricey tag, I'd recommend it to VR users looking for a really neat and new experience.","October 28, 2014","true","1.0"," 35 of 67 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","35","67","0","0"

I bought in only because I want to support early efforts to get VR "film" rolling :)  There are some pretty amazing "shots" in here that are worth taking a look at though.  Particularaly the scene with the Buffalo at sunset, and the crowd scene.  Some things to keep in mind are that the DK2 is not very good at video due to the pixel structure and resolution.  Also, I feel that the head tracking is very limited in comparison to a full 75hz game like Proton Pulse.  I'm not sure if its a limitation of their tech or my system (GTX780 SLI), but the framerate is very choppy while moving your head.  I believe this is probably due to the framerate of most of their video not matching the 75 hz of the rift, so as you turn your head you are seeing 1 frame of video dragged across up to 3 frames of rift screen refreshes (for 24 hz video)?  This issue certainly needs to be addressed if they plan on releasing comercial VR "films."  Also, I'd suggest a disclaimer recommending that you don't move your head side to side or back and forth while watching, as positional tracking is impossible to support with this tech, and VR sickness is quite nasty.","October 29, 2014","true","0.3"," 9 of 35 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","9","35","0","0"

I had the DK2 in extended mode, with my solo monitor set as primary, launched Zero Day from Steam (not in VR mode) and it just worked, perfectly. The short film (~15min) is sort of a compilation of various demo footage, most in 360* 60fps, all of it in stereoscopic 3D. Some of the footage is better than others, and around a third of the footage is either 180* or normal footage projected onto a curved display. The opening and closing segments feature a fully rendered cinema where you are transported to and from your seat, through the IMAX-like screen, and into space. Yes, it's awesome. With the latest Oculus runtime and firmware installed, I noticed very little judder, but some judder and screen tearing is normal during the 360* footage, due to the work-in-progress nature of the techniques used to stitch together so many camera views.\nI'm all for supporting premium VR content at this stage, since it will allow developers and filmmakers to developed new tools and processes to keep pushing things further. The price may seem hefty for a short film, but this is good stuff, and a lot of resources went into putting it together. It's also by FAR the easiest way to showcase a number of great things VR can be used for. From epic nature footage to sightseeing, a wedding, and a shape ship, there's something that would appeal to anyone who you might want to demo a Rift to.","October 28, 2014","true","0.3"," 14 of 51 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","14","51","0","0"

It combined mostly 360 filmmaking with some 3D rendered ecperiences and a VR theater and it was very interesting experiencing the changes between the three.  I only paid $9.99 by preordering it from their site, but it was certianly worth it to me to get, what I believe, is the first true VR movie experience.  I watched it on my DK1 and, as another user pointed out, I simply launched it and it worked.  No VR mode no VR Cinema required.  I must say, this is one of the (it not the) first times I have just put on my Rift and hit play in Steam and was off to the races...and I really liked it!  This makes me even more excited for the consumer version of the Rift.","October 28, 2014","true","0.4"," 10 of 42 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","10","42","0","0"

Even at 5 dollars this was a waste of money. Performance issues galor in this thing. After reading multiple reviews about this not working properly I thought to myself Ill download the demo to see if it ran ok on my setup. To my surprise the demo works flawlessly on my setup. So I bought it. Actual game runs terribly after space scene. Even the same scenes that worked good in the demo ran horrendous in full version. Then it stoped at the run down building scene near the end. I love how they made the demo work great but the full version blows. Zero point did a full bait and  switch on me. I don't understand how prerecorded video scenes can be this hard to do. Wish i could get a refund for this garbage.\n\nDon't buy it!!!!! No matter how tempted you are.","February 13, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My relationship with this project is that I originally pre-ordered the movie back in March for ten bucks. Did I get ten dollars worth of material here? Nope, not even close. Am I disappointed? No not really because my original intent was to help these pioneers push out a product that will help us decide what and where this new medium can and should go. I am glad that it happened, I am glad this exists, and I'm glad that Condition One pulled the trigger rather than giving up.\n\nWhat does it mean for you? For the price, not worth your time or money. It's only 15-20 minutes long. That's a dollar per minute and you're really not going to be coming back to this over and over. There is only one or two scenes in here that were somewhat intriguing but marred by the deficiencies of the recording equipment. If you've tried the Oculus Google Streetview experiment, the 3d is about the same quality that's supported there. The 3d is tacked on having things farther away appearing closer than they should and there's one scene in particular where the scale was significantly smaller than it should have been making the people appearing in it seem like midgets. Sound wise, some scenes have good implementation where others are off by a long shot. I experienced some technical issues immediately trying to start it up, the resolution being very far off for some reason when mirroring my rift with my monitor. Extending it to the rift got the resolution to work out but the movie would show "Optimizing Video Quality" would fade out and then just show a blank screen. After several restarts it finally loaded without any real changing of settings on my part.\n\nThe whole thing is just very unpolished and left extremely wanting. If I were to speculate though about the future of this product, I imagine the price will eventually come down quite a ways. Presently it's most likely reliant on making sure that the pre-orders don't feel like they were ripped off as they originally intended for the experience to be worth $10-15. From the way they've behaved the last 6 months I would guess that as they pieced it together, they realized that they were missing the mark by a bit, but couldn't just down the price immediately without incurring the wrath of their early supporters. If they're smart and want their product to actually reach more than just a handful of people, they'll drop the pricing on this as soon as they can down to a few bucks because it's really not worth more than that. Until then, save your dollars, download the demo, and just wait to see how this one plays out.\n\nAgain, I want to congratulate Condition One for sticking with it anyway, tackling problems without any kind of standard to follow, and doing their best to deliver the best product possible. Like the first ever motion pictures, the actual quality was much less important than the groundwork they were laying down that generations to come would study and learn from.\n\n*Edit: With the new price change I'm going to go ahead and switch my review status to recommended as I absolutely wish to support the devs and all the work they did for this. That being said, the product is still the same. About the same price as a bag of chips and as far as VR products right now go, this is a decent snack right now.","October 28, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
