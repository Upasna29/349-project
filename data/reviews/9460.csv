What we have is a poor man's dystopian FPS that feels like it tried to cash in on COD, with a plot so thin you can see through it, and gameplay I'd attribute to a game 10 years in the past during the PS2 and 1 era. It is very obvious out the gate the devs wanted you to do multi player and the "Story" mode was just a 4 hour time wasintg tutorial with lackluster characters you can never identify with let alone like.\n\nThe final straw for me however, was the lousy bugs as well as the AEGIS physics engine bug that requires you to roll back your drivers if using anything beyond and 8600.\n\nOverall, i'd not wish this game on anyone, if you truly need the FPS, war is hell feel, wait for Call fo Duty to go on sale or some such.","March 20","false","3.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unfortunately the developers have done a really good job of misrepresenting the actual game play. Nothing in the actual game feels gritty or realistic. The enemies all look as if they're made of plastic and likewise their movement is rigid, almost as if they were a plastic toy. Their AI is a huge disappointment, there is no intelligence in their actions. They do the minimum of what is required in order to impede your progress, but that's it.\n\nThe weapons all attempt and fail to be futuristic versions of modern weaponry. They sound weak and are extremely inaccurate, which combined with the enemies unintelligent AI and plastic look ends up leaving a very unsatisfied feeling upon killing them.\n\nThe single player campaign is short, and contrary to what the developers claim it is also very linear and scripted. At no time during a mission did I ever feel as if I had any real choices as to how I was going to approach any given situation. The drones for example sound like a promising concept, but they fall short. It's almost as if they could have given a person a choice in how to fight or accomplish a given task. In reality though they never felt truly useful because they lack any real use on the battlefield outside of several scripted/forced events, this results in them feeling as if they're nothing more than a prop on a stage.\n\nMost of the maps are large and a couple of them are okay in their design, I almost enjoyed playing them, unfortunately though they're over shadowed by the games numerous shortcomings.\n\nNo matter how low the price may be, I can not recommend it. Save your money and time.","August 31, 2015","false","7.5"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","11","25","3","0"

Thanks Frontlines, but i guess everything comes to an end.\n\nNote: I will stress this here, so people, can understand and they dont let themselves fall into hole, The game is not playable anymore, there is no multiplayer, all servers have been shutdown, there is no way you will be able to play it online EVER again, do not yourselves get fooled, if you think there is such way, use it at your own risk. But it is from my experience that if something is too good to be true, then its because it is. Dont let yourselves take risks unnecesarily, its not worh it, i have been gaming for years now, so you can take my word for it, or maybe not, its your call, but i talk from experience.","November 5, 2014","true","3.5"," 56 of 75 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","56","75","0","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/recommended/9460/","sharpincome","Sharp Income","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharpincome/","1122 products in account","A pretty solid single player experience as a near-future, open-world-ish, Military themed FPS. It's not a full open world, as it's one structured area per level. I think "open level" would be a better description. Think of a battlefield map that has your forces moving from one side of the map to the other (like the front line moving in the trailer). This open level mechanic is refreshing for a single player experience (that isn't battlefield with bots) compared to the modern military shooter campaigns which are very linear. There's still a hint of linearity as each mission is basically about 3 target objectives (at a time) you have to capture/destroy but you can pretty much get to each of them in whatever order you want. Then another 3, and so on, until you've basically hit ever point of interest in the large scale level. It plays out somewhat like Crysis (1) or FarCry (1), but better in my opinion because the combat comes sooner, is more sustained (more ammo, more bad guys, & less time traversing the map), you have allies to fight alongside you, you're given more choice via multiple simultaneous objectives, and the level design is more than just a jungle (it's an urban jungle)\n\nThis game lets you use vehicles (tanks) but you can survive w/o having to use them (unlike fights in battlefield). Then there's also using drones (RC cars/helicopters with mounted guns/bombs), which occures quite often-more than I would wish in an FPS game but at least its not the majority (or even the entirety) of any particular mission and It's possible to get the through the mission w/o using them, though can be difficult at times.\n\nGraphics may be slightly dated, but they're unified and solid. Sound is generic but it gets the job done well enough without detracting too much from immersion. Dialog is simple, not much depth. Same with the plot, but this is good as it doesn't try to cram a bunch of narrative/history into your brain when you've come to play a shoot 'em up action game. The controls are tight. You have health regeneration so as long as you have cover, you can almost always stay alive. There are still times where you may die, but the open-world game mechanic makes dying less frustrating as you are not forced to follow the exact same path that just got you killed!!\n\nNo aim down sights, just some weapons with scopes as alt fire. You're able to choose your "class" (pre-set loadout) if you die and have to respawn in the campaign.\n\nOverall, great fun playing the single player campaign as an open level shooter. I was disappointed with the last few levels in the cities as you couldn't enter many of the large buildings which greatly restricts your movement and attack options compared to the previous levels in the game.","May 13, 2014","true","10.6"," 42 of 56 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","42","56","0","2"

Bad news first: Servers are down, you won't find anyone to play with online. Thankfully, the single player mode has a lot to offer. If you're old enough to remember Battlefield 2 and how they said it'd have a single player campaign, I'm pretty sure that's what the designers of that old frigate had in mind when they thought about it, even though it never came through eventually (thanks for that, Obama!).\n\nGraphics are still decent, weapons are neat, vehicles rock. The little boondoggle drones keep ingame monotony down. The story is surprsingly well written. I really liked how much thought went into all that just-slightly-beyond-tomorrow-tech - the experience is similar to the recent 2020-future Cowadooties, though far less spectacular, of course. Still, the designer's artistic achievement is to be applauded, if Call of Duty Advanced Blabla comes up with pretty much the same ideas five years later.\n\nNaturally, the immersive aspect is rather reduced when compared to a big-budget game like Battlefield. Often you'll find yourself just blasting at simpleton foes or hammering away at a distant installation with and IFV chaingun. Nonetheless, I was playing through this game with a big grin on my face, if only because it actually felt like a good old GAME instead of these new overscripted pseudo-movies. I'd give the single player experience a straight 8/10, though that number drops significantly after the first pass.\n\nLike I said, a real fun game. Definitely recommended when on sale, you won't regret the four hours or so it takes to  finish. After that, go for two double cheeseburgers at Mickey D's and feel like you're 15 again and all's well with the world for about an hour.","November 14, 2014","true","1.6"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","23","29","4","0"

Competent, non-arcade-type gun play without the complexity of some of today's modern offerings.\n\nI've owned this game for _years_ and until looking to see if the publisher had done any further Frontlines games, I really never noticed that there was a multiplayer; yes, the option was there, but I guess I never really noticed it. I guess that this game never seemed like it would be a good MP, so maybe that was it; at least it didn't devolve in to some POS CoD or BF cheatfest gaming that only kids play these days, so maybe it's a good thing! Apparently you can still play on LAN though. So, can't ding it for lack of MP when I never noticed MP was really there.\n\nIf you want a great FPS and will accept kind of a short story, check out Fuel of War, and its prequel or sequel Homefront from the same publisher.","January 28","true","21.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I will, however, say that I can't recommend this game to anyone.\n\nIt's not poorly made. The graphics are well made for it's time and everything functions as it should. Unfortunately the gameplay is entirely inferior to those who have come before it. Single player consists of a series of Call of Duty style narrative maps with the addition of a squad of bots to help you against the enemy. Unfortunately the boys are invulerable and not terribly helpful. They will never accomplish much other than blocking your line of fire because they appear to not understand objectives and since they don't die they never do things like hold a postion while you flank because the second the bots find a path to you they simply run forward and wherever you're emerging from becomes the front line.\n\nMy advice: play Unreal Tournament on assualt maps. There's no poorly written story but the bots feel like actual members of your team and are actually working to acheive the same objective you are rather than just being placeholders to make you feel less alone.","March 25, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

The AI can sometimes be clever, but the challenge is mostly based on an endless supply of cannon fodder that seems to spawn out of closets and crates.  The environment looks large, but an invisible wall prevents you from really taking advantage of the landscape as much as you'd like.  Lastly,and probably most importantly the single player mission is SHORT.  This is good only for about five hours of play.  There's a small amount of replay-value, and I suppose the multiplayer and langaming maps add a significant amount of value for players who are into that.  For my uses, this is a game to be rescued from the bargain bin, played for a weekend, then never opened again.","August 29, 2011","true","11.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The only thing is that I didn't get the chance to play online with other people on 360 and hopefully the MP will be fully ressurected for this game via PC! It's a great FPS that, as a friend said in his review, should of set the standard for game series like MOH, COD, and Battlefield! The one thing that I regret is that the devs haven't made a sequel! I hope Nordic Games does though, albeit in a form of a new title! One other thing that I must say, if you are getting this game, I suggest you get PhysX Legacy since this game does need it to run on Windows 7!

This one went under the radar, and I would confidently say that its SP campaign blows away anything that Activision (CoD) or DICE (BF) has produced in the last 10 years.\n\nFFOW has an interesting storyline, good gameplay concepts, and an overall good feeling. Very surprising, considering CHAOS Studios' 'Homeland' had a terrible campaign.\n\nThere are a good variety of missions and players are able to use an assortment of vehicles and aircraft throughout the SP campaign. What I enjoy most is the "hands off", non-linear approach of the SP campaign. Certain missions will give you tanks, planes, drones, etc, but wont force you down a specific route. It's like the developers said "Here are your objectives, here are your tools, you figure it out". The maps are large enough so that players can actually develop a strategy and execute their own plan, this allows great re-playability on missions.\n\nMy only gripe is that there is no COOP.

That's the positive things. On to the negative.\nFirst off; it's sporting massive multiplayer online combat, with 64 people....while the servers are down. So don't even think about playing online anymore. After figuring that out, I gave a shot at the singleplayer campaign. It's the cheesy arcade-hall story: "Red Star Nation attacks the oil supplies in the Middle East. We must stop them!". The gameplay itself isn't much better. Your main rifle has the scatter of a shotgun as soon as you fire more than 1 shot at a time, vehicles drive clunky and the AI is abysmal. The AI actually gives more meaning to the "singleplayer" than it simply not being multiplayer, you actually feel like you play alone. At several instances I see one of my teammates and an enemy brotherly coming into a room or up the stairs. The enemy starts shooting me, while my teammate does nothing.\nWorst was when I encountered an enemy tank; it was parked right next to one of my own vehicles, which was shooting its machinegun at the enemy. Ofcourse it was equipped with a rocket, but hey, those are expensive I guess!\nHowever, the moment I got near the enemy noticed me and felt like it should shoot at me. Not much fun.

By now you should be aware that this is basically a single player game only.  I got around 9 hours worth on hardcore level.  Only had one crash on my XP computer. Had to DL a driver patch to make the game work. If they had a neutral button I would vote for that.  The game gives you generous amount of ammo and the ability to instantly heal yourself if you disengage from a firefight. You can't really count on your AI buddies to save you. More than once the enemy would stroll up to around shotgun range and shoot at me ignoring my friendly AI, while my AI buddies kinda danced around missing or ignoring the enemy.  So basically your AI buddies help you locate the enemy by shooting in their direction. You also use some type of radar that  lights of the enemy in a red circle when you see them. Not sure why you would have this on on hardcore mode. This game is really easy especially when you have a tank. Just go forward, shoot, go back and repeat. Hide to get repaired if necessary. You also get plently of lives to finish a mission. I'm not sure if you have the ability to change your loadout before a mission starts, but you do have that ability when you die once. All in all not a bad game,but better games are out there. Also there seems to be 3 or 4 active nordic employees -_-","April 1","false","9.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is very obvious out the gate the devs wanted you to do multi player and the "Story" mode was just a 4 hour time wasintg tutorial with lackluster characters you can never identify with let alone like.\n\nThe final straw for me however, was the lousy bugs as well as the AEGIS physics engine bug that requires you to roll back your drivers if using anything beyond and 8600.\n\nOverall, i'd not wish this game on anyone, if you truly need the FPS, war is hell feel, wait for Call fo Duty to go on sale or some such.","March 20","false","3.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Unfortunately the developers have done a really good job of misrepresenting the actual game play. Nothing in the actual game feels gritty or realistic. The enemies all look as if they're made of plastic and likewise their movement is rigid, almost as if they were a plastic toy. Their AI is a huge disappointment, there is no intelligence in their actions. They do the minimum of what is required in order to impede your progress, but that's it.\n\nThe weapons all attempt and fail to be futuristic versions of modern weaponry. They sound weak and are extremely inaccurate, which combined with the enemies unintelligent AI and plastic look ends up leaving a very unsatisfied feeling upon killing them.\n\nThe single player campaign is short, and contrary to what the developers claim it is also very linear and scripted. At no time during a mission did I ever feel as if I had any real choices as to how I was going to approach any given situation. The drones for example sound like a promising concept, but they fall short. It's almost as if they could have given a person a choice in how to fight or accomplish a given task. In reality though they never felt truly useful because they lack any real use on the battlefield outside of several scripted/forced events, this results in them feeling as if they're nothing more than a prop on a stage.\n\nMost of the maps are large and a couple of them are okay in their design, I almost enjoyed playing them, unfortunately though they're over shadowed by the games numerous shortcomings.\n\nNo matter how low the price may be, I can not recommend it.

Good thing that I didn't pay more for it because the game is pretty lame.

I repeat, there is NO MULTIPLAYER (only LAN). So don't buy this game. Even though you can't even buy it on Steam anymore, don't buy it elsewhere either. It's not worth it. Better just download it if you want to play the (very short) SP campaign.

I will, however, say that I can't recommend this game to anyone.\n\nIt's not poorly made. The graphics are well made for it's time and everything functions as it should. Unfortunately the gameplay is entirely inferior to those who have come before it. Single player consists of a series of Call of Duty style narrative maps with the addition of a squad of bots to help you against the enemy. Unfortunately the boys are invulerable and not terribly helpful. They will never accomplish much other than blocking your line of fire because they appear to not understand objectives and since they don't die they never do things like hold a postion while you flank because the second the bots find a path to you they simply run forward and wherever you're emerging from becomes the front line.\n\nMy advice: play Unreal Tournament on assualt maps. There's no poorly written story but the bots feel like actual members of your team and are actually working to acheive the same objective you are rather than just being placeholders to make you feel less alone.","March 25, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.\n\nI thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.\n\noverall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title.\n\nHovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles.\n\nmy oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself.\n\n\n","July 8, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the positive things. On to the negative.\nFirst off; it's sporting massive multiplayer online combat, with 64 people....while the servers are down. So don't even think about playing online anymore. After figuring that out, I gave a shot at the singleplayer campaign. It's the cheesy arcade-hall story: "Red Star Nation attacks the oil supplies in the Middle East. We must stop them!". The gameplay itself isn't much better. Your main rifle has the scatter of a shotgun as soon as you fire more than 1 shot at a time, vehicles drive clunky and the AI is abysmal. The AI actually gives more meaning to the "singleplayer" than it simply not being multiplayer, you actually feel like you play alone. At several instances I see one of my teammates and an enemy brotherly coming into a room or up the stairs. The enemy starts shooting me, while my teammate does nothing.\nWorst was when I encountered an enemy tank; it was parked right next to one of my own vehicles, which was shooting its machinegun at the enemy. Ofcourse it was equipped with a rocket, but hey, those are expensive I guess!\nHowever, the moment I got near the enemy noticed me and felt like it should shoot at me. Not much fun.

However, if you are looking for a long lasting FPS you can get tens of hours on, you won't. I played through the campaign twice and look at my hours. The campaign is alright, its cheesy at parts, but the voice acting is good. The guns shoot funny. The description also says its open world, which it isnt. It is very linear. If they mean that in the sense that you can walk around wherever on the map you are on, then that is correct, but it is definetly not like GTA or Assassins Creed in that sense.\nOverall, It's an okay game, fun while it lasts.","June 23, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That's the positive things. On to the negative.\nFirst off; it's sporting massive multiplayer online combat, with 64 people....while the servers are down. So don't even think about playing online anymore. After figuring that out, I gave a shot at the singleplayer campaign. It's the cheesy arcade-hall story: "Red Star Nation attacks the oil supplies in the Middle East. We must stop them!". The gameplay itself isn't much better. Your main rifle has the scatter of a shotgun as soon as you fire more than 1 shot at a time, vehicles drive clunky and the AI is abysmal. The AI actually gives more meaning to the "singleplayer" than it simply not being multiplayer, you actually feel like you play alone. At several instances I see one of my teammates and an enemy brotherly coming into a room or up the stairs. The enemy starts shooting me, while my teammate does nothing.\nWorst was when I encountered an enemy tank; it was parked right next to one of my own vehicles, which was shooting its machinegun at the enemy. Ofcourse it was equipped with a rocket, but hey, those are expensive I guess!\nHowever, the moment I got near the enemy noticed me and felt like it should shoot at me. Not much fun. Don't consider buying it.","June 23, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I semed to get hit a hell of a lot yet didnt seem to lose much in the way of health, and I found the constant birage of new spawning enemies somewhat unrealistic. however if you like a tactical run and gun style gameplay with constant enemy attacks to overcome then this is a good game choice.\n\nI thought the size of this game was a little on the high end. (above 10gb) but I gues for the age of it and the probable unnecessary programming for the time I cant complain to much. I just wish it had been a bit longer play time for the size.\n\noverall, now that I have the sound issue fixed, I found this to be an enjoyable title.\n\nHovever for the age and play, I found the original farcry to be a much better more well thought out game, except for the 2 stupidly annoying boss battles.\n\nmy oppinion if you want this game get it and you shouldnt regret it, but get the original farcry aswell and note the difference for yourself.\n\n\n","July 8, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was skeptical when I first got this game, thinking that it was going to be some cheesy rehash of the old school delta force series and graphics to match. What I found was a visually impressive game with some really fun mechanics and a storyline that was actually engaging. Frontline doesn't market itself well but in the age when everyone who owns a computer starts making crappy "Free-To-Play" games, I'm actually very pleased with it. I know it's a few years old but it was refreshing to see a non mainstream game/name (ie Halo) actually exceed my expectations. Parts of the game that are a bit wonky but all in all it kept me engaged for the duration of the Solo Campaign. And after all, isn't that all you can ask for in a video game? Maybe I was impressed because of my low expectations, or maybe, just maybe; might I dare to venture that Kaos Studios has actually made a decent one.","September 9, 2011","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
