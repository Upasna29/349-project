Modes for aaaall the tastes. For those who like challenges, there are levels and endless modes. For those who are creative, there is a mode for you and you can also test your skills building your own levels and shared them in the workshop. For those who just play with company, you can play with up to 7 friends in the same computer ("omg how's that even possible??"), and, just a warning: there will be a lot of tiny snakes. So if you don't like snakes you probably shouldn't be here... Kidding.\nAnd of course, I couldn't help to mention Nokia 3310's Snake. If you know what I'm talking about it's self-explainatory.\n\nWhat I enjoy the most about this game is the adventure mode and making commutiny levels (I already created some levels myself). I also liked the soundtrack. It's very pleasent and well chosen.","January 29","true","10.5"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","15","15","3","0"

Instead of moving vertically and horizontally, you are moving circular. This makes for an interesting game experience.\n\nAlso, the dev is a cool guy who listens to feedback and solves your issues, so that's a big plus. :)","January 29","true","6.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bashlet/recommended/404700/","Bashlet","Sam - Check out GameX on YT!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bashlet/","149 products in account","Curvatron is the most delightfully simple, elagant and infuriatingly ♥♥♥♥ing difficult piece of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played.\nAnd.... That's exactly why I've loved playing it thus far. I was given a copy of the game by the publisher to check it out. So far I haven't played enough to record my full video review of the game, but have played enough to recommend this out to any fan of the classic SNAKE.\n\nCurvatron has some of the smoothest graphics available, and while I may have considered it too simple for a game worth purchasing, I believe the mechanics and music are more than worth the purchase. There has been a lot of work put into the level design and different game modes.\n\nFinal Words\n\nI recommend Curvatron to anyone who loves SNAKE, but hates themselves.","February 29","true","0.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

I contributed music to level 16 and decided to quickly check out how it sounded in game. Sadly, I don't think I'll ever be able to get to that level, despite my initial plans of rushing through the first fifteen levels. That being said though, the game is really cool - I love the art style and the fact that there's only one control. I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you like arcade games.","February 4","true","1.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Yay!\n\nI like this game. It is easy to make levels and can be wonderfully frusterating to play. I made a bunch of levels using the doors, very hard.\n\nThat said, the Steam version will not run for me. My antivirus's (Avast and Malwarebytes) both flagged the installer as a problem. I forced them to ignore and it installed. It still does not play. It shows a window with a title of Curvatron and it is solid black, nothing happens.\n\nI talked to the developer and this is a problem with Steams "wrapper" for loading games in the Steam client. He plans a stand alone PC version - yay!","February 1","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
