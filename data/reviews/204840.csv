The gameplay, however, falls short of anything appealing. It may have been decent had the campaign missions been a bit shorter and if your powers had more variety, but when the game tasked me to drop rocks on workers' heads for 10 minutes straight, the novelty of the goofy death screams quickly wore off.\n\nIn short, Babel Rising is a towering example of a game that's simplistic and repetitive to a fault. Pass over it.","December 30, 2013","false","0.7"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","39","44","0","0"

So, what if he broaden a plague? No, that would be too easy, let's throw rocks and fireballs at people!\n\nDoes it sound fun? If you think so, I have a bad message for you - it's only for the first minute. The gameplay of the game is grindy, as you only throw elemental spells at people (just need a mouse for playing). That still would be not so bad, but let's explain it with level objectives:\n\n- Level 1: Kill 40 workers,\n- Level 2: Survive 20 waves of enemies (and each wave has ~5 workers),\n- Level 3: Kill 40 priests (and a priest usually comes with a each wave),\n- Level 4: Survive 8 minutes,\n- Level 5: Kill 450 workers.\n\nI hope that's enough to explain you how repetitive it is, thus boring. The game has few bugs worth mentioning, like local multiplayer that crashes the game, or a skill that crashes the game if you have an NVidia GPU (check discussions).\n\nWhile Babel Rising has a nice idea for a gameplay mechanics, it isn't fun at all, and nicer graphics can't help it. Don't even think about buying that.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 11","false","1.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","1"

You have 4 powers, earth, water, wind and fire and they all come with 3 powers. Left-clicking executes the most basic spell, and it's mostly used for small groups. Right-clicking allows you to take out multiple enemies and finally holding the middle mouse button will grant you the most powerful spell, like a flood or a rolling boulder. With these powers your goal is to stop the villagers from building a tower. If they complete it, it's game over. You have no other abilities or towers (except for your powers) to stop them so it's a bit primitive for a tower defense game.\nSo far I wouldn't recommend it. No, you're better off with TD games like Orcs Must Die or Anomaly.\n\n[Rating: 56/100]","August 12, 2012","false","1.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/recommended/204840/","albertrayon","albertrayon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/albertrayon/","1581 products in account","Babel Rising is a tower defense game developed by Mando and published by Ubisoft. I have no experience with other Mando games, but I've generally enjoyed games released by Ubisoft. Babel Rising goes against this trend.\n\nIt starts off with an interesting enough premise. There isn't really much of a story going on, but it's not hard to ascertain that the little people are trying to make a tower like Babel and as a god you have to stop them. There are 4 elemental powers at your disposal, and each power give you two abilities, a local and an area of effect. Use your elemental power enough to unleash a super attack over time.\n\nThe problem really arises after you get past the main idea of the game. It's a good start, but there is not enough to justify spending more than a couple minutes with it. Little people rush the tower, you attack them. There is a little variety to the enemy types, but it does not affect the gameplay much. Little people rush the tower, you attack them. When I found that the third mission would require me to defeat 40 of the priest type enemies, and they came at a rate of about 2 per minute, I couldn't stomach the idea of playing the round for 20 minutes. In addition, although you can mix it up a little with your attacks, there really isn't much difference between the various local and area powers.\n\nThe graphics are cartoonish and passable, but there are no advanced video options. You cannot change the resolution. I played with a 360 controller as I tend to whenever given the option, but there was a huge glitch with the controls. After completing a mission, there was no way to continue. It just locked on to the mission complete screen. While looking at the support forum I see this has been a problem since its release, so that's not changing anytime soon. If you want to play with a controller, prepare to ALT-Tab and quit the game in between missions. The controls may be better suited to keyboard and mouse anyway....\n\nThere isn't enough in Babel Rising to justify the price tag ($10 at this time). I could see this being a bundle purchase you might spend a few minutes in, but it will have trouble holding your attention for longer than that. This game might have been better as a iOS or Andriod mobile game if they weren't willing to flesh it out more.\n\nGrade: D-","August 20, 2014","false","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The consequence is that you don't feel 'in control" as you should.\n\nOtherwise graphics are great, music simple but effective and you will learn the hard way that being an angry god is quite difficult (too difficult perhaps...)\n\nSo I recommend this game if you intend to offer it to a friend as a simple gift or if you want to spend 5 minutes on it when you have nothing else to do. Do not expect anything more than raw mindless destruction and do not imagine you will spend hours on it.","September 11, 2012","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The starting levels are too slow and by the time it gets challenging it's past boring.  The sound loops fairly poorly as well and is like a sparatic fly in your ear.","February 23","false","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difference is that you are trying to defend a tower from hordes of workers with the help of your miracles and calamities.\n\n+ Cute visuals\n+ Nice soundtrack\n+ The levels don't take too long, making it suitable for short bursts of playing\n\n- It gets repetitive after the 10th mission mark; there isn't much variety\n- The last few levels are really difficult\n- Some glitches like mouse freezing, game crashing, etc.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game only if you're looking for a short game to play in limited free time. Not bad, but don't expect Anomaly Warzone level of entertaintment.","February 13","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
