hell yes you should get it, has a dark atmosphere to it , use your stealth and strategy to conquer monsters and reach the final level in this randomly generated game" - 8/10","January 8, 2015","true","6.4"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","33","46","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/recommended/333760/","Dzumeister","zooboo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzumeister/","308 products in account","Vintage Year is a twin stick shooting dungeon crawler with roguelike elements. The basic premise of the game is that you've been hired by a gentleman who calls himself The Connoisseur who tasks you with defending his family's precious wine from a vicious gang called the "Skull Faction". As you venture into his wine cellar, however, it's clear that there's other supernatural forces at play.\n\nThe game is often compared to other top down shooters like Nuclear Throne. Although both games share the same basic elements, they are quite different. Vlambeer's Throne has a faster, more arcade-like feel to its gameplay, while Vintage Year relies on stealthy tactics and careful planning. At the beginning of every level, you're given an opportunity to scout out the layout of the room. This gives the player a chance to strategize the best way to tackle all of the enemies on the floor; you must eliminate all of the Skull Faction before continuing. Levels are also shrouded in darkness, making it difficult to peer ahead to keep track of enemy movements. To counter this, you're given a limited amount of torches to place, adding more of a strategical aspect to the gameplay.\n\nFor its $5 price, Vintage Year offers a good amount of replay value. There's up to 16 different playable characters that you can unlock, each with their own unique perks. After every two completed levels, players have the chance to gain more perks, helping them continue through ever-increasingly difficult dungeons. Enemies, Mini-Bosses, and Bosses get progressively harder to overcome, making this game a suitable challenge for fans of roguelites and action games. There's a lot of the game that the dev has kept secret, leaving the player to discover the strange inner workings by themselves. Additionally, players can also unlock an alternate game mode, cosmetic hats (!!!), and mod their own characters into the game.\n\nStill, the game isn't perfect. The controls aren't remappable, and at times, movement doesn't feel as smooth as it should. Some parts are a little buggy, such as sometimes getting stuck inside walls and strange spike trap hitboxes. Graphically, the pixel sprites lack the creativity and charm that Nuclear Throne manages to capture, but the developer, Nooner Bear, makes up for it with a chilling atmosphere that keeps the player on their toes. He's still adding bugfixes and patches to the game, so it can only get better from here.\n\nVintage Year is a solid game that delivers a lot in a small package. It offers a good amount of replayability through procedurally generated levels, challenging gameplay, and many player unlocks. It definitely shines most as a quick game to take breaks with since you can go on quick runs to try and beat your high scores. This game is a great stepping stone into shooter roguelites and is definitely worth the asking price. You should definitely consider picking this up, considering the $4.99 vs. $12.99 Nuclear Throne asks for. However, both games have their own merits. Even if you own Vlambeer's popular product, this is a good investment for a different experience. If you like games that are easy to pick up and play but are difficult to beat, this indie gem is a good addition to your gaming collection.\n\nTL;DR: For fans of Nuclear Throne, Teleglitch, Cavern Kings, and other shooter roguelikes.","March 2, 2015","true","2.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dstecks/recommended/333760/","dstecks","DStecks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dstecks/","283 products in account","Stylish and uncompromising, but rough in ways that wouldn't be so forgivable at a higher price point.\n\nVintage Year is a low-key roguelike overhead shooter, and here roguelike doesn't simply mean "permadeath". Vintage Year embraces the old-school roguelike style of giving the player very little information and forcing them to figure it out. It mostly works, with the gameplay being simple enough that you can learn just by fooling around, and the fast-paced live-die-repeat gameplay helps this.\n\nYou never feel like you lose much progress by making a blind choice, but sometimes the very minimal UI can be frustrating if you already know how things work, you just can't remember which item is which. Some players will find the experimentation-driven learning very rewarding, but some may find it simply frustrating.\n\nThe gameplay is rather polished, but one major area shows weakness: enemy pathfinding. Levels are randomly generated and mazelike, and the enemies have an extremely hard time navigating if there is a hard wall between them and you. And this isn't something that comes up every once in a while; enemies literally do not know how to move around a wall to line up a shot. In some ways this works to the game's benefit; if the AI could navigate better then the already hard game would be even harder, but to see the AI fail so regularly is amateurish.\n\nVintage Year is rather difficult, since you have very limited health and it is only replenished by (very rarely) randomly found health pick-ups. Using all the tools the game provides you is vital, as is caution. Stumbling into a room without a very good idea of what's all in it can be deadly. While unforgiving, the difficulty feels fair, though one sometimes wishes for some kind of non-random healing.\n\nThe biggest failing is in the UI. It seems designed for a controller, but the gameplay requires precision I wouldn't trust to a controller. Frankly, if you're making a PC game, main menus that can't be navigated purely through the mouse are an unforgivable sin. And furthermore, the game is inconsistent: sometimes WASD can be used to navigate menus, sometimes the arrow keys need to be used. Sometimes things are selected with the mouse, sometimes with E, and sometimes, bafflingly, with the enter key.\n\nFinally, the progression system is very minimal, only giving unlockable characters and cosmetic items for characters. This isn't a terrible flaw, but its implentation feels more like an ingame-currency DLC store than a true progression system, in that the things you unlock may not help you get further in the game at all, and are simply alternate options to enhance replayability.\n\nOverall, the biggest factor in my recommendation is the price. At 10 dollars I would not recommend this game, when you could get Hotline Miami for the same. But at $5.49 it's worth a look if you like roguelikes or overhead shooters. I don't know how much more I'll really play this thing, but I've definitely gotten $5.49 worth of fun out of it.","April 24, 2015","true","2.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is what it looks like. It's a roguelike top down shooter. The core gameplay is intense and quick, but not overwhelming like Nuclear Throne is. No random perks, the same perk tree every time. Random guns but every gun generally does the same damage as every other gun in its class. No shop. Ongoing currency just unlocks characters with slightly different perks. It plays lightning quick. The final act is a huge difficulty ramp though but it's still quite doable compared to other roguelike action games. Hell, the design is solid enough it could almost pass for a real arcade game rather than yet another roguelike. The pure shooting and dodging is satisfying. A nice relaxing game worth the cost.\n\nIt's got a more measured pace and tighter balancing than Nuclear Throne and I think that's for the best at the cost of NT's sheer love of random chaos.","January 7, 2015","true","2.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gtfolawlz/recommended/333760/","gtfolawlz","Revolver Talksalot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gtfolawlz/","284 products in account","In a nutshell - Nuclear Throne's gameplay (at a slightly slower pace) + Cthulhu Mythosesque atmosphere + persistant unlocks = a light romp best enjoyed in short bursts.\n\nStandard top-down shooter with an eery atmosphere, intensified by your need to put down candles in order to see your foes (which, by the way, you have a limited number of). You start off with four characters (my favorite giving a heavily increased rate of fire) and unlock the rest, either by completing hidden objectives or buying them at the shop. Additionally, you can unlock starting spells, which operate as a single and constant perk for the entire run.\n\nWeapons wise, you're given a variety ranging from your standard pew-pew pistol to the more creative volcano cannon to get the job done. If you happen to pulp something particularly hard, character-specific flavor text will pop over their corpse (if you're playing as the Bear, it just goes "rawr" when someone is turned inside out).\n\nI've got minimal playtime, yes, but I'm sure the game will keep me occupied for fifteen minute intervals for quite some time. It does a very good job of dangling the carrot of progression over your head to keep you moving along, while not forcing significant investments of time in one go. A very good example of a touch-and-go roguelite shooter.","January 7, 2015","true","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As the levels are random generated.\nYou can choose between multiple characters with different attributes. like lifesteal or high aim.\nYou get money in-game which you could spend to upgrade or buy unlockments.\nYou will not lose the money if you die or quit.\n\nThere is some downside to this game aswell. Camera is a bit weird and i dislike the melee camera alot.\nIf you hack an enemy and you hit them. the camera is totally going away from your character. So you will not see yourself and the enemy for a second.\nYou can also hit enemies through walls with a melee weapon.\n\nMusic is short and looping alot.\nOnce you have spawned on a level you will remain invisible, so you can scout ahead first and every area. Enemies will not harm you unless it is a boss.\nThere are light sources in the game and it is very dark in some area. It's not a requiement or  a must have in order to beat a level. But it will help alot.\nBullets are bouncing at walls, so u could use that to kill an enemy who is hiding.\nAmmo COULD be limited. Each weapon type has their own kind of ammo.\n\nThe game is quite great though.\n\nIll give this 7/10","October 24, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As such this game is no longer recommended and the review has been updated accordingly.\n\nThis is yet another game inspired by the revival of the roguelike genre that binding of issac has done for the gaming community. The game itself is fun but it feels significantly unpolished and unbalanced... It's basically nuclear throne but inferior in almost every way. There is no proper font for things such as the amount of corks you have, and the game crashes while exiting, etc. There are bugs and very poor balancing, pretty much all of the deaths you get will be cheap and ridiculous ones. Furthermore, there are no explanations for upgrades you find by placing torches in the right places. It also lacks achievements. Normally I don't care about achievements in video games, but as this is a roguelike, having no achievements severly reduces the game's replayability. The music in the trailer is not found in this game, instead the game music is actually far more fitting towards the game and is quite good. Despite the game's cheap price, I cannot recommend this game for anyone and I would advice all those interested in this game to go buy nuclear throne instead. If you have already gotten bored of nuclear throne and you're looking for something similar then maybe you should buy this, but just remember, it feels lesspolished than nuclear throne in early access.","October 12, 2015","false","2.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Main mechanics are shooting and placing lightsources as visibility is a problem.\nJust first impressions of this piece: I found it to be quite a poor title in all honesty. Having a USB joypad plugged in seems to cause the game some problems, especially given that the control prompts are for K&M.\nI got stuck in the wall twice in the first half an hour of gameplay, so I've given up on it.\nOthers might well get more mileage from this, but it's not for me.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrGZJBABcbc&list=UUiWKzsh27Mo_8WVnVqc2DyQ","January 13, 2015","false","0.5"," 3 of 19 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","3","19","0","0"

The game immediately forces you threw a tutorial with text that appears too slowly before you can even get to the menu, and the gameplay is simplistic and kind of crap. The text has legibility problems due to the extreme 'retro' "I have no skill as an artist" graphics, and honestly I just did not enjoy it at all. Only forced myself through it long enough to get the trading cards.\n\nThis may be up some people's ally for a simple, quick paced-ish shooter dungeon game thing, but it isn't coming close to mine.","February 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 1 of 15 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","1","15","0","0"

Even though I haven't spent alot of time playing, I can honestly say just go buy Nuclear Throne. It is better in almost every category.\n\nDon't get me wrong - it seems the devs put their heart into this cute little piece, but I really don't think it can compete with NT and it is just so dang similiar. It just feels like NT.\n\nI think this needs more content to seperate itself from NT. It can totally be done, but more work needs to happen.","January 9, 2015","false","0.6"," 5 of 25 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","5","25","2","2"

You have been sent by a wine enthusiast to infiltrate his wine cellar and protect his priceless wine from the bandits that reside there. There are plenty of characters and cosmetics to unlock (all with funny wine names!) as well as plenty of weapons to be found throughout the levels.

While on the surface it might appear to be a slightly different take on the roguelike genre (with nods to titles such as Nuclear Throne), it actually has so much more to offer. The premise in particular is very interesting and surprisingly unique. You have been tasked by a being known only as “The Connoisseur” to weed out undesirable bandits and evil spirits from a dungeon-like wine cellar. Along the way you’ll become imbued with paranormal abilities and find a plethora of weapons with which to dispatch your foes. What really sold me on this game, and what makes it stand apart from other top-down shooter roguelikes, is how much strategy is involved. Peeping from behind a wall, planting torches, and planning out an attack are not only par for the course in Vintage Year, but necessary for your continued survival.","January 3","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
