That scores it bonus points in my book for innovation alone. An interesting idea alone doesn't make a good game but AirBuccaneers is executed, not flawlessly mind you, but well enough to make for a very enjoyable gaming experience. It has come a long way since it started as an Unreal Tournament mod in 2003.\n\nBefore I go into the details I have to tell you my main gripe I have with this game, it will most likely be a dealbreaker if you're considering a purchase. It's multiplayer only and the community is pretty much dead, if you login today you will most likely find all servers empty. A problem far too many old, indie or non-mainstream multiplayer games face.\nTry it with a group of friends or join a Steam group that is dedicated to organizing AirBuccaneers sessions.\n\nAirBuccaneers pitches two teams of air-balloon crews, "Vikings" and "Buccaneers", against each other in exciting ship-on-ship battles. Each player assumes a role of his or her choice, a role that can be switched fluently during the game. Pilot a ballon and order yor crew around as a helmsman, man a cannon as cannoneer, repair damage done to your balloon, engage in ranged or melee combat (yes, enemy ships can be grapple-hooked onto and boarded), set up floating mines or support a teammate (for example one of the cannoneers to allow him to fire at a faster rate).\n\nCannons are far from accurate, so skill in this regard doesn't matter as much as in many other first person action games and if you consider your aim still not good enough that's not a problem either: Just assume another role that suits you better.\n\nAs you may already have guessed, teamwork is everything. The fact that you're totally dependent on your fellow crew members simply doesn't allow to play as a lone wolf and leads to almost organically developing teamwork very fast.\n\nThe only persistent element of the game are the skill trees, a different one for each role. Which path you take is not entirely up to you but progression is assigned automatically depending on your actions during matches. To me, this feature feels superfluous, I never had the feeling that it influences the outcome of a match at all. Maybe that's because every perk is evened out with a debuff and that's probably better than having new players start at a disadvantage.\n\nInstead, the game allows for imbalance in another way: Since players can switch teams any time they want in absence of an autobalance system it leaves it entirely in the hands of the participants to form evenly sized teams.\n\nIn conlusion, I'd recommend AirBuccaneers to everyone if it weren't for the lack of a player base. It certainly is a game that deserves to be revived, I still hope that it will at some point but wouldn't hold my breath.","July 31, 2014","true","4.8"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","46","54","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/recommended/223630/","kermamrek","Kerma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/","289 products in account","It's hard to give airbuccaneers a fair review. It really is. Why? Because as of writing, both servers up right now have 0/32 players.\n\nI really doubt anyone will even read this review, only because this is a game time forgot. I bought it when it first came out on steam, and since nothing has changed since other than going free to play (with no bonus for people who previously bought, something that would anger most people but I had my fun with it so I feel it's only fair) all I can do is reminisce on previous times I've played this game in 2013 when it wasn't horribly dead.\n\nI feel like AirBuccaneers is a game that if it had a thriving playerbase it wouldn't be at "mixed" of 60% positive ratings. It's rough around the edges- but not in a way that negatively impacts the game. The game works like most air combat simulators, you fly around in airships and shoot different types of weapons at the enemy while the pilot tries to steer you out of the way of projectiles incoming so you don't horribly crash and burn to your pitiful death. What makes AirBuccaneers different than guns of icarus? Ground combat. It's a lie to say you can walk to your enemies base and kill them via one on one fistfights as the ground is covered in poisonous mushrooms, but in AirBuccaneers you spawn in your home base and can choose what ship to board either by walking onto a docked one or using an hangglider to get to one in the air. But how does this equate into ground combat? You have free movement and aren't locked onto your ship, meaning it's a legitimate strategy to either dismount your hangglider in mid air and jump onto the enemy's ship or to jump from your own and engage in proper swashbuckling- or just take their helm and drive their ship into a cliff. You can also use one of the diverse ship types like the Kamikaze ship that instantly destroys anything when touched (but it horrendously underarmoured) or the massive, immobile fort that has a huge cannon on it but can only move via air maneuver which takes a long time to recharge.\n\nAnother great thing about airbuccaneers is the perks and flaws system. I found this very unique at the time, and it still sticks out to me as one of the only multiplayer games that has something like this. There are very overpowered perks in each level progression tree that you can pick to make yourself better suited to one role, but there are negatives in that tree (or other trees) you must choose from as well. This would be just OK if the perks were something generic like "move 10% faster" or "repair 20% slower", but they're all mostly fun stuff like "you're drunk and your screen is tilting", "you don't take fall damage", "you have an eyepatch over half of your screen", and "your gun works like russian roulette and has a random chance of killing you". I didn't get that far in the perk tree as this game died pretty quickly, but it was the main thing that kept me playing and I really wish another multiplayer game would pick up something similar.\n\nSo all that positive said, do I recommend AirBuccaneers? Hell yes, if you can find players. It's free to play now, and is a great arcadey game with an interesting character creation system. I just really wish it wasn't dead.","March 17, 2015","true","10.9"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kissamies/recommended/223630/","Kissamies","Kissamies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kissamies/","423 products in account","In brief: Great idea, unfinished execution. Good game but no players. Free demo available. Free to play\n\nThere are many FPS games with vehicles these days, but not so many that are all about the vehicles. There is also many that are supposedly about teamwork, but people end up lonewolfing anyways. AirBuccaneers emphasises the teamwork alot. You can fly a ship alone, but usually you are much better off with a crew. Compared to the other game with similar premise, Guns of Icarus Online, ABu is more sandboxy and free while GoIO feels like it's more "serious business".\n\nThe game does have some problems, however. Even though there was a lenghty public alpha and beta testing stages, it feels like the final features implemented in the release were rushed and not tested and balanced properly. This would have been fine if there had been proper post-release support, but the few patches after release have been relatively minor and not about gameplay issues. The developers were communicating at first, but now have fallen silent and seemingly moved on to other projects. This has caused the community to wither and die. Great as this game is, it's not so fun with just few players. There is bots, but with just them it's barely fun at all.\n\nTo go into more detail what the unfixed problems are, first of all there is the perks and flaws, which should have been tested and balanced much more. I don't think the idea is bad in and of itself, a sort of "build your own" class system, but the implementation is poor. There is some combinations of perks that are very overpowered and there are flaws that you barely notice and some that can be used to your advantage. Then there is the exploits that should have been fixed soon after they were discovered, but have not. The somewhat awkward team selection system, which often leads to uneven teams, is also a problem, as is the team scoring system, which could have used refinement. One of the more annoying problems is a some sort of memory leak issue with the Unity engine they couldn't solve and instead made the servers reboot periodically. This is bad because it breaks down matches that have been snowballing and gathering players.\n\nA great concept that would have been great game with some more work. I like the original Unreal Tournament 2004 mod's atmosphere better, and there is some minor things I'd like to have seen recreated in this game, like UT's "don't walk over the edge" code, but overall this standalone version is better. I still recommend it despite all the problems. The lack of players brought by the other issues is a serious problem, though. Beware. If you can try it with a group of friends, you can at least avoid being alone against bots.\n\nSome other notes:\n- This game is quite different from the usual FPS's you might be familiar with and you will have to spend some time to figure out how to play it. There is no real ingame tutorial, but there is a manual, video tutorials[www.airbuccaneers.com] and Steam Community guides.","December 20, 2012","true","462.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

Then AirBuccaneers might be something for you.\n\nAirBuccaneers is a slow paced Action FPS (yes I said slow...). You pick one of the two teams (Buccaneers vs. Vikings), afterwards you will spawn on land. From there you're able to walk towards one of the few airships and take controll of them. There are a few different airships for you to choose some are big, some are small. Just to be clear; you are able to fight on land but this rarely happens.\n\nAfter you've chosen one of the Airships and up in the air, it's time to search the enemy. You can walk freely on your airship and switch between steering and controlling the cannons.  When steering you are able to boost your ship into any direction you feel like, after each boost you will have to wait a while to use it again.\n\nBecause the game is slow paced, strategy and timing are the most important aspects. Flying the airships is slow, even aiming/firing your cannons is slow. If you are too close to an enemy ship they are able to jump on your ship, kill you and hijack your ship, which can be pretty fun. There are various weapons for you to use aswell like melee weapons and grenades.\n\nIf you've played for a while you're able to level up your character, pick different perks and also gain new clothes/armor.\n\nOriginally being a Unreal Tournament 2k4 mod, AirBuccaneers feels and plays like a mod. The controlls are a little bit clunky and the graphics are not up to date anymore, it did not bother me much personally though.\n\nOverall, AirBuccaneers is a refreshing and original game, something you've probably never played before. Will you play this game for 4 hours straight? Probably not, but it's a great game to return to every once in a while. At the time of writing, I found out the game is Free To Play, so there is no reason not to try it. I would've recommended it even if there was a price tag, just try it!\n\n\n\n","March 2, 2015","true","4.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

There's a good number of strategies and roles you can take on.\n\nThe perks/flaws system is a great idea too, where picking a new perk as you level up means you have to pick a 'flaw' as well. The problem is, going up in levels is far too slow - a terrible grind. The game starts to get repetitive well before you've unlocked most things.

Well, it could be that game. Unfortunately, nobody plays it.\nI've been [trying] to play it for the past couple of days and have had a grand total of 2 populated sessions. With a few exceptions, it was the same group of players each time. I'm not really surprised that this is the case, have you heard about Air Buccaneers? It was featured on Steam when it released, but then it just sort of vanished.\n\nThe developers seem to be neglecting it too – when I first played it near release among my first thoughts were “wow, this will be great with a bit of polish and some content updates.” I don't think either have happened. A quick visit to the Steam community forums would show you that the small player base echoes this opinion.\n\nIt's a crying shame, really. Air Buccaneers could be a really fun game. During my time playing I met a player called Keel and truly were we the gods of the wind! Single handedly we held off barrages from. . . AI controlled airships because only one other person was in the game. While I'm glad that bots take over when there aren't enough players, it's just not as satisfying. Especially since AI ships can't be boarded and captured – which is one of my favourite aspects of Air Buccaneers.\nSeldom did me and Keel get a chance to clumsily weave through a barrage of cannon fire, pull up to the enemy and leap through the skies – swords in hand – to claim an enemy ship for our own. But when it happened, it was glorious.\n\nAir Buccaneers has 3 game modes: Deathmatch, Domination and Protect The Golden Ship.\nIn Deathmatch you blow up enemy ships to score points, in domination you blow up enemy ships to score points and in Protect The Golden Ship you blow up enemy ships to score points but also have to blow up the golden ship – One team defends and the other attacks. So there isn't much variance there.\n\nThere are 3 roles in Air Buccaneers. Captain, shooter and Everything Else Guy.\nThe captain pilots the ship, shouting out orders to the crew and calling out the locations of enemy ships. The shooters man the cannons, manually aiming the cannon and trying to predict the ball's trajectory [there is no aiming reticle]. The Everything Else Guy does everything else, if you aren't behind the wheel or behind the cannon then you're fixing the ship, spotting enemy ships, firing off air-mines or supporting the cannons by reducing the cooldown time on their shots.\nThe roles are flexible, at any time the captain can ditch the wheel and hop on the cannons or the shooter can decide he's had enough of missing shots and instead just leap onto the enemy ship to engage in an exciting battle of who can click their sword the fastest. Melee combat leaves much to be desired, which makes boarding less exciting than it could be. But is melee combat really important in a game about piloting an airship to shoot other airships?\n\nThere are 4 types of ships in Air Buccaneers. As before I'm going to make up their names because I don't think the names of anything are mentioned anywhere in game.\nFirst up you have what I call the Classic. Not particularly fast, four cannons and hardy enough to soak up a few cannons before dropping out of the sky. Then you have the Speedy McGoFast; only one cannon, fairly small and weak, fast enough to get close enough to an enemy ship to initiate a surprise boarding party.\nThere is also the Flying Fortress. Very slow, very big, I think it has a strong defence? I've never actually seen a cannon hit it. It's an incredibly long ranged cannon platform that nobody really uses. And finally you have the OH COME ON. A speedy little kamikaze ship fit for one person. No cannons because you are the cannon. Pick a target and smash right into them, sacrificing yourself for the good of the team [only to respawn a second later to do it again].\n\nI took a break from writing this to see if I could play Air Buccaneers. Nobody was online.\n\nSo, would I recommend Air Buccaneers? Well it depends on how many people are listening to me. A couple of friends? Probably not. The servers are too empty. But if I had an audience of enough people to populate servers? Heck yeah. It's a fun game that's worth checking out if you have a large enough group of people to actually play.","January 3, 2014","true","8.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has good graphics, fun gameplay and simple and easy to navigate menus (including a well thought out in-game tutorial). If you can get this on sale and you have a bunch of friends to play it with, go for it! I wholeheartedly recommend this title, just please note that the community is currently dead, it certainly needs a revival or a group (which I'm sure exists) to schedule a play session for you to be likely to see another player online.

AirBuccaneers is one of those diamonds. Ludocraft's old Unreal Tournament 2004 mod has got its facelift.\n\nAlthough a bit rusty from the edges, the basic gameplay in AIrBuccaneers is worth it. Two teams, Vikings and Buccaneers are battling for the domination of the air space with different kind of balloons differing from little kamikaze ones to big battleships and floating bases.\n\nFor a new player it can be a bit hard to get into the game, though compared to the old mod, AirBuccaneers is much more gently. There isn't really a game like AirBucs, especially in terms of gameplay.\n\nThere's perhaps only two flaws in the game, for me at least. One is the not-so-big player population. But, eh, that can be fixed, because AirBuccaneers deserves more players. The second flaw is a bit clumsy melee action, but one can live with it.\n\nI recommend this game for everyone from the bottom of my heart!","January 20, 2013","true","19.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Folks who are giving it bad reviews simply haven't played it in the right environment.\n\nIt's also a TON easier to play since the UT2k4 version, since you don't need separate people to load, aim and fire the cannons.

Most your time is spent waiting on a slow airbaloon across the map. Not to mention fire times for the weapons are slow. Slow movment with slow firetimes and lack of players doesnt befit "Action" games.\n\nThe game could be improved by having a fast way for players to get from one ship to another to do FPS PVP while the slow airships try to destroy eachother. Think of the baloons more like destructable contol points, each team needs at least one ship to survive and loosing all your ships eather by being destroyed or loosing control of all your ships would be considered defeat. It would be likable to games such as Unreal Tournament or Team Fortress 2 but with its own unique spin on gameplay elements. Such a mechanic could solve the issues regarding game speed and add an extra insentive to players in that there are more rewards involved than simply being the last baloon floating.","August 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

Also nice strategy - take more money, deliver less content.\n\nIt seems unfinished to me, and is one of the reasons (besides The Forest and some other unfinished alpha games) why I will never support unfinished projects like this anymore.

Had I done so, I would ahve found out that this game is an online multiplayer game to that of which the multiplaying community is dead. I am sure I did not spend a lot of money on this game, but still was a little let down to see that it was dead.\n\nThe graphics are nice and the gameplay mechanics seemmed fine. I wish I could offer up a little more information on this product. Hoever, it really doesn't matter... the community for this game is dead.

There are no players anywhere even though the game is now free. My guess is that people try it once, don't get it and abandon it forever.\n\nAnd finally, this game is ugly.

It doesn't know whether it wants to be an FPS, a third person game or an RPG. When it tries to do all three of these things, it does them poorly. When shooting you snap into first person and when sword fighting you snap over to third person view. It can be slightly disorienting when there is a lot of crap going on in and around your ship. Fighting is slow but more importantly it's not that exciting. Combat consist mainly of missing with a crap load of cannon shots. Of course when you do land a hit you actually do feel like you accomplished something for once during the round. The steering of the ship itself feels clunky and clumsy at times almost as if you blindfolded a fat drunk guy and told him to walk to the other side of a room without crashing into anything.\n\nBut the thing that was really discouraging about this game was the tutorial (It was painful and unhelpful).\n\nRed flag #1- They give you your first tutorial during your first live match up against other players (Bad move)\nAs they were giving me the basics, I hopped on the nearest ship and got going. A prompt came up and said "Use the mouse to look around to the left and right on your ship. You want know what happened after that? I turn to my left and a cannon ball hits me in my face, explodes my ship and I go plummeting to the ground like Wily Coyote.\n\nRed flag #2- They gave me vague answers as to what my equipment does. You start off with this wooden spoon/lolipop looking thing in your hand (Found out later that's what you use to repair your crew's ship.) There's literally no animation that shows you repairing anything but you'll know you're fixing something when plus signs start coming out of the floor. (I found that quite strange.)\n\nRed flag #3- The game gives you the option to go kamakaze on enemy ships so if the enemy feels they are in a loosing battle, the next best thing to do is kill themselves and take as many of your crew with them. Worst case scenario it could turn into a giant kamakaze match.\n\nRed flag #4- As mentioned before by others there's not a lot of people on here so there are times you might be greatly outnumbered during a match or you may not find a match at all.\n\nEven though I don't recommend it, I can definitely see this game becoming one of those cult classics with some people. It has a kind of charm to it that if you got a boatload of your friends into a match, it might actually be quite goofy and entertaining. This is definitely a team essential game so make sure your crew at least knows what to do and how to do it if you're thinking about giving this game a try. This game still has potential and believe it or not I really hope this game does better than what it's doing now.","December 14, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Bad Gameplay\n2. Bad movement\n3. Really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying HUD\n4. More lame movement\n5. You can't control the glider just select the ship you want to go to and spin 360 degrees for minutes.\n6. Cannons have really ♥♥♥♥ing slow movement\n7. not much players\n8. Cannons don't even have a crosshair\n9. Sword is probably the most useless weapon ever\n10. you fall in the water you die, but the game warns you about stupid ♥♥♥♥ing mushrooms, like seriously?\n11. The tutorial doesn't really show you anything, like how to operate a cannon, or how to operate a ship.\nHere's the tutorial in short. look around > Move > bring out your sword > put down your sword > Go to the glider > Go land on a ship > GO DESTROY A ♥♥♥♥ING SHIP WHICH YOU HAVE NO ♥♥♥♥ING IDEA HOW TO ACTUALLY DO IT BECAUSE YOU'RE A NEW PLAYER.\n12. Only multiplayer.\n13. 3D models look like ♥♥♥♥ from up close.\n14. That tornado. Is it just for show?\n\nPros:\n1. Good idea and concept of the game\n2. Great environment\n3. Really nice scenery, You can view some of my screenshots in my profile.\n4. Free to play. Yippe.\n5. THE ONLY THING THATS BEAUTIFUL ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE SPEC MODE.\n6. Nope. Thats pretty much about it.\n\nHope Devs fix this game because i will not play this game because i want to play this game. I would probably just go for a spin in the spec mode and take a few screenshots lol.\n\n6/10 because of the good scenery. If it didn't had that i don't know how low i would have rated.\nI would only recommend if you want to download 600mb to get some great view of battleships in the air with viking pirates and a freaking giant tornado in the middle of the battlefield which pretty much does nothing.","December 14, 2014","false","0.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
