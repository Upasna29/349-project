They are from the PS4 version of the game. What you are actually buying is a pretty rubbish PS3 port that looks remarkably like the back of a bus. The Fox Engine, that thing that MGS uses on PC, is nowhere to be seen.\n\nPlayer animations are jerky, goalkeepers have all had a mandatory full frontal lobotomy and play like David James with Parkinsons.\n\nIn addition this\n\n- an internet connection is always required (no mention of this on Steam page)\n- No dedicated PC settings what so ever (just 'Low', 'Medium' and 'High')\n- Teams are all out of date\n- Microtransactions\n\nIf the game were ten pounds, and the screenshots and videos actually showed the product you were going to get, then yeah, maybe worth a quick look. At four times that price you have to wonder if someone at Konami is having a laugh.","September 18, 2015","false","31.9"," 521 of 553 people (94%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","94","521","553","57","3"

Not the same game engine found on the XBONE or PS4, low res textures and no 4K (2560x1600 is the highest I saw) or SLI support. Not that you'd need SLI as one GTX 980 will run the game at max settings and use up anywhere from 10-20% of GPU performance during zoomed out gameplay and around 40% during upclose replays.\n\nAnother issue is transfers, a ton of players are still at their old clubs. Perhaps during the time consuming port Konami managed to not do a roster update.\n\nThese issues are probably why they never released a PC Demo. Thank goodness for Steam's return policy, after 10 minutes of gameplay this one is going back ASAP.\n\nI wanted to like PES 2016 and had high hopes for it after seeing what they did with the latest MGS title for PC. EA only doing marginal updates to FIFA is killing me and I don't want to give them anymore cash. It's a real shame because this title looks and plays so well on PS4.","September 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 674 of 755 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","674","755","18","12"

Keepers practically let in goals and even winning the game, I felt no satisfaction whatsoever.

This PES is a good football game.\nSome say graphics are not good for PC, I say they're fine.\nIt runs smoothly at max settings on my not-so-high-end-machine, and I quite enjoy the graphics. Ok, crowds are ridiculous, but it's not what I'm looking for in a football game.\nGameplay is nice. Movements are well done, shooting is satisfying, players really look like their real-life counterpart... everything ok here.\nYes, refrees tend to be a little bit too british, if you know what I mean: in order to get a yellow card you have to backstab your opponent with a knife. Decapitation may reward you with a red card. All other fouls just don't get signaled. I can live with it. Oh and goalkeepers tend to be somehow sleepy and you may concede goals that would otherwise be saved by a 2nd division goalkeeper, but that's "ok" too... I'm willing to forgive all this to Konami this year, but...\n\nONLINE IS BROKEN!\n\nSome say matchmaking takes forever. This is partly true. Sometimes it finds a match within a few minutes, sometimes it takes longer, sometimes it takes forever... but I guess that's because noone's playing online and know why? Because no matter how good your pc is and no matter how fast your connection is,\n\nyou will get a 1 second button delay in online matches...\n\nthat means you want to slide tackle? you will end up missing the ball, missing the player and you'll find yourself lying on the pitch alone, while the attacker has already scored... nice eh?\nI looked everywhere to find a solution. Don't even bother (nagle's algorythm, windowed fullscreen, gpu settings, you'll find those tips everywhere... guess what? no difference. AT ALL)\n\nTHIS IS RIDICULOUS, UNACCEPTABLE, AND A TOTAL JOKE\n\nIf it doesn't get patched within this year this will be the last time I'll put money on a KONAMI game. EVER.\n\nSo be warned, if you plan to play online, don't even bother getting this game.\nIf you plan to play it offline it MAY be a good game IF fouls and goalkeepers get patched.\n\nAlso, before the upcoming patch that should update squads and add a few teams, KONAMI has done a worse job than ever before (if possible). Summer market has been barely taken into consideration, even for licensed teams. That's unacceptable too. And planning an update more than a month after release is even less acceptable. How comes that FIFA's squads are always (ALWAYS!) up to date on release (or at least they try...)? They must have some magic skills...\n\nHELLO KONAMI?!?\n\nEDIT 30/10/2015\nI need to update this review after the "big update" has been released. Guess why? Because they managed to ♥♥♥♥ this up one more time! Transfers are not completely updated, they simply skipped the last day of transfer market, so needless to say, they skipped a MASSIVE part. Still no sign of gameplay or online performance updates. WORST PURCHASE EVER. WORST GAMING COMPANY EVER. They're fooling their customers around. STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME AND FROM EVERY OTHER KONAMI GAME, JUST LET THEM DIE, THEY DESERVE IT!","October 22, 2015","false","36.0"," 106 of 123 people (86%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","86","106","123","24","3"

But still disappointed for not getting a better version for PC. It shows the lack of commitment. Master League mode isn't improved as much because it still has unreallistic transfers and it doesn't help the fact of launching a game with outdated transfers either. Online mode it's a tad better from last years but it's still P2P connection so eventually it will die and it will probably be flodded by pirate versions.The screenshots advertising this game... yes they are from PS4 version basically it's a click bait tatic and half of those features are not even visible in the PC port.\nI'm writting an honest review because I actually like the gameplay but for having so many flaws around it makes it harder to defend it. I would say that same thing happened to other games like the new Batman game that was a fiasco. I just ask Valve to have better control over the companies so they wouldn't set so high prices over outdated ports on PC.\n\nI give this game 5.5/10 - Fun at stages but as a PC gamer you get half the experience. You better have a PS4/XBOX one to play the complete game.","September 19, 2015","false","2.7"," 86 of 95 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","86","95","0","1"

The gameplay wasn't as revolutionary as I kept reading everywhere and the graphic quality seemed like I was playing a 1999 simulator. This couldn't be right. It was "the return of the king" as I kept reading. The 20th anniversary edition. Well, it was only when I had the chance to play it in the Xbox One that I understood the real scenario. It is indeed "the return of the king" but only for last gen consoles. PC users only get a lousy PS3 port that is nowhere near the PS4/XB1 versions.\nAlso, the screenshots and videos in the Steam Page don't seem to be from the PC version.

So I've been playing this series since the beginning. Now, I don't know who quality-controls this game in KONAMI, but after 20 years, this game still repeating the same flaw over and over again.\n\nLet me start with the PROs:\n\n1. Good gameplay, improved animation and realism.\n\n2. Very nice Master League, probably the best in the series.\n\nThe CONs:\n\n1. Let me start with the interface.\na. Very ♥♥♥♥ interface design. They couldn't do it right with sophisticated design in the PS3 series (forgot which years), now they ruin it with ugly minimalistic design. They should learn from Google or other app designer who design minimalistic design with beauty. Champions League license saved them because some scoreboard has been improved since they licensed and copied its design.\nb. The interface itself is troublesome and not made easy to navigate. You need to press so many button to quit the game. You need to follow so many step to go into command list in training mode. Then to resume the game, you can't just press start, but have to press B (or O) that many steps. And I don't know why the interface is very laggy, at best very low framerate like it's lagging. Note that I have GTX 970 and play the game itself smoothly.\n\n2. The replay. OMG who approved this kind of replay? It is recorded like some baby holds the camera.\na. The height/ vertical angle is bad. I suspect this is because KONAMI wants to show off that they made a very nice grass and balls and stadium. Surprise, who cares? Well I do care about them but they are only ambiance, not the focus itself. The game should be the focus not the grass or the balls. KONAMI is repeating the same mistake like PES 2011 or something that showed kickoff with a very low angle because they wanted to show off the stadium they made. And it's the third or fourth year they have this ♥♥♥♥ replay mode.\nb. The width/ horizontal angle is also bad. I often can't see the beauty of the play or the tricky strategy of the attempt. I mean they really should watch the REAL European football game like Serie A or BPL or Champion League itself. They do the replay right. We can see the player who passes, who shoots, the defenders, and the goalie. That's the right replay. How difficult it is to copy/mimic that?\n\n3. If you cross/pass from the left flank, you still shoot with the closest foot (which is left foot). This has been happening the last 10 years and no one to fix this?\n\n4. Captaincy change on sub. Why is a newbie have the captaincy when i sub the captain? They should make it automatically change to second captain.\n\n5. Home advantage is gone. This is the best thing on PES 2012 or something. Now it's gone again. In reality, home advantage is REAL, it's a psychological fact.\n\n6. Too arcadey. I played on highest level (superstar) on Master League. And the goal is too easy. Yes my style of play is clumsier than most people, i attack all the time, so my opponent can score big. But how many do i score? Bigger. 7-4 or 1-6 is common score in this series.\n\n7. The CPU is bad. They makes too many mistakes from short pass set pieces. I can always stole the ball, especially from their goalie and then scored an easy goals that i consider cheating. But they rarely foul me so the card is minimal.\n\n8. Very unlikely to get injury on real game, only from training. I don't know if it exist at all, I and a lot of my friends play this game for more than one ML season, and we got ZERO injury from real game.\n\n9. ML superstars don't get upset if they are not played. KONAMI had it right on previous certain PES when we had too many superstar, they got ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when they're not on the first team.\n\n10. Commendatory is bad. They always, ALWAYS, ALWAYS comment it wrong. When it's GK mistake, they comment that it's the striker's skill to shoot it in the corner, etc etc. Not to mention that they always state the obvious like they're explaining football to 5 yo kid on his first time football experience. idk maybe it's the anime style that make them do that (explaining basic stealth and CQC to black ops agent in MGS).\n\n11. Maybe it's me who's stupid but i don't know if the pitch is raining or not. Sometimes it's wet but only rains after a while. I know it's a feature, but you should be able to check the condition.\n\n12. BAD BAD graphic for non playing character. C'mon you have all the time in the world to make the tuxedo more realistic. It's not eating any processing from the GPU, you have only 2 characters in that scene. They should make cameraman, ball boy and, and security better too since when they are up close the other characters are not shown. When it's zoomed out, use the low res texture/polygon. How hard is that?\n\n13. I don't know how they make the score for the players. In average, players only score like 5.5 or 6.0. I have to make 5 goals and 2 assist so my striker can score 9.0\n\nAnd that's i remember, for now. Oh yes, their biggest mistake is to fool us, the PC gamer, with false advertising. I refunded the game and got back my Rp 740.000. You can buy a kidney with that kind of money here. I won't give any to badly designed game like this, whose company has all the time in the world, to perfect the game every year, but they didn't.","September 17, 2015","false","0.6"," 63 of 75 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","63","75","4","1"

Don't be conned by the screenshots or details published on Steam as these were taken from the far superior PS4 version using a completely new build of the Fox Engine - something the PC version is NOT running on.\n\nThe engine used in the PC version is exactly the same as PES 2015 and to add further insult to injury; it is just an enhanced build from the 2012 edition published back in 2011. Graphically, it shows as the visuals are extremely drab and the textures are quite frankly appalling. Compared to the PS4 release; not only is it significantly worse; it's actually embarrassing to play the game in this state. The user interface which is probably the only feature that has been significantly overhauled is even more cumbersome and annoying than in previous titles and is the final nail in the coffin on a pitiful product.\n\nIf you can get past the humiliation of playing on a poor PS3 port in 2015 after paying full price; you'll actually enjoy the experience but even the most hardened Pro Evo veterans will find this joke hard to take. EA Sports did the same on PC with FIFA 14 by releasing an old gen port but at least they were honest about the situation months beforehand. The fact this is full price is just insulting and that the squads haven't even been updated on many teams from the current transfer window suggests you're better off obtaining a refund and just going back to Pro Evolution Soccer 2015 instead.

While there are many promising gameplay elements, this game is plagued by a number of crippling issues:\n\n1)updates and Konami's take on communication with the fanbase\n\nUpdates take way too long and the patch notes are as useful for understanding the effect of upates on overall gameplay as a bicycle is for scuba diving: 'We will also be doing minor updates to improve a lot of gameplay aspects that our players have been requesting(...).' Are you feeling as enlightened as I am, now?!\n\nOffline line-up-updates will take until October 29th to be implemented, that is almost six weeks after release. Players have alerted Konami to a number of gameplay issues starting Day 1 and so far all the player base knows for sure is that Konami is working on an update.\nWhat specific gameplay issues they are going to address with this update is anyone's guess, however. The aforementioned global roster update is the only new content us humble users are allowed to know about in advance.\nRight now I can't help but wonder if Konami has not outsourced their PR for the game to the Public Security Intelligence Agency.\n\n2)the sorry state of rosters and the terrible implementation of the UEFA-tournaments:\n\nFor the largest part, this game uses outdated team information. A recent patch dating October 1st updated only the online modes, but left the officialy licensed UEFA-Tournaments untouched, along with all other offline-modes.\n\nFor reasons beyond my limited mortal understanding Konami deceided to leave a couple of teams entirely out of the tournaments, such as Borussia Dortmund without even replacing them with a non-licensed counterpart.\nEven worse, although Bayern Munich is a fully licensed team in exhibition mode, they are not available for the Champions League, so I am not about to excuse their abscence wth the limited licenses Konami aqquired.\nBeing a soccer enthusiast from Germany these two things immediately caught my attention and I know for a fact that the same holds true for a number of teams from other nations as well.\n\nTL;DR: Don't get your hopes up for the UEFA-licensed modes and don't expect up-to-date rosters either.\n\n3)Online gaming\n\nJust like most of the other users I have experienced severe lag in online matches, alongside a grueling percentage of disconnects. I have in fact only been able to complete 2(!) out of 7 matches so far. That is just unacceptable for me and even in those 2 cases where I was able to finish the match crippling lags made the game seem about as enjoyable as undergoing a root canal treatment.\nThe frequent lags reduce what could have been a promising soccer game to a game of chance.\n\n4)Goalkeepers and, to a lesser degree, defensive AI in general\n\nThe goalkeepers in this game are terrible, their catching skills are practically non-existant and in 1vs1-situations you basically have to aim directly at them in order for them to save. Diagonal shots like the ones Robben loves to fire from the corner of the box come with a success rate of what feels like 90 percent.\n\nThrough balls, especially lobbed ones, are way too effective against enemy defenders and goalkeepers alike. While defenders will react too slowly to the situation, goalkeepers will remain glued to their goal line. If your opponent has fast forward players you are in for a world of hurt and easily prevented goals.\n\n5)the man in black\n\nThe Referee does not really exist. He is just there for offsides, throw-ins, corner and goal kicks. Gattuso could surely be persuaded to return to the field immediately if real life referees behaved like they do in this game. I have spent an entire 20min game trying to provoke a red card and failed miserably.\n\nI did not even earn a booking. Sliding tackle from behind against a player who is not even remotely close to the ball? Just play on, the referee says. Maybe there is a cheat code implemented into the game that would allow you to call down a tactical nuke on the goalkeeper so that you could earn a red card, but short of that I cannot think of a way to incur the referee's wrath in any meaningful way.\n\n6)In defence of the game\n\nThe aforementioned issues aside, Pro Evolution Soccer 2016 can be a fun game, as long as you stick to playing offline modes. The passing and the ball physics are nothing short of astonishing, the skill shots you can produce will make you feel like the next Messi and the fight for possession is thrilling and unpredictable. At its core, the game is a terific simulation and has lots of potential. Given these strenghts it is all the more baffling why the game is in the sorry state it is in right now.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\nI have a feeling that with a little fine tuning most of these issues could have been resolved within a couple of weeks with some good, old-fashioned quality testing before release.\n\nKonami should understand that customers and product testers are not identical target audiences. Yet with the game in its current state I cannot help but feel that by buying this game I have given my express permission to do their beta-testing for them and that is why I ultimately cannot give this game a thumbs up and recommend it to other players.\n\nIf they were to fix these issues in a timely and satisfactory manner I might be inclined to write a more favorable review in the future and put more emphasis on the undisputed strenghts of the game, but right now I absolutely do not feel like doing that.\n\nRight now, I am deeply dissappointed that Pro Evolution Soccer 2016 does not nearly realize its full potential.\n\n","October 5, 2015","false","45.4"," 56 of 71 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","56","71","5","2"

Oh-boy was I for a surprise!\n\nI honestly have mixed feelings about this year's PES. I think most of it comes from the fact that the FIFA series is extremely polished and functional. For exemple, I found the general settings and menus of PES very cumbersome, not logical and overall... ugly.\n\nThe game itself is a let down, graphics and sound wise. Where in FIFA you have a thorough commentary with lots of insights and little bits of facts here and there, in PES everything is a bit bland and lifeless. The graphics are okey-ish (DX9 is very evident, specially lighting and shadows) with nice animations and I like the color palette, looking more natural to me than FIFA in my opinion.\n\nAnother downside is what plagued PES since its inception: the lack of licenses. I know it's not Konami's fault since EA has an almost total monopoly on it but still it leaves a sour taste when playing with generic teams and players.\n\nWhat I do like though, is the tempo. The game feels more slowly paced compared to the steroid-infused FIFA and although the through-passes are a bit overpowered, the game is very nice and plays in a very interesting manner. I believe much of it will change with patches though.\n\nOnline is a joke and I couldn't finish one single match without being disconnected so I don't know how to evaluate it.\n\nAnyway, I think I'll pass this year's PES and go back to FIFA. I will try to come back a couple of patches later and see how the game is going but for now, I don't recommend.","September 18, 2015","false","18.7"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","36","40","0","4"

(All PC versions.)\nSo this review's perspective is not to compare with more recent versions of these games.\n\nI had only 2 hours of playtime for this review, since I'm still not sure whether I will refund or not...\n\nPro:\n- Some really great gameplay improvements (esp. ball moves)\n- Better animations to some point (tackles)\n- More realistic due to balls bouncing off foot etc.\n- Difficulty level system is better balanced than with FIFA, where I win every game 10-0 on first 2 levels, but then again hardly ever score a goal on the next levels.\n\nUndecided:\n- Gameplay overall. Maybe I would have to get used to the animations and input reaction, but it feels a little to indirect.\n\nCons:\n- Graphics: Not better than FIFA12 imho. Faces dull, grey, liveless.\n- Audience/stadium looks crappy when it rains, due to almost everyone wearing grey rain capes...\n- Some animations look strange (e.g. jumping opponents when playing a header or goalkeeper catching ball), because shadows on the ground look wrong -> you cannot really see in what direction (up/left/right/whatever/at all) the move goes\n- Changing player running direction feels clumsy/slow/indirect\n- Online: I get a lot of lagging. Finding a quick online game opponent took me about 5 minutes waiting time\n- AI defense: COM players on my team just stand around and don't move at all with ball right next to them very often.\n- still last seasons rosters... may be updated later, but the game is out now, so this does not leave a good impression on me\n\n\nConclusion:\nConsidering the above contras plus the fact that there are no licenses for most leagues, I find the price (50€) way too high, so I tend to refunding ( I'll give it a day of thinking...). On the other hand, compared to an distinctly older version of any soccer game, there is indeed a huge difference in gameplay, which makes me curious to explore the game more indepth on some level. Hard decision at this moment.\nFIFA 2016 demo felt somehow to be the better package when it comes to the overall mix of graphics (if you need it) and gameplay.\nNot recommended at this price (50€), however.\n\n\n\n\n\n","September 17, 2015","false","115.1"," 31 of 37 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","31","37","0","0"

Konami missed a clear 1-on-1 situation and it was not even close.\n\n\nThere are merits to this game; I think it is the best PES game on PC since PES 6. The monthly stats reports in Master League and the added features of fluid formations and tactics are reminiscent of Football Manager and do add some level of authenticity to the game.\nThe on-the-ball player movement, the timing for passes and tackles, manual aiming and the actual dynamics of the ball in different situations are much improved compared to previous incarnations of the series, and arguably, better than that of FIFA 16. As such the gameplay of PES 2016 is also more challenging and tactical than FIFA 16 (by comparison of Superstar and Legendary).\n\n\nBut there are a number of glaring problems that undermine most of what is good about the game. The most prominent problem is the UI, which is an eye-sore, but the graphics are equally appaling. The fact that the PC graphics isn't anywhere close to what had been shown in previews is deceptive and incredibly offensive from Konami.\nOnline play is plagued with lag, long waiting time and poor eventual matchmaking.\nThe previous addition of MyClub serves no purpose other than as a rival FUT, it lacks originality; they have made some changes this year but the connection to their server is too unstable, the mechanics and gameplay depth are also lagging behind that of FUT.\nRoster updates are not being done promptly enough and offline capability is lacking, which is a big negative when things in this genre is about authenticity.\nSome aspects of the actual football game are short of what is expected, in particular, the leniency of referees to some outrageous tackles, the inability for GK to catch or deal with set pieces, the over-aggressive defensive plays and the frequent, significant fluctuation of player form in the space of days.\nTeam kits, team names, team crests, player names, league names...it’s one thing to have UCL and UEL license, but not having the others really affected the game’s authenticity. You can argue that EA lacked certain licensing as well, but at least they have worked hard to present appealing substitutes to the gamers and have also worked in other areas to compensate for their inadequacies. I cannot say the same for the case of Konami and PES.\n\n\nPES 2016 is still a quintessential PES game, good mostly in terms of player-tactics and on-the-ball dynamics. If you are a PES-exclusive player, this is certainly an improvement from last year’s game. If you are a FIFA-exclusive player wondering what the PES hype was about, the answer is ‘nothing noteworthy’. If you are still undecided or are a newbie to the football game sub-genre, I would wholeheartedly recommend against buying PES 2016.\n\n\ntl;dr: FIFA is still King of the football games for PC.","October 7, 2015","false","8.1"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","35","49","2","0"

They are not from this version of the game most likely.\n\nA few remarks about the "Phenomenal Gameplay" everyone keeps raving about. While a lot of things have been improved for PES series in the last couple of years, I cannot understand why:\n\n1. Goalkeepers are so dumb in MyClub (maybe I am doing this worng, but they are simply standing there)\n2. Referee's lost their whistles. After about 4 hours of play I encountered 1-2 free kicks of any sort. Even seemingly harsh tackes get ignored\n3. Its not all bad, gameplay-wise, its the best PES to date (don't hate me PES 6 fans) but all the other things just simply won't let me enjoy the game\n\nIf you do decide to buy this, expect to experience last-gen graphics, very sad animations and a plethora of FPS dips. Enjoy.\n\nKonami released the Demo AFTER THE GAME RELEASE. How sketchy is that? I hope you do not support this company and their sneaky ways\n\nKonami, stay in the slot machine business.

It feels like a stand alone patch for 15 because all Konami have done is simply remove some of the good parts of 15 and add some of the missing things from 15 and voila you have PES 16!\n\nExamples:\n\nGood parts taken out of 15...\n\n1). The shooting, which was good in 15, they've messed up in 16, so now whether you lightly touch the shoot button or hold it down there isnt going to be any difference (so the powerbar is pretty much useless), in 15 you had to hold down the shoot and pre-emptively make the space which was fun imo and added a little more skill to shot creation. Now the ball is simply a balloon with no weight at all to it.\n\n2). The animations, in 15 I had no problem, players felt like they had weight and the collision system worked well and the animations fitted the movements the players made. But in 16 they've sped everything inadvertently by adding extra animations so when you line up a few tricks consecutively there isn't enough time for this to be realistically portrayed so the animations skip and you end up with it looking a little jittery and skittish.\n\n3). Passing, having tried all passing modes (passing assistance) in 16 it would seem that there doesnt seem to be any consistency between them for I notice certain passes (quite easy passes at that) simply won't go to the person you're aiming for so in effect these options are missing, whereas in 15 I could eliminate that problem by changing (lowering) pass asisstance.\n\nAdded the things that were missing from 15...\n\n1). Cursor change, whereas in 15 it was quite sluggish, in 16 it is much more responsive and all the better\n\n2). Player response time, compared to 15 the players in 16 respond much faster to loose balls which is good, although as mentioned above because of the animation skips and inconsistent player motions things can get a little like sensible soccer (defenders getting sucked behind attackers in an instant and almost comedic manner).\n\n3). Ball in the air options, greatly improved from 15, I've already managed 3 overhead kicks and many volleys, things that were missing in 15 - you basically had little control over what happened in the air in 15 in terms of attacking options whereas now if you want to volley simply wait for the ball to drop lower than chest height if you want an overhead kick position yourself under the ball with your back to goal - definately much better.\n\nOverall, if I am honest I have to say 15 is better. I prefer the meatier shots and the heavier weight to the players. However, I am a person who likes a bit more realism over arcade action and I think 15 felt a bit more like a simulator so it gets my vote.\n\nHow to score this game?\n\nWell, considering that it (PES 16) offers nothing new in terms of graphics, interface and sound (sorry but I detest Peter Drury what's worse is in PES 16 he sounds like Ned Boulting (another soulless ITV drone) who I also destest, and doesn't actually build on anything good from 15 (because they've simply taken them away or changed them for the worse) means that this game feels like a patch. In fact the more I think about it the more it could be for at the beginning of PES 15's release Konami stated that they wouldn't be creating any further patches that would alter the gameplay of 15, where they basically saving that for 16? Also, everything else seems to fit - the team changes are the exact same team roster for Arsenal is the exact same as 15, even Diaby is still there! I was wondering why the updates just suddenly stopped way last year, ok I can understand the gameplay not being touched (which is ok I like the gameplay in 15 as it is) but what happend to Data packs? There were none!\n\nSo the more I think about it the more it makes sense. Konami is in crisis, so what's the cheap option? Simply stop putting money into the creation of patches for the current (15) game and use those resources instead to create a patch (I was going to say 'larger patch' but it's not, for I wouldn't have minded paying the money as long as the team were actually up-to-date but sadly they're not) that they can essentially call a new game because blatantly that's what it is, a gameplay patch nothing more and as we approach the release of the new game don't bother releasing a demo for the PC that could potentially reflect any of this. It all makes sense.\n\nSo I've paid for a poor patch that if I had downloaded from PESEdit.com I would have deleted - the shocking thing is with PESedit at least you get the real team kits and rosters on top of the gameplay changes with this effort from Konami you get none of that! It just goes to show how much I have been ripped off.\n\nSo onto the verdict\n\nConsidering the above\n\n2/10\n\nHowever, if PES 15 had never existed then...\n\n6.5/10\n\n\nP.S. Like some other users I will be using the refund option","September 17, 2015","false","3.4"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

And although it has been refined since 2015 a lot of the same issues remain, particularly around the AI. In significant games (cup semi-finals, league winning fixtures etc.) the AI ups the difficulty by essentially cheating. Players become untackleable, your AI controlled team mates do stupid things (e.g. stepping aside from 50/50s, making rash tackles) and your commands become more like suggestions. Even when the game isn't actively trolling you there are issues. Opposition players can take the ball from you from just about any angle with minimal contact regardless of the relative strength of the players in question. Stats like pace seem to be completely irrelevant at times as an exhausted, lumbering central defender will easily catch up to your fresh, speedy attacker. Through balls in general are just a hot mess - unless you are using fully manual controls it is a complete lottery as to what will happen when you play one.\n\nPES2016 has a huge amount of promise but is hampered by poor visuals and a terrible, and at times rage-inducing, Master League AI. If you can get it in the sale then it's probably worth it, but for full price it's hard to recommend it.","December 27, 2015","false","163.7"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

Who is evil here, Konami or Steam?\n\nAnswers from Steam and Konami for this betrayal would be most welcome","September 17, 2015","false","26.4"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

BIG FAIL KONAMI\n\nEDIT (after a couple of weeks): do NOT buy this game to play against the AI ! apart from the scripted events I mentionned above, there's another highly frustrating and unfair feature in this game: let's call it 'anticipate the buttons' - i observed this on normal(!) difficulty and higher...\nlet me explain: you are required to press a button to initiate an action of your players, we all know that of course. So while we players run around the pitch like crazy just to position ourselves somewhere near the ball or pass trajectory the AI miraculously is ALWAYS in perfect position, not because it is particularly good in using clever positioning but it simply anticipates the buttons you press - the AI knows where to move or stand because it knows what buttons you press, thus where you want to move, pass or shoot. try it with the following example: dribble along the sideline towards the corner flag. you'll most certainly have a defender on your tail, perfectly positioned between you and the box. now try to make a full stop to let the defender continue to run towards the corner flag (that happens against human players cause we don't have superhyperlighting reflexes!). now observe how quick the AI defender turns as well and is still tailing you - it's superhumanlightingfast reflex! or in other words: CHEATING! this results in very frustrating gameplay because whenever you successfully manage a nice pass combo, through ball or run it doesn't feel like it's YOUR achievment to outsmart the AI but rather the AI just letting you succeed for once because "let's give him a goal, otherwise he'll quit playing this game".

If you are interested more in multiplayer/online modes then perhaps the game has redeeming qualities that might recommend it, I am unsure.\n\nBecome a Legend is completely broken. When you are tackled there is probably about a 25% every time that your player is going to go down injured and will stay down on the ground for a pretty long time, he might get back up on his feet and you may well complete the game but there is about an 80% chance that you are in fact out injured for between 3-16 weeks. If you are playing as a forward or like to run with the ball this pretty much adds up to spending half or more of your time out injured every. single. seqason. This is even after your player gets 90+ stamina. It really isn't 'Become a Legend' so much as 'Become Darren Anderton/Arjen Robben' depending on the age of the reader.\n\nAnother problem that infects BAL, and probably other game modes include stupendously lenient referees. I think historically football games have been guilty of overly strict referees but this game goes way too far in the other direction. Be prepared to be scythed down and spend a good several weeks out injured and not even see the perpetrator give away a free kick let alone receive a yellow card for his assault.","December 20, 2015","false","73.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

With all the play time i have put into this years pes i must say that there is a lot of improvements from last years but this being said it still falls short of what should be a polished and complete game (imo), porting for the pc could have been much better and there is lots of people i know play this on xbox and the ps and don't come across the same issue which leads me to think that it will always be aimed at the console owners more than anyone with a pc . Here is a list of faults that you must get past and ignore if you are to enjoy the game .\n\nCons :\nslow reaction time incomparison to ai players < always second to ball , always slow in intercepting passes or covering areas of space on the pitch ( i have gone though a great deal of players to try and correct these points but too no avail).\n\nNever truley feels like a game of football but a case of controling 11 men with little understanding of what they are doing on the field  so that the computer does not have the ability to score which most of the time locks you into one type of playing style and leaves you feeling at times that regardless of how you play the goal was always going to be scored . Again i have tried lots of players and tactics but the control always falls to you which would be fine if it was a bit more reactive if you leave anything to your teams ai you are in for a loss. EX - i tried playing with just the computer players pressing and making tackles and at the end of the first half i was 3-0 down against a low level team with less than 30 % possesion .\n\nBy now you may see a drop in my intrest in writing this review as to be honest i have far to many faults to list and nothing will ever change with these kinds of games until the developers and companies stop trying to bring out a game every year that leaves their customers dissappointed after a promise that is shallow and more focused on out doing their competitors instead of serving the Beautiful game which is football . I have never been interested in playing fifa at all and i am still not i will allways prefer PES over fifa any day but i cannot help but feel that something needs to change if players are needing mods and such like to feel a void that exsists in the original game . I have stuck by PES since day one and as a kid with little understanding the game there has been more than one version that has giving me tons of hours of happy game play but now i am older and more demanding of this title i can say that i have been left wondering about the game that it could have been .\n\n","March 18","false","574.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

It's problems are symptomatic of not just a series, but a genre that has become stagnant and lacks any real innovation. And therein lies one of the main issues with sport simulations; the games are restricted by the real world elements. As a fond, even dare I say, hardcore fan of the Pro Evolution Soccer series in it's Playstation2 heyday, it's lack of meaningful progress in the last ten years is saddeningly glaring. Whilst games in nearly every genre have evolved tenfold in the last decade, football games, including all of the big hitters, PES, FIFA and FM, have done very, very little, and in a genre where annual releases are the standard, this is extremely poor.\n\nI'll talk about a few things I feel this game has done right before focusing on the negative. In terms of core mechanics and gameplay, the passing is very solid, for the most part and there are a lot of unique passing animations that add an organic feel to passing, the passing feels weighty and satisfying.\nThe ease of implementing custom tactical settings is excellent, and this has always been something PES has done better than FIFA; it's drag and drop system of creating formations feels fluid and offers some room for creative formations and strategies. The game also lets you switch between other custom systems on the fly during the game, again offering space for creativity.\n\nThen there's Master League. It has the remarkable quality of instigating feelings of nostalgia whilst remaining hopelessly archaic and frustrating. It has more or less remained untouched from the series glory days and it's idiosyncrasies now feel out of touch and counter intuitive to maintaining a notion of simulation. It still features the haphazard 'coloured arrow' system of player condition, the same system that has been in the series since it was called 'International Superstar Soccer', some 20 years ago. It's a system that feels so arbitrary and unfair, that it breaks any semblance of simulation, and whilst it might have been acceptable 10 or so years ago, there is no room for this anymore. Add to this, the equally bizarre in modern context, international game schedule, which sees half of your players leave for international duty at random points during the season to come back completely fatigued and effectively unselectable for the next 3 or more games. There is no excuse for this anymore.\n\nThe gameplay itself has fared little better. Goalkeepers are comically inept to the point of being game breaking, failing to make even the simplest of saves, parrying the tamest of shots and positioning themselves with such epic ineptitude that it's hard to believe they are seemingly made to represent real, professional athletes. Their absolute stubborn refusal to move off their goal lines will gift you many undeserved, easy goals. Without the explicit intention of hyperbole, I would argue that these are probably the worst goalkeepers I have had the misfortune of seeing in a video game.\n\nThe controls and players themselves feel sluggish and very unresponsive, especially when defending. Trying to switch defenders can be beyond a nightmare at times, with the game often straight refusing to switch to a relevant player, or even worse, upon gaining control of a player, all of their momentum and movement completely dissipates as though the very life of them is being instantly drained. First touches feel heavy even when purposefully trapping the ball. A lot of the time, it seems as though your touch goes in a random direction rather than the actual direction you are holding on the controller. The same goes with passing at times, almost to the point where it feels that the game is just passing wherever the hell it feels like.\n\nAnd then there is the scripting, momentum or whatever other term you have for it. It is so rudimentary and blunt that it becomes completely insulting to the player. Segments of paly feel painfully contrived, and on the higher difficulties, it results in feeling completely powerless to the whim of the game. There are times you can literally feel that the computer opponents are going to score in the next piece of play, and more often then not, my fears were confirmed with a rippling net. It creates this overbearing feeling of unfairness for the sake of cheap drama, and the unsubtlety of it all is completely immersion breaking.\n\nI haven't tried much of the online play, because the game performs so poorly in online games and there seems to be a lot of lag, regardless of your connection quality. There is also a lot of rampant cheating in the online scene, but I suppose I can't fault the game itself for that, although it has been suggested that Konami ought to do more to prevent this.\n\nOverall, despite the game having it's moments, it feels too old, too slow and offers little to nothing new, despite the decades of ongoing development. I seem to only be able to play this game for an hour or so at a time these days before I ground down by the vast flaws of this title. This might be a game that others can still enjoy, but I feel laboured playing this game, and it usually ends with putting me in a sour mood. I cannot recommend this game.","January 22","false","140.5"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","2"

PES 2016 looks plastic (on the PC only, apparently) and crowd noise is bland and repetitive, so one never gets immersed in the game. Those are bearable weaknesses, but the fatal one is being able to get past the defensive AI (in Become A Legend (BAL), at least): for example, my 17 year old player can ALWAYS simply run past an Aston Villa defender, by running side by side then turning hard towards / in front of him. My player's Speed = 79 and Dribbling = 82, so this is reasonable at times, but not every time. To be fair it does not happen much against Chelsea players, they are quicker. But in my first season of 2016 for AFC Bournemouth ("East Dorsetshire") I scored an average of 1 goal per game, which is just crazy. In PES 2012, if I try this manoevre using a similar player (e.g. Torres), he can't keep his speed up and and slows rapidly as he turns at 90 degrees, which is more realistic.\nI would love it if Konami would build on what they have without losing the good things, eg. take votes as to what people like most about a release and then retain the most popular items. As it is, I doubt I will buy 2017 to find out what's been dropped or gone wrong this time.","March 28","false","362.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Now and again you will be enjoying a rare game without any lag and get a 3-0 lead, 99% of the time your opponent will start lagging the match so everything you do will have a massive delay and you end up losing 3-4. If they aren't lagging the game then they will simply quit and the result doesn't count, this means it is almost impossible to get to the top leagues without cheating, if you encounter someone in division 1 you can be sure they will cheat if you are ahead. I'd say one in every 10 games doesn't have lag or a cheater. Konami have shown no interest in fixing this so i'm done with this franchise and done with Konami. When it comes to gameplay it's far and away the best football game ever but if you're playing online it's such an incredibly infuriating experience that i can't recommend it. If you're playing offline multiplayer then it's a must buy.","May 20","false","402.5"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

For those PES fans of old, this really has the feel of one of those older games (in a great way). The gameplay is fun and the match engine is immersive.\n\nOf course yuo get all the usual license issues but thats not a new thing... I've always overlooked that.\n\nMy biggest gripe would be similar to most other people's, the GK's... They're just hopeless, often missing shots right next to them. That being said, i also think the shooting is a little too easy and that makes them seem even worse than they are. Regardless of the player skill you can almost always place a shot in the corner with relative ease. It just doesnt feel right and knowing i can score with ease kinda ruins it for me,,,\n\nIf you want a more plug and play football game(i.e. getting your mates around for a tournament) i think this is great. If you want a more challenging, richer experience then FIFA is probably the way forward for you.","December 16, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It's very annoying, and slows down the load times of some of the game options. To top it all, I've noticed that chances are that the connection fails or drops in the end -showing some error codes I'm too lazy to search about-, so the wait is in vain.\n\nFortunately, I got this game for local co-op/vs. So, with a little patience at the start, the rest is pure fun.\n\nEdit: I hope the rosters get updated from time to time, and they add missing teams/leagues in the future.

Everything from graphics, colors, user interface, playstyle, mechanics of the game, is a total mess and laughable. I miss the older versions, who at least had decent look and better game control with brighter and more lively colors.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971447102/recommended/375960/","76561197971447102","Mas Bro Ridwan","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971447102/","133 products in account","Let's start with the more obvious flaws of the game. One, lack of official licensing that has plagued the series since the beginning of time. It's still continuing until now giving the game less credence than the FIFA series. Second, the visual aspect of the game pales in comparison with the FIFA series. The crowd looks ugly, the goal celebration lacks polish, and it lacks the HD texture of the game console cousin.\n\nBut that doesn't matter right? What matters is the gameplay? Well, here's where it gets ugly. The passing system is hit or miss. Sometimes you can thread through a quick pass to your players between enemy defense, other time your players would pass half-heartedly and the ball would go to your passing target at crawl speed which is easily intercepted by the enemy defense. And the AI defense is insane! Sometimes they are able to predict when you pass the ball leading to them able to intercept more than 10 times in a 10 minutes match.\n\nEDIT 15/04/2016: And your AI teammate movement leaves a lot to be desired. They don't find spaces and intentionally positioned themselves close to enemy defender even when attacking. This positioning causes our passes to be easily intercepted by enemy defender when we pass the ball, when we control the received pass, and when we start dribbling the ball. I had seen this happened so many time that this must be intentional programming by Konami. This doesn't make any sense whatsoever.\n\nEDIT 19/05/2016: ♥♥♥♥ you for using scripted AI. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that players who have low body balance able to push my 90 and 95 rated body balance defender. Some of the AI passing is near ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t with pin point accuracy for a low level team. Dont ♥♥♥♥ing put this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on me. It isn't fair, it's ♥♥♥♥ing putting the player into massive disadvantage where we can't pass nor can we intercept any of the opposing team passes.\n\nAll of this is pretty disheartening since the game itself is very rewarding for players who rely on passes and tactical play instead of the run and gun of FIFA series. Since the passing works mysteriously you'll have to rely on luck whenever you try to pass (EVEN NORMAL SHORT PASS) the ball. This is sad because i've been a fan of the PES series since the console era. And can you believe this is the first time i was able to legitimately purchase the game on Steam? Last year i couldn't buy PES 2015 because i was region locked by the stupid Konami. Now i get back to the game and see the passing system botched, the visual fidelity is lacking, and the game roster is still as stupid as ever.\n\nEDIT: And do you know how hard it is to make the AI off balance without resorting to violent tackle? Most of the time they are able to stay on their feet and thus able to regain the posession back. The higher difficulty would make it nigh impossible to tackle AI players just like in the old PES.\n\nEDIT May 2016: This is nitpicking. But why can't i pick my match time in the Master League? I don't care about immersion. The game performance worsen during daytime match due to the shadow and brightness effect. But hey, i can't change match time since it's immersion breaking. It's more immersive breaking when the game lags so badly during the day than during the night.\n\nWhat year is this? The Master League mode still has the same ♥♥♥♥ed up international call-up during the season. I can't set whether i could withdraw my players or not, and almost all of my players went back from international matchdays exhausted. Meanwhile, the opposing AI team suffer no set back and can play their original starting line-up while i must scrounnge bottom of the rosters for any meaningful players. It will take several matches until all of my roster are fit again. This is insane. This is literally the same fatigue problem harking all the way from PES 5.","January 18","false","573.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zx9cmstorm/recommended/375960/","zx9cmstorm","FuryX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zx9cmstorm/","24 products in account","This has to be the worst football soccer simulation in the history of video games. Did not expect this, especially from Konami. Sadly they screwed this one up, big time.\n\nBefore we delve into the relentless frustrations, let us talk about what is good about the game.\nFirst of all, the FOX Engine running the game renders the game beatifully, with vivid and detailed\ngraphics that truly colors the pitch from one end of the stadium to the other. Movements is smooth,\nrealistic and true to life. Very well done implementing the FOX Engine into this one Konami.\n\nSounds good right? Well on the surface it is. However, the game is marred with flaws that Konami should have fixed a long while ago. First of all I grew up playing PES (never really liked FIFA), so having the 2016 edition blow up to shreds is a saddening experience for me.\n\n1) The clunky, slow-to-navigate User Interface. They tried their best to implement what FIFA had done before for their UI, but the results is pretty horrid. Navigating is slow from one section to another, and it takes a while to get through the damn "establishing connection" part.\n\n2) AI is still dumb. At this point I am too frustrated to ask Konami to do a better job. Unless you are playing at SuperStar, the AI will reflect each real-life clubs they are portraying poorly. Defenders just watch by as the through ball reaches the opponent striker, they will almost never slide tackle, strikers panic easily and all sorts of horror. The best thing is when you overtake the opponent to repossess the ball. More often than not your player will just stand there even though you are spamming the shift key for him to move, only to witness the ball reclaimed by the opposite team. Brilliant is it not?\n\n3) THIS IS THE MAIN REASON WHY PES 2016 just sucks big time.\nREFEREE IS AN ABSOLUTE HORROR.\n\nOh, your player was tackled so harshly FROM BEHIND without them touching the ball, and you even got injured?\nRef: I have no part to play in that. It's a physical game, deal with it. What's that? You got injured? Like I give a damn.\n\nOh, you merely extended your leg without touching anything (not even the foot of the player, nor the ball) in an attempt to take the ball? Ref: Sorry lads, a freaking foul for you! What's that? You haven't done anything? Well like I give a damn what you think.\n\nREFS are one sided most of the time. You got tackled to death, no whistle. You extend your foot and touched the ball, nope, foul for you. There you have it: Konami's finest engineering.\n\nAnd goodness gracious, I played Become A Legend for 5 seasons on SuperStar, and guess how many times I got a penalty? 15! No really, it's 8.\n\nAllright allright, it is actually 3. 3!!! Konami, you got one job! Most of the time I was tackled very harshly in the opponent's penalty box, but no whistle, no fouls, no nothing. I got physical with their defender to regain possession, but I got a foul instead. Seriously, what kind of universe are the REFs in this game coming from? They definitely makes use of their sense of smell, cuz for sure they cannot even see the god damn field.\n\nLack of fouls, unfair treatment and foul blindness just wrecks this game so much. I love PES, and I love Become a Legend, but if KONAMI does not fix this in the future, I might as well switch to FIFA.\nBut, as much as I hate the referee, I still have to recommend this game, simply because it looks gorgeous and plays more realistically and smoothly compared to FIFA.\n\n\n\n","May 23","true","48.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bjorse/recommended/375960/","bjorse","Bjorse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bjorse/","132 products in account","I have mainly been playing the become a legend mode on the highest difficulty. My main issue with the game is that sometimes it feels like the game has decided on beforehand who'll win a match. The same issue was in PES 2015. I can be playing in FC Barcelona and be facing a low-level team with crappy stats (~70 or below on offense, midfield and defense), but the opposition plays like they're the best team in the world. They're not missing any passes, making perfectly timed tackles and scores on their chances. And their defence is Gods, no matter if it's a defence man or a forward. My player has 96 in speed, and sometimes I've faced players with like 75 in speed, but when a team mate plays a through ball the opposing player will get there first, no matter if he's behind me when the ball is played. Meanwhile my team cannot do anything right; they cannot take the ball from the opposition, they cannot make any decend pass, and they certainly wont be trying to hit the net. It means it's only up to me, as a single player in that team, to produce something offensively AND take responsibilities in the defence. And while struggling throughout the game, and maybe finally scoring a goal, you'll be sure that the opposition will make 2 goals pretty quick after that to get ahead, without really being challenged. It's pretty frustrating when those games happens. Especially if you've been through all the Champions league stages with an ease, and suddenly your team sucks and you're out of the competition.\n\nAnother really frustrating thing in BAL (I think people experience the same thing in Master League) is the injury bug. On the highest difficulty they'll make perfectly time sliding tackles (from Normal and upwards) and if you're hit you'll be injuried (most of the time). Sometimes your player stands up again after a while, but most of the times he'll be injured for weeks. This happens several times per season, making you miss a lot of games and if you're injuried you'll not be picked for the national team games, even though they'll be played after your injury has ended. It happens to your team mates as well, but not as frequent. It's worth to mention that my player has the max value on injury resistance, but that'll do nothing in this game it seems.\n\nThe last thing that bugs me is the goalkeepers. They just can't seem to save anything if the ball is hit close enough. The consequence is that you and the opposition will be scoring a lot of goals. 3-3, 4-3, 2-3, 4(+)-0, and so on is what most of the games will end. A few games is "normal" games, with scores like 1-0, 1-1, 2-0, but they are rare.\n\nBUT, I still love this game despite the stuff I mentioned above, because the positive things in the game are still far ahead. The happiness this game produces for me is endless. I don't really care for the graphics, I think it's pretty well for a football game. The gameplay has improved A LOT from PES 2015 and when winning games it feels like a effort, like you've really fought to get there which is satisfying. I had hoped for them to improve BAL even more, but it's still really good. I'm loving it. I'll recommend it for the BAL alone, if you're into that type of stuff.\n\nIf Konami will patch the issues I've mentioned (which has a really low chance, as they did nothing to improve BAL in PES 2015), I'd give the game 10/10. But in its current state, I give it 7,5/10.","November 21, 2015","true","278.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The best game mode IMHO is Master League next would be despite the mentally challenged CPU AI in this mode is Become A Legend which IMO better than FIFA's career mode.

There is not much wrong with the graphics. Sometimes during replays you see a close up of someone in the crowd and it looks weird. That is all. Everything else looks good enough, and since it is soccer, it is so zoomed out you can't even tell either way. All around, all of fun to play. I don't think it has enough content to be a game you play all the time, but it is a good "side game". For example, here is what I do:\n\n70% of gaming time: competitive Rainbow Six Siege\n10%: PES 2016\n10%: Rocket League\n10%: Random singleplayer games I slowly work through(AC:BF, Ghost Recon FS, Tomb Raider, etc).\n\nWhat i'm saying is, if you want to add some games to your library that you can put time into and have fun consistantly PES 16 is a good option. If your thinking of playing it all the time though, don't expect much. I am able to put 2 hours+ at a time into Rainbow Six Siege, but I could never see myself doing so with PES.","April 2","true","76.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

Of course, FIFA became morelike PES, and PES seemed to lose its way - 2014 was nearly unplayable for me. I would often conceed last minute corners, and spent a few seasons with Wolves losing most games and sadly recreating reality.\n\nThe issues with textures and licences can be solved by searching for the Smoke patch.\n\nThe Master League and the like is the best I've seen, with enough arcadey management to make the team more detailed than before: roles are allocated automatically, and there is a real sense of the team growing.\n\nI haven't played online as I spread my time across more than a few genres. I imagine that those who love that side of this game might be disappointed from what I've read. For the rest, playing with friends in RL is decent as it always has been.\n\nSo, for those willing to search and patch the game (all with .exe files once unzipped), this is a worthy return to the series for the past five years.

PES 2016 is easily the best PES I've played since PES 6. Plenty of modes to choose from, my favourite being My Club where you start with basic mediocre team and you slowly sign new players and 'build your legacy' as they say it.\n\nPros:\n+ Fast and fluid gameplay\n+ Ball control is better than ever\n+ Building your team in myClub mode\n+ Players know how to shoot unlike in PES 2014 where scoring is rocket science\n+ Free kicks in good position will often end in goal\n\nCons:\n- Establishing Communications every few seconds\n- Through ball too effective, easy goals\n- PC graphics worse than consoles\n- Menu navigation is like early Windows 8 metro mess\n- Can't make your own team formation (at least not in My Club mode) - you depend too much on your trainer\n\nNote:\n- Posible con, maybe I'm bad at defending, but attacking is much more effective than defending. I feel like players that are attacking are at least 50% faster and agile than defending players. It's hard to take the ball.\n\nOverall 7/10 Recommended for football fans!","October 3, 2015","true","50.6"," 16 of 36 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","16","36","3","0"

This years Fifa hasn't been amazing. So, I wanted to try PES, and although I haven't won a single online match on "my clubs", which is PES' version of Fifa's ultimate team. I do prefer Fifa's ultimate team, but PES' still good.\n\nI believe this game does have some positives over Fifa. The passing, I love in PES. I also love the early crosses and through balls. There are certainly some crazy things that can happen, just like in real life football. But also, crazy things that aren't like real football at all... Like when you're hoping to keep the ball in at the bi-line or thow-in lines and put in a first time cross. Occasionally, your players will take an extra touch and put the ball out of play...\n\nAuthenticity is always going to be an issue with PES. Incorrect kit colours and team names etc. But the majority is editable.\n\nI'd love to see a more Fifa feel to PES' version of pro clubs. I'd also like to see the ability to protect the ball and use a players strength more during ball possession. Finally, the option to select tactical defending really should be implimented in PES soon. If I could, I'd give this 4 out of 5 stars. It's worth a play.","October 11, 2015","true","33.7"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

It might not have the meticulous authenticity of FIFA but PES 2016 is plainly just a much more enjoyable football game to play, and has actually shown consistent improvement year to year - and this year Konami have absolutely nailed the gameplay. Remember, the only way they'll be able to implement all the licenses in the future is if you actually buy the game, and it's definitely worth buying this year.\n\nPros:\n-Fantastic gameplay - passing, tackling and shooting all feel natural and dynamic than in FIFA\n-GP system\n-Unpredictable matches\n-Master League overhaul makes it a lot more fun to play; a much better interface, slightly better transfer negotiations (though still not on FIFA's level), in-depth stats\n-UEFA Champions League, Europa League, Super Cup and Copa Libertadores licenses, and UEFA Euro 2016 is confirmed to be added at a later date\n-Player controlled celebrations\n-Commentary improved but still not great\n-Although a blatant Ultimate Team clone, MyClub is very entertaining\n-Dynamic weather\n-Expansive edit suite as per usual\n-Player models look very good\n\nCons:\n-Although perfectly functional, the game plan menus could be a little easier on the eye; they often look clunky\n-Licenses for Premier League teams (except Man United) still missing; option file support non-existent and PC is actually the most difficult platform to import images on\n-Disappointing PC port in general, graphics are nowhere near up to the standard of PS4/Xbox One, no mouse support\n-Some animations still look somewhat robotic\n-Can be a tad too easy for experienced players, even on Super Star difficulty\n-Texture quality of the crowd is sub-par","October 23, 2015","true","47.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

It's either FIfa or PES. After playing FIFA for years running I thought to go for PES this year seeing good reviews. I found a good deal in Amazon @ INR 999 and bought it. I found the price a little suspicious seeing xbox & ps version were 3x the rate. I loaded it up and played the first game and thought I was running at low settings, I immediately quit the game to check and found it was running at high settings. I did a few research and found the game was different from the one available next gen consoles. Dissappointed, but I let it go due to good gameplay. BTW the GK in this game is a joke. Lack of licenes didn't bother me much as I was used to it and found a few mods available in the internet. What got me furious of the lack of timely updates, summer transfer was released in october. winter transferers released in March. What is the madness??  The finally made a decent game and now they are doing this? To add to the misery the Euro 2016 "DLC" they are giving as free is joke.

You are Pes fans ( u must be one of them, if u r not i suggest u dont waste ur money)\n2. You are prefer graphic than license (konami dont have full license like fifa, so dont be mad if u r finding football team without their emblem/kits/player face\n3. You are MASTER LEAGUE FANS LIKE ME ( i spend all my time for master league )\n\nWhy u should not buy this game:\n1. You are FIFA FANS ( dont try stupid things )\n2. The Price is to damn high for what ull get, i suggest u buy at steam sale ( i say this b cuz i need more features for master league, konami just dont try their best for this i think)\n3. I can see glitches every where ( Player skin change from white to black WTF !!!, jersey change it colous -_-, but konami already apologies for this, and their trying to fix this)\n4. You are not/can not playing football game/ or you never play it before (dont waste your money here bro)\n5. You are a girl !!! like my friend, she is soooooooooooo STUPID she buy this game and cant play it (wasting money)\n6.

For ex: its to easy for player in master league to transfer to other club, some times player move to their own enemy club, and the fans seems doesnt care about that.\n-In real world its a chaos for the player, the fans circle will say bad things about the player, the player will lose their confidense, mentality and its effect their daily life in soccer. ex: torres when moved to chelsea\n4. focus on MASTER LEAGUE mode, this is the way u guys in konami can beat FIFA without license, i think a lot of pes player, they buy pes for this game mode ( need more scnario and emotion )","October 10, 2015","true","183.4"," 19 of 44 people (43%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","43","19","44","4","6"

New nice features at MyClub, but also on Master League. A lot of improvements this year. I think it is one of the best PES games I ever played.\nBut there are also some negative points. I think everybody knows it right now about the graphics, because read a lot of bad reviews about it. It is not like PS4, but it don't change this awesome gameplay and the joy that you can get from this game. Hopefully they will change the graphics next year. I hope they will also work on the football team licenses of the Premier League and Bundesliga but also the stadiums. That will definelty make the game better. Another point is that sometimes the goalkeepers are not that great in the game, sometimes the look a bit useless because I think it is easier to score goals in this new PES. The last negative point that I have is when I play online it sometimes doesn't work that good as when you play a game against the computer. Overall one of the best PES games in my opinion!

First of all, even though the graphics are lower quality than they are on PS4 and Xbox One as this is an old generation port rather a new generation, I think the graphics are still pretty damn good considering. To give this game a negative review simply because of the graphics is pathetic and shows that you are one of these idiotic PC gamers that thinks the hallmark of a great game is down to what it looks like. The game is great, the gameplay is what makes it great. It is the best PES I have played in years and is miles better than that pile of dog business EA keeps pumping out year after year.\n\nAs for the issues with online play, I cannot comment as I don't play online matches. So if you are interested in purchasing this game for online play then you may want to read other reviews that cover this.\n\nBut as a single player football game, its awesome!\n\nAnd finally, if you are on the shelf about this game download the demo. That way, if you do get a bug up your chocolate star fish about the graphics, you can save everyone the misfortune of having to read your whiney review about how inferior the graphics are compared to next gen consoles and therefore is a terrible game...."wah! wah! wah!

Everybody has it's own experience, and i will tell you what i like in this Game (or don't like). I play only Online (tested 3x offline to be able to compare both modi) so if you are a offline Gamer, dont read or rate this review. You won't get anything out of this :).\n\nFirst of all, PES 2014 1.0 was the best PES ever made (ok, online it lagged like hell). But the rest of it, shame on you Konami. PES 2015 was "ok", but there was to much enforced by the game itself (passes, Online Momentum...) and bugs/glitches (Input lag, cursor bugs...).\n\nPES 2016 was my hope to get a finished PES with as few as possible Bugs, glitches and problems. And after 25h i can say, this Game Online (Lobby) is the best i've ever seen. I didn't experience any lag, where i couldn't find something wrong from Konami or the Game. The Teamplay lobbys, huge and massiv lags in pes 2015, are fluid. Only in 1-2 situations it slows down, but never on the Pitch (mostly when celebration for a goal or after a foul). Details you'll get in my Pros and Contras.\n\nThis Game hast the potential to be the best ever, if they fix some of my Contras. If you are a Online Gamer and you like football, buy this Game because there are nice leagues and Gaming with Friends in Lobbys is much more appreciate.\n\nIf you are a Offline Game, buy another Game or read someone elses review.\n\nPro:\n- Collision System\n- Ball handling (the ball isn't "glued" to the boots)\n- Online Experience (no more different experience between Offline and Online. No lags Online(if both players have stable connection), even the Teamplay lobby is by miles better then before)\n- No more Cursor error, i get all the time the player i want\n- Fun Factor :)\n\nContra - need to fix:\n- Referees (in 2015 every small touch was a foul and card, now its the opposite)\n- R2 shot - It's to easy to score goals and almost noe difference between Robben and an 70 CF. Disarm this shot.\n- Goalkeepers, better than Fifa but Online not good\n- MyClub - results 10:3. 7:6... more like waterpolo... this may can be fixed with better GK and disarming R2 shot. To easy to get Top Players\n- Roster updates and communication with the Fans is lousy, @AdamBhatti is a community Manager that can't communicate with us.\n\nI don't care:\n- Graphics - there is something called sweetFX, it makes your PES looking better and PS 4 like. If Konami cant(or will not) handle it, SweetFX helps and this is no reason to not recommend this Game\n- "Immersion". I don't care if beside the pitch are 3D Fans, Photographs, security guards... Offline it is available online not. I don't need it, i focus on the Game itself and chatting with friends while playing\n\nSo i hope you like this review and i helped you at least a bit.","September 22, 2015","true","307.1"," 12 of 50 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","12","50","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sambrowski/recommended/375960/","sambrowski","Sambrowski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sambrowski/","218 products in account","Make up your own mind\nFirst things first, this isn't a defence of Konami. Providing PC players with the same lighting/textures as xbox360/PS3 players is inheritly lazy and extremely short sided. If Konami see PES as a long term franchise then treating a big chunk of your community as a cash-cow is only going to make the game a harder sell in future.\n\nI'd readied myself for dissapointment. The initial PS4 reviews/gameplay footage made me optimisic from a gameplay perspective but I was under no illusions that the PC version was going to be anything other than a "hybrid" of old-gen and current-gen since the PES Franchise Manager Adam Bhaati announced it on Twitter in mid-August. The 5gb download suggested the same low res textures as PES 2015. The same-old seperate executive file for saving resolution and graphics settings suggested Konami's treatment of the PC crowd was to be the same as last year.\n\nHowever, despite all that, I'm really enjoying PES 2016 on PC.\n\nThe increased physical interaction between players is probably the first thing you'll notice if you are coming back from 2015. Players jostle, stumble and bounce off each other. The ball too will bounce and spin free of a player's control if they're put under the right kind of pressure. The physicality too, thankfully, is enhanced by much more lenient refereeing which creates more em and flow. I hated the amount of fouls and breaks in play that we had on PES previously which only benefitted dirty defenders. Now, it's more akin to the Premier League, where referees turn a blind eye to tussles around the pitch in the interest of the spectacle.\n\nPassing has also had a massive overhaul. From the mundane sideways pass to raking lobbed through balls, passes feel great and fair. I play with the default passing assist set to "1" which is essentially one notch above manual control and I found that my intended pass was the one I performed. If the pass went astray or was intercepted this felt like my fault. It wasn't until I started playing as players noted for their passing ability did I see the depth and variation to the animations within that system. Depending on the situation, players might simply pass with the inside of the foot, flick the ball behind or bend it around a defender with the outside of the foot.\n\nThe success of a football game can hinge on the balance between shooting and it's goalkeepers. Whether or not you like that dynamic this year is probably down to everyone's personal preference and possibly how you play the game. The shooting is undoubtably great. A powerful accurate shot is dependent on the player's ability, the player's body position in relation to the ball and the target as well as how you aim. If you're able to hit a dipping volley in to the top corner from 25 yards with Patrice Evra you can claim take the credit. At the same time, miss from six yards with only the keeper to beat then it's your own fault. Your body position was wrong. Too much power. Go play Mario Kart.\n\nA decent shot becomes forgetable if you don't trust your goalkeeper though. For the most part, the changes to goalkeeping this year are positive. The new physicality system means that if a keeper attempts to claim a cross through a crowd of players you are more likely to flap at the punch and create a problem for your defence than claim the ball clearly. Powerful shots aimed straight at the keeper can be parried in to the path of goal poachers. The likes of Cech, Neur and Courtois are capable of pulling off incredible saves, particularly at  top difficulty settings. However, poor to average goalkeepers offer little resistance. At lower difficulty settings this is exacerbated. This isn't much of a problem in singleplayer where you can ramp up the difficulty to create more of a challenge. In myClub however, PES' variation of FIFA's Ultimate Team, the default goalkeepers are useless. Poor stats make these folk chocolate teapots - you should make improving that position a priority if you want to avoiding conceding 4 or 5 goals every game.\n\nI'd really been hoping for a return of Peter Brackley for the 20th anniversy of PES/ISS - nope. Not this year. [I live in hope - make it happen before I die please Konami]. PES have instead replaced Jon Champion with Peter Drury. Drury, for better or worse, gives it his all. The guy's Twitter handle is @Football_Poet and he managed to bring that Grade A pretentiousness to Konami's recording studio...by shouting. A lot. Every time I've scored I'm reaching to turn the volume down on my speakers. There's only so many times you can hear "FRANCESCO TOTTI IS A GENIUS!!!" in one game before deciding never to play as Roma again.\n\nThis isn't game breaking. In fact, this year the overall presentation has improved in terms of how the game replicates TV coverage of the sport. Intro sequences are finally back, the camera tracks the players and staff from the tunnel to the pitch as Drury reads out the starting line up. It's a massive improvement on PES 2015 where the omission of any sort of intro sequence was unforgiveable.\n\nThere's no new addition in terms of game modes. myClub returns and the Master League has been given a facelift. At the time of writing this I've not yet started a Master League. My reasoning is that I refuse to start a Master League until the player transfers have been updated. As it stands it's the 21st of September and there still hasn't been any sort of transfer patch. Konami - If your game isn't ready or up to date please delay it. An annual football release should contain up to date transfers/player stats and I shouldn't have to manually input that detail myself or ask a 3rd party to develop it for me. This isn't just Konami doing this but it's a problem and is dissapointing.\n\nAnother thing that remains from previous releases is the dreadful online integration. Konami need to ask themselves whether "Establishing Communications" and "Testing Network Enviroment" really need to dominate your online experience before you get in to a game. FIFA is streaks ahead when it comes to implementing online play. You really need to put up with this if you're going to find any enjoyment online. Thankfully i've had very lit lag in gameplay in either myClub or Online Divisions so far.\n\nIn terms of performance - I have it running at 60fps and at 1080p on a GTX 570. If anything it runs slightly smoother than PES 2015 did. There's no longer any annoying pop-in of players faces which was a big problem last year. The textures of the kits and faces are a slight improvement on last year but this is without doubt technically inferior to the PS4 release on every level graphically.\n\nOverall - if you can't look past Konami's decision to ♥♥♥♥ on you for being a PC gamer you probably are not going to buy this now anyway. If you can look past that though you'll find what I think is the best football game for almost 10 years (if you exclude the PS4 version of the same game).","September 21, 2015","true","78.5"," 12 of 55 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","12","55","0","0"

Is it worth the money?\nI have concluded no not at this stage but patches may be forth coming.\nHere is the reasons why.\n\nAnimations - great to have physical animations but not when the player will not react until a certain animation has played out before control is given back to the player. Im looking at you defenders. Bloody annoying to gift goals because your player is doing his own thing while someone runs by him. Otherwise they aren't too bad.\n\nGoalkeepers - Awful again......They seem to be incapable to stop low down center of goal shots most times. These are WORLD CLASS goal keepers not sunday league players, and these shots are easy meat from a real goalie. I would rather a game where scores are 1-0 everytime than watching such soft goals be scored from 20 yrds out as common as the sun rising. Goal keepers need to be improved greatly in football games all round really. The fun does not come from 5 goals a game every game but the teamwork to score a well worked goal. Beef the goal keepers please or give me a super goalies DLC if I have to pay for it.\n\nGraphics - Better than 2015 but sadly when the same game on another system less powerful than PC has better graphics something is wrong? Why? Still playable and better than FIFA but unacceptable that we same graphics were not released on PC. Just copy the TV replays for once like FIFA.....\n\nGameplay - Closest thing to real football on a gaming system. Still do not like players making runs in to incorrect areas or holding off on runs when aches of space open up for them. Fullbacks seem to be the only players that make quality runs most times. Midfielders are hit and miss.\n\nSound - Commentary is not good. Screaming what a stinging shot that tested a goalie when the ball rolled slowly along for him to pick it up breaks emersion. Better to just turn commentary off and listen to the generally good crowd sounds.\n\nExtras - Not enough teams - not sure if it is a licensing thing but some large teams from the unused leagues such as galatasaray are missing. Still no German league. Have to wait for the mods to fix this.\nMenus not too bad this year.\n\nMods - Thank god for mods. Do we really need to keep making our own games?\n\nI still love PES more than the ping pong FIFA gameplay and gameplay is what counts. But please please improve the goalies as they are not that ♥♥♥♥ and please release the HD graphics improvements of the PS4 even if you do it by blood sucking DLC.\n\nRecommend.....Just, because there is no other choice yet.

So much improvement from PES 2015. Definitely the best gameplay ever for PES franchise to date.\n+ Much easier to dribble and control player. Easier to pass and shoot too.\n+ Fluid and realistic. New animations added.\n+ Slightly improved myClub.\n+ Much improved Master League.\n\n- Still no license for many major clubs, especially BPL teams. Fortunately we can alwasy use third party patch with PES.\n- Last season roster. Seriously KONAMI? European transfer window ended more than two weeks ago.\n- Coins bought in PES 2015 can't be transferred to PES 2016.\n- Old gen port. PS4 (and I assume XBox O too) has better graphics no matter how powerful your PC is.\n- Getting an opponent in online mode is not that easy, just a bit better than PES2015.\n\n\nI nearly decided not to buy this game after being discouraged by so many negative reviews marked as helpful.\nI then downloaded FIFA 2015 demo in Origin but the gameplay is still not that convincing to make me buy it.\n\nI have been playing both PES and FIFA franchises since 1997. Gameplay is by far the most important aspect to me, that's why I stopped playing FIFA after FIFA 2003 (or 2004?) but not with PES.\n\nLong story short, I decided to buy this game just like I did last year with PES 2015.\nSurprisingly, I found this game to be much better than PES 2015 despite getting lower rating. While I'm not justifying KONAMI decision to port the old gen (PS3) instead of the next gen (PS4), I still can't understand all the hatred toward this game. Yes, the graphics is worse than PS4 but it's not like it is so bad and makes it unplayable.\n\nWhile I admit I too am disappointed with KONAMI for several reasons I mentioned above, I feel like I have to recommend this game and write this review to counter all those haters.

Before that I played almost every game of the series ( and enjoyed it ). This year I wanted to give it another try and I have to admit that I have some mixed feelings about it, though I recommend it, not to everyone but to people who prefere pure football over graphics and presentation.\nOf course there are lots of negative aspects about the game and I have to admit that I don´t like them. The presentation, crowd, animations and graphics are far away from what could have been possible on this platform...again. Konami isn´t very interested in the pc community as it seems. But that is not new. I guess it´s a general problem of asian publishers who have their focus on consoles and handhelds. Nevertheless, this is, year after year, a punch to the face for all pc players.\nHowever, if you can keep these facts out of your mind and don´t consider them most important for a football game, you will have a lot of fun with PES 2016. The gameplay is great, it feels like football ( especially when you´ve played football in real life, like myself ). The speed of the game is clearly slower than FIFA´s, although you can speed it up via gameplay settings if you like. In my opinion the slower gamespeed makes it more realistic, but everyone has his preferences. The tactical behaviour of the players and the changes you can make are great. There are lots of possibilities to create goal opportunities, teammates are moving into good positions, the defense feels strong ( when you compare it to FIFA ), which means that you have to create your chances instead of dribbling through the whole team. You can score in so many different ways instead of learning the positions or situations ( FIFA ) where you score every time.\n\nWhat I want to say with all that is, that the gameplay ( for me ) clearly overweights the visual issues of the game ( which it obviously has).\n\nRecommended, as I said earlier, to people who prefere pure football over graphics.","September 18, 2015","true","9.7"," 8 of 75 people (11%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","11","8","75","0","0"

It doesn't seem to matter who plays in goal, Neuer or not, keepers simply cannot catch anything inside a penalty box.\n\nIf you overlook this "slight" concern, gameplay is excellent and game is a joy to play even now. There has been a lot upset about graphics looking worse in PC version than XboxOne/PS4 – grass looks like astroturf in PC version. Personally I don't mind that at all, when playing online matches replays are often skipped and there is no telling which kind of grass roots are there growing on the pitch.\n\nNew animations are great and the passing seems to be better than PES 2015. Tactics have improved a lot. MyClub has a interesting feature with players gaining experience points after matches. After a goalkeeper patch and first updated Data Pack this game would be my number one choice for a football game this year.\n\nEdit: Tip: I have to ALT-TAB out of the game once to go from sluggish 7 fps to 144 fps. :)","September 18, 2015","true","108.0"," 4 of 63 people (6%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","6","4","63","0","1"

Have real PES players ever cared about that?\n\nGameplay is what matters and that has improved many times over PES 2015.\n\nGetting more into details.\n\n- It seems COM levels dropped a bit so Pro seems way too easy to beat and Top Player feels more like Pro in 2015.\n- Online gameplay differs to the offline, which is normal but seems further apart than in 2015. What I mean , it is very hard to defent hence the high scores (played 5 games almost all of them had 5 goals in first half. I put it also down to the length of games, since 2015 10 min was way too long for realistic scores, 7 mins matches seem perfect for me.\n- In 2016 I feel I can create almost any action I want, players make runs, fight for the ball, respond quickly to controls etc.\n- some nice animations on first touches, unconventional passes done by better players - this gives some great feel to the game\n\nOf course must admit current price is a bit of a rip off considering that PC gamers are not getting all features and graphic uplift, so for that reason I would still recommend the game but maybe wait for a price reduction.","September 17, 2015","true","44.9"," 8 of 80 people (10%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","10","8","80","4","0"

THIS DOES NOT LOOK AS GOOD AS THE PS4/X1 VERSION. Not even close. It only looks a tiny bit better than the PS3/X360 release and visually speaking, is a current gen port. However, they warned us this would be the case since JUNE, saying that the PC version was a hybrid that was better than the current gen, but not as good as next gen (in terms of visuals). They said they didn't have all the resources to fully port the next gen version (probably ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, I admit.)\n\nHOWEVER.\n\nThis is the best football game I have ever played in my life. I have played FIFA since FIFA 06, and this is the best football game I have ever played. The gameplay is really special, it flows very naturally, and while its not perfect, FIFA plays like a disgusting joke compared to this game.\n\nAnd thats...about all it has going for it.\n\nMaster League is ehh\nAll the other modes are ehh, so ehh that I don't even remeber what they are.\nAnd liscences (obviously) are non existant as usual for the BPL and the Bundesliga.\n\n\nSo if you can handle going back to the pile of garbage that is FIFA because the game isn't as pretty as you want it, don't buy this game. But if you can stomach some average visuals, you won't regret this game. Its really great in terms of what matters - The 90 minutes on the pitch.\n\nP.S. it actually isn't a direct copy of the current gen version, It's its own hybrid version and contains several features that the current gen release doesnt, including extra custscenes and animations.

I said for offline! and I only recommend for people who picked PES over FIFA for a decade.\n\n- Nice gameplay, smooth and fluid, especially for someone who love BAL mode on PES\n- Acceptable graphic, can reach 60FPS on mid-low machine with high graphic setting but not good enough for games which have launched on Q3-2015\n- Stupid GK, 80% will be goal if you shot on target!\n- Referees were imported from WWE TV-Show, they can't see any important incidents and always ignore them\n- Unplayable online mode, you may need very good connection to play online with delay around 1sec. But if you use normal connection which can play other games, e.g. DOTA2 CS:GO or whatever, delay will be around 2-3 sec.
