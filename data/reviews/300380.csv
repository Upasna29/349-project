I've been dealing with a lot of "big" companies' customer support, and getting terrible customer support (including having my requests shut down with no communication - thanks, Sony). So when I emailed the developers of Road Redemption regarding issues around a 32 bit win7 4GB machine, not only was I highly surprised to see a responce within 4 hours (give or take 20 minues) but having an actually answer (in this case, I was informed that the issue had been noticed and the game would be patched in a few hours).  In one contact, the developers not only smashed my expections, I now use them as an example of a company doing it right. So, developers, please please please, keep up the great work.","May 31, 2015","true","4.1"," 217 of 239 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","217","239","8","5"

(Game handles pretty well, keeping that balance between realism and fun.)\nAction Packed (Game keeps players on their toes, with funny wipeouts in the mix of things.)\nLots of Weapons (Tons of things to fight with, including guns, which Road Rash never had.)\nUpgrades and Perks (They work wonderfully and really help the player through the race.)\nDifferent Environments (They change as your progress.)\nA Secret Map (Are you guys kidding me... Freaking Rainbow Road from Mario Kart?!?!YES!)\nThings I feel need some work:\nOptimization (The maps can become very very laggy with frames dropping to around 5 FPS, I have a pretty beefy rig with a Radeon 7970 and it shouldn't have problems with a game like this.)\nVoice Overs ( I really wish there was some kind of voices for the police and riders, not really dialoge, more like "Oofs" or laughter and maybe a "Pull over!" from some cops now and then.)\nCharacter Customization (There really isn't any, but this is early access and I have a feeling this could change easily.)\nOverall this game is really fun and takes me back to the good 'ol PSX days sitting around my house, playing Co-op smacking my father with a chain in Road Rash Jailbreak.\n","September 18, 2014","true","7.1"," 176 of 199 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","176","199","0","26"

This game is still unfinished.  There are really only three tracks, and half of a campaign to play through as of my last playthrough.\n\nWith that out of the way, this is pretty much the absolutely insane Road Rash successor that I didn't know I wanted.\n\nThe main campaign mode (the only thing implmented in the version I've played) is semi randomly generated (meaning that you'll get random victory conditions on the tracks), and has rogue like elements like permadeath and an ability to buy stats with the money you collected during a run.  The campaign, so far as I can tell, still follows a basic track structure.  It goes desert tracks for a few races, rooftop tracks (which is where most of the glitches seem to currently reside), winter track (which is basically a greyier version of the desert track), and quite literally Rainbow Road from Mario Kart.  What really makes these tracks dynamic is the random effects you can get.  Like all oncoming traffic, weather effects, or even raining and explosive cars.  Some of these effects are amazing, and really push the races from fun but basic to absolutely crazy.\n\nThe actual bike handling is pretty forgiving, if a little stiff.  It's pretty easy to stay on the track, barring some occasional blind turns.  I do kinda wish there was more tactile feel to the handling, since it really doesn't feel like you are even on a bike.  But in the context of the game it isn't so bad.  Because it works well with the game's combat system.\n\nWhich is the meat and potatoes of this game.  It is amazingly satisfying to club someone over the head with a pipe.  Most of my time in the campaign mode was chasing down and braining rival racers.  The more racers you take out, the more money and better weapons you are granted, thus continuing the cycle of violence.  The gun play seemed okay, but I honestly didnt try it much, since I really just wanted to beat more racers (and police, and random traffic) with melee objects.\n\nOf the games three basic tracks, the desert/winter ones are the best realized.  The rooftop tracks I had issues falling out of the level geometry and getting stuck.  And the Rainbow Road alike track makes for an interesting easter egg, but wasn't much fun to race on, with constant tight turns and narrow track width, and no traffic to interact with.  But these are things I'd assume would be smoothed out over time.\n\nOverall, thus far there's not a wealth of features in the game, but what is there is quite fun.  The combat is fun enough that I found myself slowing down just to hit more racers with blunt objects.  And doing so while cars are dropping from the sky and exploding is quite amazing.  I'd recommend it once it becomes a more complete product.  Even now it's pretty fun, but the glitches and lack of content mar it currently.  If a totally crazy and still very playable bike combat game sounds up your alley though, I'd go ahead and recommend it now.","November 25, 2014","true","8.8"," 71 of 83 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","71","83","0","0"

There are some sensibilities to keep in mind, however. Road Redemption is a lot more modern in its arcade style. Controls are more lenient, though racing does have some weight. In turn, physics are crazy over the top for extra excitement from jumps and debris flying across the road.\n\nCombat packs a punch with lots of different weapon choices, though firearms suffer from poor camera control right now.

There was this gem of a title called Road Rash that was just about the coolest thing anyone had seen at the time.\n\nRoad Redemption takes the spirit of that old classic, slaps some more meat on the bones, and brings it into the modern gaming scene, with it's own original twists.\n\nRoad Redemption is a straight arcade game. Don't go looking for a "racing" game here so much. The emphasis is much less about getting to the finish line first, and more about making sure nobody else does.\n\nAnd that's where it shines. Road Redemption doesn't try to be anything it's not. It knows it's a fun, quirky arcade racing rampage. That's all it wants to be.\nThe graphics are not amazing, but not bad. The sound is a bit rought, but the music is good.\n\nCurrently the game is not without it's faults, there's some performance issues, sound effects could REALLY use their own volume slider (they can get insanely loud at times), the camera control while shooting is a bit hard to use, and the menus and such are pretty minimalist.\n\nAt it's core though, the game is just crazy fun. You'll find yourself playing it over and over, even after telling yourself "Just one more time...".\nThe plans they have for adding multiplayer and stuff in the future only add even more to look forward.\n\nI do love seeing the collaborations with other indie devs too. (Shovel Knight starting with a shovel FTW!)\n\nAll in all, for a fun, crazy good time that mimics the joy of old school fun times, Road Redemption is totally worth the asking price.","July 5, 2015","true","10.0"," 42 of 45 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","42","45","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970396137/recommended/300380/","76561197970396137","Martleby","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970396137/","91 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThe following is based on 5 hours play of the Early Access version, which I hope will provide some useful non-partisan feedback to the developers.\n\n1) This is not a racing game\nRacing games tend to have some things in common. They have tracks, they have timers, they have scores, they have course records, they have winners and losers, they challenge the player to improve, and they instil a sense of progression and achievement. Road Redemption has and does none of these things.\n\nRoad Redemption neither rewards success nor frowns upon failure. You simply must not die, or else you’re back to square one. Take a “race” event, for example. To win any money you must finish in the top three. However the sorts of thing you can spend your money on post-race are health top-ups, nitro-replacements and other items that ameliorate the damage of the previous race. Given that the aim is simply not to die, it behoves the player not to actually take part in the race. I, for example, employ a half-throttle strategy, simply puttering around at half-throttle avoiding obstacles, combat and various other hazards in order to get to the end with as little damage as possible. More often than not this strategy leads to a top three finish, but it doesn’t matter anyway because you can still progress to the next event regardless of where you finish. I’ll say it again: there is no benefit to taking part in the race because the aim is not to die.\n\nWhat of the other events, such as Take Down, Jump Jets, and Police Attention? The same applies. Your priority is not to die and “failure” doesn’t hinder your progress. So should you a) participate and risk death for no benefit or, b) pull off to the side of the track and do something else for three minutes? If you answered “b” you’re beginning to see the problem with Road Redemption.\n\n2) The tracks need a designer\nRoad Redemption’s ‘road’ courses are dull and boring. They largely consist of four and six lane highways, long, sweeping, shallow corners and some of the dullest designs I’ve ever seen. If you were hoping to experience the thrill of opening the throttle into a blind corner on to oncoming traffic, darting between cars and trucks as your heart starts beating that bit quicker, Road Redemption will leave you disappointed.\n\nThe roof-top courses are simply dreadful and need to go. If I want to race in a city I want to do it at ground level. I want to blast down alleys, race through shopping malls, crash into curiously placed fruit stalls. What I don’t want is to race on roofs crashing into air-conditioning units. Nor do I want to fall off the side of a building and for the game to reposition me somewhere in mid-air leading to an inescapable death cycle, which seems to happen rather more often than it ought.\n\nDon’t get me started on Rainbow Road. This is out of place and even the game doesn’t seem to understand it. I’ve “fallen” off this track to have the game reposition me after the finish line - the bike indicator jumped from the progress meter to the right hand side of the screen and I could not finish the race. I’d also say this: if you want to do something a bit self-referential or add a knowing wink to a game, pick something from your own history like a 16-bit Road Rash level. Don’t pluck something out of a completely different series like Mario Kart.\n\n3) Procedures are for bureaucrats\nHad I been careful enough to read that Road Redemption uses a lot of “procedural generation” beforehand I almost certainly would not have bought it. Why?\n\na) Because infinitely generated dullness is infinitely dull and,\nb) Because developers never give you the option to replay the same procedurally generated level.\n\nThere’s nothing wrong with adding a bit of randomness to a game - games like the Burnout series have been doing this successfully for years - but when everything is random and there’s no mechanism to replay a “procedurally” generated course then there is no sense of progression or achievement.\n\nImagine that you’d actually bothered engaging with the game (which you won’t, see 1 above) and you’d come first in a race. Imagine further that you’d had so much fun, you thought you’d like to play the exact same level again. What if you then wanted to share that level with friends for a bit of friendly competition? What if you’d like to have a play with the parameters sent into the procedures to see what sort of madness you could generate - or better yet have the control to create and share your own courses? Well tough. You can’t.\n\nThis strikes me as a massive oversight and one that should be easily fixable, but strangely never seems to occur to developers.\n\n4) It’s not about the bikes\nCall me a traditionalist but I expect a bike game to have a good range of bikes, all with unique handling and performance characteristics. I want a bike shop so I can ogle over the Diablo 1000, I want an upgrade shop so I can fit nuclear-powered rocket-motors to my bike. I want to indulge my virtual-bike fantasies.\n\nRoad Redemption doesn’t give you any of this. Instead you get a skill tree (of which more later) and jump jets.\n\n5) Moral hazard?\nYou might think that bike-based combat would be an almost infinite source of fun, but in truth it gets old very quickly. I played through the original Road Rash recently and found the combat there to be far superior even though it was far more limited. Why?\n\nIt’s all to do with focus. Road Rash is a racing game where limited violence can be deployed to your advantage (and often chagrin when it goes wrong). Road Redemption is a non-racing game where egregious violence is used all the time for no specific purpose other than you can. Road Rash also introduced consequences for being violent (albeit in a limited way - Natasha being rude to you wasn’t the end of the world), whereas Road Redemption’s violence is entirely consequence free.\n\nYou can have all the guns, clubs, bombs and swords you want but if they only exist for the sake of existing what’s the point?\n\nPS Swinging from helicopters sounds like it should be fun, but isn’t.\n\n6) Do you wanna be in my gang?\nAnother thing the original Road Rash got right was its personality and connection to the game world. There are other characters who converse (yes, in a limited way) with you and draw you into the  world of illegal street racing.\n\nRoad Redemption, on the other hand, is completely impersonal. You are apparently a member of some bike gang (of which the only evidence is the occasional appearance of a rider with a green arrow pointing to him), battling other gangs (who are they, why are we fighting?) in some strange dystopian world of which you - the player - have little knowledge of and probably care even less about.\n\n7) Skill me up, Scotty!\nIf there is a golden rule to racing games it’s that the player’s skill comes first and foremost. If the player enters a corner too fast and ends up embedded in a wall that is his or her problem; conversely if a player executes the perfect jump, squeezes between two oncoming vehicles and wins by the narrowest of narrow margins that is the player’s reward. It’s fine to add some variability - such as tires bursting, engines blowing etc. etc. - but it should, essentially, be all about the player.\n\nRoad Redemption’s skill system flies in the face of this. The player’s actual skill is replaced by a tree of variables (or “skills”) that affect the outcome, turning the game into a grind rather than focusing on improving and rewarding the player’s real skill (or would do if the player engaged with the game: see 1, above).\n\n8) Control, oh pitiful control\nI found the game almost impossible with mouse and keyboard. Imagine piloting a brick at 100mph. That’s Road Redemption with a mouse and keyboard. A controller is infinitely better - as long as you don’t try using any of the ranged weapons.\n","November 1, 2014","false","5.8"," 158 of 241 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","158","241","6","13"

I used to love playing those games back in the days. ^ ^\n\nHere you race against other motorcyclists, punching, kicking, grabbing, using melee weapons and firearms to attack or slow down their progress.\nEach race has a different requirement and mission. One might have you to simply get 1st place, another will have you cause enough chaos to get the attention of the cops or another mission may ask you to smash every motorcyclist and vehicle you see.\nSuccessfully pulling off completed missions will earn you a lot of money and XP, and the more motorcyclists, cops and vehicles you take out the more XP and money you earn.\n\nAfter each race you can use the money to buy different boosts and buffs. You keep them as long as you stay alive, but if you die they are all gone but after death you can use the XP you have earned for permanent upgrades like a better motorcycle, increased health, better weapons, increased weapon durability and a whole lot more.\n\nThis is an early access game so you will see some bugs throughout, like being able to drive through bridge columns with no collision detection or sometimes the camera will rotate on its own in another direction which can lead to crashes because you are trying to fix the camera position and there is no camera reset button or key so you have to manually move the camera back behind the driiver and try to get it as centered as possible so your driving isn't off. But this is something that can easily be fixed in an update.\n\nSo far Road Redemption looks really good and has a lot of promise and if you are a fan of the Road Rash series then you will really enjoy this game. :)","October 25, 2014","true","3.7"," 47 of 60 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","47","60","0","0"

After hearing of this nostalgic remake I had to check it out.\n\nWhat I like about the game:\n+ Fast paced. No boring bits here folks.\n+ Action can get intense, especially when you are paying attention to the road hazards as well.\n+ Tons of weapons to weild.\n+ Riding physics are pleasant with a nice "arcade" feel.\n+ Plenty of ways of dispatching your foes into the asphalt, speeding cars, poles, concrete etc.\n+ Runs smooth on older hardware (circa 2005) and is rock stable.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- Rooftop & Space levels are disjointed from the fast flow of the other levels.\n- Rooftop levels have minor bugs that cause your cycle to crash.\n- Seems to be an unnecessary mid-air slow down effect off ramps and jumps.\n- Some textures are low-res and are reminiscent of late '90's Direct3D games.\n- A few of the music tracks are out of place.\n\nWhat I'd like to see:\n= The textures pumped up to decent resolutions.\n= Music tracks that fit the grunge / metal theme of this game.\n= Speedometer.\n= Crashed bikes become obstacles. Just to create some jeopardy for firearms lovers.\n= More bikes + riders to select.\n= Upgradeable bike parts from tyres to turbos to keep the game interesting.\n= Less "catch up" handicap.\n\nThese are small negatives on a massively fun game. I might sound a little harsh on a game that isn't finished, however I feel that the game and it's current content just need a minor nudge in the right direction before it gets polished so that it will be the killer game experience it deserves.","February 19, 2015","true","18.0"," 39 of 48 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","39","48","0","1"

The combat is fairly satisfying, hectic, and has some great visual feedback. It's fun at first, but then you start to encounter some problems.\n\nFor one thing, the physics are REALLY rough. I understand that this was (is-being, rather, as it is still in Early Access) made using Unity, and this is an ambitious project for the engine. Bouncing around canyons and buildings like a racketball while screaming at a hundred miles an hour is humorous at first, but I found myself quickly frustrated as I would tap a rock on the side of the road on accident and then be propelled into the sky a hundred feet up. Or better yet, scream down a road as fast as possible and run into a slightly-protruding drain pipe and suddenly come to a dead stop.\n\nFor another thing, the skyscraper levels are interesting, but dumb. You get a grapple gun and jet boosters. The grapple gun is difficult to use, especially as there is no tutorial for it. The jet boosters are fun, but given the tight turns and deceptive nature of the tracks, you will likely plummet to your doom. Again. And again. And...again.\n\nAlso, there are only a handful of different tracks, none of which are particularly inspired. Even the rainbow road one is little more than frustrating. The first few missions have you repeating the same track with different start points or a different time of day, but it can get tiresome once the gameplay begins to wear thin.\n\nAnd finally, the game is rather unstable. It's crashed on me three times so far and I've only played about 80 minutes of it.\n\nI understand that this is early access, but it is still very rough around the edges. I like the combat a lot, I like the light RPG advancement elements, I like the variety of weapons. This game shows a lot of potential, but has a long road ahead of it before I can give it a thumbs up. Once they iron out these issues, it will definitely be worth getting, but until then, ride on friend.","June 15, 2015","false","7.0"," 82 of 122 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","82","122","3","0"

Why is it so difficult for developers to replicate Road Rash? Every reboot, remake, reimagining, homage, always focuses on the fighting. Fighting in Road Rash was a novelty but not what made the game special. It was the racing. The twisting turns, the trecherous roadways; it was the rush when you threaded the needle at top speed on the 15th mile of Pacific highway. The key to success was racing clean or a kick to your opponent at an opportune time, because getting into a slugfest slowed you down and cost you the race. It was as much you against the level as it was you against your opponents. There was a vibe, an edge, and one hell of a soundtrack.\n\nRoad Redemption has none of these things. It is bland and devoid of character. It focuses too much on weapons and damaging your opponents and not enough on racing or level design. The core gameplay mechanic, how you navigate through the game, is also flawed. Rather than a hub where you can select races or make a name for yourself on some underground circuit, you are forced to progress through a series of "levels". Each level has an objective, win the race, take out x number of oppontents, use this special move, etc. The kicker: when you die, you start back at the beginning. Not a unique concept, starting at the beginning when you die, but an odd one for a racing game. And for a game with such drab gameplay, repeating the opening levels numerous times is more punishment than consequence.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a Road Rash equivalent, keep looking. This game offers no redemption.","February 12, 2015","false","0.5"," 153 of 242 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","153","242","5","11"

The swerving is tight, the way your rider stiffens up to take a swing with his weapon, kicking other riders in midair, hitting the brakes to power through a turn horizontally, landing on riders to knock them off... it's all there.\n\nThe destruction is fun and ludicrous. The original Road Rash had a more "serious" feel to it, while this spiritual remake turns it up to 11 for good measure.\n\nWith its short levels (2-5 minutes of intense racing) and the cash/xp rewards model that doesn't really offer any poor choices, this is a great "pass the controller" game to play with others and it's easy to play "just one more race"\n.\nPros:\n-slick action arcade racing mechanics\n-large amount of vehicles on screen\n-great draw distance\n-good collision detection and sounds\n-wide tracks\n-highly replayable campaign\n-includes New Game+\n-multiplayer on the horizon\n-pretty good uptempo music\n-generated level geometry feels consistent, works well\n-guns feel substantial and are well balanced\n\nPros that used to be cons but were improved by development:\n-powersliding/skidding now feels weighty and fun\n-critical attacks now look special\n-more vehicle enemies which create traffic chaos on the roads\n\nCons:\n-no interesting differences between enemy rider types other than durability\n-camera can be annoying and finnicky on rooftop levels, can't see where you're landing\n-engine sounds are kinda boring and inconsistent with your speed\n-audio cutting on gunfire\n\n\nBugs, Issues, Suggestions\nAs an early access title, I don't count bugs as Cons as these issues will likely be fixed with development time\n\n-Experience point abilities could use some more interesting choices aside from increased health, damage, critical hits, etc\n-no gender selection (Player or AI... Road Rash did have the infamous Natasha, after all)\n-could use some more rolling road hazards. The logging trucks are a good idea, maybe throw in gas tankers that can be shot for explosions, tractor trailers that are carrying cars, and more trucks in general\n-no oil slicks or ways of losing traction like Road Rash\n-jumps make you lose speed, no purpose to ramps being in the middle of some of the levels, perhaps stunts will be added for experience/nitrous/health gain effects?\n-more racing types or ludicrous level effects would be great... perhaps modes such as Slalom, Guns-Only, Always-On Nitrous\n-no chain weapon (come on this was a key Road Rash weapon!)\n\nConclusion: For an early access title this is so far a quality experience, and is nowhere near the realm of early access games that come out unplayable or with false hopes and undelivered promises. Humble Deal or Winter Sale makes it a no-brainer, and at the original price it's still a great value for anyone that likes Road Rash or action/arcade racing, and hopefully when the success comes and the sales roll in, the developers (who seem like great people) will continue to make meaningful updates and get the game to a solid 1.0 state.\n\nThumbs Up!","December 13, 2014","true","9.1"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","33","43","0","0"

I was a huge fan of the RR series back in the day, so I was really excited when I heared of this new game. And now it's on Steam! Altough not entirely the same as Road Rash, it reminds me to it in many ways. If you ever played and liked Road Rash, you will definitely like Road Redemption too. Even though it's in EA at the moment, I already had lots of fun playing it; racing while beating the crap out of your rival gang members with various melee weapons and firearms. Get launched from you bike when you smash into something because you weren't paying attention. There are straight forward races for the top spot, races where you have to defeat a set number of rivals or races where you have to attract as many police officers as possible. You can earn money, wich you can spend on more health, nitro, damage you cause and much more. However, you loose all this, when you die. Besides money, you also earn XP, wich you can use to upgrade various aspects. These upgrades are permanent, even after you die. So you get stronger and better equipped, every time you start a new game. I also like the soundtrack; varied music tracks wich suit the game very well. Graphics and sound are descent, not great but they get the job done. Overall I'm quite pleased with the game in it's current state. Development is ongoing so it can only get better. It's difficult to say if it's already worth your money, looking at the amount of content. For example, MP is not yet available. It's just very subjective.

Maybe when there's like a lap race mode or a race only mode it will be more enjoyable and yes I understand that Road Rash had the same linear race style.

The developers also care deeply about this game because they keep optimizing it! If you have a modern computer you will enjoy it.\n\nBUT OLDER COMPUTERS BE WARNED: It is semi-playable as of the September 27th, 2014 update. The miniumn requirements are a lower than they should be. You will have problems running it if not at the recommended settings.\n\nI own a Laptop with a dual core 2.1 ghz processor from 2009. It gets the job done when I want to play some older games (I can even run skyrim on low settings decently).  If you turn down the settings down to 'fastest' setting and change the resolution to the lowest you can get acceptable framerates that allow you to play the game without too much of problem. You still might suffer from random studdering and low framerate. At least now you can acutally able to control your character and even knock some other npcs off their bike. The first level for some reason is very resource intensive (maybe too many cars and objects loaded) but the later levels run pretty well. At this time I can play it but I still get frustrated when the controls don't respond as quickly as would like (but it is definitly better than it was before!). Still get a few random pauses in the game, and the framerate will drop when something happens.\n\nI think what I'm more impressed is how much the developer has optimized this game, even for older computers.

I loved the old Road Rash games, which were clearly an inspiration to this game.\nI should probably add; I randomly got this game for free from the devs; they asked nicely if I wanted to review their game. Which is the reason I wrote a review of it in the first place. I usually don't write reviews much... Of course, if I didn't like the game, I would still review it, just with a different verdict.\n\nThings this game are IMO missing a bit are the story line. I always liked having an excuse to kick Biff off his bike in Road Rash. hahaha. I was also a bit disappointed you can't seem to buy or improve on the bikes, instead it's just improved with some skill stat. And obviously a myrad of PC options are still missing at the current moment.\nBut oh well, as this an early access, I'll just go over to what's actually there;\n\nSo there's the mayhem on the road rashes, which are fun enough of course: Kicking the opponents off the road, and the random weapons used to literally beat the competition.\n\nThe game's main focus seems to be more on the over-the-top action. You might start out with a simple club to swing around, but you can end up with 'jetpacks' and grenade launchers.\n\nThe campaign mode is randomly generated, and in some events you need to do certain tasks in order to win, rather than just race to the finish line. Sometimes beating rival gangs, and other cases attracting alot of police attention or fighting the competition without using weapons.\n\nThere's even rooftop races going on, which is pretty wild. And you have crazy stuff like jump jets to make sure you can reach that next rooftop.\nAnd there even was a racing level where it was raining cars. Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nAfter each event you can buy some upgrades, which will stay with you as long as you survive, and improve on skills permanently. Sometimes you also get offered a new weapon to play around with.\n\nCurrently the game's already full of action. If you loved the mayhem in the old Road Rash games, and want more of that, you'll certainly like what this early access already has to offer.\nBut don't expect a racing simulator out of it just yet, so far it's more an arcade action game.","October 9, 2014","true","2.7"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","33","45","0","3"

In fact, I do - on *FIRST IMPRESSIONS* this game is awesome and full of potential.  But it remains that - potential. All too quickly the loose-and-lazy slap-dash approach of unprofessional early access devs becomes apparent.\n\nAs a demo it's great and gets you excited. As a proper game? It's rough, unbalanced, repetitive, buggy, generally unpolished and has barely been seen any meaningful updates in months.\nI feel the design of this game has lost it's way - the dev blog hasn't been updated in over 12 months?!  How about sharing a roadmap to completion.\n\nDon't buy if you're hoping for a finished, polished game worth playing more than a couple hrs. I bought in hoping they'd follow through and now I regret it.\n\n\n==================\n\nupdate - I've been contacted by the devs asking to discuss my review, which is very decent of them. I appreciate that they take the time to engage with feedback on a 1 to 1 basis. The response was literally "yes, we know, we are working on all those things".\n\nI think regular news posts on what's to come might manage expectations a bit better?\n\nIf you're interested, these are my issues:\n\n- Transparency.\nI am invested in this Early Access game because it shows potential. I don't know what your priorities are going forward toward v1.0.  Early Access is (usually) where devs take feedback and keep their supporters in the loop about future plans, yet most updates are minor polish/bugfixes with no mention of what's next on the list.\nAlso, no posts on the dev blog since mid-2014... This leaves me wondering what the developers believe the game needs in order to be considered 'complete', because people investing during Early Access might want to know. Heck, in the very least I hope the developers consider *listening to their early access supporters* somewhere on the list of priorities, because why the heck do we buy-in to an unfinished game in the first place? Because we believe in you...\n\n\nSome aspects of the game could be awesome, and instead feel 'tacked on' / meaningless.\n- Story\nNothing? any motivation behind playing the game? even Road Rash 1 had basic NPC dialog that meant something...\nSuggestion: invest in making me care about progressing thru the random content. Even just a bit of text explaining the backstory is better than nothing.\n\n- all the things, all the time.\nchoose a bike, choose a rider, have lots of random weapons, figure out all the controls, all the tactics, do all the things - in your first race?!   Everything is there. Nothing feels especially useful.\nSuggestion: A carefully crafted progression whereby the game begins with just a couple of options, and as I progress, I learn about each new weapon / gear / perk / bike / rider etc as part of a well designed game... I am told there is a plan for this but "it just isn't in the game yet."   If there's plans for this stuff - *tease me* with it in a news update, and I will fall in love with this game all over again!! It's a no-brainer!\n\n- randomly generated missions.\nWhy? Sure in theory it's 'less repetitive', but honestly they're all pretty similar in practice and you get no warning of what's coming next.\nSuggestion: Different missions require different tactics and/or equipment.  Foreshadow what's coming and let me choose my perks / gear before tackling the next leg of the journey. This system works well in countless other random-encounter games, and would work well for a 'pick a path' progression across the map of the USA - eg: route A is more direct but dangerous, route B takes detours but offers better rewards.\n\n\nPerks System -\nA lot of choices, a lot of them redundant in certain situations, or too cryptic.\nSuggestion:  Make these choices meaningful! eg: explain what criticals are / how they work before asking me to spend $ on improving them.\n\n\n- GUI\nit's terrible. I assume this is getting an overhaul at some stage...?\n\n\n- Online Multiplayer ...?\nit's totally ok if you can't do it - just say so already!","September 17, 2015","false","5.0"," 41 of 59 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","41","59","0","0"

It's a simple premise.\n\nIt was, basically, the video game that your mother referenced everytime she had book club and the ladies started ranting about senseless violence. Hence, of course, it was arguably one of the best games of all time.\n\nRoad Redemption is Road Rash re-done, with a couple of extras thrown in - there's a better upgrade system in terms of EXP which makes the game feel a little rogue-like - not a negative point at all, since it allows you to have a couple of races, crash and die, upgrade your stuff if you can, and not worry about being stuck on some difficult level without progressing.\n\nDuring breaks in levels you can use your cash to buy upgrades at the store - these upgrades only last as long as you do: once you die you lose these (but keep your EXP upgrades).\n\nThere are also a lot more weapons, which is fantastic, and riders and bikes with stats that affect gameplay.\n\nIf you have played Road Rash:It's Road Rash basically.\n\nWhat I would like to see:Voice-overs. In the style of Quake and Unreal Tournament, annoucing when I'm on a rampage or something.\n\nAdditional bikes and weapons are a maybe, as well as a larger skill tree. New maps and locations would be fantastic as well!\n\nAll in all though, this game is quite complete, and definitely a recommended buy!","December 29, 2015","true","1.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","2"

I used to love Road rage games back in the day. This one lives up to that name for sure.\n\nIt's a rouge-like type game but with races. You get different weapons and different mission which are randomized every single time you start a new game. Once you beat missions and start progressing you get power ups inbetween races/rounds. Along those you also level up your charachter and can unlock abilities which are permanent. This means you keep coming back for more and more action. There are 5 bike choices at the start and they vary in acceleration, grip, steering, top speed etc. You can also pick riders, it includes a flaming pumpkin as a rider so you can be Ghostrider too lol. Other noticible biker is a Shovel Knights character as a rider. There is a Psycho rider too which i think is the reference to the Borderlands Psychos but i am not too sure about this one as it looks a bit different.\n\nGameplay is very similar to the old Road rage formula. You race and in the race you get to bash your opponents with a variety of weapons including guns, pipes, baseball bats, shovel etc.  This game is very arcade-ish and races can be very adrenaline fueled and exciting. Very very fun gameplay in my opinion\n\nGraphics are decent, not the best out there but not that bad either. For an arcade type game like this you don't need top of the line realistic graphics anyways. Some of the maps looks very good while others not so much so i guess graphics are average.\n\nSound can really use an improvement in my opinion. The crash and hit sounds are not that good but then again the game is in Early Access so hopefully we'll be getting improved sounds in the future. Music is nice though.\n\nConclusion : Very nice game. Pick it up if you like arcade racing and/or are a fan of the Road rage games.","September 20, 2015","true","2.5"," 31 of 44 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","31","44","0","1"

This game is actually really fun and the developers seem quite passionate about it. The levels are as varied as they can be with one taking place flying over rooftops with jet propulsion and harpoons (I was quite happy staying on the road to be honest). There are various weapons you can pick up and you can get upgrades between games. There are also permanent upgrades, definately a mechanic to follow, as seen in Rogue Legacy and Iron Fisticle. This means that if you are crap like me, if you play the game enough you will progress, not just keep falling at the same hurdle. There are other bikes and cards to contend with. Sometimes a straight race, othertimes a battle. You will crash if you ram into things not bouce off like in some games, which I like as it adds to the tension, but the game can still be forgiving re-setting you and taking some health.

DO YOU WANT A MODERN REMAKE OF ROAD RASH? IF YES, BUY THE HELL OUT OF THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. IF YOU AREN'T SURE, ALLOW ME TO REGALE YOU WITH THE TALE OF MY EXPERIENCE WITH ROAD REDEMPTION.\n\nI watched the trailer for Road Redemption and immediately knew I needed it in my life. I bought and installed it, eagerly awaiting my early access experience, knowing that even if the game doesn't progress beyond its current state, the devs claim that there's already a solid 10-15 hours of gameplay implemented. I believe that this may not be entirely accurate. You can't call this gameplay - this is an experience.\n\nMy first run, I didn't make it to the end of the first track. I wasn't entirely sure on the controls or mechanics, but it seemed fun enough. Did I mention this is a game with permadeath? If you get a game over, you spend your XP on some permanent upgrades, then it's back to the start. Any unspent XP is discarded. Killing enemies is the best way to tip the odds in your favor here - every kill nets you some boost meter, some health, some XP, and some cash. Cash, and the items you buy with it, are lost when you die. Depending on your playstyle, you may find that you prioritize certain items which complement your playstyle. I advise you to save this approach for later. Become comfortable with both the selection of melee weapons and ranged weapons. Learn how explosives work. Learn to use the grappling hook, once you get it. Did I mention there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed GRAPPLING HOOK? Learn to parry enemy attacks. Learn to kick other racers into oncoming traffic or environmental obstacles. Learn what shortcuts look like, and when to use them (or not to use them). Learn to use your jump jets, when playing on rooftop levels. Learn to disarm enemies. In short, learn the ins and outs of the game's many and varied mechanics, to ensure your success. Which is never guaranteed, since each run is randomized. Sometimes there are snow levels. Sometimes one of your fellow racers will be driving a car intead of a motorcycle. Sometimes it won't be a car, but a truck filled with logs, which spill out and cause everybody behind you to crash out, completely filling your boost meter. Sometimes there's hallucinogenic gas.\n\nThere are still some rough areas of the game - parts of the UI need work, parts of the soundtrack, which is mostly great, is... less great. Sometimes the game will decide that I should be facing the opposite direction in the middle of a race, just for funsies. It also takes too long to get back into the action after crashing out, especially on the rooftop levels. I also kind of find myself yearning for actual graphics options. And unlockable bikes/riders. Those are just little niggles, though,  and the game IS in early access, after all.\n\nIn short, if you like combat racing games or the original Road Rash, or just want to play as Shovel Knight riding a motorcycle swinging off of helicopters on a grappling hook and smacking racers with a medieval mace, buy this game. It's really good. Also, it has 4-player co-op, and online coming soon.","April 24, 2015","true","4.6"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","25","34","2","1"

Every single time, without fail, laugh-out-loud duck-and-flinch old school video game FUN.  I spend most of my game time in that aforementioned abyss, straining my intellect and grasping for immersion. Road Redemption has taken its place in my apothecary as a balm, a revitalizer for my spirit, after such sessions.\n\nThis game flashed by on my front page for weeks before I really looked into it; I didn't look too closely because I figured it was some sort of glorified street-moto Trials clone.  What opened my eyes to it was a search by tag "Permadeath."  I'm a big fan of permadeath mechanics in general so I became ravenously curious and dove into a game forum spiral,\n\nRisk of Road Redemption\nTurns out, at its core, Road Redemption is a fiercely indie, happily absurd, fresh, new, and ridiculously satisfying roguelite.  Let me clarify by discussing the major gameplay elements.\n\nThe loose premise is that you are a gang biker trekking across USA, west coast to east coast, for some reason that somehow involves a boss level at the end.  RR does not for a moment pretend to have a rich and nuanced plot.  The trek is divided into more than a dozen stages that take between five or ten minutes each to complete. Gameplay is traditional 3rd-person motorcycle race style with the control schemes to match (this will show my age, but it reminds me fondly of playing Road Rage in the arcade back in the day).\n\nSo how is it roguelite?\n\nFirst off, each playthrough is entirely procedurally generated- the road maps, terrain, and absurdity variables (sometimes you'll get a level with "hallucinogenic chemical zones" that are filled with bright colors and cars falling out of the sky, other times the whole course is made of skyscraper rooftops, etc, etc); the enemies, their names, attributes, and gang affiliations; the weapon and item drops; and the game type for the level (for example, one level may involve getting the police to really notice you, another will be about smashing a rival gang, another will be a simple race).\n\nSecond, Road Redemption uses the modern meta roguelite paradigm that more or less rules the genre at the moment.  You permadie again and again and again but you can earn xp during your playthrough that can then be spent on permanent meta-perks like more health per level or higher base melee damage.  It's more challenging than some of the examples out there, because if you don't earn enough xp to buy a perk, all that xp dissappears.  Nonetheless, bit by bit, I find myself (sometimes) stringing together more and more levels before the inevitable fatality (other times, I just die- but man is it a fun ride).\n\n"What I take from writers I like is their economy...that's magical." -Mos Def\nRR shows great economy of design. It's indie in the beautiful way only our age allows and it does not strut like it's AAA. There is no chaff, no filler. It doesn't pretend to be something great or profound. In fact, if anything, it is proudly and defiantly banal.  And therein lies the magic, that special something that makes a game fun with no pressure and no strings. Just FUN.\n\nAnd in our lives of overwork, overextension, and exhaustion= I have to say I really appreciate that.\n\nRR is in Early Access so I will hold off on a number rating, but I will say with great joy- If you just want something FUN to play, get this game. You will not be disappointed.\nNo Drama, Just Reviews\n\n***Also, SHOVEL KNIGHT***","July 22, 2015","true","6.4"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","3"

It is very much the spiritual successor to Road Rash, which I greatly enjoyed on my PS1. Besides the basic combat, which this title mimics well as far as my memory serves, it also layers a progression system. You can purchase perks with the money you've won but they vanish after you die. You also earn experience, which can be used to upgrade other facets of your character than remain even through death. This adds almost an RPG/roguelike experience to the game.\n\nI only have a few quibbles. The rooftop levels are the least enjoyable for me. They seemed neat at first, but it's very easy to miss the same jump over and over again or become stuck on parts of the roof geometry. Still, it's nice to have something besides the same basic roads to race over repeatedly. I also have some periodic issues with getting knocked off my bike for no apparent reason.\n\nMinor issues aside, Road Redemption is an excellent way to get your Road Rash fix. I look forward to future updates to refine the polish on this already fun game.","June 18, 2015","true","3.6"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","24","34","3","1"

The only drawback is gamepad compatibility issue (as of October 2015 Early Access (EA) stage) for Logitech Cordless RumblePad 2 and another older generic gamepad.

I'm having a TON of fun reliving my childhood with updated graphics and gameplay. The campaign, once you beat it 2-3 times, can be beat in like 30 minutes or so, but I'm on my 7th time beating it so it's got high replay value. There is a campaign+ mode, too, which makes things harder. It's got a LOT of potential to be something great and I firmly believe it'll become that. It's a great pick up and play game, especially with a controller, if you got some free time and don't want to commit to games that require hours of your attention at a time for the full effect. This is a very instant gratification game so far with high replay value. I'm about to go beat the campaign again because the core gameplay is just so rewarding.

I have to say it takes me back to the days of the Genisis with Road Rash. This is much more fun though since you can do a little more customization and develope your play profile. The game can get a little crazy with turns and things falling out of the sky. The traffic almost becomes insane at later levels but even though it detracts from the reality of things a bit, it make sense that the game should get harder as you get further into it. It would be nice though if the environmental hazards (crazy turns and heavy traffic) were replaced with harder opponents or goals. If someone could make an openworld game with this kind of action, it would be awsome. This game, for the price has given me a good amount of fun. I did get it on sale though. It would be even better if there were Steam supported multiplayer. If you like racing, a lot of butt kicking and progressive profiles, this game is a good one.

I'm still finding myself playing through Campaign+.\nDefinitely one to watch, Road Redemption is a promising racing / fighting game.  It plays more "arcade-y" than Blur and is a great couch game.\n\n\nOther Notes\nI received my Early Access key at no cost from a developer directly.  Post beating the game, I was given a prompt screen where I could ring a developer and talk about my experiences.  It's great to see, and testament to the indie model, that I could have such direct access to the team to discuss my feelings towards the game and voice my suggestions.\n\nAsking the developers what the terms are in relation to uploading game-play to YouTube - I was informed both over Steam and via phone call that I can upload any game-play material, music or other assets from the game with no restriction (this may not apply to you!).  I see some other players have already started uploading footage, so hopefully this'll have the intended effect of bring more players to the game.","November 27, 2014","true","7.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","2"

It feels very much like an arcade game to me. It’s not gritty, it’s fast paced and you can easily maneuver your motorcycle midair. The game is definitely not a simulator and it doesn’t let sense stop you from being able to do some outrageous things.\n-----Not that really it affects gameplay but the aesthetics could use some polish. This is to be expected from an early access title, especially on it’s initial release.\n----- If you miss a jump you will fall into a mysterious grey void which is the point where structures cease to exist. And here you will find random props suspended in the air and other motorcyclists who suffered the same fate.\n-----I like the v-twin sound of the your avatars bike. But I think riding a sportsbike that sounds like a racer would be cool too.\n-----In some areas I suffered from low framerate with the graphical settings set to ‘fantastic’. Lowering the settings to ‘good’ alleviated this. 11 But framerate was still an issue where large amounts of vehicles were present in close proximity.\n\nAt the moment there is only the option of campaign mode, either single player or splitscreen coop. There is no online mode yet. I played solo.\n-----In campaign mode you play through a series of levels. Most levels take place on a highway populated by road vehicles.\n-----It is cool to ride your motorcycle at high speed through traffic while brawling with other motorcyclists. Trucks overturn and spill their cargo, blocking the road and you constantly have to avoid cars that have gone out of control. You will miss some obstacles by only centimetres.\n-----Some levels take place on roof tops. You and the other motorcyclists must all make jumps from rooftop to rooftop. For some reason automobile traffic will also occasionally join you on the rooftops. They aren’t very good at making jumps.\n-----Every stage has a different objective which appears to be randomly selected, such as racing other motorcyclists, attracting police attention or taking out a number of other motorcyclists without using weapons.\n-----Occasionally there are special hazards present. Theses include a motorcyclist who constantly throws timed explosives onto the road behind them and ‘car rain’. You might want to keep your distance just so that you can survive and make it to the next stage.\n-----All other motorcyclists and certain cars are hostile. They will swing weapons at you or try to drive you off the road. You will lose health when you take hits, fall off your bike or fall off a building. When you run out of health it’s game over.\n-----You have the choice of up to three weapons at a time. You can acquire different weapons by dispatching foes or completing stages. Most of them are melee weapons.\n-----Initially I used the gamepad because I figured that it’s probably better than keyboard and mouse for controlling a motorbike. It is probably is better for controlling your throttle. But then I realized that this game has guns and the game pad sucks for using firearms.\n-----I would recommend using the mouse and keyboard solely for this purpose. Being able to use your guns effectively and your ammunition efficiently means a lot in this game.\n-----Weapons aside, the coolest way to dispatch other motorcyclists is probably by grabbing them. You can take them by the neck and maneuver them into oncoming vehicles or obstacles.\n-----There is also a grenade launcher which you can fire from your motorcycle just like terminator II. I was very happy to see this.\n-----You have a limited nitrous boost which you can use to make your motorcycle go faster. You magically regain nitrous fuel as well as health and earn extra cash by taking out motorcyclists and other vehicles.\n-----In some stages you also have jets that allow you to jump and glide. It’s ridiculous but, I thought this was awesome because it was just like riding a motorcycle from one of my all time favourite games, Full Throttle. The problem with it is that there is no indication when it runs out of fuel needed to boost you over a void.\n-----After completing each stage you can spend your cash on items, most of which last until you die. Items effects range from recovering lost health, minor increases to your rewards for taking out other vehicles and completing races or extra lives albeit with the loss of most of your maximum health.\n-----When you lose all your health during a stage you finally die for real and it’s game over man. You will have earned experience based on the total amount of cash you earned in your run. Your experience can be used to purchase upgrades which will carry over to future attempts at the campaign.\n\nCurrently there doesn’t seem to be any sign of the ‘truly epic quest’ story line. But it will cool to see it and online multiplayer in future updates. Personally I wish there was open world ♥♥♥♥♥♥me like this with minimal ‘RPG’ elements, I think that would be awesome.\n-----This game was challenging, I only made it halfway through the campaign after numerous attempts at it. Sometimes what you are rolled with can be really difficult even on the first level.\n-----But it’s fun. And I think the price is reasonable for amount of content as well as the potential replayability that the game offers. I definitely recommend thinking about getting this game.\n\nSince writing this I have completed the game in it's current state. It's actually not very long at the moment, although I did say the game had a good amount of content. But an update is scheduled soon.

It sounded like best racing concept ever. And it still does.\n\nBut execution is jus f****ed up.\n\nCampaing gameplay consists of series of missions that you play until you die. There are two mission "types". Kill X people before timer runs out and race. I hate timed missions with passion, but amount of required murders is usually low, so unless something bad happen, first type it's doable.\n\nBut if you were given "race" mission, you already lost. Winning means getting 3rd or better place. That may sound easy until you realize that opponent AI keeps other bikes slightly slower than your top speed is as long as they are in front of you and keeps them just behind you after you overtake. That means every time you slow down, everyone you ever overtook flashes in front of you and gets ~200m advantage. EVERY. Effing. Time.\n\nAnd you will slow down eventually. Either by hitting something, getting stuck in scenery, getting stuck in another vehicle or just by trying to get through curve. My favorite place is curved road just before finish line in 1st map. I can get there 1st with no problem, and then choose if I let everyone overtake me by slowing down, or just fly over the road and let everyone overtake me while I respawn.

I'd compare the combat with the horse mounted battles of Mount and Blade, only on a hyper-speed motorcycle that can boost. It's extremely satisfying to line up a perfect critical hit with a battle axe against a cluster of rival bikers.\n\nThe way the cars and characters are constantly flying across the screen in a physics-tornado of destruction is incredible. The gameplay loop of short racing/combat challenges, buying temporary upgrades, and then applying earned XP to persistent skills is smart and addicting. The game is frequently updated by its developers.\n\nCONS:\nPerformance inconsistency has been the one thing I have found frustrating, but it is to be expected at this early stage. The current build as of July 5th will fluctuate back and forth from over 100 FPS to 30-50 FPS in a matter of seconds and I'm running it on a GTX 970. Earlier builds ran really consistently, but as the has game progressed, the optimization has suffered. I expect later versions to run much better.\n\nI also feel that, at the harder difficulties especially, there is too much pipe bomb spam from enemies. It seems like a cheap way to artificially increase difficulty. I imagine that the devs will continue to balance the game to correct this in the future.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI've gotten more than my monies worth at this point from this game. I can't wait to see what the devs bring to it in the future! I'd love to see an "endless" or open world RPG mode, perhaps in a sequel.","July 5, 2015","true","12.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"

When it came out, they ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned (and some still do) about low frame rates. They ♥♥♥♥♥ed and moaned about the sound track, the gameplay, basically everything.\n\nRoad redemption is a great example of an early access game that actually gets worked on over time, as it should be. Early access is a scourge on games. Especially because people seem to think two things. The first thing being that buying early access gives them a seat at the development table (it doesn't) and the second thing is that for some baffling reason, most people assume the early access means finished product. Road Redemption has come a long way since it's inception, going from a somewhat shoddy bike racing game with combat, to what a modern iteration of road rash should be.  The frame rate is smooth, much smoother than it was when I first got it. The controls are responsive and easy to learn, also an improvement from it's early days. The enemy bikers are ridiculous and fun. I encountered some guy wearing huge bullhorns on his head, I promptly shot him in the back but apparently he was a boss with a longer life bar than most so I had to beat him to death with a shovel. A sort of flaw that isn't really a flaw is the games rubber band AI. If Road Redemption were a regular racing game, it would be a flaw. Road Redeption is a combat game though, and so this habit of enemies to soft lock onto your position only serves to make fighting them easier. That's not to say you can't take a cheap shot as you sail by some chump with one of the games many weapons. Both guns and melee weapons to choose from. These weapons can be earned by killing enemies, or stolen from enemies by interupting one of their attacks with counter while unarmed. Some of the weapons are very difficult to get without stealing them from enemies. The sound track is great, perfectly complimenting the gameplay and the graphics are appealing.\n\nIt's a deal at 20$.","May 12","true","4.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Good game to kill time. I was interested in buying this game because of a youtuber I watched. If you like shooting or hitting people with shovels and you like racing games then this is definitely for you. The campaign is decently long, and the levels get tougher. Some of the levels include racing on rooftops with a grappling hook. However, I do have some problems with this game. The AI needs to be fixed up. Some of the maps need to be tweaked a bit. Finally, upgrading your racer is really weird. Why not remove this since it's so confusing.\n\nIn Conclusion For an early access game it's a good start. However, I'm afraid that this game will lose its hype. The updates are rather slow. Many problems need to be fixed, and hopefully the community grows. I really want this game to become the greatest; if not, the best road dash ever. The concept is very interesting. The game is still in development, so that means that I will update this review in the future when the game is complete. Finally, I recommend this early access game.","February 21","true","1.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I think maybe having an announcer or more sound effects or at least some more atmosphere going on while playing.\n\n*I would love to see a rival system. Like if there were bike gangs/groups and if you killed a member then that group would be more inclined to attack you in other missions.\n\n*Would love to be able to buy different bikes or at least change their look/style.\n\n*Would love to see visible damage; if character is low on health, perhaps helmet is cracked and road gear has some scuffing and holes in it (or bike damage; fire, smoke, sparks etc)\n\n*The attacks are fine, but it would be great to be able to hold the attack and release when you are ready instead of the awkward timing (yes, road rash did this, haha)\n\nOther than that, the game is pretty cool despite it's slightly unplayable for some people (myself included), but is being corrected and improved.

When i watched the trailer this game seemed really fun to me, and it is kinda fun, but the amount of flaws keeps it back from being a good game.\nGod awful soundtrack (MAIN MENU MUSIC NEEDS TO BE CHANGED ASAP, it is so out of place i couldn't believe that), ridiculously bad animations when falling from a bike, beyond awful menu design , almost every race you will see no animations when crashing into things like big side pipes or when falling of the bridge, and the graphics overall are pretty poor looking.\nThis game needs A TON of improvement in order to be enjoyable, i'm not saying that it can't be good, but i doubt that the developers could achieve that, and maybe a cornerstone in this will be their budget.\nI really hope that this will be a good, polished game one day, but in it's current state, i can't recommend it.\n\nEDIT: the developer updates this game really often, so at least it's not likely to be abandoned like some other Early Access games, and this is a good thing.

It delivers insane high-speed racing mixed with brutal combat that has you smashing other bikers off the road to score first place. (or whatever the objective is) The enviroments are crazy with cars colliding into eachother causing havok to avoid crashing into and cops trying to sideswipe you. Its a fantastic game to play in short bursts when you want something fast and furious to pass the time.\n\nTHE GOOD\n+ The racing and combat is incredibly satisfying\n+ Graphics are pretty good for early access\n+ Randomly generated enemies/hazards keep things interesting\n+ The rooftop levels are super addictive\n\nTHE BAD\n- Menus are very bland and uninteresting\n- Many melee weapons feel identical\n- FPS takes a hit sometimes on highest graphics settings\n- Lack of modes (The game seriously needs more modes upon full release)\n- Lack of customization (You cant buy new bikes or gear)\n\nTHE UGLY\nWhen you die, youre DEAD. Time to start over again. (But at least you get to permanently boost your stats)\n\nBOTTOM LINE:\nI think Road Redemption is a fantastic game that gives many fans of vehicular combat the action they've been craving for a long time. I very much look forward to the implementation of multiplayer in 2015.

In Road Rash you raced against a set number of riders, in this game you do not really race anyone as the other riders are generated as you overtake.  Its a bit like those old Atari F1 games.   It doesn't actually feel like you are in a race.\n\n2. In Road Rash the riders had unique names and even personalities, remember Natasha, Belladonna, Lawson and Rude Boy?  Sure it was not super indepth but it did add a lot of flavour to the game. In RD, the riders are generated so there are no unique personalities or flavour.\n\n3.  This game operates on a mission system.  In theory its a good idea but its annoying that you fail a race because you didn't grab enough enemies and steer them into incoming traffic.  I'd prefer to overtake or attack the other riders in the method of my choosing.  Its just silly that you have to win a race with strange conditions attached.\n\n4. The game feels empty.  Its fun for a few hours but then you realise there is not much more to it.  In Road Rash you had lots of bikes that felt very different to handle, the tracks were great and felt unique at each stage.  Even the leveling system doesn't improve things very much.\n\nI would not recommend the game in its current stage. It might be a great game over all but I feel this would require a major overhall.\n\n","May 29","false","6.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Not only that, it adds an in-depth upgrade system.\n\nInitially, I did not like the way you lose all your upgrades upon death. As you keep the same health, unless you heal, from wave to wave. Then I realized when you die, there's permanent upgrades you can acquire that last game after game and the in-game upgrades are the carrot at the end of the stick for trying to get to those further and further waves. Overall, it's a brilliant system and I'm really looking forward to what this games turns into upon final release.\n\nThere's some minor niggles with the camera (it's all mouselook) so you have a hard time keeping upon with the action sometimes or other times you'll notice it just feel off and then correct it upon thinking about it. Which can bring you out of the game. However, it almost feels necessary for when you get a gun to have that free aim. So it might be something you just need to get used to.\n\nI highly recommend getting this game whether or not you played the Road Rash of yore. The procedural tracks are fun and feel solid. Not just cobbled together. The weapons are diverse and quite fun to use. Especially the sledgehammer and old Remington from Terminator. I'm sure they will be adding a lot more content as well such as more bikes and players but in some races there's even a giant truck to contend with! Check out this marvelous brutal racing action before it releases and gets  a full price.","January 28","true","2.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

What I enjoy about the game is that it features the same antics in racing that one gets out of Rod Rash.  While it is important to get a higher position, in this game, it gives more focus on attacking other cyclists.  That being said, it has alternate modes that it goes into that wasn't in prior Road Rash games I had played (granted the last I played was Road Rash for Windows 95, which was the same version on the 3DO console).  There are some odd places you travel, one being a path that features cars raining from the sky, and the player must dodge them.  Also, I find it interesting that such a game was authored in Unity3D; it is really proving how the technology is progressing.\n\nUnfortunately, the game has some quirks.  Granted it is a mere "arcade" feel game, it doesn't focus on how a motorcycle or a car would actually travel on the road.  This is a mere notice as many people buy into games such as Mario Kart where they do not implement natural turning of a vehicle, but rather the rear of the vehicle pivots.  (contras this to say Tux Kart which gives a better example of how turning occurs with vehicles).\n\nAdditionally, the game has bugs where it randomly crashes on the Linux platform, typically after permanent experience level ups are awarded after dying.  Also, I'm not sure if it is a bug, but I've seen "cars" identified as "npc" enemies that are holding position in the race, and I'm supposed to attack them.  Again, maybe this is on purpose?  But I haven't contacted the developer to see.\n\nAt any rate, I have to give serious marks down on stability on the Linux platform, but overall, the game has a fun factor.  I have to recommend it at this time, but as time progresses, if these issues are not addressed, I will change my rating to negative; not because I want to as its a great game, but if the game does not work, what does one really have?","December 28, 2015","true","20.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JetUppercut/recommended/300380/","JetUppercut","Jet Uppercut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JetUppercut/","202 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRoad Redemption isn't identical to Road Rash. Unlike what other reviews will have you think, this is certainly only Road Rash in the sense that you ride bikes and wallop cops with baseball bats. Also sometimes you have to race.\n\nWhile those things are a very large part of what Road Rash is, where this game is different is very obvious. It's got a much more arcade feel, with the one life is all you get policy. The melee battling is about countering enemy attacks so you can disarm them or critical hit them, rather than just zig zag punching them until they drop their 2x4.\n\nThere's also guns. My personal favourite being the sawn off shotgun. Extremely satisfying to use and the reload animation is awesome. They aren't particularly difficult to use, being hitscan weapons. And since one shot is usually enough to put a rider out of commission you never seem to run out of ammo.\nThe C4 is equally satisfying to use.\n\nThe current race modes are a mixed bag. You can get anything from Jackie Chan's Kung Fu Kicking Competition to 10 tonne rain while trying to win a race. This isn't a bad thing by any means, the variety is good. But it's a far cry from Road Rash's rigid illegal street racing structure.\n\nAnd in the end it shows. The absence of a distinct race mode means the pace is set by the other modes where you try to kill as many cops or rival gang members as possible. And much of the time the race mode doesn't feel any different. The addition of punching bag bikers during a race slow down the pace considerably. I often found myself forgetting I had boost because I was having too much fun wailing on cops and these random dudes in the race and still ended up winning. Once again, this isn't a bad thing. But design wise I think it would be better to choose one or the other.\n\nOn the few occasions a fellow gang member turned up, I found they would swing at me as they drove past. Their AI doesn't appear to be any different from the other bikers except that they prioritise the AI over you. In the full game I'm left wondering how establishing a biker gang and only having one life to do it all in will play off each other. I'd find it difficult to invest myself in a gang or my comrades if I knew the moment I died I would have to start all over.\n\nThe Jump Jets attached to the bike during the rooftop level are a fun addition, but don't add much to overall gameplay on the non-rooftop levels. I often just ended up using them so I could shoot grenades at my feet. And cheat by jumping over crashes and huge logs. I never really found a use for the grappling hook, though it'd be fun if I could attach it to one of the helicopters seen flying over the tops of levels sometimes.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. But it is in a beta/alpha/whatever at the time of writing this review, so my impressions are obviously not going to be relevant when this game finally releases. Or at least I hope not because Road Redemption has a lot of potential.","September 24, 2014","true","18.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

The developers have made some changes that make this game fun to play again. The huge road block at level 3 with the masters race has been taken out so now your progression in the game lasts beyond 10 minutes of gameplay. That was a big step forward to making this game enjoyable. They didn't remove the black semi truck which used to be extremely annoying, but it no longer matches your speed when you are in range of it, therefore it's annoyance factor isn't really an issue anymore. I am no longer getting hit for over 50 percent of my health from one melee attack and In the few games I have played since the latest patch I am no longer experiencing the rider that blocks every melee attack no matter how well you time your attacks. This is also a huge improvement.\n\nI am still keeping my fingers crossed that there will be a game mode inserted later in development which brings back the series of racing for points and progression to higher racing leagues which the old Road Rash games had.

This is a racing game , but you also get to beat, hack and shoot the other racers. So yeah this game was lots of fun. Choose a motorcycle and a rider and on with the Road Warrior tactics. An easy game to play, with a little skill of handling your bike and how to kill all others, this game is well done. The music is rock, metal and a touch of techno that goes great with the atmosphere of revving motors and dying rival gang members. There is just one mode, in witch after choosing your rider and bike. ( Shovel Knight ) you go through a series of missions that basically all end up of you riding your bike as fast as you can, to kill as many as you can. After each mission completion use the money earned to gain upgrades to weapons, your bike or health. ( Beef jerky, hot dogs and burgers heal you).  Travel accross the US causing death on the road. After you die in game, you gain experiance on how far you get in the US ( aka how many missions you did) Then you use the experiance points to ugrade a talant tree, that like the between mission shop, you can upgrade your weapons, health or bike. These points in this tree stay perminant and help you kill and ride the next time you play.

I got in on this at version 0.001, and it was clear they knew what they were doing and how much Road Rash they played before the series took a dump and died (they even pointed out what few realized about the originals not actually involving turning in a dev diary). The amount  of progress up to this version is really impressive, especially in such a short span. The core game is fantastic, now it's all bells and whistles.\n\nWhile the game is still in beta and you can tell it's unfinished (car animations are minimal, the camera doesn't keep up so well, there's only one attack animation, motorcycles don't have any real braking animation/sound), the actual game is tremndously fun. It's a smooth update of the Road Rash style that works well in the age of analog control (much easier to hit that other rider now!) and provides more than just straight races, although going fast and bashing heads is the essence of any track. There's some roguelike elements to the game, too. You get up front purchases of helpful items between rounds that last until you die, and permanent, XP based upgrades like bike quality, total HP, etc., and I hope to get to choose a bike later on instead of just upgrading the same one.\n\nMy only complaints at the moment are that the guns would benefit from a bit of aim assist (if it was EASY to aim a gun from a motorcycle, it would be boring, but it's a little too unweildy right now) and that the tracks lack features. If they're being procedurally generated, the array is a bit thin. Judging by the desert, there's only two turns, sometimes you see a ramp or a divider, rarely a bridge. It's still a lot of fun, I'd just like more of it.\n\nBoth of these problems are entirely reasonable for early access, and the latter problem is a sign if how good the game is - my problem is that I want more!\n\nBest motorcycle combat racing game this century that lives up to the Road Rash legacy with ease. If they manage to license a few songs (this is a natural fit for Soundgarden) or build in an mp3 player, they'll beat it.","September 23, 2014","true","11.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","7"

Road Rash!  If there is any game that Road Redemption can be compared to, it's Road Rash.\n\nAt this point of the development, the game is pretty simple.  The player begins a campaign and enjoys some intense motorcycle action.  There is no real story at this time, and the multiplayer is still to come, but what the game already offers is well made.  The bugs are minimal, the game has never crashed, and it is very playable.\n\nThe combat requires some work to get the timing right.  Each melee weapon has a different attack range and speed that it is swung, not to mention the satisfying sound that some of them make.  The sledgehammer is boss.  The ranged weapons are really powerful, but can cause a distraction while aiming that can lead to a crash.  Fighting against AI is fun and good practice, but this game could be crazy with multiplayer!\n\nSpeaking of the AI, the npc cars may as well be tanks!  Some are pretty mundane and cruse down the road, but others are out for destruction and do not follow the laws of physics -- at all!  They make the rules as they plow through incoming cars without a budge.\n\nThe game is pretty bare bones right now, but the devs have a really solid foundation to work with and some of the ideas that are implemented in this game are a lot of fun, but there is some fine tuning that needs to be done before the multiplayer can be engaged.  The time spent has been extremely enjoyable -- nostalgia -- better than many finished titles of this price.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=323943171","October 14, 2014","true","23.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","2"

It's wonderfully arcade-ish while still having fluid, physics-based action. The shooting is nice, the melee is nice (although I wish you could HOLD an attack and charge it up and let go when you're ready like in Road Rash!\n\nThe weapon selections are neat, the game modes are varied and fun - and there's a level-up system that doesn't take very long to max out (I just maxed mine out on the first day), but the replay value is immense.\n\nTurbo boosts, grappling hooks, jump jets??? It's exactly as fun as it sounds. Which, if you're me, is a lot.\n\nVery much like road rash on 3d crack, but in a good way. Nice interface, good graphics, and when you beat the campaign you get the option to call the developer himself and tell him what you think of the game!\n\nDefinitely not a purchase you'll regret if you like the idea of a crazy action-packed spiritual successor to Road Rash.\n\nOn the rooftop levels, you basically get to be batman on a motorcycle. Once you get the hang of using the jump jets, boost and grappling hook in combination with each other, you can seriously stay airborn for a LONG time. You'll feel like a total pimp the first time you use the grappling hook to swing around a 90 degree turn while airborn.\n\nI highly recommend this game for people who like fun.","March 21","true","12.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

But not quite there yet for me\nThis isn't a "Negative" review. Just not a CURRENT recommendation\n\nPROS\nRoad Rash inspired game play\nRandomly generated courses\nSatisfying hit connections\nNice player Models\nInstant Controller support\nDecent control scheme\nDecent frames per second\nCONS\nLoad screen lock-ups with Shovel Knight model ( FIXED! )\nRather lack luster graphics ( though better than most Unity indie games )\nRinse/repeat combat ( Most enemies can be fell with the same strats over and over )\nLack of a good sense of speed\nRepetitive game play\nFULL THOUGHTS\nI had this one sitting in my wishlist for a while. Excited by the idea of a modern return and spiritual successor to Road Rash. I waited for a price drop on this one as it is early access before purchase. ( As I always do )\nToday was a price drop of -60% bringing it's price to $8. No questions asked, I snagged it up.\n\nBooting the game up, I noticed the Unity logo. While this isn't a bad thing as there are tons of great games build on the unity engine; it did put a sour taste in my mouth with its recent track record. I am happy to report that this does not effect the quality of the game at all. So let's just get that out of the way.\nGRAPHICS\nThe menus are pretty basic, but fit well enough within the game. A little update to these textures and menus would really spice things up and help it not look as though it was made for the Xbox la 2002.\nThe same can be pretty much said for the graphics overall. Rather bland and flat; they don't really offer much to help the cacti and hay bales whizzing by to stick out from the dirt and random rock formations.\nOddly enough, the player models are pretty decent! Nice lighting feedback on the leather and metal on the character models DO help you stick out from the forward mentioned basic textures.\nNOTE: The loading screen will currently not finish if you are using Shovel Knight.\nNOTE ABOUT THE NOTE: The dev got in contact with me and informed me they fixed this little bug! Grats to the devs for speaking with and informing players!\n\nCombat\nLets get to the meat of the game play.\nThe combat is just what you see. It's all either melee or gun based action ( with the occasional c4 pack thrown in for fun ). It's pretty satisfying.. for a moment. Once the tingles of nostalgia wore off I found myself with a sort of glazed over expression. Turning, striking, dodging, turning, striking, dodging etc. etc.  I found out really fast that you could fell most enemies just by cheesing your way through each randomly generated coarse. The game has many ways of dispatching other bikers. Kicking them into objects, Beating this ♥♥♥♥ out of them with various melee weapons, shooting them out right or even using explosives. All of these combat methods are pretty much not needed as a simple pipe and X or Y spam will do just fine. Everything else is sort of a "If you want to" sort of deal.\n\n\n\nWhile the game has a LOT of potential I feel it just has something lacking in today's high octane games. A lack of a sense of speed and even more so it's graphics. While graphics aren't everything ( most of my personal favorite games are butt ♥♥♥♥ing ugly ) I do feel that they are very last gen and even earlier. A facelift would really help things outs. On top of this, the games core mechanics are solid.. but every combat "feature" feels tacked on and not needed.\n\nOver all It was fun for a minute... and then became extremely tame. In my short time with the game I knew that I had purchased it based on my inner 8 year olds' screaming request. There is SO MUCH possibility here that it's disappointing for what it is currently.\n\nI look forward to see what the final product has to offer and wish the devs the best of luck. They have something worth making here! But as it stands, I can't recommend it. Keep an eye on it and see where it goes. It's promising.","July 4, 2015","false","0.5"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","8"

Even in its current state, if you have any fond nostalgia for those games, you owe it to your inner-child to pick this title up.\n\nCurrently, the game is limited to a campaign mode of progressive areas and difficulty. There is racing against the timer, racing against a specific rival gang, night driving, icy tracks, cars raining down from the sky, police chases, exploding vehicles, rooftop racing... and I enjoyed every satisfying slash and crash that forcibly de-seated my fellow racers as I burned past them. Every time you die, all of your XP earned through that play-through can be spent on permanent player upgrades, adding to your health, damage, weapon durability, ammuntion, etc... so on each successive run, you'll have even more of an edge on your side.\n\nThe game plays fast and feels fast with little stuttering (running on an i3 processor with a GTX 640 Nvidia card), though there are instances of SUDDENLY-CARS, because the draw distance seems a little close to your bike. The way the bikes handle feels instinctive (using an x360 controller), and the button layout is workable... though not perfect. The ability to remap the keys isn't currently implemented, but it is one of the features on the list to be added. Based on the level of polish the game already has, this is definitely not a project with sloppy devs... I would highly believe that patches, new game modes, and features are en route.\n\nFor downsides, though... with only one current play-mode, the game will grow repetitive after a while. The AI routines of the opponent riders is somewhat predictable, and once you learn the timing of the weapon swings, they frequently fall for a basic swerve-n-strike pattern. There are plenty of weapons to experiment with, including the grappling hook which is a blast to use, but its still an issue of slowly becoming familiar and then boring. There is no automatic lock-on for any firing weapon... that takes a while to get used to, as your ability to aim is also your camera control... perfect for the shotgun, but very tricky for the uzi. The roads themselves are far more lethal than the other riders, and while this is an excellent thing, currently specific conditions like the raining cars can make those races VERY difficult, and can completely shut down a run.\n\nIts an awesome thing to see, mind you... driving through a downpour of debris, but that feature needs to be scaled back enough to be able to actually navigate through the falling wrecks.\n\nMultiplayer is a listed feature of the game. That would seriously increase this game's replayability factor, and it would be AWESOME to be able to race against other players with this engine, but currently that feature isn't available.\n\nAll that said, I still HIGHLY recommend this game in its current state. Its very playable, low on the glitches, a TON of fun, and I have full confidence that upcoming features and fixes will just make this even more enjoyable of an experience.","December 26, 2014","true","6.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","9","14","3","0"

You can kick people into oncoming traffic, off buildings, into signs and construction equipment, or you can just straight up shoot them/hit them with your weapons.  A lot of the levels are just replays like the rooftop levels, the only difference is how the AI reacts.  The worst thing for me in this game is how long it takes you to come back to life when you slam into a vehicle.  Watching counters it takes about 3-4 seconds to get back on the track, whats worse is when you try to use your nitrous to catch up to where you were and within ten feet of starting where you respawned you crash into another vehicle and have to wait to respawn again. The games fun for the most part.  Very Repetitive.  I have a friend who comes over and we play together which makes it a little more fun because you can take eachother on.  When playing co-op whoever finishes the best in a race is the score the entire group gets, when killing people all the kills are shared.\n\nOne thing i hate is getting crazed drivers mode on the rooftops, it essentially does nothing.  If it actually had drivers on the rooftops it would be different.  Another thing that would be awesome to see is being able to play as a car once you beat the game as there are times when you're racing against cars.","May 31, 2015","true","17.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I'd never had a 3DO, and although I was a huge PlayStation fan, I'd be lying if I said I ever played the series in any of its subsequent incarnations — hell, I never even played loosely-similar games like "2 Xtreme".\n\nThat said, I've come to find in "Road Redemption" a game truly worth loving and one of the few early access titles which I deigned worthy of my hard-earned dollars — and that might be a reflection of the game industry at large more than anything else. Or, it might just be because the game's ♥♥♥♥ing fun. Just buy it and stop reading.\n\nIn an age when $69.99 will buy you something like "Dragon Age: Inquisition", where you get hundreds of hours of single player content and a comprehensive multiplayer offering, "Road Redemption" is shockingly bare bones. You have a couple of different "race types", realized through different level types, and a simple campaign mode which is basically the classic "arcade" style, where you start from the beginning and try to get to the end.\n\nIn spite of this old-school design, the game brings some newer persistent-reward mechanics to the classic arcade design. You earn XP as you play, and that XP can be spent on persistent upgrades which make subsequent runs easier. As was true of most games since COD4 with this concept, it's successful in rewarding ongoing effort.\n\nBut what makes "Road Redemption" worth playing is none of its novel new features nor is it hurt by  its lack of substance.\n\nThis ♥♥♥♥ is just pure fun to play. Smacking someone off his bike is so satisfying, and shooting a car to the point of destruction to get it out of your way mid-race is exhilirating.\n\nFor all its anemicness and rough edges, the game is just fun as ♥♥♥♥ to play, each and every time you play it, for 10 minutes or 10 hours at a time. And once multiplayer is in the mix? This game is going to be one of the greatest of all time.\n\nJust ♥♥♥♥ing buy it.","February 26, 2015","true","3.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

First the physics kinda suck.  The bikes have too much grip; theres usually not a reason to let up off the gas in a turn which is not how motorcycles work.  Flat out on the gas the whole race isnt racing at all and it degenterates this game into just another hussle for turbo, which then becomes the only reason to actually fight another racer.  You dont have to hold off your pole position like in Road Rash if you can turbo hop from one random spawned un-ranked racer to the next.  Which gets boring quick.  Also lame when a mob of un ranked, like not in any place 1st-15th, all hit you at once and the games over.  And all your stuffs gone.  No bike upgrades except for one skill that doesnt really feel like it does anything.  The Semi is a cool idea but its broken, goes way to fast and then consistently runs you over after you defeat it.  Also theres to many times where hiting a car or telephone pole head on just stops you or instantly makes you travel in reverse without falling off the bike.  All the bikes feel about the same, they just change the difficulty.  Which I don't like.  There shouldnt be a difficulty.  It should be about racing and fighting/positioning skills, getting money to get better weapons and bikes so you can win those harder races.  You cant steal weapons which was one of the best things about the original road rash games.  You just pick it up automatically after you kill the person that had it.  I WANT to have that crowbar that I stole from Jorg in the second race.  It has sentimental value.  Also the AI dont get vindictive like they would in Road Rash. The penalty for death is to high, I cant choose the level I go next, The bikes make no noise, theres NO PEDESTRIANS to run over or cross traffic.\n\nJust ... Just make it like Road Rash.\n\nTake out the counters, weapon durability, how kicks make you completely stunned instead of forcing your to try to regain control, Fix the Physics so you actually have to race, maybe make traction loss a thing, and take out turbo except on maybe the last 3 bikes.  Also the weapon system is kinda lame. I die all the time trying to switch weapons, because to do so requires you to take your thumb off the steering.  Shootings is meh... Needs to be easier to switch weapons or shoot to the side.\n\nOh another thing.  Study the actuall bike market right now, particularly the technology that exists, like traction control, electronic variable susspension, sproket changes, tire compound...Every bike enthusiast I know is a gear head and if you can't drool over that next upgrade theres no incentive.  I want to save up the 20k to buy that BMW S1000 HR or w/e if is with the traction and suspension control that basically handles everything about cornering except braking an leaning.  I don't like racing just for XP  points.\n\nI had high hopes for this, but as it stands, I really regret my purchase.","August 30, 2015","false","2.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The game, so far, is not a finished game. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy it in early access, it just means you should know what to expect. Right now the devs promise a 10-15 hour experience, and that is precisely what they deliver. 10-15 hours of sheer fun is to be had racing, slicing, bashing and shooting opponents with anything from pipewrenches to medieval axes, to handguns to grenade launchers. Nothing says ♥♥♥♥ you like Father Christmas bashing someone's head in with a giant candy cane.\n\nThe game is not without its flaws, though. As is, the levels get rather stale after a while, there is hardly any diversity in bikes and riders, the music is not as iconic as the original Road Rash, the skill tree is very lineair, boring, and doesn't allow for experimentation, and the buyable in-campaign upgrades are 50% ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t filler stuff.\n\nI'm sure a lot of that will be adressed by the devs before the game is released.

That being said, it's crazy-stupid-awesome how fun this game is. As it stands in its development, there is no story to speak of, which includes dialogue, cutscene's or character names (with the exception of a handful of extra-powered baddies). And as someone who usually finds story-telling and character-development a very important part of the games he plays, I couldn't care less. You drive down long highways on a motorcycle and kill rivals with an assortment of guns, swords, and blunt objects. Not to mention sticky packs of C4 charges. The continuous swarm of enemies that seem to be procedurally spawned (though I don't know for certain) make it unlikely you'll every run out of things to hit, or things to hit with. Though if you do, you can always kick at their wheels or grab them and steer them into oncoming traffic. But what makes the game endearing is the immensly satisfying instant gratification of the gameplay; you never hear people in the arcade playing House of the Dead complain about where all these monsters came from or who the main villain is because it doesn't make it any more fun to continuously blast zombies in the head.\n\nBut what if you're no good? Like, not at ALL? It barely matters. The system of upgrades, which utilizes both "use this til you die" items as well as "You're dead now? Tune up your bike and try again" items ensures that even an embarrassingly awful defeat at the hands of a sub boss in the second level will still give you a slightly better chance next time.\n\nI've been playing this title since shortly after its release to the Steam community, and I have not once regretted the decision. The easy-to-pickup nature of the best arcade racing games, touch of self-aware humor of GTA3, and the immensely satisfying carnage of Twisted Metal 2 make Road Redemption a title you're sure to come back to over and over again. If you don't already have a game in your library for instant catharsis, Road Redemption is as good a suggestion as any.\n\nA billion stars (out of a billion and six).","February 18","true","10.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With the punks they have brass knuckles and they punch their victims off.\nA death metal gang who has long hair black clothing maybe they can headbang and you can hear music come from them and they have knives or machetes or chainsaws.\nA black metal gang that could have the same thing as above but in black metal style.\nA grunge gang with grunge clothing and their weapon is ciggarettes /alcohol bottles/ heroin needles\nA stoner gang who uses pot paraphenilia to attack their enemies.\nA mob like gang who use vintage weapons and dress up like gangsters\nA ninja gang who use nunchuks and ninja stars\nThis can go on\nand on\nand on with as many gangs as you create.\n\nThen when you have more then one gang fight amongst each other they will have their set style and fighting style.\n\nYou should be able to hijack other bikes and make it challenging so if you mess up you fall off.\nOther people should be able to do the same to you.\n\nAlso police should be able to pull you over\nMake it so you can get away but make it a challenge for you to get pulled over\nMake it so they can pull over other people even people that you are in a race against and they do not even care about you.\nYou can make choke points where they set up barriers\nThey can hit you and make your bike wobble at the end.\nJust do all cop things even make those things that pop your tire\nYou can see cops in the distance and then they follow you after you pass them.\n\nThis is all the ideas I got right now.","December 26, 2015","true","24.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Ultimately it's fun, and it'll give you a (somewhat) modern(ish) version of road rash. But be warned that it does lack a certain level of polish, and is a definite sale-purchase.\n\nIn terms of presentation, graphics and audio, you're looking at something (very) comparible to FlatOut 2 (2006). As it's an arcade style racer (sort of) it kind of gets away with it, but it is a shame.

I found it tricky at first and must have failed the campaign at least four or five times before I managed to complete it, but I breezed through the campaign+ mode first try and didn't find many parts of that to be particularly difficult, so my main concern is whether the leveling/upgrade system slowly takes the real challenge out of the game. There isn't an awful lot of content for the £15 price tag, but I enjoyed what I played and I'm looking forward to seeing where this game goes, so I would recommend it.\n\nAlso, the devs openly give out their phone number in the game.

The variety of levels is enjoyable, and the way they have designed a seperation between permanent skills and play-through purchases feels good.\n\nHowever, the controls can feel a little unforgiving at times, and once you've played the limited number of modes there's not much more to experience other than slightly different maps, and varying degrees of difficulty.\n\nI'm looking forward to seeing this game improve and get more content.

There is a special kind of rush when your enemies stay down. Road Redemption remembers everything road rash did right and brings it back with smoother gameplay. However it seems to be stuck in perpetual open beta like so many others. Unlike many of the others however, it feels for the most part a complete game and is often receiving small updates.","April 17","true","21.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If the idea of Road Rash meets rogue-like appeals to you, then you'll probably enjoy this game. The physics are appropriately arcade-y, and the combat feels satisfyingly brutal. It can be frustratingly difficult at times, especially if you're like me and don't have great twitch reflexes, but it's still great to play in short bursts.

Missions are about racing and fighting against bad dudes or eliminate some determinated number of bad guys.\n\nIf you wanna play it alone, loses a big part of the fun. Still a nice game to expend some minutes here and there if you are not in mood to play some typical AAA title.\n\nIn my opinion the worst thing right now is the performance at split screen, low fps at my i7 + GTX 780.\n\n*7/10          Could be a really cool multiplayer game if the developers continue with his nice job.","November 18, 2014","true","0.8"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I would gladly buy again at full price.  Playing local coop with my daugther thirty minutes into the game (almost 10) she was say that this is one of the best games ever.  Not sure about that part yet but it certainly is a fun game and has the makings to be a very good game with further love and development by the developers.  It was certainly even with only an hour spent so far worth the money.   Is it rough around the edges?  Very.  Graphically it isn't anything to write home about.  Sound wise I can't say as we didn't have the sound playing.  I am not much on sound effects anyway so I usually am not big on reviewing that side of games.  I love soundtracks but only when I am playing OST burnt to CDs in my car.  Anyway to me this type of game is all about is it fun.  This isn't a game that is meant to be complex looking so the graphics really aren't that big of deal to me.  They are smooth for the most part so that is what I care about.  There are a few clipping issues that I am sure will get worked out.  Texture wise this isn't meant to be a game you are going to stop and look at the roses anyway.     Control wise I played via keyboard and my daughter via offical 360 controller.  We have a second 360 contoller but I was too lazy to hook up so I am going on her word about the contoller controls but she didn't seem to have any real problems with them.   The keyboard controls using the default WASD/Keyboard controls were fair but had some drift in them.  I am sure the developers will tighten up the controls as game development goes along so I am not too worried about that.   However contol in this type of game is one of the bigger issues worth looking at so if you are wondering as far as July 5th, 2015 at least as far as keyboard controls I can say that the bikes do control a "floaty" that I would like.   Once again this is a EA title and I am sure this will  change.   As far as overall game concept this game follows along with the old Road Rash feel and that is perfect for me.  The game is FUN.  Is it perfect, nope.  Was I expecting it to be at this point, nope.   Do I think it has the chance to become a great game, yes.  At this point in development do I feel like it is worth risking the full asking price of $20?  Yes if you played Road Rash or looking for a fun game that doesn't take itself too serious then I do.   The game doesn't have a lot of "meat" in it yet but even so what is on the bones so far is worth the money.  I have spent a lot more for a lot less fun.","July 5, 2015","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you don't know what Road Rash is, it's kind of like a racing game with beat em up elements. This game offers some rouge-like elements, the levels are a little random, and when you die, it's over, but you earn perks for your next run. The perks are very minor, Road Redemption is still a racing beat em up, not a grindy rpg.\n\nUnlike many other games in early access, I have seen this game continue to grow and update. The game lacks a few things, some new modes might be nice. More diverse AI would add a lot, they seem to all act pretty much the same way. While some randomization is great, as it adds replay value, there is just too much. Knocking a biker off feels like killing a random monster in a mmo, another will just spawn and take its place. There are no grudges, or personalities, and often riders who have nothing to do with your current race will try to attack you for no reason.\n\nMost importantly, despite its few flaws, it's a fun game. It runs well, the screen shots and videos accurately depict the graphics. I have not had the game crash, slow down, or had any noticeable bugs. I feel the game is worth it at full price, and I expect it to continue to get better.","October 19, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

This game is wondeful, the combat feels great! (It feels like I've really just smacked that guy in the face with a sledgehammer and sent him flying off his bike!) The only thing is, I wish I could duck. There have been times where two cyclists are at either end of me and try to hit me at the same time. It'd be halarious to see them smack each other. The Motorcycles feel good, the sounds are okay. Need a tibbit of work, expecially the guns. They're not bad, though. The visuals are all pretty nice, too! There's an assortment of races and mission types generated each time you play, and few diffrent tracks. I also must say, the soundtrack is wonderful. I'd love to be able to pick it up!\nAlso, if the developers come across this review..I've only run into one bug.

All whilst still being easy to master and do well in. Also, the updates are coming quite fast now after they switched to the Unity engine. The game's great joy, for me, is that it doesn't take that long to have fun and you can easily just finish it and go about your business. I especially enjoy it as it is somehow a remake of an old game that I played when I was a child, which makes it something special. All that, with a cool development team that listens and what to please the majority of people.

I knew I wanted it. Just watching the trailer for it brought back all my old memories of playing Road Rash back in the day. The game doesn't disappoint. While it doesn't share all the same qualities, it's still enough to satisfy my nostalgia.\n\nIt's crazy fun when you ignore the obvious learning curve. You need to definitely level up a bit to even stand a chance against the later levels in the campaign or just pure mastering of all you have at your disposal. There's also a Campaign+ Mode which gets even crazier with the difficulty and chaotic mayhem. I haven't had a chance to try the split screen yet, but from what I've seen from videos, It looks like a blast...Then there's also the elephant in the room. Yeah, I'm hoping Multiplayer Online will be added soon. Until then, at least we have offline co-op.\n\nOverall, from what I've experienced from the game. It's great. I hope it gets even better with new modes and all the kinks worked out in the future when it's finished.

I remember trading my SNES for my friend's Genesis a lot of weekends in Jr. High, and the Road Rash series was one of the biggest reasons. This game takes the timeless concept of armed crazies on motorcycles racing on public roads for fame and fortune to another level.\n\nProbably the biggest upgrade, online multiplayer, isn't implemented yet, but what is here now is already as fun as the original games. What's already been added to the original schematic is local multiplayer, rooftop levels, "hallucinatory" levels with cars falling from the sky and crashing into each other at every turn, awesome avatars with flaming jack-o-lantern heads, and a permanent experience based upgrade path on top of the cash upgrades that dissapear after each game ends.

I decided to go back and play it again recently because I remembered it being pretty fun, and then saw that I forgot to ever actually write anything about it, which is probably why the only other developer who ever gave me a game to review was the one who made that Hat Man game that I gave a bad review for. But on to Road Redemption. Road Redemption is a fun little game with equal emphasis on racing and combat, in which you try to survive your way through a trail of races and eliminations. You gain both cash and XP as you progress, but if you die then it's game over, and you restart from the beginning with only your XP upgrades carried over. The combat is pretty fun and fleshed out; you can grab other racers and steer them into oncoming traffic, kick them off bridges, shoot them, or just get in with a battle axe or a lead pipe and bash and counter your way to victory. Road Redemption is a game where "1st place" can either mean "stay ahead of the other racers" or "be the only racer left", and I appreciate that since I'm not much of a racer but I am much of a person who likes to hit other people with shovels. I first played the game over a year ago and it's still getting regular updates, adding lots of small features and changes that weren't in when I first played, but it is also still missing online multiplayer, which makes the $20 price tag a bit steep. It's apparently only going up in price after it leaves Early Access, though, and the current singleplayer content is still pretty fun, so if you're interested in the concept you may want to just take the gamble and buy it on sale now for the multiplayer later.","January 4","true","3.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

That might not seem much now, but before the GTA series this was something of a rariety in a game).\n\nApparently, according to wikipedia Road Rash 3D wasn't well received at the time. Well it was by me having by that point probably wasted months in the Road Rash games on the megadrive. As such, this modern day rip off homage has an awful lot to live up to.\n\nThings are still rough and ready, but the core of the game is there.\n\nOn the bad hand; the split screen multiplayer is workable but has bugs, the network play is still completely missing and the bikes feel like they are cruising far too smoothly and quickly over the road surface - it's not just the final "rainbow road" style track that makes you think you could be playing a karting game.\n\nThis should be unforgiveable, but...it's somehow not.\n\nIt's a testament to the Road Rash legacy for those who grew up with it that Road Redemption still makes me grin every time I fire it up after an update, whether it's surviving a pile up, loosing a lorry load of logs off a passing trailer on a trecherous bend with a well placed sword swipe or kicking an opposing rider off a bridge.\n\nIt also has something I don't remember in Road Rash, guns!\n\nSimply put, this game has massive potential. In my mind's eye I imagine netplay with clans of bikers riding a race or grudge match against one another. I can almost hear the grenade launcher calling out for it. I can hear the swearing and the laughter over the voice comm.\n\nFor now, Road Redempton is worth supporting as no one else is doing a similar game. Buy it (or con someone else into doing so :D) give it a play through, then get a few ciders in and try the split screen with some buddies, preferably on the hallucinogenic chemical zone level, where cars fall from the sky.

It is no where near the acheivement that Road Rash was but with this being early access I am hoping it can get closer to it. Currently it is not worth the price tag. There is no where near enough content to keep you going longer than a few hours. The races are short which can be irritating if you fall off near the as you will not have enough time to catch up, they are quite often extremely hectic and it is primarily luck that ensures you get through it. There can be bombs exploding, cars flying everywhere, cars swerving all over the road and occasionally cars that fall from the sky in the aptly titled halucineagenic zone.  There are two lots of upgrades, temporary ones which last for as long as you are alive and are bought with cash won from races and ones you buy once dead with the XP you have earned whilst alive. This is quite fun but again not a patch on Road Rash. I would like to see shops in which to purchase new bikes and parts to upgrade the one you have and new outfits to buy and things like armour. The races need to be longer as you are just getting into them when they come to an end, an end which allows you to carry on riding until the gane loads. I would like to see something of a story too, not anything dramatic like Grandma needs a new hip but doesn't have insurance so I race to pay for it kinda crap but just yes we race it's what we do. In Road Rash there was characters I didn't want to fight with as they always said nice things to me and there were jerks you didn't mind repeatedly bashing. Something like that is always fun. And dear god please lose the Mariocart level, currently the last level, riding on a rainbow in space? Come on, you lost me there.\n\nIn summary this is a fun game and a good way to waste some spare minutes but so far the content is lacking and the races are too short. But otherwise an enjoyable experience, unfotunately not worth the current price tag.","November 26, 2014","true","9.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

We all know what game this reminds us older players of. Here we are in a different time to do it all again, better and brutal online. Im really looking forward to the coming year of updates to gauge the level invested by this Louisiana company.\n\nFeatures I find lacking or just bugs.\n\n- Poor leaning on the bike\n- No cat walks or stoppies\n- Double health skill carries to ng+ but starting level 3 & $1500 does not\n- Starting a race is always set up at paces from other bikes and based on distance, its possible to not start a race until you want there is no time limit just a bar telling you when you finish\n- Maybe add street races where you all have a starting line and the option to have a delay to use weapons\n- Buying from the store the double dmg for the next race is bs garbage, its a gamble. make it a xp skill\n- There is no proper way to quit after you finish a race and spend exp if youre not dead.\n- No proper brake, just forward and reverse. never puts leg down.\n- The check points between levels to buy stuff show have more random one type of item(e.g cb radio, +mass/kg but can hear chatter maybe learn a thing, chains as weapons, screwdrivers, mail boxes, a whip, road beers, ♥♥♥♥ jugs, etc)\n- More chatter between all motorists, gestures too.\n- Mission to get 4of 4 stars you have to drive slow before reaching the end. its a problem of too short of a distance.\n- Cash into exp store item should display the ratio of $:exp.\n- Disarming a rider does nothing but killing a guy nets you a weapon...kick a guy off a roof top much.\n- Hands not attached to the handle bars\n- The magnum hand gun is large compare to our players hand, compare it to the harpoon gun in size.\n- Why is it with a handgun equipped that three different buttons are used to fire a gun?\n- More race modes: Defeating mob bosses on bikes with gang in tow, Tsunami run where you stay ahead of the death hunting you down, Hallucinegenic Zone you have an ability to slow time(e.g Max Payne 3 online) allowing the rider to  duck and weave.\n- Intersections, over passes, on ramps off ramps. get those alt routes\n- Not enough variations, the style going is very spaced out 0_0\n- Steamworks or GTFO\n\n\nOverall 7, because there is only 7 levels and it plays very well. Its not even half way across to what appears the end. At this time the game is .827 in Early Access. I like the randomness and hope to see a roguelike story making choices. Im sure to spend many hours playing once multiplayer rolls up\n\n\njuly 4 2015 - Alot has changed ng+ is tough and need to set yourself up to be able to compete so you dont die. basically if you barely beat a level and used all your boost you wont beat the next lvl. the new build look is nice, but it really shows how detailed it looks like a arcade cabinet game. There is still no multiplayer or bikes. Alot of fleshed out snags, power up attacks and more.","December 22, 2014","true","16.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kebhow/recommended/300380/","kebhow","kebhow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kebhow/","733 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRoad Redemption is a spiritual successor of the Road Rash Series. I have played only one Road Rash game before, which was on my Playstation. When I played Road Redemption for the first time, I really got that feeling that this is really a worthy follow up after the series, with modern graphics, physics, etc.\n\nIn this early access version, you're gonna be playing the campaign mode which lasts 12 levels, not unlike a rogue like setup. You go from level to level with various objectives, got some temporary upgrades in between which will be gone when you die, and then get to buy some permanent upgrades like health, damage, etc. With my poor skills, it took me 4 hours to finally finish this early access portion.\n\nAs for what you do in the game itself, there are race-type levels, take down, weird platforming level with a just-cause-y grappling hook, and a few other variations (like racing with cars raining from the sky). I have to say they really nail that feel when you hit enemies in the face. It's just so damn satisfying ! Kicking your enemy to make him crash a truck is even more fun, although a bit more difficult. There are also a few types of guns which makes your job of killing people very, very easy compared to hitting people directly in which you can take some damage. Maybe it'll be better if they nerf it a little. Nothing game breaking though.\n\nMy two cents is that even though this is a very early access, I get the feeling that the final product is going to be epic. The developers are great and they patch the game almost everyday, sometimes twice a day, and are also active in the forum. I fully recommend this game for those of you who likes hitting people in the face (who doesn't ?).","September 28, 2014","true","7.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

It's still not nearly perfect but it's still amazing in it's current state. That bone crunching sound and puff cloud of blood followed by your enemy getting flung off their bike is what you live for in this game and it's oh so satisfying.\n\nThe splitscreen multiplayer is also super hecticly fun and hilarious.\n\nDefinitely a huge recommendation from me.\n\nEDIT: The game has had some updates here and there really adding nothing to the game besides fixing some minor bugs that I never ran into. I haven't seen an update in over a month. And calm the ♥♥♥♥ down people, the Dark Souls thing was an obvious joke.\n\nCons\n-The UI still looks terrible and the handling can still be weird at times.\n\n-AI has been updated to be more agressive, but all that has done is make the AI gang up on you or fly past you and hit you perfectly with a weapon without even stopping. It's honestly made the AI a lot more annoying and not more difficult and they "can" stick to you like glue no matter if you're going over a jump or slapping that nitro, in the air, they will literally lose all air momentum and stick to you in the air, hit you and then take off in mid air. They can be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t at times.\n\nThe game isn't bad, I still have a lot of fun with it, but the devs really need to step up their game.","December 29, 2014","true","8.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","58","7","12","6","4"

You get guns, a samurai sword, c4, all kinds of weapons, a nitro boost, a jetpack maneuver, a really responsive drift, oceans of traffic, and various objectives.\n\nIt is also very much like a rogue-like.

That's what Road Redemption is. No plot, no getting serious, just pure violenece on the road focused on shoving people off the road.

I'm not that big a fan of the music, or the menus, but the core gameplay is really fun. It's a little rough around the edges but the developers seem to be continuing to engage with the community on the Steam forums and there is an official launch planned for later this year so hopefully they can iron out some of the problems. The updates they have planned look promising and I'm excited to try out the new features for myself.\n\n(It does kind of bug me that the default player character is set to Biker Santa Claus. I kinda wish there were more customization options for your biker..  But honestly, my biggest complaints are the kind of sloppy looking UI and menus that look very plain and not really stylized. It needs more polish!)\n\nThe driving and combat feels solid, and even the guns and shooting feel simple to use. The upgrade system, with a shop between levels, is a neat addition to a game like this, but again, the menu/UI for this stuff needs work. Same goes for the permanent upgrades that persist between playthroughs.\n\nIf the final product comes out and it's more or less the same, I don't think I would recommend it, but as it is, with updates on the way and a developer actually communicating with the fans, I'm happy to support them and I eagerly anticipate the future builds.","May 23","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you're careful about it you can even fly through entire races using your grappling hook like some sort of Hell's Angel/Spiderman hybrid. Its riddled with bugs and the mechanics behind races means its nearly impossible to catch up to rival racers in several modes.\nDespite the unpolished bits the combat has an incredibly satisfying sense of crunch. Since everyone is flying along at hundreds of miles per hour any hit that connects sends enemies flying like you just hit a home run. Hopefully as development goes on we'll see the rest of gameplay get tightened up a bit, right now it probably isn't worth a buy, but there is definitely enough here to have a real gem of a game in the future.","July 4, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

That said, I unexpectedly played this game for about 4 hours straight because I was having a lot of fun. Here's a section of gameplay with cars raining from the sky:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/JwgR8L9wAOo\nSome of you may be too young to have ever played Road Rash, but this game is on track to being better than one of the classics from my childhood. Players get a bike and have various objectives while racing around deserts, icy mountains and even city skylines. Much like Road Rash, the player is armed and able to kick and attack other bikers with weapons. Unlike Road Rash, however, Road Redemption has a huge arsenal of melee weapons and guns to lay waste to others on the road. Pasting C4 on bikers and blasting a cop car with a gernade launcher is exteremly fun.\n\nSo far, only some single player content is in, but multiplayer is on the way. Road Redemption has a few different mission types that vary from "get the attention of the police" to "kill all these guys without weapons" and they mix up the gameplay quite a bit. Presently: when a mission is completed, you're on to the next level. Completing these challenges and killing enemy bikers and cars gives you cash for buying upgrades for the next level. When you die, it's over, and you lose all your cash and upgrades. However, there's also a skill system, where you use experience points earned from killing bikers and cops to buy upgrades for things like health, better starting weapons and more nitro boosts. It's a little rough at the moment (the tree itself could use some visual tweaks), but the idea is awesome for a game of this style.\n\nSo far, the only negatives I can even think of are some bugs and preformance issues. The game chugs a bit (probably due to physics stuff since changing quality and antialiasing doesn't change it much), but it's still surprisingly playable during this. There's a few infinite loading bugs that I can't seem to reproduce, and once I got stuck in the skyline when I fell inbetween some buildings, but otherwise nothing that some polish won't fix.","October 1, 2014","true","7.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Not even once it considers itself serious.\nExpect tornados throwing cars all around the level, bomb that appear out of nowhere to blow you and your opponents up as well as crazy rides on the rooftops (with your regular traffic around as well, yep).\nMost of the things in game are randomly generated. While this means you can literally play it endlessly and get a new experience every time, this also brings in some issues.\nFor example, sometimes roads are generated in a very strange way so that you cannot really see what's coming next.\nThe fog from explosions seems to be just a texture (or maybe it's just the particles are not transparent at all?) and you cannot really see what's behind it.\nSome of those random things makes you feel cheated when you lose because of them.\nThey are definitely fixable, though. And every patch makes them a bit better.\nIn general it's a very pleasantly and crazy experience for those of you who want to scratch that Road Rash itch, as well as just for people looking to have some motorcycle combat fun.\n\nMore detailed look in the video:\nhttp://youtu.be/TaY36btUeA8","October 12, 2014","true","2.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

The level progression can be a little like Road Rash Jailbreak if any one still remembers that.\nYou get so far into the game, and once you get a game over, You have to start all the way back to square one.\nThis game is a little more lenient because you can gain XP to level up your skill tree. One Notch on the tree is to start from level 3 instead of level 1.\nA solid Check point system would be way better than having to buy them by failing Countless amounts of times.\nThe AI can be really aggressive in some areas and really hard to complete the objective. Once you run out of super Melees, It's almost impossible to Knock the AI's Off their bikes In the Eliminate X amount of Opponents.\nIn Road rash and other games, if you countered at the right time you got to take their weapons from them and stun them for a second making the progression doable. In Road Redemption you just dodge, and hope a gang of 10 other Bikers and Cops Don't Knock you out instantly sending you all the way back to either level one or the last purchased check point.\n\nThe item system, though Unique makes the game interesting. There is a choice of Guns or melee weapons, like shovels, axes, bats ect.\nThe bad thing is aiming while steering the bike. The environments can be so chaotic it makes the guns hard to use. So i don't. The weapons have health, so when they are depleted, you can't fight back or counter once you exhaust your last weapon.\nThe weapons also Auto cycle when you knock out another biker. So if you like a particular weapon be prepared to get the next thing that comes your way.\n\nI like the health system concept this game has going for it and the screen affects when you have low health. You can Gain a little bit of health by knocking out other AI's. The bad, is in the Game mode where you have to take out X number of opponents. They tend to Clump together and gang up on you. Even The AI's that don't have cursors over their heads, and some of the other Cars.\n\nThe controls need more polishing, Needs a better turning radius. There is no way to make sharp turns, you have slowing down. There are some areas where you have to slow way down, or you will crash into a mountain or drive over it and fly out into the rest of the unpopulated map.\n\nThis game reminds me very much of Road rash. I loved that game. This Game has made a lot of good updates since it had released.\nBeing able to do wheelys over objects and cars would be nice instead of face planting into them. Also whats up with car's and other vehicles being competition? I thought this was a bike only game.  It's fun, but a little confusing, hard and Chaotic at times. Still hadnt beaten it, but i do have a logn way to go with the way the game is.\nKeep up the good work developers, I hope my review helped.","March 15, 2015","false","4.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Buy this game!  It's every bit as fun as it looks.  The bikes are satisfying to ride.  The physics are more arcadey than realistic, meaning they're fun and forgiving.  Even with a mouse & keyboard it controls fine.  The weapons are hilarious, from knocking a rider's block off with a long shovel to slapping a C4 time bomb on his back.  When that fails, you can grab a rider and steer him into traffic, or just kick him right off a bridge.\n\nThere are different mission types, and while there is permadeath, your upgraded skills carry over into subsequent playthroughs.  Also, the soundtrack is fantastic.  The developer has been very active, releasing updates as often as every day since I picked this up during the last summer sale.\n\nThe downsides I've noticed include the interface, which is kind of ugly and poorly structured.  The rooftop levels aren't as solid as the open road levels, but they're getting there.  If multiplayer is of paramount importance, you'd better wait.  For everyone else, this game is already plenty of fun in its current state.  To put it differently, I don't see buying this now as a gamble, unlike other Early Access games.","July 4, 2015","true","17.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The game comes with dynamically generated raods, a few variations in mission objectives that all seem to lead towards a boss fight of sorts represented with a red skull.\n\nIm an avid fan of older games and road rash, it was one of those games that was amazing to play with friends, sure it took quite alot of effort to find the right keys being on the same keyboard and whatnot, but the fun was worth it. What has been changed compared to the good old game? The game has race and hitman modes, but the most interesting addition by far is the "hallucinogen ride" where they chuck falling cars on the road while you ride, here dodging traffic takes a whole new meaning. The game also introduces a wide variety of weaponry including guns that werent in the predecessor game, althou hard to aim, they can be a big help in several situations (they even have a rocket launcher!) Overall the opposition interaction isnt there yet (if it ever gets implemented since the current bikers are faceless goons who you tend to forget real easy) and the recing part lacks the "racing part" as the game focus is too much on combat. What do i mean? enemies you have left behind easily catch up to you and your forced to retaliate, its too easy to catch up once youv fallen or been smacked off your bike.\n\n\nFor now i have tried only the single player mode of this game and am loving it quite alot. Sure the game has a few kinks to work out but its a real masterpeice of early releases. So if kicking and hitting your fellow bikers while doing a race is your kind of fun, then i whole heartedly reccomend this game, but the game is still missing a chunk of the heart that used to be road rash.","December 28, 2014","true","2.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Many many bugs (some game-ending) and there currently is not enough content to warrant a purchase. Recommend waiting untill more is added to the game before buying.

I seriously want to love this game, but there are a lot of design flaws beyond bug fixes that simply do not make the game enjoyable.\n\nA great example of this is the skill tree, which should be scrapped entirely for a new unlock system that changes your starting weapons and unlocks new motorcycles. Increasing your health, xp gains, and cast earned isn't healthy game play fun - its grindy and does not feel rewarding to the player.\nInstead, picture that you only start the game off with a single character and bike, no weapons, and have to earn your way up the ranks. As you spend your xp after each match you unlock new characters (that start with a single weapon) or bikes with real differences. You shouldnt start each game with 3 weapons immediately, already on stage 3, and nearly irrelevant bike choices just because you played through a few times. I know it's early access - but this is the kind of thing that is getting old quickly.\n\nThe game also completely lacks personality from the other racers, and to make it worse it is littered with a bunch of randomly spawned NPC's to up the action. Instead keep my 10 or so competitors and make them challenging, make them try to grab me and block my shots, or boost when I try to shoot at them. Give them names and pictures, dialouge, they need personality.\n\nLastly, since right now your current objectives are all random - it makes for some frustrating game play. I don't mind the tornado, explosions in the middle of the road constantly levels, or roof top timed challenge modes existing.... if there was a choice to it. If i could choose to want to play that or not it would really help. I want a core gameply driven experience when I hit campaign, and I want a challenge type scenario placed elsewhere. My campaign should be an experience of improvement and difficulty to be the best racer out there, not dodging randomly generated falling cars.\n\nThe game is still fun, but I am not recommending it until I see some real direction put into the game instead of a bunch of randomly placed together content and skill trees.","January 6, 2015","false","3.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","1"

Essentially there isn't much here - there is about as much gameplay depth and design to this as, I dunno, a wacky trainer for grand theft auto, and it has the look and physics feel of someone's first project in unity.

This should be enough to tell you that you will not play much of the game.\n\nI didn't like it. Maybe I am just a little to young (20) to have played the games that were like this back in the day so I don't get the whole nastalgia feeling or anything, but if you want a throw back or enjoy the simple games where you just try to get further or try to get a higher score than last time... ok.\n\nStarting the game out, you get on your bike, you press forward and depending on situations... you never stop pressing W. Time your whacks right and you get a hit on a guy who then get some strange spead boost if he isn't dead in the first hit. Get a gun and shot your enemies... only takes one shot usually but the maps are just full of bends, there really arent any straight aways or anything, so you miss most of your shots.\n\nGraphics... not great. The models for the game were not made that well. They represent the object being displayed just fine but there should have been a lot more vertices for a game that is so simple. Map design... lots of cars on the road, and a few things on the side. That is all, nothing more than that, your done. Just stay on the road or suffer a large penalty to move speed off it.\n\nRespawns... I once ran into a car on accident and I respawned, only to be pancaked instantly (theres about 2/3 of my heal gone), respawned once more and got ran into from behind this time by a semi. Guess what? Game over, start over again with the same boring winding roads with the same weapons and maybe one more upgrade but probably not.\n\nSo I guess since I come from a primarily FPS and MMO background, this kind of game was just never suited for me anyway. If your into games that are similar to this, then I'm sure you will enjoy it. But I don't like the boring grinds of the same thing over and over again. I enjoy challenges, but I like challenges that are different each time, this is just the same set of missions over and over until you get past the one you died at.","October 17, 2014","false","0.6"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","4"

As a huge fan of Road Rash I dont really like what I see here.  Why not just update the Road Rash already award winning game design?

In this game here is no rivalries, the game play is similar but not as good as in the past. Hell I even miss the crashing and running back to the bike, it added a touch of realism, this new version is all too arcadey.\n\nPlus the music is aweful, I mean terrible with a capital T.  The bike and game sound effects need to be much more distinct, deeper, richer.  I should be hearing the bike deep in the bass of my speakers, instead ..nothing much at all.\n\n\nPlus the physics of the bike dont feel right either.

I'll admit I'm far too biased to say whether this is over-all a good game or not on its own merits, but I feel it has drifted too far from the Road Rash roots it came from for me to be able to enjoy it. If you happen to be considering this game because of those roots, I definitely recommend going on youtube and watching someone else play it rather than just relying on the trailer.\n\nThe game feels a lot like Burnout Paradise to me, not necessarily in gameplay but in style. A lot of people do seem to like that style, but I prefer a bit more grit and subtlty.\n\nAs I sad earlier. Not a bad game, just not for me. And my concern is that people wanting another Road Rash may be disappointed by the direction the changes have taken this game.

If any of you have played Road Rash for the N64, Road Redemption is like that but on bath salts and with guns. A few issues I have with the game are when there's a lot of ♥♥♥♥ onscreen like when a logging truck spills logs all over the road or if there's a "car storm" the FPS drops to the single digits.

SPIDERBIKE!\nMore like SPIDER RASH... I backed this thing up because I'm hopelessly addicted to the 1995 Roadrash for PC (remember the friggin awesome Soundtracks on that one?) the rail rider mechanic (having the screen pull your bike around wherever the road bends and you got to pull in that direction to keep in lane or avoid collisions). Expect me to endlessly compare this UNITY engine stinker to the good ol' boy classic. My name is Milwaukee Jon !\n\nNow I know this is Early Access and I am writing TWO notes here to edit this review whenever I see significant changes.\n\nFirst off: Unity? FFFFFUUUUUUUUU...\nRuns like @$$. I'm serious. I have seen better Tetris 3D clones with more destruction and particle effects that run like a waterfall (constant). I have just recently grabbed Receiver (thx Bundle store) for free and I am willing to accept its low poly plastic look that runs as $H!T as anything else with the touch of the Unitron.\nI guess the engine was picked for a reason (looking at you Linux and MacOS) but ffs is it underperforming.\n\nCould be because I do not own a 1337 PC GAMING MASTER RACE accredited machine. I don't give two about that becaue I played games in the past decade that a) run like hell and b) look like paradise at the same time while you get your lil avatar ♥♥♥ raped by the superb AI that handles most of your surroundings. All the while my machine was switched to energy saving settings.\n\nAnyway:\nSoundtrack is a bit here and there. I really like some of those electro tunes (shiz beatz and all the shebang) but on the other side the metal tunes cannot possibly compare to the grunge awesome that was included in the classic. However if you compare the stage themes (there were 5 in the classic) and this one that puts random themes everytime you reload a stage I guess it is somewhat better because you know it is an actual track and not a MIDI tune with fake instruments from the system repository.\n\nControls: As I expected it is an upgrade in dimensions. You have thrusters to do quick jumps and doubletap to activate a constant booster instead of boost capsules that needed to be timed well in the classic to have an effect. You can turn around, drive here and there, only limited by the camera pitch towards the center but OH WAIT, mouse now controls the camera and the combat. The one hit takedowns work nicely and blocking seems to be OK. There is even a hook gun that when mastered can become your best tool while chasing rivals or evading obstacles. Spiderman approved!\n\nVideo and Settings: Change resolution, windowed or FS, AA, VS. all that $H!T takes a nose dive because on weak rigs you can pretty much forget about it. Doesn't matter what you pick. Fastest is still beyond min. playability. The more is happening on screen the worse stuttering gets. I usually just skipped the city rooftop stages whenever I lost too much HP cause they are pointless when the best I get are 12 FPS...\n\nGameplay:\nOne hit takedowns (crticals) are often, booster gets me up to max speed when I need it but doesn't help chasing well placed opponents although the game cuts you some slack like the classic did. The opponents are often gathered near frontrunner so if you manage to drive fast and not fly off your bike or get  stuck  SUPER GLUED  to the rear of a car (wtf man?) then you have a good chance to overtake all them suckas at once (thx to the popo beating up everyone and occasional car storms (yes you heard right, CARS dropping out of the sky onto the track like ultra heavy rain drops of the apocalypse!!!). I felt like a D@m/\/ wizard while a few hundred meters in front of me cars spawned out of nowhere and crushed the opposition and pesky pigs.\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning. Hook gun comes complete with bungee rope and all that gud stuff. While midair you can turn directions like Mario and not give a flying pair of ducks about inertia or silly physics. YOU ARE THE PHYSICS! Oh what is that, a huge boulder? NOPE! it's a perfectly fine ramp. Just dash into it and get catapulted back on track while blasting fools from above with your hitscan AK, UMP, Shotie and grenade launcher. Hell yeah.\n\nI guess at this point I gotta pull the emergency brakes: See, the classic was inspired by the console versions. The combat felt up close and personal because you AND your rivals had a health bar that regenerated once downed. It was fists vs. fists, chains, bats. The opponents had names displayed in the corner. They even had UNIQUE outfits and bike colors ffs (d@mn boy (speaking of Early Road Redemption), you gettin yo 4$$ handed to ya by a 20 year old game you tried to surpass). That's right, rival gangs, popo and all that SHARE most of the looks. One surprise I found was that some random racers drove CARS! Wohoo, I can't bash your teeth in but I sure can blow you up with sticky TNT or that nice 40mm launcher.\n\nThen again, the basic get up in the classic was a helmet, a two colored bodysuit, and the color of your bike. The popo had fat bikes and leather with an open helmet so you could see their faces when punching them off their bikes. This one surprises me.\nNobody wears helmets (only random ♥♥♥♥♥ drivers wear those), everyone is beating everyone of different color, the cars just run into you when you try to slow down, Coppers don't play it save, the cars do incredible amounts of colateral damage, the police is more interested in murdering than in real life minus the use of guns (would be too OP I guess).\n\nWhat I am trying to say here is that basically I like some of the new stuff but laugh at the lack of detail that's been put in the visuals and the behaviour. Everyone is bat$H!T insane and the truck drivers are dropping deadly logs on purpose causing endless waves of crashing cars and taking you off your bike (I guess those things get nerfed sooner or later). It makes the feels go away and make way to a different kind of frustrating. Needs way more polish guys.\n\nOne example in combat dynamics:\nHere only the toughest makes it out alive (most of the time it is you because everybody else gets knocked the EFF out from one hit criticals or quick 2 hit combos or simply mowed down by gunfire thank god it isn't autoaiming like in some other bike racing games *cough* Jacked *cough*). Once you manage to crash enough times (mostly thrice) then it is bye bye and you gotta restart your career in a parallel universe as the Game Over screen keeps tellin yo stOopid @$$ (or spend EXP on a "NEW" concept of advancing the plot. Yes, a PERK let's you skip the beginning stages).\n\nThe perk system is very funny at that it COMPLETELY bypasses SHOP, CLUB HOUSE, SAVE TOILET. Yep.\nWant a better bike? only 100XP for starters, want higher character stats? moar EXP please. Want to gain more for less? EXP is currency, money is for the YOLO campaign items. The concept of YOLO is exactly that. Where the save feature made devastating bike damage pointless in Rash: oh you failed, bike is gone, money is gone, go back to square one and ... oh wait just load your last save. Redemption goes: PFFUUU...CK saving, better transcend space and time and possess another racer that looks exactly like you and condemn him to the same if not worse bone shattering death! Oh and go back to the beginning lowie.\n\nCharacter traits are gone completely. You are the same a-hole all the time occasionaly your dummy driver comes with a helmet. Watch out we got a badass over here. You can steal weapons from everybody else but why would you when the missions are short and your own stash of multiple murdering tools is more than enough. Oh right. Weapon degradation. No ammo refills, no slice and dice. Every hit takes a chunk out of weapon condition. No more endlessly swinging your bat in the face of oncoming rivals.\n\nWhat I expect in the future:\nBiker Names - at least the Opposition\nMoar creativity with the bikes - customization\nMUCH longer stages. MUCH LONGER.\n5/10","September 19, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

Sometimes its elevator music and sometimes its hard rock. It plays sort of like a rouge like game. The missions are somewhat random and you have one life to get to the end of the game. At the end of each level you have some time to buy health and pther upgrades with the money you earned in the previous event. Once you die, you can spend some experience points on permanent upgrades that will help you in your next attempt. I have yet to beat it but im getting pretty far now. Its hard to stop playing once you have started. I cant wait to play this with friends. It really does bring back old road rash memories.\n\nI very much recommend this game.

Disgusted by humanity's rapacious slaughter of those beautiful creatures, he determined that the only way to impact positive change was to stage a sit-in protest in front of the White House. This game covers the cross-continental journey from the dazzling west coast to the seat of corruption.\n\nAlong the way, the young man makes shocking discoveries. The most unsettling is the realization of his own innate violent desires. Unsure how to reconcile them with his noble mission, he lashes out at many bikers who are pursuing their own goals on the lonely roads. The entire time, he is haunted by a semi -- clearly a metaphor for his unstoppable ambition and the pain and destruction it leaves in its wake. His days are filled with explosions, bludgeoned heads, and ragdoll bodies. Eventually, as he nears DC, he comes to a dramatic revelation: Drugs are bad for you. I mean, seriously, what the hell is a "butterfly whale?" What was he smoking when he came up with that?\n\nEDIT: I learned I was in contravention of international law ("All endangered species shall be described as 'majestic').

It not only harkens back to Road Rash, but all the arcade games that were easy to get into and gave you that thrill, whether you beat it or it beat you.  You'll notice I haven't played much so far but even if it never gets out of EA, I feel I've gotten my money's worth.  As an aging gamer, my hand-eye is far from what it used to be so I really stink at this game. I can't even get to 3rd place and die more than I survive but I keep going back for more.  To me, that's the mark of a great game.

Road Redemption does a million things better than those games from two decades ago, but also has yet to unlock that sense of agency and independence.\n\nWhat has me writing my review today is that the project has been receiving a lot of attention from its developer over the past several weeks with a constant stream of updates that add content and improve gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempprofileurl/recommended/300380/","tempprofileurl","Ben","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempprofileurl/","2213 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOriginal review 16/42:\n\nNot now.\n\nThis has potential, yes. Currently, it's not worth your money.\n\nCurrently, there are loads of lockups which make the game practically unplayable, even on the lowest settings (This is coming from a guy who can max out Arma 3 and Battlefield 4, so no "it's your computer" comments please).\n\nI accepted this, thinking that maybe for whatever reason my i7 4770k processor wasn't powerful enough to procedurally generate the landscape quickly enough to drive on.\n\nI was wrong - This game boasts on the store page: "Lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in this procedurally-generated driving combat adventure."\n\nUh, no. One of the reasons I was interested in this is because of the procedural generation. There is NO procedural generation in this at all. After dying four times and being forced to restart the game (This isn't as annoying as it sounds, fortunately), I realised I was racing on the EXACT same stretch of road each time.\n\nGive it a while until this is in a playable state, I'll update this when a major patch comes in.\n\nUPDATE 12/10/2014: The devs have spoken to me twice about their progress and patches with the game, which I always appreciate. The latest patches seem to have introduced prcedural generation of landscapes, which is definitely a good thing.\n\nThe FPS lag remains for me, though it's definitely improved and apparently being addressed currently.\n\nAt the moment, the game still isn't exactly "playable" for me, though if you're willing to take the risk on serious performance issues, I would definitely go ahead and suggest it.\n\nUPDATE 18/05/2015 - With the game nearing what should be full release (It was meant to be Q1 2015, doesn't look like that's happened), I figured I should update this again.\n\nThe dynamic content still isn't great, the first level always looks pretty much the same, the only difference seems to be day/night.\n\nAs for FPS drops, the game in itself is much smoother but I still get lockups every time I kill an enemy.\n\nYou can also take damage for a while after passing the finish line.\n\nCurrently this is a "Meh" rather than a "Yes" or a "No", but I personally have some regrets still.\n\nUPDATE 15/06/2015: I'm changing this review to a positive one. I've spoken a number of times with the Road Redemption team who are obviously dedicated to making a good game and want to take the time to perfect it (Hence why it's still in EA, I assume).\n\nThe lockups upon killing an enemy are apparently a design decision, which I understand - The developer said that it's an idea suggested by Vlambeer to have an impact pause and camera shake when hitting an enemy. It's not something I'm a fan of personally, but as the developers it's their prerogative to do what they like with their game. They've shortened these recently, I assume to interrupt the gameplay less, but I still feel like they might be unnecessary.\n\nPerformance wise, the game runs at a solid 60fps on the highest settings now, which I find impressive considering the plethora of issues I had on launch.\n\nAs for the dynamic content, I still feel like it leaves a fair bit to be desired - The map feels very similar, if not the same on every playthrough - Obviously level 1 is different from level 2, but level 1 feels the same on every run.\n\nThe game itself plays really well, combat feels solid and there are plenty of different ways to take out your enemies and I love the idea of it being a semi-roguelike whereby you have permadeath but you can also upgrade your abilities for your next run.\n\nOverall, a really solid title now, runs well and the gameplay is great. My only gripes are the pauses when you hit an enemy and the lack of dynamic maps, but other than that I'm not sure I can fault it. Would recommend even at full price (At the time of writing it's on sale in the summer sale so you've got no reason to not buy it), there's enough content to tide you by for your money's worth.","September 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just finished my 1st play-through and i'm very impressed. Obviously it was a little short but in open access I expect little compromises. It's a very familiar pattern to Road Rash of old with level after level of wild tracks to race. It can be quite seat of the pants type stuff at times with clever dips and rises hiding oncoming traffic, crazy debris spinning about the track, suicidal cop cars etc etc etc. It has a great structure of purchase based add-ons and experience based ones to fine tune your rider for the oncoming challenges but could really use the same to customise and personalise your bike itself. At this time, it could definitely still do with some fine tuning (for example Road Rash's agonisingly long run back to the bike after crashing would add a greater price for recklessness) but all complaints are minimal to the joy you'll get watching a man you've just kicked into oncoming traffic get wiped out by a logging truck. If it was a bigger full game with competitive online multiplayer and the tweaks ironed out it'd be a certain 8 or 9 out of ten. Great work bringing back a sorely missed classic.","June 25, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can still continue but without the cash reward at the end of the race. And also, give that number a call! Ian is a very nice man.

As others have stated; it's not road rash, not a bad thing though. Racing while on acid, as hallucinogenic cars fall from the sky, is neat; until you hit one. The game is actually in pretty good shape for being early access, though I would like more bikes and riders, but that could be in the works. Biggest complaint is having been clipped into a car (only twice so far), and just had to sit back and enjoy the ride.\n\n+I got a notification that I killed Pewdiepie.\n+Murderface achievement (Dethklok reference)\n+Putting C4 on other motorists, and getting blown up with them for staying too close.\n+Regular patches for improvements and/or fixing bugs\n\n-Not many bikes or riders available yet\n-Physics can be "interesting"\n-I got a notification that I killed Pewdiepie, yet he is still alive.","July 6, 2015","true","41.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Elements of a roguelike are implemented nice, controls are fine and fighting other racers is very fun indeed.

The Road Redemption team asked if I'd like a free copy to play to provide feedback so here's what I think so far.\n\nAgain, like I said, I've only played about 3 hours and I've already had loads of fun. Road Redemption is a high octane arcade racing combat survival game (definitely a mouthful). There's no story or voice acting but the gameplay is all you need. Race across rooftops, take out rivals, taunt the cops and try your best to stay alive. That may sound simple but it's challenging. The AI isn't dumb. They've kicked me off of bridges and have blocked my attacks quite a lot. Cars ram into you and trucks drop lumber and destroy anything in their path. The devs made the braking system really soft so you can't easily dodge grenades or attacks being launched at you. Some missions will have raining cars and random ones that will drive completely horizontal to the highway making it even more challenging and random.\n\nOf course this game being in early access there are still kinks to work out. I've gotten stuck on terrain and sometimes the hit boxes can be a little off. At times I'll find that respawning on the track I can't move and am forced to quit and their secret racing map seems to end in the middle with no finish so I haven't been able to complete the campaign yet. Online mutliplayer hasn't been released yet but if you have a friend you can play local co-op.\n\nTo provide some ideas I would definitely add some voice acting and police sirens. It would also be really cool to have a story along with the campaign to make it more immersive and since it's already crazy...why not add a mission where you have to outrun a ridiculously giant truck along with having to deal with your usual rivals? I'm sure you guys must have lots of ideas and I can't wait to see them in action. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game and I can't wait for more content.","October 7, 2014","true","5.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Be warned that these upgrades disappear after you lose all your health on the road.\nThere is persistent experience generation (from killing rival bikers and destroying cars) that allows you to get points to spend upgrading your bike, max health, upgrading your starting weapons, and so forth. These bonuses always stay with you no matter how many times you restart a level.\nSplit screen campaign (soon to be online). Works very well with shared bonuses from the shop and also a competitive mode is in the works too.\nAt the time of writing there has been 6 updates to knock out bugs, increase performance and add new content and the game hasn’t been out a month yet, so yes dear reader this is a dev team that listens to its community and keeps an eye out for bugs.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThere are no key-bindings just yet (there is a placeholder in the options) so just a head’s up if you don’t have a game-pad. You will struggle without one.\nAiming your cross-hair to use firearms is very difficult and there isn’t a button to reset your camera. What ends up happening is after you try aiming and want to have your camera dead center you need to do it manually and fast before you go head first into a car. I have faith in the dev team that this is going to be sorted out sooner rather than later.\nThe hit detection seems a bit off from the rival bikers as there able to hit you when they’re in mid air and you’re on the ground, although it seems to happen more on “the rooftop” levels then in the other levels.\n\nNitpicking:\n\nYes Road Redemption has bugs, a fair few to put mildly, but only just a few weeks old on Steam and they’ve already released several patches to address the big ones.\n\nDid I make time to complete it?\n\nYes. 5 times so far in 11 hours.\n\nRedlight or Greenlight:\n\nThis game is currently at a greenlight.\n\nThanks to the dev team for handing out plenty of patches in a short amount of time (big company’s take note). I was a kickstarter backer paying $20, but it was money well spent and I’d gladly spend double if not more for this great title. I’m really, really glad its this team (Dark Seas Games) that has made RR and by the time this has released in its final form it’ll be an instant classic and definitely my game of the year.

These games might incluede: Twisted Metal, Road Rash, Burnout series, and possibly Flatout.\n\nAt it's core, the racing mechanics are there, but the aren't heavily influenced by anything other than get from point A to point B. It's more about the journey, not about the destination, and boy is this journey a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nEach mach has different demands: race, destroy, or sometimes you'll find just surviving is a demand in itself. There's just enough nuance in the game to really warrant a purchase.\n\nI actually just got off the phone with the developer (he seems like a really nice guy, and his phone number is actually in the game), and he's stated that they have a lot planned. Hopefully the racing portion become more of its own beast, but time will tell.\n\nI mentioned the journey, getting from point A to point B, and that's where the game shines with all sorts of carnage, explosions, and parrying. There's nothing quite as satisfying as the combat in this game. At it's core it's more a combat racer than it is one or the other, but it does have a heavier emphasis on combat. It's a blast, and co-op will be riot.\n\nThat all being said, the game is difficult, like, extremely so; however, it's never to the point of irritation, but more to the point of, "Let's play again."\n\nTL;DR\n\nThe game's a blast, and is a fun combat racing game, though there is definitely more emphasis on the combat.","October 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

You won't be dumping hundreds of hours into this but it's an overall good game.\n\nUpdate: 11/25/15\n\nDev snuck a big update in on me - added some assests (new ramps, new debris/vehicles on road, tunnels in maps now etc). I died in a campaign once for the first time in a while but the difficulty felt a bit forced/artifical. Once I started to really pay attention since I had been doing stupid well recently I noticed some changes:\n\n- Enemy AI riders are more aggressive. I think their health was also increased a bit or my damage went down overall. There might even be a few more of them (the "clutter" riders) then usual.\n\n- Road clutter (especially in the halluciongenic map) can be a bit overkill at times and almost seems "rigged" in a Dark Souls type sense.\n\n- Field of view. I think the FoV was limited in an attempt to make it harder to see. There are also visual effects to help limit FoV in certain spots on the maps.\n\nOverall I like the changes but feel it could be toned down just a bit. Add in a range modifer to damage on the guns and it'll be great. A difficulty and FoV slider would be a great fit as well.\n\n\n10/25/15:\n\nI've now completed the campaign ~8 times since the last major update. Game mechanics are all essentially the same. Devs say the game is harder (doesn't really need a difficulty boost IMO) but really it's just changed to be more reliant on brutality. Powerups are necessary to win (attack damage, nitro gain, max nitro, then add in some hp recovery boosts). Guns now drop from riders (don't think they did before) which is a welcome change (I still use headless horsemen skin because it's cool looking and I don't mind having less frequent gun drops). It's nice to have the "race the masters" every 3 levels removed. Game is still massively reliant on nitro and killing to replenish. AI has either improved a great deal or been given ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t advantages since it seems like it's much harder to break away from the pack now. Go slow near a pack and they slow down, use a small nitro boost near an AI enemy and they "keep up" with you etc.. seems like BS advantage. Game needs a re-focus on racing a bit more IMO.\n\nOriginal:\n\nTruthfully it's a great game but lacks depth (not a game you'll sink hundreds of hours into). If you enjoyed Road Rash at all this will definitely hit the spot for you.\n\nPros\n\n- Solid weapon selection (shottys to ak47s to shovels/katanas to c4/harpoons to grenade launchers)\n- Fun mechanics (nitro, jump jets, killing people with shovels while riding a motorcycle, harpooning people or objects and using the harpoon as a sling, attaching c4 in the middle of a group of 6 riders then nitro-boosting away.. etc)\n-"Perma-Death" system that allows you to earn XP and still keep some powerups.\n- Solid amount of upgrades\n- Combat is fun, with ability to kick, deflect, dodge, and attack\n\nNeutral\n\n- Small selection of bikes/riders\n- Small number of base maps and missions that get "randomized".. seems to be 4-5ish main maps (Not including the very cool last level) and 3 modes (kill, race, raise wanted level).\n- Guns have no range modifier (shotty/cqc weapons will do damange at range)\n\n\nCons\n\n- Driving overall could use some tweaks with more noticable differences between the bike models. The handbrake could be better as well.\n- Some levels seem to be "hard/annoying for being hards sake" - mainly the one where cars randomly fall out of the sky.\n- Certain racers do not start with you and you can see their skull icon on the length map; this seems like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (especially only having 20 seconds to overcome guy in first).\n- Minor clipping issues on objects\n- Harpoon glitches (especially when enemies are around, will often times randomly shoot backwards or to the side)\n- When jumping bike very occasionally doesn't land correctly and drastically reduces speed\n- 18 wheel truck cabs should not be able to boost in front of me at max speed, they honestly just become annoying (agent of chaos is their point but damn).","June 27, 2015","true","38.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A seat that has been collecting dust for far too long IMHO. It also reminds me of the craziness of the Burnout series and Radikal Bikers. I tend to prefer racing games that are more than just racing. Sometimes its more satisfying to just blow it all up. I find this game to be a great way to get all my commuter frustrations out. I'll happily sacrifice realism for entertainment value.\n\nMinor stuff:\nThe gameplay is pretty solid for an Early Access. Haven't run into any sort of game ending glitches or crashes.\nThe Punk Model: the skin on his shoulders stretches all kinds of funny when he swings a weapon.\nI'm reluctantly happy there isn't a restart race/round option, far too many times I've had awful starts that resulted in a win where I was just trying to finish.\nBallerina Effect: Every once in a while a car or piece of wood will start to spin out and, I guess, lose it's horizontal drag making it spin faster and faster. I kinda like the effect, it definitely has a place in a crazy game like this. It's a mechanic that jives with an icy track or low gravity but not every environment.\nLow Speed Turning: I tend to hit the fence on the Star Road from time to time. It usually spins me 180 degrees. I find it easier to select 'put me back on track' instead of attempting to turn around. The turning radius is wider than the track forcing me to make a 3 or 4 point turn just to get reoriented.\nPipe Bomb Bikers: So satisfying to take these guys out. There's a good chance I'm probably just complaining here but in Campaign+ I've run out of time on take-down missions because the Pipe Bomb Bikers take out the other bikers before I can catch them. It isn't a recurring issue, usually happens if I'm out of Nitro.\nCampaign+: I found some of the races where there's car rain, bomb guys and car/truck opponents (usually around 10+) were easier to finish because the obstacles end up taking out all the competition in the duration of the race.\nStar Road: I found that if I rocket boost right at the sart of the race, before the first drop, I will sometimes fall through the track instead of landing.\n\nSome terrible suggestions:\n1) Selectable 10-speed bike: C'mon its a little funny.\n2) Female Racer: While Shovel Knight was the addition that made me buy the game, your welcome. I wouldn't be opposed to some sort of female character model.\n3) Grab Breaks: Opponents don't seem to break a grab no matter how long I hold them.\n4) Intersections: Pretty self explanatory.\n\nThanks for this gem of a game. Can't wait for the full release.","March 6, 2015","true","38.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Opponents tend to home in on you more and difficulty has been slightly increased later on but this is all good as balance is better early game. Upgrades mean a lot to you late game. All in all this is now easily 8 or 9/10 now.\n\n\nShortly this game is a 7/10 In it's current state and already a pretty solid recommendation. It is however a game in early access and has potential for a much higher score after some alterations to the game. So lets list the good and the bad:\n\nGood:\n- So how many Sega Road Rash -type of games have you seen lately? In 2015 the concept is looking quite fresh.\n- Good action. Satisfying violence.  Speed!\n- Experience points that can be distributed to skills permanently.\n- Experience points that can be used to get upgrades that are in effect until you die.\n\nBad:\n- This is one of those games where the AI is right behind you and if you make a mistake late on a course it's all over in a blink.  Luckily some mistakes are allowed if you are not that far into a race and your hitpoints allow you to continue.\n- Random nature of the maps underscores the importance of luck sometimes quite a lot unfortunately. It is common to grind one level a long time until that one time the stars are aligned correctly and you clear it flawlessly.\n- Bugs, glitches. Not that many and not that critical. But railings on the bridge are very bugged as they are there pretty much just for show. Also the ground under bridges are the best places to make the game glitch so bad you fall trought the ground into the void.\n- It is possible to stop from full speed to zero in an instant and get stuck on things near the road or civilian cars that drive on the road. I was not amused when i got hooked on a car for a long time unable to get off. Quit button solved that one.\n- Restart button missing. Essential function in any racing game. Put on the Road -button is there but it's not the same nor does it work most of the time until you are very deep outside the road. (and guaranteed to loose the race at that point).\n- Experience point system could use a closer look. Loosing all XP in certain situations ensure there is extra grind that does not help. Even keeping small amounts of XP after every game would help.","September 29, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempprofileurl/recommended/300380/","tempprofileurl","Ben","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempprofileurl/","2213 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOriginal review 16/42:\n\nNot now.\n\nThis has potential, yes. Currently, it's not worth your money.\n\nCurrently, there are loads of lockups which make the game practically unplayable, even on the lowest settings (This is coming from a guy who can max out Arma 3 and Battlefield 4, so no "it's your computer" comments please).\n\nI accepted this, thinking that maybe for whatever reason my i7 4770k processor wasn't powerful enough to procedurally generate the landscape quickly enough to drive on.\n\nI was wrong - This game boasts on the store page: "Lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in this procedurally-generated driving combat adventure."\n\nUh, no. One of the reasons I was interested in this is because of the procedural generation. There is NO procedural generation in this at all. After dying four times and being forced to restart the game (This isn't as annoying as it sounds, fortunately), I realised I was racing on the EXACT same stretch of road each time.\n\nGive it a while until this is in a playable state, I'll update this when a major patch comes in.\n\nUPDATE 12/10/2014: The devs have spoken to me twice about their progress and patches with the game, which I always appreciate. The latest patches seem to have introduced prcedural generation of landscapes, which is definitely a good thing.\n\nThe FPS lag remains for me, though it's definitely improved and apparently being addressed currently.\n\nAt the moment, the game still isn't exactly "playable" for me, though if you're willing to take the risk on serious performance issues, I would definitely go ahead and suggest it.\n\nUPDATE 18/05/2015 - With the game nearing what should be full release (It was meant to be Q1 2015, doesn't look like that's happened), I figured I should update this again.\n\nThe dynamic content still isn't great, the first level always looks pretty much the same, the only difference seems to be day/night.\n\nAs for FPS drops, the game in itself is much smoother but I still get lockups every time I kill an enemy.\n\nYou can also take damage for a while after passing the finish line.\n\nCurrently this is a "Meh" rather than a "Yes" or a "No", but I personally have some regrets still.\n\nUPDATE 15/06/2015: I'm changing this review to a positive one. I've spoken a number of times with the Road Redemption team who are obviously dedicated to making a good game and want to take the time to perfect it (Hence why it's still in EA, I assume).\n\nThe lockups upon killing an enemy are apparently a design decision, which I understand - The developer said that it's an idea suggested by Vlambeer to have an impact pause and camera shake when hitting an enemy. It's not something I'm a fan of personally, but as the developers it's their prerogative to do what they like with their game. They've shortened these recently, I assume to interrupt the gameplay less, but I still feel like they might be unnecessary.\n\nPerformance wise, the game runs at a solid 60fps on the highest settings now, which I find impressive considering the plethora of issues I had on launch.\n\nAs for the dynamic content, I still feel like it leaves a fair bit to be desired - The map feels very similar, if not the same on every playthrough - Obviously level 1 is different from level 2, but level 1 feels the same on every run.\n\nThe game itself plays really well, combat feels solid and there are plenty of different ways to take out your enemies and I love the idea of it being a semi-roguelike whereby you have permadeath but you can also upgrade your abilities for your next run.\n\nOverall, a really solid title now, runs well and the gameplay is great. My only gripes are the pauses when you hit an enemy and the lack of dynamic maps, but other than that I'm not sure I can fault it. Would recommend even at full price (At the time of writing it's on sale in the summer sale so you've got no reason to not buy it), there's enough content to tide you by for your money's worth.","September 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just finished my 1st play-through and i'm very impressed. Obviously it was a little short but in open access I expect little compromises. It's a very familiar pattern to Road Rash of old with level after level of wild tracks to race. It can be quite seat of the pants type stuff at times with clever dips and rises hiding oncoming traffic, crazy debris spinning about the track, suicidal cop cars etc etc etc. It has a great structure of purchase based add-ons and experience based ones to fine tune your rider for the oncoming challenges but could really use the same to customise and personalise your bike itself. At this time, it could definitely still do with some fine tuning (for example Road Rash's agonisingly long run back to the bike after crashing would add a greater price for recklessness) but all complaints are minimal to the joy you'll get watching a man you've just kicked into oncoming traffic get wiped out by a logging truck. If it was a bigger full game with competitive online multiplayer and the tweaks ironed out it'd be a certain 8 or 9 out of ten. Great work bringing back a sorely missed classic.","June 25, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First, the game looks amazing.  Second of all, I felt like I was 5 years old playing the Classic Road Rash, but this game is balls to the wall fast, 99% faster then what I expected, the missions are somewhat difficult, but don't worry if you fail them... You can still continue but without the cash reward at the end of the race. And also, give that number a call! Ian is a very nice man. Didn't mind me calling him at quarter to four in the morning to dicuss the game! (I called thinking it was just a computer recording)\n\nThoughout my play through of the game I've only had the game crash on me twice, which is not bad, the error reports are sent when you relaunch the game.

You won't be dumping hundreds of hours into this but it's an overall good game.\n\nUpdate: 11/25/15\n\nDev snuck a big update in on me - added some assests (new ramps, new debris/vehicles on road, tunnels in maps now etc). I died in a campaign once for the first time in a while but the difficulty felt a bit forced/artifical. Once I started to really pay attention since I had been doing stupid well recently I noticed some changes:\n\n- Enemy AI riders are more aggressive. I think their health was also increased a bit or my damage went down overall. There might even be a few more of them (the "clutter" riders) then usual.\n\n- Road clutter (especially in the halluciongenic map) can be a bit overkill at times and almost seems "rigged" in a Dark Souls type sense.\n\n- Field of view. I think the FoV was limited in an attempt to make it harder to see. There are also visual effects to help limit FoV in certain spots on the maps.\n\nOverall I like the changes but feel it could be toned down just a bit. Add in a range modifer to damage on the guns and it'll be great. A difficulty and FoV slider would be a great fit as well.\n\n\n10/25/15:\n\nI've now completed the campaign ~8 times since the last major update. Game mechanics are all essentially the same. Devs say the game is harder (doesn't really need a difficulty boost IMO) but really it's just changed to be more reliant on brutality. Powerups are necessary to win (attack damage, nitro gain, max nitro, then add in some hp recovery boosts). Guns now drop from riders (don't think they did before) which is a welcome change (I still use headless horsemen skin because it's cool looking and I don't mind having less frequent gun drops). It's nice to have the "race the masters" every 3 levels removed. Game is still massively reliant on nitro and killing to replenish. AI has either improved a great deal or been given ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t advantages since it seems like it's much harder to break away from the pack now. Go slow near a pack and they slow down, use a small nitro boost near an AI enemy and they "keep up" with you etc.. seems like BS advantage. Game needs a re-focus on racing a bit more IMO.\n\nOriginal:\n\nTruthfully it's a great game but lacks depth (not a game you'll sink hundreds of hours into). If you enjoyed Road Rash at all this will definitely hit the spot for you.\n\nPros\n\n- Solid weapon selection (shottys to ak47s to shovels/katanas to c4/harpoons to grenade launchers)\n- Fun mechanics (nitro, jump jets, killing people with shovels while riding a motorcycle, harpooning people or objects and using the harpoon as a sling, attaching c4 in the middle of a group of 6 riders then nitro-boosting away.. etc)\n-"Perma-Death" system that allows you to earn XP and still keep some powerups.\n- Solid amount of upgrades\n- Combat is fun, with ability to kick, deflect, dodge, and attack\n\nNeutral\n\n- Small selection of bikes/riders\n- Small number of base maps and missions that get "randomized".. seems to be 4-5ish main maps (Not including the very cool last level) and 3 modes (kill, race, raise wanted level).\n- Guns have no range modifier (shotty/cqc weapons will do damange at range)\n\n\nCons\n\n- Driving overall could use some tweaks with more noticable differences between the bike models. The handbrake could be better as well.\n- Some levels seem to be "hard/annoying for being hards sake" - mainly the one where cars randomly fall out of the sky.\n- Certain racers do not start with you and you can see their skull icon on the length map; this seems like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t (especially only having 20 seconds to overcome guy in first).\n- Minor clipping issues on objects\n- Harpoon glitches (especially when enemies are around, will often times randomly shoot backwards or to the side)\n- When jumping bike very occasionally doesn't land correctly and drastically reduces speed\n- 18 wheel truck cabs should not be able to boost in front of me at max speed, they honestly just become annoying (agent of chaos is their point but damn).","June 27, 2015","true","38.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempprofileurl/recommended/300380/","tempprofileurl","Ben","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tempprofileurl/","2213 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOriginal review 16/42:\n\nNot now.\n\nThis has potential, yes. Currently, it's not worth your money.\n\nCurrently, there are loads of lockups which make the game practically unplayable, even on the lowest settings (This is coming from a guy who can max out Arma 3 and Battlefield 4, so no "it's your computer" comments please).\n\nI accepted this, thinking that maybe for whatever reason my i7 4770k processor wasn't powerful enough to procedurally generate the landscape quickly enough to drive on.\n\nI was wrong - This game boasts on the store page: "Lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey across the country in this procedurally-generated driving combat adventure."\n\nUh, no. One of the reasons I was interested in this is because of the procedural generation. There is NO procedural generation in this at all. After dying four times and being forced to restart the game (This isn't as annoying as it sounds, fortunately), I realised I was racing on the EXACT same stretch of road each time.\n\nGive it a while until this is in a playable state, I'll update this when a major patch comes in.\n\nUPDATE 12/10/2014: The devs have spoken to me twice about their progress and patches with the game, which I always appreciate. The latest patches seem to have introduced prcedural generation of landscapes, which is definitely a good thing.\n\nThe FPS lag remains for me, though it's definitely improved and apparently being addressed currently.\n\nAt the moment, the game still isn't exactly "playable" for me, though if you're willing to take the risk on serious performance issues, I would definitely go ahead and suggest it.\n\nUPDATE 18/05/2015 - With the game nearing what should be full release (It was meant to be Q1 2015, doesn't look like that's happened), I figured I should update this again.\n\nThe dynamic content still isn't great, the first level always looks pretty much the same, the only difference seems to be day/night.\n\nAs for FPS drops, the game in itself is much smoother but I still get lockups every time I kill an enemy.\n\nYou can also take damage for a while after passing the finish line.\n\nCurrently this is a "Meh" rather than a "Yes" or a "No", but I personally have some regrets still.\n\nUPDATE 15/06/2015: I'm changing this review to a positive one. I've spoken a number of times with the Road Redemption team who are obviously dedicated to making a good game and want to take the time to perfect it (Hence why it's still in EA, I assume).\n\nThe lockups upon killing an enemy are apparently a design decision, which I understand - The developer said that it's an idea suggested by Vlambeer to have an impact pause and camera shake when hitting an enemy. It's not something I'm a fan of personally, but as the developers it's their prerogative to do what they like with their game. They've shortened these recently, I assume to interrupt the gameplay less, but I still feel like they might be unnecessary.\n\nPerformance wise, the game runs at a solid 60fps on the highest settings now, which I find impressive considering the plethora of issues I had on launch.\n\nAs for the dynamic content, I still feel like it leaves a fair bit to be desired - The map feels very similar, if not the same on every playthrough - Obviously level 1 is different from level 2, but level 1 feels the same on every run.\n\nThe game itself plays really well, combat feels solid and there are plenty of different ways to take out your enemies and I love the idea of it being a semi-roguelike whereby you have permadeath but you can also upgrade your abilities for your next run.\n\nOverall, a really solid title now, runs well and the gameplay is great. My only gripes are the pauses when you hit an enemy and the lack of dynamic maps, but other than that I'm not sure I can fault it. Would recommend even at full price (At the time of writing it's on sale in the summer sale so you've got no reason to not buy it), there's enough content to tide you by for your money's worth.","September 19, 2014","true","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just finished my 1st play-through and i'm very impressed. Obviously it was a little short but in open access I expect little compromises. It's a very familiar pattern to Road Rash of old with level after level of wild tracks to race. It can be quite seat of the pants type stuff at times with clever dips and rises hiding oncoming traffic, crazy debris spinning about the track, suicidal cop cars etc etc etc. It has a great structure of purchase based add-ons and experience based ones to fine tune your rider for the oncoming challenges but could really use the same to customise and personalise your bike itself. At this time, it could definitely still do with some fine tuning (for example Road Rash's agonisingly long run back to the bike after crashing would add a greater price for recklessness) but all complaints are minimal to the joy you'll get watching a man you've just kicked into oncoming traffic get wiped out by a logging truck. If it was a bigger full game with competitive online multiplayer and the tweaks ironed out it'd be a certain 8 or 9 out of ten. Great work bringing back a sorely missed classic.","June 25, 2015","true","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First, the game looks amazing.  Second of all, I felt like I was 5 years old playing the Classic Road Rash, but this game is balls to the wall fast, 99% faster then what I expected, the missions are somewhat difficult, but don't worry if you fail them... You can still continue but without the cash reward at the end of the race. And also, give that number a call! Ian is a very nice man. Didn't mind me calling him at quarter to four in the morning to dicuss the game! (I called thinking it was just a computer recording)\n\nThoughout my play through of the game I've only had the game crash on me twice, which is not bad, the error reports are sent when you relaunch the game. The Missions are a little repitive but still none the less pretty difficult, and the controlls are SOLID (I perfer using the gamepad, but use the keyboard and mouse if you want to use the guns, and rifles)\n\n10/10 would HIGHLY reccommend if you want a casual, hardcore arcade-ish feeling racing game!\n\nA few things I would LOVE to see in the final build of the game....\n\nBike customization, Story line, few cutscenes here and there, and more areas to play!","June 26, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The models aren’t the best (especially the collision models); it’s poorly optimized, there are no key re-bindings… but above all, it’s still a blast to play. The level design is great, the combat system is like Road Rash on steroids, the weapon selection is massive ( who doesn’t love taking someone out with a claymore, mace, or harpoon gun?), and the developers actually care about feedback. For a measly $12 I got to spend a night with my best friend barreling through deserts, forests, and rooftops all while beating and shooting our way to victory.

The Developers so far appear dedicated and I can't wait to enjoy the fully polished version. Fans of this game will find plenty to enjoy here, and if you enjoyed racing or motrbike games, then give it a shot.

I also backed the game on Kickstarter.\n\nFirst impressions: so far this game has done a remarkable job of making the "road rash" style game work.  I've only played the first few levels so I can't say anything about the later levels, but the opening levels seem rather short.\n\nThe least "road rashy" thing about this game so far is the use of guns and bombs, though that's not entirely a bad thing.  It's great fun to ride up next to someone, tag them with C4 and then ride away as they blow up.  It's also great fun to raise the cop level by going on a gun rampage.  So far though, these are extremely powerful and should be something you achieve by doing something awesome (like maybe causing a 5 bike pileup or booting the lead racer off a bridge).\n\nKicking bikes and hitting them with pipes so far reminds me A LOT of the original Road Rash game.  That game made you work to achieve a weapon though (usually by grabbing it out of the hands of someone else) whereas this game gives you a weapon right at the start.  I think I preferred earning the weapon through gameplay.\n\nSome of the racing aspects of the game seem like it needs work.  Making turns doesn't feel as good as it should, and I'm not fond of the way the game lets me accidentally change the direction I'm looking (it should nearly always snap back to straight ahead).   Also there's a lot more bikes on the road than just racers so I'm not sure why that is exactly.  Road rash seemed like it was a racing game with some combat thrown in, not a combat game with some racing thrown in.\n\nAll in all though, this game is off to a very good start.  I look forward to seeing it develop into a more refined version of what we have now.    Also for $20 you can hardly say no.  I seem to remember the original Road Rash costing $40 back in the late 80s (which would be about $70 now).  This game is dirt cheap by comparison, though there's no soundtrack by Soundgarden or whatever...\n\nI'll update this review as I get farther into the game and as more changes are made in future updates.","October 5, 2014","true","2.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Opponents tend to home in on you more and difficulty has been slightly increased later on but this is all good as balance is better early game. Upgrades mean a lot to you late game. All in all this is now easily 8 or 9/10 now.\n\n\nShortly this game is a 7/10 In it's current state and already a pretty solid recommendation. It is however a game in early access and has potential for a much higher score after some alterations to the game. So lets list the good and the bad:\n\nGood:\n- So how many Sega Road Rash -type of games have you seen lately? In 2015 the concept is looking quite fresh.\n- Good action. Satisfying violence.  Speed!\n- Experience points that can be distributed to skills permanently.\n- Experience points that can be used to get upgrades that are in effect until you die.\n\nBad:\n- This is one of those games where the AI is right behind you and if you make a mistake late on a course it's all over in a blink.  Luckily some mistakes are allowed if you are not that far into a race and your hitpoints allow you to continue.\n- Random nature of the maps underscores the importance of luck sometimes quite a lot unfortunately. It is common to grind one level a long time until that one time the stars are aligned correctly and you clear it flawlessly.\n- Bugs, glitches. Not that many and not that critical. But railings on the bridge are very bugged as they are there pretty much just for show. Also the ground under bridges are the best places to make the game glitch so bad you fall trought the ground into the void.\n- It is possible to stop from full speed to zero in an instant and get stuck on things near the road or civilian cars that drive on the road. I was not amused when i got hooked on a car for a long time unable to get off. Quit button solved that one.\n- Restart button missing. Essential function in any racing game. Put on the Road -button is there but it's not the same nor does it work most of the time until you are very deep outside the road. (and guaranteed to loose the race at that point).\n- Experience point system could use a closer look. Loosing all XP in certain situations ensure there is extra grind that does not help. Even keeping small amounts of XP after every game would help.","September 29, 2015","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However, the devs are releasing updates quite frequently (every 2-3 days) and they're taking seriously the customers' responses and actively participating in the forum too.\n\nThis game is a motorcycle-action game, similar to the old Road Rash games, but in a modern form and improved with several great ideas. The graphics is beautiful and meets all modern requirements a game needs today. The controls are very responsive, and easy to get used to it, however you'll need both your hands, because the action buttons are on the mouse (if you play it with keyboard and mouse of course).\n\nThere are several "game modes" (inside campaign and campaign+ and competitive is coming too) and those are varying map by map, for example takedowns, attract police, "simple" race, race on rooftops, takedowns without weapons, etc... There are at least a dozen weapon from tire iron, through battle axe, to the AK47 and the devs are promised there will be more.

My friend and I played this on splitscreen for about two and a half hours, but we never felt invested like in the old games. Nothing we did felt particularly meaningful, starting with the character select screen where we had to pick identical characters and bikes. The way the races end is incredibly jarring. As soon as one player crosses the finish line, the level just ends. The second player cannot finish the race, there's no fan-fare, no overview of the race, and no trash-talking bikers. Also, none of the levels feel very distinct from one another. No kangaroos jumping out at you or hitch hikers to run over. Just a generic weaving three-lane highway that seems to loop back on itself ad nauseum (on account of proceedural generated levels, the geography of this game is kinda messed up). The upgrade system feels meaningless as well. You can choose from a number of boxes with static bonuses, as opposed to RR3 where it was all about saving up for that sweet new bike, then decking out the tires and suspension. Jumps also don't do much. In RR3 you'd go off a jump and fly off the f-ing screen. In this there's barely any air or any other real reason to hit a jump. The weapon degradation system is similarly meaningless. You come across weapons so frequently and carry around such a large inventory that you'll never go wanting. In the old games, stealing a pair of nunchucks felt like a huge accomplishment. The police don't do much in this. They won't run you off the road and bust you. They're more there for lip service I guess. I also don't understand why there are so many armed motorcyclists, but only some of them are in the race. I suppose one of my biggest beefs is that the campaign never makes you feel like you're accomplishing anything. In RR3, getting through Japan on level 5 while riding a super bike was a huge feat.\n\nI know the game isn't finished, but I can't really recommend it in its current incarnation. I hope it touches up on some of the areas I've discussed. The combat system is fairly satisfying. Grabbing other riders and driving off cliffs is hilarious. I like the detours. Fighting semi trucks is ♥♥♥♥ed lol. I'd probably be way less critical if I wasn't a huge RR3 fan. Despite my numerous criticisms, I seriously admire what they're trying to do here.","January 10","false","2.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

At times it's frustratingly difficult, but that just makes the times you make it through all the more special. I would name myself a jaded gamer, I struggle to find as much joy with games these days. However this little gem of a game has come along and helped me rediscover a bit of gaming joy.\n\nThere's a definite feeling of speed, and both the combat and dodging of obstacles can give that on-edge feeling where your breath stops for just a moment as you wait those milliseconds to see if you edged it.\n\nThere's rightly a lot of comparisons to Road Rash, but this game stands out on its own merit. It has a whackyness that surpasses the prior game, and the feeling of progression is different as well, at least in this early access edition. Road rash felt more gradual, whereas this game throws you right into things. Said progression is a bit strange in Road Redemption, but it has its own charm if you have the patience.\n\nThe game still needs work, there are some strange occurances and the odd crash, but the patches have been coming thick and fast and I am confident it will only get better.

The game is a procedurally generated racing action game. There are multiple types of missions, including takedowns, cop attraction, race against bikers or race against time...\n\nIn the game you get a huge arsenal of weapons: baseball bats, pipes, swords, machine guns, grenade launchers, axes...\nThe driving is really arcady and the attack buttons have to be pressed moments before hitting the opponents, similarly to the whip in Castlevania. The AI works really well, and gets more and more challenging as you go on. In the four areas of the game (desert, rooftops, snowy mountain and a bonus one), there are multiple hazards (like traffic and buildings) or variables (like car rain).\n\nAnother great aspect of the game is the soundtrack: it is really energetic and fits the game like a glove.\n\nThere are, however, some problems related to the performance: in some tracks, especially the first one, the framerate drops at 6fps. The developer have assured that they are working on fixing these issues.\n\nOverall, this is one of the most action packed racing games I've ever played, it gets constantly updated by the developers and it will feature additional content such as competitive gameplay, character customization and more weapons. One of the best Early Access games to support.\n\nSCORE: 90/100","October 9, 2014","true","7.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

It has all the replayable fun of Nintendo's Excitebike, except it's a modern 3D game with all the related perks. I'm not sure I would pay full price for it just yet though. Maybe wait for more updates to prove the value, or look for a sale.","March 14, 2015","true","0.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game has some similarities to Road Rash but has a lot of unique featuers as well, such as vertical jump jets on your bikes in the city rooftop level, and a Just Cause 2 style hook shot thing. The game is also somewhat Roguelike-ish in how it plays, with perma death on your rider, but also letting you upgrade your character for the next attempt.\n\nI've played it before and loaded it up again after multiple updates and found the game is even better than I remember. The graphics are great and with updates the performance issues are greatly improved. The music is fantastic and gets you pumped for kicking ♥♥♥ on the streets, and the sound effects have been improved and are even better now.\n\nOh yeah, you can race as Shovel Knight now, awesome!\n\nGreat variety of weapons, melee as well as guns & even C4. The guns are a little hard to control while trying to maintain your place on the road and not wipe out in a corner or on some ♥♥♥♥♥ driving their car into you, hopefully things improve on the guns and aiming. I'm not really worried though, because every time I go back to play this it has been updated and is even better than before.\n\nStill waiting on the multiplayer, and I think that will be incredible when it comes in.\nThe game itself is fun to play and even has up to 4 player local co-op, but the campaign still feels a bit lacking. I'm not sure what it is, but it needs something to tie the races together, a story or something.\n\nYou are racing and it's great fun, but you don't really know why you are racing, and the levels - while being fun - don't segway into each other and feel like instead of doing a campaign you have to do 10 random levels then do the last level. I am certain this will be address in the final version, and it is still in early access, so we'll just have to wait and see.\n\nAll that said, this game is awesome. If you liked Road Rash, and you also like Roguelike games, this is a gooder!\nIf you're not into early access, than definitely come back and check it out after the full release.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/uP5QhklnoWs","January 19, 2015","true","3.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It has all the feelings of classic Road Rash (this is coming from a Sega Genesis veteran who by the way was decently disturbed by the violence in the game when I was 4)...\n\n...and this violence is understandably much worse in this modern day game (not in a bad way)... it has a decent amount of blood and a sort of disturbing sound effect when the melee weapon cracks against the body of an opponent. Yes it's disturbing, but it kind of puts a moral urgency on whether or not you want to violently and bloodily slam someone off of their bike and probably maim them for life. But I don't want to make it seem like the violence is overwhelming. It's just enough to be funny and in your face but not overdone.\n\nImmediately fun, easy controls, and it has an interesting old school game path where you progress through levels and if you die you have to start over. Kind of gives you more of an initiative to keep playing, I feel.\n\nSure I've only played a half hour so I can't know for sure about replayability or longevity, but I'm sure when online multiplayer is released it will be a huge plus, not to mention local split screen co-op which I've also been scarcely pleased with on Steam for a year.\n\nGreat game!","March 1, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Good ol' fashioned video game fun right here folks. I absolutely loved the original Road Rash series, and this makes me smile just like it did. Motorcycles, cattle prods, and grenade launchers...what's not to love?\n\nThe developers continue to improve the gameplay, and those sloppy controls/graphics/physics I mentioned are being improved upon as the weeks pass. I just did a playthrough on 7/20/15, and the graphics/controls are definitely better than when I first played the game in February.

The physics have been made more realistic as well, although there are a few hiccups at times when I'm pretty sure I pass straight through objects. More than anything, I just hope multiplayer gets added (I'd love to have co-op, cracking skulls on motorcycles with a friend? Yes, please).\n\nAt this point, it's worth at least a solid 15-20 hours of single player gameplay. Is that worth $20 bucks? For me, yes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/recommended/300380/","toad004","toad_004","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toad004/","199 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is the type of game that makes me question steam's binary review system - you either give thumbs up or thumbs down, neither of which conveys my feelings about this game. Then again, it's still an improvement from steam's old system, which didn't even have a "no" option at all!\n\nSo, on to Road Redemption. This game is a spiritual successor to EA's Road Rash series of games, so the main game play consists of beating the crap out of your fellow bikers and trying to be the first to the finish line. But this isn't just a re-skin of road rash with modern graphics. Combat is effectively required, as some missions flat out require you to eliminate enough enemies to advance. But all the missions (save the pure time trials) require plenty of fighting. Taking down another racer will knock them out of the race, and taking down almost anyone will restore some health and nitro, as well as reward some money and their weapon.\n\nIt's no surprise then, that the developers took care to make the fighting the single best part of the game. There's a lot of depth to the combat, from kicks and grabs to baseball bats and pistols. Kicks and grabs are good for steering someone into an oncoming car or forcing them off a cliff. Melee weapons vary in speed, strength, and durability - for instance, shovels are strong but slow, while bats are weaker but faster. Swords break easily but are both fast and strong. Then you have the guns, ranging from pistols to Uzis and grenade launchers. They are great for shooting other bikers from a distance. Finally, you can deflect an attack from an enemy - if done right it blocks the attack and makes your next attack very powerful.\n\nThere are various missions and various conditions to preform them under. Most of these are fun, such as eliminataing a certain number of enemies, or attracting police attention. However, the 'time trial' missions lack the fun factor present in the other mission types. They are the only missions with no one to fight, and it seems that there's no reason for these missions to be here, other than "a racing game needs time trials"! Many also cannot stand the 'car rain' missions, where cars literally rain down from the sky and crash into the ground. They'd be pretty fun if it wasn't for the pure randomness of it - it's possible for a car to land right in your way (or otherwise bounce or slide in your wary) with no chance to react, causing an instant crash and a loss of some health.\n\nLosing health is a big deal, because unlike in the road rash games where zero health meant losing a few positions, in Road Redemption it's an instant game over! This is the most drastic departure from the classics, where the only way to lose was inability to pay for your wrecked bike or a ticket form the cops. Death means starting back from square one, except for the skills you purchase with XP, which you get to retain between playthroughs. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as the skills are fairly neat. But it may tick of long-time rashers who just wanted to relive the classics.\n\nThe game's actual problem lies in it's lack of content. I was able to complete everything this game has to offer within 3.1 hours, according to steam. At present, the campaign is comprised of 12 levels with randomly generated missions, and there is a harder campaign+ which is the same, just harder. There is no story to speak of, and the only multiplayer is local split-screen co-op. This is what made the game so hard to recommenced - 3.1 hours does not justify the game's $19.99 price tag - even if it were 75% off, that's well over a dollar an hour! So why then, is there blue, rather than red, at the top of this review?\n\nMy final recommendation arises not from what this game currently is, but from what it can be in the future. This game's Greenlight page gives a description of a story featuring multiple outcomes depending on your actions, as well as facing betrayal from your gang, and leading your own gang at some point later in the plot. This story mode alone would be worth the price if added to the already outstanding gameplay,  but the developer seems to be active in the forums and seems to express a desire to add plenty of other content, and already has added quite a bit since early access release. Based on what this game can become, I ultimately must recommend this game.\n\nI must make sure to revisit this review in the future once the game is completed, whenever that may be.\n\nUPDATE: Road Redemption has undergone an engine change. Historically, an engine change mid development results in classic games like Daikatana and Duke Nukem Forever. Thankfully, this game may be an exception to the rule.\n\nThe boring time trial missions appear to have been removed entirely while the car rain missions (referred in-game as "Hallucinogenic chemical zone") have been altered so that cars are always avoidable. In addition, one new track was actually added to the game\n\nGraphics were mildly improved with the engine change. I've been informed that performance has improved though I cannot confirm as my current PC is far over recommended specs. They've been able to add in more traffic and more racers as well - a welcome addition. Jump Jets now have a meter of their own, and only appear on the rooftop missions.\n\nThe only downside to this change (or perhaps I simply missed this flaw before) is that unaligned traffic seems to target the player despite being supposedly unaligned.","December 21, 2014","true","8.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They know how to take feedback, no matter how negative it is. My first review was extremely negative but not only was I contacted by the devs (like, through Steam chat directly) but they have made many of the changes both I and other critics suggested. The game has gone from Lunacy Racer, which it was originally, to something akin to Road Rash. And you know what? It is a lot of fun. It’s a great Early Access title that really does test your skill and shock you with bone-crunching crashes when that skill fails.\n\nIt is still lacking a few elements including context for the missions (why are we trying to raise our Police Wanted Level) and store prices (why does a strip of beef jerky cost $500) but these 'flaws' can be excused as they are still developing the game. And make no mistake – they are developing it. It has come a long way since those early days.\n\nIf you are interested in a very violent motorbike racing game full of shocking crashes and satisfying ‘skull-cracking’ combat, this is the game for you.

It was nostalgic and fun from the start, the improvement has been steady and often lately. My character is all maxed out now so the experience points are useless, but I feel like the fun will always be there(especially if/when they add multiplayer!). I'm a stickler for surround sound, so I'm hoping they plan to polish it enough to include that. However, I got my money's worth a long time ago as far I'm concerned.\n\nIf it were me developing it, I'd make it so it went full screen after someone dies during split-screen gameplay.

As far as I know you can't get busted when you wreck by a cop which really takes the thrill out of taking down the cop before he takes you down, really the cops in this game are just like any other biker just with a different skin. You pretty much start every mission with a weapon instead of having to earn it by grabbing one from an opponent so that old feeling of "♥♥♥♥ YEAH I JUST GOT THE CHAIN!!!!" is gone. You no longer have to run to your bike after you wreck which I'm not quite sure is a bad thing or not yet. So far it is feeling more like the crappy GBA version more than the awesome genesis/3DO versions of road rash. Like I said it is still definitely fun and still worth getting but I feel let down compared to my expectations, hopefully when this game is fully released the modding comunity will come up with something to make it feel more like classic road rash.

A very close comparison to Road Rash, which I enjoyed a lot.  It is a extremely frustrating game (expect to die a lot), so this is sort of like Dark Souls on bikes.\n\nIt is a satisfying feeling to kick a biker off a bridge, or kick them into oncoming traffic.  I can imagine how the multiplayer would be.\n\nSo far, there are more pros than cons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jveezy/recommended/300380/","jveezy","jveezy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jveezy/","324 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game. Oh man. If you loved Road Rash but thought that maybe it could use a bit more variety, maybe a larger assortment of weapons or some different missions besides racing, then you will love this game. This game is an absolute blast.\n\nBored with hitting other riders with bats? How about a shovel? Or a pipe wrench? Oh, blunt objects not doing it for you? HOW ABOUT A SWORD? Don't want to melee? HOW ABOUT A MACHINE GUN? Not powerful enough? HOW ABOUT A GRENADE LAUNCHER? Or have some C4 and reach into the cars that are trying to take you down (yes, some of your enemies are cars instead of just bikes) and stick some C4 in the passenger seat and watch it explode a few seconds later. You'll have more fun attacking other riders than you ever did before. I hope the developers are also going to allow people to mod custom weapons and maps to provide even more variety.\n\nThe difficulty is just challenging enough that the game is fun and easy to grow into but not so easy that it's boring. With so many weapons, it's not easy to master the timing and mechanics of each weapon, and weapon deterioration makes it so you have to learn to use different weapons properly. I struggled a little bit with using the mouse to control the camera while racing, especially around corners. That's not a problem when using a controller, but then trying to aim a gun with the right thumbstick while still controlling the bike properly becomes the challenge. It's difficult, but not something that I didn't noticably improve on after a couple hours of gameplay.\n\nThe physics aren't all that realistic, though I don't exactly expect them to be. This is an arcade game and not a strict simulation, and the explosions and crashes are accordingly over the top and cartoonish in the best way. Some of the more nitpicky quirks are that you can avoid a complete wipeout when hitting something (especially on the side of the road) simply by braking or letting off the throttle. You'll just hit something and then stop immediately but not crash. That also applies to big crashes in the middle of the road. I've been sandwiched by two vehicles, but just by not accelerating, I can practically surf the wreckage and leave unscathed. It certainly doesn't bother me as a new player, since I have no problem finding plenty of other ways to wreck myself, but it might become more annoying as I grow into a less idiotic rider.\n\nMaybe this is just personal preference, but I would also like to see some longer maps, and maybe an actual minimap in the corner instead of a progress bar. Driving through the city in Road Rash was also fun, and this was something I didn't see in this game (other than the rooftop map, which is a nice, though sometimes frustrating, addition). I would love to see some maps that mix intracity and intercity roads, but I know the developers are hard at work on a lot of other requests. Tunnels are also another racing game staple that aren't in the game yet that I would love to see. Also, if the developers ever put together some sort of map where the course manages to travel THROUGH some buildings, I might just buy this game for all of my friends who want it (I can dream, can't I?).\n\nOverall, I'm going to be playing a lot of this game, especially as the developers keep adding more to it. It's very well-polished for an early access game, and I can't wait to see what else gets added. I already have a few friends that are itching to play this in online multiplayer, and I can't wait to strap some C4 to their bikes and kick them off the road.","September 26, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No, not really but it showed potential to be a good game with the insanity that it tossed at you and for me was worth the purchase since I don't mind risking a bit of money here and there on unfinished products so long as the developer or publisher have not had issues with delievering with this model before (Double Fine). It is now further into "Early Access" and I can safely say that even if it doesn't gain much from what it is currently it is worth picking up as long as your not on a really tight budget, it controls great and doesn't fail to toss insanity at you around every bin.\n\nMy only major complaint about it in its current state is that a lot of the races are mostly on one of two over used tracks, it would be nice to see a bit more varriety in the tracks though you don't really mind it to much when its litteritly raining cars down onto the track as cars drive any which way on the road creating massive wreaks to try to drive through while you try to kill rival gang member and come in 1st in a race all at the same time, or try to take down 7 rival gang members as you hop from building to building with a jet jump and grapling hook to get around.\n\nOnly buy the game if you don't mind buying incomplete products hoping they don't drop the ball, don't mind seeing the same track many times, and like stupid levels of insanity in your games. Don't buy the game (yet) if you mind buying incomplete products, hate seeing the same track over and over even if it feels different each time with different challenges and AI to complete and deal with (traffic on the right side only, traffic on both sides going the right way, traphic on both sides going in random directions causing massive wreaks, traffic raining from the sky are but a few of the ways that the level can be the same but different), or if you like regular racing games because this games appeal is the insanity so don't expect any of the races to be fair or something you can memorize.\n","September 24, 2014","true","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

However that only existed for the evening, and the next morning I was able to start playing.\n\nNow I'm not a very good gamer, being honest, and this game offers a respectable challenge. But I've had so much fun already. I've only reached level 6 (not sure how many there are) and once you die,  you have to restart. However it's not as bad as it seems. After each successful level you get cash to spend on extra weapons, food and the like. Cash and purchased items only last until you die. When you die you get experience earned to spend on permanent upgrades. These include extra health, more weapon durablity/ammunition and extra lives etc. There's a decent sized tech tree to unlock. So each time you fail you're made a little stronger for the next attempt.\n\nIf you've played Road Rash then you're familiar with the style of play; fast-action racing with lots of cars and other bikers, all kicking, punching and smacking each other over the road (and over cliffs as well) trying to win the race. There are also guns and explosions, cars flying everywhere, enemy police bikes/cars and other car racers fighting you, taxis on skyscraper rooves and I'm sure some of the ambient traffic tries to take you out too!\n\nThe devs have named some of the enemy bikers after popular youtubers/streamers such as TotalBiscuit, Pewdiepie and Spoony, which I chuckled at.\n\nNow of course there are bugs (had one where I levitated at the side of a building after falling over the edge) and in general it lacks polish. The devs have promised a competitive multiplayer/pvp mode at launch, which should be fun... though I'll die instantly probably!\n\nAll in all, you can replay the same few levels over n over and have a lot of fun. It's not a game you'll be able to play for thousands of hours unless you're really good at the pvp mode, but you'll certainly get your money's worth for just £14, and once completed, it'll be something I come back to every now and again for a quick blast of fun.","September 19, 2014","true","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Did you like it? If so then this game is for you. Buy it immediately.\n\nThis game takes Road Rash, a motorcycle racing game with violence, gives it more modern graphics, and then kicks it up a few notches. It's got all the basics. Bludgeoning your enemies, kicking them into oncoming traffic, grabbing them and forcing them into obstacles, shooting them, etc. All your normal, violent, motorcycle race needs. But that's just the beginning.\n\nA few levels in you might experience cars dropping from the sky. Why? Hell if I know. But man does it cause a lot of destruction. On level 4 your bike gets Jump Jets. Congratulations, you can now jump several dozen feet in the air. Sound crazy? It's not. Mostly it's just useful. It's also fun as hell. Beginning on Level 5 you start racing across skyscraper rooftops, and yes, it's as fun as it sounds. More fun in fact because you get a grappling hook that allows you to swing your way to victory. The only downside is that it's a bit hard to use. But when you do use it, man do you soar through the air.\n\nAnd it just keeps going. The current last level is fantastic. I shall refrain from spoiling it and just say that it is a racing game classic and everyone will get a kick out of it. Or hate it. But in a loving, nostailgic way. Future updates will provide more levels I assume.\n\nAs far as mechanics go, it's decently solid. There's an upgrade system, and a shop. You only keep your money and shop items until you die, but upgrades are permenant. Most controls aren't explained super well, but a quick look at the pause menu will give you all you need.\n\nI decided to leave the things I didn't like for last, mostly because some if not all of them are likely to change.\n\n-I'm not sure how keyboard/mouse controls are, so I would look into that if you don't have a controller.\n-The game lags severely on my lower end machine. Going off of looks alone it shouldn't be lagging so bad. Either there's a LOT of computing going on or it's just unoptimized. Hopefully that gets better.\n-Cars are too strong on early levels where you have weaker weapons. They force you off the road and while you can melee or shoot them, it takes a decent amount depending on the car. Especially police cars.\n-Aiming mode camera needs to have an option to snapback to default\n\n\nAll in all it's a good damn game. You should check it out.","September 29, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are an array of weapons that can be used from a board w/ a nail in it to an AK-47.\n\nThis is early access so expect bugs and not a ton of content besides weapons.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/recommended/300380/","polly_s_hate","Polly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/","407 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn its current state (ver 0.816) Road Redemption is a solid idea that very much needs some more time in the oven if it wants to earn the high pricetag the final version is said to be. The Road Rash roots are clear as day with high-speed motorcycle action fused with a combat system that has just the right amount of depth, but the execution doesn't feel quite right yet.\n\nThe game's Campaign modes offer a series of randomized challenges. During each session of a Campaign run, you'll earn money which you can use between stages to give yourself certain advantages for THAT PLAYTRHOUGH ONLY, such as doubling your money and temporary health boosts. Once you die you receive experience based on your performance to invest in another set of upgrades that are permanent and carry over into each new playthrough. The idea is solid and incentivizes you to keep going because with each run there's potential to better prepare yourself for the next run. It's a smart gameplay loop that's rewarding and fun to engage with.\n\nThe riding mechanics and combat are fairly easy to engage with. Riding has a very arcade-styled feel to it and it's relatively eas yto pick up and play. Combat has a surprising amount of depth, though it's still very possible to play thorugh the game never engaging with the advanced techniques like grabbing and deflecting attacks. The basics are here and they're very close to feeling complete. With a bit more polish, Road Redemption will be just as fun and engaging as its inspiration.\n\nThat said, the biggest issues Road Redemption faces right now are largely performance and balance related.  Depending on your setup, the game will either run like a dream or drop frames at an alarming rate when things get too hectic. This is obviously VERY bad for a game that can sometimes call for some tight precision in order to stay on your bike. The game's difficulty is all over the place, with a dynamic range of "a bit too easy" to "completely unfair." Since all of the game's stages and objectives are randomly chosen, difficulty fluctuates wildly and it can only take VERY little for a good run to be a total wash in mere seconds. The rubberbanding of enemies feels a bit on the ridiculous side at the moment, and certain objectives simply DO NOT WORK with certain types of stages. Anything involving the "raining cars" gimmick feels much too chaotic right now, and rooftop stages that involve forcing the player to eliminate a certain number of enemies or dodging oncoming traffic (ON ROOFTOPS) just aren't quite there yet and often feel unfair and frustrating.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment is that while the permanence aspects of the game are fun to engage with, the current Campaign mode feels more like an extra mode than what would be the meat and potatoes of a full game. With only this type of Campaign mode, the game as a whole begins to feel kind of empty. I can't help but feel the game would benefit from a larger scale Campaign similar to the Road Rash games, where upgrading and buying new bikes made you feel more connected to each playthrough. It's also a bummer that the game lacks any real sense of character or attitude like those older games did as well.\n\nIn its current state, Road Redemption has quite a bit going for it, but if it's going to jump in price after release as the store page claims, then there really needs to be more than what there is now. What's there now is still very playable and fun, but there's still quite a bit of tweaking that needs to be done and content really needs boost.\n\nI can only VERY CAUTIOUSLY recommend this game as it is right now. I've had a good deal of fun with it, and if the final product manages to expand on the ideas presented now and fixes some of the balance issues, I'd say Road Redemption will be quite the treat for those who've been thirsty for motorcycle racing and combat.","October 11, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Still, it's Early Access and the menu graphics are really unimportant to how fun it is to drive around and smash things up.\n\nIt's pretty easy to run off-road and it's very unrealistic when it happens. Crashing on the road is pretty easy, but crashing into terrain is surprisingly hard. But it's Early Access, so they might fix this.\n\nNo ability to remap the controls with an XBox controller.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/recommended/300380/","wirdjos5","Wirdjos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wirdjos5/","89 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI expected the speed and the violence. On the store page, Road Redemption looks like a sort of Mario Kart meets Sons of Anarchy mash-up. What I was not prepared for was the extra depth of the rogue-like packaging it would come in. A single crash won't take you out of the race, but if your lifebar is drained, either by too many wipeouts or by other bikers, that's it. That campaign run is over and any winnings are left behind. Experience, however, which is accumulated over the course of the run, can only be used at its conclusion. That experience is used to purchase permanent perks which make your future bikers stronger and net you more money and/or more experience in future runs. After those perks are purchased, the experience total from that run is wiped away and you start from scratch, plus those permanent perks of course. The speed, the violence, and the adrenaline all make for an entertaining experience on their own, but past that, what really stuck me about Road Redemption is that I only started winning races once I noticed that the other cars on the road actually follow normal traffic patterns - as much as one can with motorcycles flying around every which-a-way of course. That means that the most obstacle-free places to travel, and thus the fastest, are the medians. You can jockey around cars as long as you understand that oncoming traffic needs to be avoided differently than the traffic you're following, but you'll only be able to relax and build speed safely once you've returned to a median. It's a surprisingly realistic situation for a game that revolves around swinging an ax or firing a grenade launcher from a speeding motorcycle.","September 29, 2015","true","23.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/recommended/300380/","polly_s_hate","Polly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polly_s_hate/","407 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIn its current state (ver 0.816) Road Redemption is a solid idea that very much needs some more time in the oven if it wants to earn the high pricetag the final version is said to be. The Road Rash roots are clear as day with high-speed motorcycle action fused with a combat system that has just the right amount of depth, but the execution doesn't feel quite right yet.\n\nThe game's Campaign modes offer a series of randomized challenges. During each session of a Campaign run, you'll earn money which you can use between stages to give yourself certain advantages for THAT PLAYTRHOUGH ONLY, such as doubling your money and temporary health boosts. Once you die you receive experience based on your performance to invest in another set of upgrades that are permanent and carry over into each new playthrough. The idea is solid and incentivizes you to keep going because with each run there's potential to better prepare yourself for the next run. It's a smart gameplay loop that's rewarding and fun to engage with.\n\nThe riding mechanics and combat are fairly easy to engage with. Riding has a very arcade-styled feel to it and it's relatively eas yto pick up and play. Combat has a surprising amount of depth, though it's still very possible to play thorugh the game never engaging with the advanced techniques like grabbing and deflecting attacks. The basics are here and they're very close to feeling complete. With a bit more polish, Road Redemption will be just as fun and engaging as its inspiration.\n\nThat said, the biggest issues Road Redemption faces right now are largely performance and balance related.  Depending on your setup, the game will either run like a dream or drop frames at an alarming rate when things get too hectic. This is obviously VERY bad for a game that can sometimes call for some tight precision in order to stay on your bike. The game's difficulty is all over the place, with a dynamic range of "a bit too easy" to "completely unfair." Since all of the game's stages and objectives are randomly chosen, difficulty fluctuates wildly and it can only take VERY little for a good run to be a total wash in mere seconds. The rubberbanding of enemies feels a bit on the ridiculous side at the moment, and certain objectives simply DO NOT WORK with certain types of stages. Anything involving the "raining cars" gimmick feels much too chaotic right now, and rooftop stages that involve forcing the player to eliminate a certain number of enemies or dodging oncoming traffic (ON ROOFTOPS) just aren't quite there yet and often feel unfair and frustrating.\n\nPerhaps the biggest disappointment is that while the permanence aspects of the game are fun to engage with, the current Campaign mode feels more like an extra mode than what would be the meat and potatoes of a full game. With only this type of Campaign mode, the game as a whole begins to feel kind of empty. I can't help but feel the game would benefit from a larger scale Campaign similar to the Road Rash games, where upgrading and buying new bikes made you feel more connected to each playthrough. It's also a bummer that the game lacks any real sense of character or attitude like those older games did as well.\n\nIn its current state, Road Redemption has quite a bit going for it, but if it's going to jump in price after release as the store page claims, then there really needs to be more than what there is now. What's there now is still very playable and fun, but there's still quite a bit of tweaking that needs to be done and content really needs boost.\n\nI can only VERY CAUTIOUSLY recommend this game as it is right now. I've had a good deal of fun with it, and if the final product manages to expand on the ideas presented now and fixes some of the balance issues, I'd say Road Redemption will be quite the treat for those who've been thirsty for motorcycle racing and combat.","October 11, 2014","true","19.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The only problem i had with the controls was the aiming with a gun, it seems very hard while controlling your bike and looking out for other cars. For $19.99 though? Uhm.. I'm not sure, it's quite expensive for an Arcade game. However, within the game itself i had no visual problems or bugs it ran solidly on my 5 year old computer.  So all i can say is, if you have the money get it. It's fun and you wont regret, however because of the price, if you're looking for a game around the $19.99 range i'd say hold off until it gets some more features.\n\n8/10, solid gameplay and controls but for the price it may be too expensive for the average gamer.","October 1, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Doing it this way means that both the people are happy to recieve a free game and test it for them, and the dev team are happy to recieve the reviews and attention the game needs, that's PRO advertising right there. Contracts to give good reviews risks harming your company label when people reveal your corruption *cough EA cough﻿*\n\nSo firstly i would like to say Thank You devs for allowing me to check out your game!\nThis review is totally unbiast and simply my OWN opinion :)\n\n--Basic Review--\nAs you may have already gotten from the Steam Videos, this game involves you riding around on a motorcycle in an infinitely generating world, where the track can take you anywhere from rooftops to the dusty deserts. Map generation is absolutely gorgeous as twisty hills and traps are generated all over the place, including hazardous traffic. Immidiately i was having flashbacks to an awesome game back on the Amiga and other consoles of my childhood, because as you, on your bike meet up with opponent racers with a 'Catch-Up' speed system, and knock them off their bikes with swinging a lead pipe to their faces...my childhood heart started pumping again as it felt like Road Rash was finally coming back to me, the game i had always wanted to be re-made.\n\nThe game is VERY familiar to Road Rash players, but it goes so much further than that, with the ability to ride an upgraded bike that can jump into the air with booster jets, and swing from helicopters with a hookshot. Even the Cars can sometimes be your greatest opponents in this game as they too, compete against you in many campaign missions.\n\nWeaponry involves many melee weapons of different ranges and different strengths all the way to UZi submachine guns and grenade launchers, but here-in comes one of the greatest issues of the game at least as a PC user, KeyBoard and Mouse controls are VERY difficult to master as they become extremely twisty and you havent enough ability to drive, aim, attack, handbrake and all the rest at the same time. It is hard to play (but manageable) with a keyboard and mouse, but ultimately this is a game for a Controller. I Highly advise you grab a dual-analog controller and plug it in to maximize your control here. WASD is not very good at how sensitive you should steer your bike and you are going to need to drive with all of your skills here as the difficulty is quite high.\n\nYou will certainly get a blast out of this game, especially when the multiplayer module comes out, as PvP in this game is set to be one of the most fun things you have done in many years, all about the skill and not about the diceroll. The game is definitely worth your cash, but also a little patience as it is early access and of course, there are bugs and several things needed to be worked out.\n\n\n--In Depth Review--\nGraphics: 7/10\nAs you can imagine, worlds which are generated tend to look like they have been generated, rather than natural looking, but that's what makes the race tracks all the more fun than realistic, but the graphics in general are great with lovely lighting and shadows, incredible carcrash physics, lots of particles and bits of things flying everywhere, its great. There are however some major issues which lose the game some points here. There is always this kind of Dust Particle which approaches your screen at almost all times, which actually heats up the computer and in some cases, kills framerate even on powerful rigs like the one im running. Another issue is that large car crashes or great moments of vehicle damage causes the game's framerate to take a divebomb down to like 2 frames per second, which often forces you to kill the game and lose your progress. It's still early access so it's very easy to understand that this sorta thing will happen :)\n\nSound: 10/10\nCountless games fall victim to a lack of sountrack, a lack of variation, and a lack of adrenaline and emotion to boot, but this game features a large playlist of music, each which will pump up your heart rate and convince you to keep driving and keep smacking people off their bike, the wonderful track lineup really keeps you playing the game so you can listen to them all. I hope in the future, like all games that have featured a kickass playlist (MAX Power Racing, Wipeout 2097 etc etc), will allow you to change track in the Pause menu, because i want to play my favorites over and over again! Maybe they could add buttons to utilize 'Next Track' and 'Previous Track' compatability. Weapons feel so realistic whenever you're in combat, from the sound of slapping meat to teeth-grinding chings of an iron weapon meeting someones skull, it sounds terrifyingly good. I have absolutely nothing to suggest when it comes to their sound lineup.\n\nGameplay: 6/10\nIt feels immidiately familiar to Road Rash players and brings back some well needed nostalgia, adding to what is an adrenaline filled game where every gut wrenching moment you fear for traffic over a hill knocking you off your bike, to battling a horde of cop cars and bikes, to avoiding the bullets and melee tools of an opponent biker and for the love of god keep your eyes on the road else you wont last long :D even the race track is twisty, bendy, requires sharp turns, and wants to kill you. It's very difficult doing all of this at once, but that's the beauty of this game and ones like it in the past, it NEEDS to be difficult and challenging...well it certainly is, sometimes feeling even unfair andd cruelly hard when actually sometimes there is nothing to do when you have been overwhelmed but try to stay alive. My only issue is that Police Cars are far too aggressive, where if a single police car hassles you from the beginning of a race, it is too easy and fast for that car to absolutely obliterate you and you dont always have a gun or powerful weapon to deal with it, making your entire race like trying to push or outrun Superman. As i have already mentioned, this game is hard, VERY hard, which is where i would like to suggest a Difficulty option, so that not-so-skilled players, or casuals can drive on easier tracks, with less aggressive AI and perhaps play a more casual and fun game.\nThere is a lack of Online multiplayer and game-modes right now, but give it some time as there already are plans to include them. It is very likely in the future, the 6 rating i have given, will turn into an 8 or 9 after it has been more developed on :)\n\nOverall: 7/10   (after development you could even see up to 9/10)\nYou can tell the game is still early access with several bugs, cars suddenly driving on the incorrect lanes, particle and physical framerate slowdowns and ruthless Car AI, but after these are fixed and more game-modes are included, i would hope with a difficulty slider so people can play at their own pace and level, this game is definitely on it's way to being an instant classic, relivving old memories of games long forgotten but better. The development team are very generous, are listening to community feedback, and are hopefully working hard on this title, because Road Redemption if it continues on this path, is going to be a rolling success. It's just missing one thing, YOU.","October 3, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There are an array of weapons that can be used from a board w/ a nail in it to an AK-47.\n\nThis is early access so expect bugs and not a ton of content besides weapons.

From zooming down motorways to leaping between rooftops the gameplay will definitely remind you of your days playing the old road rash series.\n\nThis time around however, there is no bike shop, and no story mode. The campaign is a series of randomly generated missions that give you cash which you can spend on items such as increased health or weapon damage. However, if you die while playing, you lose all your progress except for any experience gained. You can spend this experience on persistent upgrades such as improved health or bikes.\n\nAll in all a pretty enjoyable game especially considering that its still in early access. Its early access state is still obvious while playing however, everything has a work in progress feel. Fortunately the core gameplay is pretty well nailed down, so if they continue building the game around this it could be even better upon release.\n\nThe game also features 4 way split screen and controller compatibility, so local multiplayer is currently possible, and it looks like online multiplayer is on the horizon.\n\nAs with all early access games, only time will tell as to whether the finished product is worth your pennies, and in some cases, whether the game will actually be completed.","December 11, 2014","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The riding and fighting are solid. I would like to see the overall game modeled more after the N64 Road Rash but it is still fun. There needs to be rivals and biker gang issues. Earning small amounts of cash and slowly upgrading weapons/bikes. Keep hit damage lower to encourage more and longer battles. Road Redemption is at its best when you are flying down highways, making turns and battling. Overall this is a great start to a full version.

I was not disappointed.\n\nAt its core, Road Redemption has some extremely simple mechanics: Drive a motorcycle across some ridiculous procedurally generated terrain (the use of 'terrain' rather than 'roads' is definitely intentional) and beat other bikers with pipes and whatnot. If you liked Road Rash, this game will likely be right up your alley.\n\nThe procedurally generated 'tracks' are really well-done - they flow well, and they're varied enough to stay interesting. Let's be honest, it doesn't take a lot of track variety to make racing games work - many of them involve going around in circles for an hour, and that's fine. I was rather pleasantly surprised by how many little shortcuts and environmental quirks there were to find on these tracks.\n\nThere's missions to play through in a level-by-level system - each level presents some challenge... taking down other riders, winning a race, attracting the attention of the police, etc. You don't have to complete the challenge to pass the level, though doing so gets you some cash that you can spend on upgrades. These upgrades persist until you die, at which point you get a 'game over', and the next time you play, you're starting again from the beginning, but you also earn experience points which can be spent to buy persistent upgrades.\n\nEach level is relatively short - 3-5 minutes, generally - so it's definitely an accessible game... you don't need hours of time to make it feel 'worth it' to play.\n\nThere's a wide range of weapons, including both melee (pipes, axes, maces, sticks, wrenches, etc.), ranged (pistols, rifles, harpoons, a grappling hook), and some special cases (dynomite, a grenade launcher, etc.), and they all have either ammo or durability. When you've run out of ammo or durability, the weapon is discarded. You can carry 3 or 4 with you, and they're very commonly obtained during the game (and sometimes between levels), so you don't feel like you have to be conservative, and you get to play with a wide variety of weapon types. In addition to the weapons, you have a kick and grab attack.\n\nThe riding physics are very arcadey in nature, but honestly, if you looked at the description for this game and expected a realistic biking sim, you might need professional help. You have fairly good air control when you take jumps (you can turn in mid-air), and crashing into a car, flying off your bike, skidding 200m on the pavement, then falling into a ravine does far less damage than being hit in the head with a pipe, but this is a good thing - it keeps the game fun.\n\nThere are some quirks, though. The physics can be a little weird in some cases, especially when going off the road is involved. The side-to-side collisions feel a little 'bouncy', and sometimes the camera angles can cause problems when you're in mid-crash and trying to recover.\n\nI feel like the game could benefit greatly from a few other game modes, but I'm chalking the absence of such things up to it being early access. Some sort of 'endless' mode where you're just trying to see how long you can stay alive would be very fun, here.\n\nThe controls are very tight, especially if you use a controller.\n\nThe game is a little rough around the edges, but this seems more the result of it being an early access title than poor decision making on the developers' part.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend this game if you enjoyed Road Rash or like similar arcade racing-combat games.","December 18, 2014","true","13.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does well but early access games are usually laggy\n- I do get one big lag every first race whenever I play at the beginning. The rest is acceptable\n- incomplete game but with huge poetential.\n\nGrab it on sale or wait for the completed game and pay full price.

I know this game is not Road Rash, but with the simularities, I assume they were headed for the same direction.  However, after palying this for a little while all it did was make me miss Road Rash.  So I'll do my review of the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-Fun in it's own unique way as some moments from Road Rash are relived\n-Traffic is certainly more active and makes for a fun ride\n-Guns are an interesting, nice addition\n\nCons:\n-The gameplay is too fast. You go all out in seconds and are forced to adapt to a very fast pace.  You get used to it after a awhile...sorta\n-Riders spawn ahead of you.  You don't ride with a set group racing towards the finish (though there are some that remain...) but it's not as enjoyable when random riders keep coming (in my opinion)\n-Not that many enviromental elements that you can explore.  Road Rash would have interesting little obsticles to ramp and get weapons or whatnot.  This version has you follow a road.  That's it. Sometimes adding a ramp in the road...but it's not as interesting (even the roof top levels aren't all that fun)\n\nAltogether, I'm excited about the direction the game is taking and it's an early release so there is more to come...but I still prefer Road Rash 64 over this (thus far anyways).  I'd love it if someone remade Road Rash 64 with updated graphics and traffic.  This is not that game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970118935/recommended/300380/","76561197970118935","steven.allick","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970118935/","2331 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis is the first game that has actually prompted me to write a review on Steam, despite me being a member since 2004 and playing many great games on here! I loved Road Rash back in the day owning every version there was across the mega drive, 3do and PS1. I still think it is a disgrace the game was killed by EA and never saw a remake or sequel, a real missed opportunity, guess they can’t see past their endless versions of Fifa etc.\n\nHowever, I am very pleased to report that road redemption captures that road rash magic and brings it into the modern world with aplomb. The racing is fast and fun with busy roads making just finishing alive a real challenge. Though it makes the game initially VERY difficult, the one life system does make the game more tense and challenging, adding a necessary sense of danger and a very real failure state. The combat is great fun and feels weighty and satisfying and it is addictive chaining kills and trying out all the different weapons. The guns are very good too but it is a bit disorientating when the camera moves with aiming, at least you can re-centre it (press right stick). And the C4 is just pure genius, that stuff never gets old!\n\nHowever, whilst I adore this game already and think the developers are doing a great job, I do think the game still needs some work to be ready for release and there were a few things that puzzled me and things that just didn’t seem quite right, both in terms of design and the actual game engine.\n\nThe first ‘issue’ struck me quite early, I was driving alongside a police bike and hit a car and came off my bike, right I thought I’m ‘busted’ (as in road rash) but absolutely nothing happened, the police bike just went by. After extended play I realised the police bikes appear to be a different character and bike skin and nothing more. This is a huge missed opportunity IMO as the constant threat of being busted if you come off your bike was a major gameplay hook in road rash and could be here too.\n\nAnother thing, which isn’t a fault as such, but just felt weird compared to road rash was having cars (and sometimes even trucks etc) take part in the race. It just doesn’t seem a fair match and the way the cars in the race tend to slide from one side of the track to the other is distracting and just looks weird. I know the game is going for the arcade vibe but you can go too wildly unrealistic too, the cars shouldn’t be able to move like the bikes, they are much bigger and heavier.\n\nThere is sometimes just too much going on, too much carnage, too many cars, bikes, riders etc flying around. When these moments of pure carnage happened (particularly on the car rain tracks and the ones with explosives on the track) it kills performance (even on a pretty good PC) turning the game into a slideshow and making survival partly dependant on luck, which IMO is wrong, in a racing game like this it should always be skill, not luck that gets you through. Don’t get me wrong, avoiding a car landing on your head or some C4 is great fun, I’m not saying get rid of the car rain/explosives type levels, just make them a bit less frequent (or reduce their intensity a touch) and make the core (racing/brawling) gameplay the game’s main focus.  I’m just saying scale the whole destruction and wackiness thing back a bit, because the game doesn’t really need it, it can be enjoyable (and sometimes best) without it, road rash never had those things going on and never needed them either, the core mechanics of racing coupled with fighting is engaging enough.\n\nThe graphics are really impressive, especially for an early access title but there does seem to a bit of a lack of variety in scenery and locales (the rooftop tracks seem worst for this). Hopefully, the final release will see some more track types, the city levels in road rash with pedestrians, heavy traffic and tighter inner city roads were great and a nice green countryside type track with rolling fields and hills would really enhance the experience too.\n\nAs enjoyable as the career mode is, it currently is a bit short and lacks a real sense of progression from one event to the next, they get harder sure but with road rash the races actually got (much) longer too so aspects of survival (vs getting into a lot of fights) and trying not to come off the bike really started to play a part. I’d really like to see the races/events become bigger and longer as you move through the career mode giving the player a real sense of progression.\n\nLastly, in technical terms the game is superb for early access, no outright crashes at all. A few occasions on the roof top events when riding between the two buildings I fell down the middle of them, the game didn’t put me on the track (I was just stuck ‘in’ the building) using the option to reset back to track was tried several times but each time it just put me back in the middle of the gap between the buildings and I fell to my doom over and over until I ran out of energy. This only happened a few times but made me extra careful to time my jumps right!\n\nOverall, sorry if this seems a negative review as I think the game is great already and seeing a road rash homage is a personal dream come true. I would recommend it highly as it is right now, I just really want to see the final release be as good as it possibly can be.","November 2, 2014","true","12.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Updated for the modern day, one of the best Arcade titles out there. Few games just focus on a tight "fun" experience like this one does. This game will give you a fun, combat bike experience, through several different racing "Modes" as you play through the campaign and level up. It has one of the best sound tracks for a videogame, tight controls, and a great twitch experience.\n\nThe cons: Some frame rate issues, particularly on the car raining episode.\nNo online multiplayer (Yet!)\nNot enough "Personality" like it's spiritual predecessor.\n\nWhen this game gets online play, it's going to have hours and hours of replay value, just driving with other players and beating the hell out of one another. I'm positive the developers will fix the Framerate issues as well.\n\nWhat I would love to see though, is some injected personality for it's single player campaign mode. There was nothing quite like Road Rash where you'd have individual Riders trash talking you (Or randomly helping you out) between races, and who would react to you beating the crap out of them or not too! Give us something like that too, add the Online Multiplayer, Fix the Frame Rate issues and we'll have a modern classic on our hands.","November 2, 2014","true","5.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Kind of? Okay, that’s good enough. The homicidal motorcycle racing genre never went stale. Instead, it kind of never went anywhere. Those games died on the side of some infinite stretch of desolate highway in the late ‘90s. Luckily, the people at DarkSeas flipped open their Necronomicon and decided to revive the genre with Road Redemption and I couldn’t be happier. It’s at least ten times the skull busting, engine revving, cap popping, and jump jetting you can remember.\n\nSet in a world where cars can, and occasionally will, rain from the sky, this is the Road Rashiest rehash you could possibly envision. Calling it a tribute doesn’t even do it justice. Road Redemption does more for this niche racing genre than any game before it. It’s nearly perfect and, technically, not even a finished product. Part roguelike, part RPG, and all high-octane violence, this game is both incredibly easy to get into and difficult to perfect. Careen across skyscrapers and swerve around crumbled competition – there are a ton of surprises folded into this title. Pure entertainment and a “must own” for old-school fans.","October 31, 2014","true","8.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

HOWEVER at some rare moment later on in the game where hell is brought down on earth, the FPS can drop and this makes the game a little tricky considerng every secound counts. however the FPS drop lasts for around 3 to 4 secounds and thats it.\n\nas i say these SMALL issues can be fixed easily and i beleave there will be a competative mode coming soon so there is more to look for. this game is addictive frstratingly challanging, has some seriouse replay value and i would say 9.3/10 Love it.","November 1, 2014","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Reviving the epic Road Rash is a great idea, but for people like me who are nostalgic to the childhood memory may feel a bit disappointed. As long as I remember, one of the best thing about Road Rash is the unlimited freedom it gives to the player, e.g. you can simply drop you motor and run all the way the finish line, however the freedom is absent from Road Redemption.\n\nFirst the new game runs in a much faster pace with much shorter tracks, which leaves the players busily doging coming veichles and runs like hell to the finish line, no time is left for more fun. Secondly the player dies far too easily: either you get hit by a car coming into your face (waaaay too much traffic!), or a car dropped randomly from the sky, or simply got slashed by a axe two times. I would still stick to the idea that you could pick up your bike and ride on when you got seriously damaged. Then it is the optimization issue. The game is supposed to be affordable even for mid tier laptops, but with a brand new MSI with a GeForce 970M GPU I still experience some significant PFS drop. Finally, is it really neccessary to have some troll events like Hallucinogen*****, or to let the player compete with a car? I have already have Goat Simulator so I truly don't need another game just like that, especially for a game that I wish I could invest more time in.\n\nFor the pros, the game has some really good level designs, for which I mean level 4 where you can compete on the rooftop with a jet pack on your rear wheel. I did not get to all the campaign levels but I believe there will be more surprise to come.\n\nTo note that this is an alpha version so there is still a lot that can be improved. With a fantastic initial concept I am hoping for future updates. So with my expectation high on this I will give it a yes.","October 27, 2014","true","5.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The rooftop levels are sometimes a little overkill (i.e., I'd rather race and beat up other racers than worry about grappling around like Spiderman), but overall a fun game, and most of the levels and challenges are engaging and entertaining. In my experience, playing with a controller is MUCH better than with keyboard, which is a swich, since I'm normally a keyboard & mouse gamer. However, the responsiveness in turning and braking seems easier to control via controller. Ultimately, I think it's been worth the purchase and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished results of the completed game (currently playing in Early Access).","October 27, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is truly amazing, even in early access. But now I have only one major complain: game isn't very serious.\nHonestly, rooftop racing with magic-jumping-jet-pack-like-device? One big NOPE.\nSoundtrack needs to be revised.\nAnd we need a "one race" mode where we can select a track, race type, motorcycle and weapons to start with.\nAnd, probably, solo mode can be more WOW!-ish with "bullet time" in "it was close" moments (especially "car rain" races, they remind me of Split/Second).\nAnd there is one very-very-very-very important request - SLI compatibility\nBut anyway it's the best motorcycle racing combat simulator that I ever played.

It has a decent assortment of weapons ranging from peices of wood to grenade launchers. Some of the challenges you do are really crazy (especially across rooftops) and whenever you fail you immediatly want to jump back in and try again. It also has a good soundtrack and an upgrade system. You may lose your upgrades when you die but there are some permanent ones you buy at the end that carry on to your other playthroughs so you have a better chance of beating the game next time. I can imagine the game getting alot more wild and fun when the online multiplayer comes around too. easily reccomend to anyone that wants some more chaotic racing violence in their life.","October 29, 2014","true","15.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, please rate up if you think this is helpful in any way. :)\n\nI'm putting this sentiment as the foremost part of the review, because I feel it's what most gamers can relate to, and is an accurate summary of the game:\nRemember the adrenaline filled moments of speeding down the city streets of Just Cause 2, or even Grand Theft Auto, watching the high-speed collisions around you as the cars of would-be-driver corpses explode into oncoming traffic? Imagine that, but completely revamped and overhauled into the most action packed, brutal street racing game you can imagine. That is precisely what Road Redemption is.\n\nBasically, the core of this game is, slipping around through traffic and other racers, while also attempting to maintain your speed, while, on top of that, trying to dispatch aforementioned 'other racers.' All of this, of course, is extremely well executed, and it was difficult for me to convince myself I should stop playing so I can write this review and go to sleep.\n\nTo start, the controls are relatively simple, and effective, as most games' are. I can't say much here, as they are pretty average, and you shouldn't have an issue. I found most of the mechanics to work pretty smoothly, and had no grievances.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. Weaving through traffic, popping people with anything from a shovel to C4, trying to line up with ramps without getting killed by a madman with a baseball bat (all in good fun, of course). The only mentionable complaints I have are that, it can get a bit frustrating or repetitive if you manage to die a bit too many times over, but if you aren't a complete psychopath, making it your goal to kill everyone in sight, it shouldn't be too much of an issue.\n\nThe graphics are on par with modern standards, making it easy to run, and pretty enough to look at. It's no Crysis, but I'm certainly not complaining. The real focus here is the intense slaughter-ifying.\n\ntl;dr\nPros\n+ Gets updated (can't say the same for many early access games).\n+ Fast paced (assuming you like it that way).\n+ Satisfying campaign length. Lots of hours in it.\n+ Satisfying map variety.\n+ Easy to run.\n+ Fair graphics/visuals.\n+ Explosions.\n+ Very rewarding.\n+ User friendly.\n+ Multiplayer\n+ Coop\n\nCons\n- Mild repetitivity. Not enough to stop your from playing.\n- Weapon repetitivity. There is melee and guns, that's about as advanced as it gets.\n- Occasional lag spikes, notably on "hallucinogenic" levels.\n- AI are predictable, and somewhat simple (though they are still very fun).\n- Can be frustrating, despite the satisfaction of progressing.\n\nOnce again, I would gladly answer any questions, so either comment or ask me through Steam if you have any. Also, rate up if this helped, so I know whether I should continue updating it.","October 30, 2014","true","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

Up to 4 player COOP was a huge selling point for me, and makes this an easy to pick up party game.  I recently beat the game and was rewarded with a phone number which I absurdly called and was connected directly to a developer.  A super nice guy I chatted wth him a bit longer that was probably approprite, I had been drinking (thanks for your patience Ian).  All in all a great game.

There have been some changes that have made the game playable and even enjoyable. The physics of the bike in the air is ridiculous... but then again so is the whole idea of the game. There is some satisfaction to be had in planting a bomb on a rival gang member's bike or grappling them until they are hit by an on-coming car. Then there's the 'cars raining from the sky' which isn't a bug but an actual developers' choice for a thing to be happening while you are trying to dodge cars and bikers.\n\nThe biggest issue at the moment on my system is that the game crashes out when trying to load levels. This appears to be due to the game using up all available memory and can be delayed by setting it at the the graphics to 'fastest'. The developers are aware of this and are trying to sort it out.\n\nAs this game has no plot it can be very satisfying to just jump in a race, smash of few bikers down and then walk away. The weapons have different characteristics and learning to time the strikes is interesting.\n\nI wouldn't say the game is worth $20 in its current state but, with the effort being put in to fix the errors, I would say that it will be.","October 2, 2014","true","12.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is in early development and I was waiting for an opportunity to get ahold of it. I was given a coupon from Steam for three or four dollars off and would still recommened people to pay full price for this game IF, they want to play the game with an Xbox 360 controller, and if they have a decent computer. I have an R9 270x so this game performs well on "Fanatistic" graphical quality, but I have been noticing suttering issues, which could be related to poor optimization. If you aren't willing to tinker around with the settings or even bother looking to see if the game will even work on your PC, then you should not even think of purchasing this game.\n\nWill be playing more of this game once it improves; as it stands, if you don't mind it's hiccups, its a fun game. 7.5/10.","October 27, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The rooftop levels are sometimes a little overkill (i.e., I'd rather race and beat up other racers than worry about grappling around like Spiderman), but overall a fun game, and most of the levels and challenges are engaging and entertaining. In my experience, playing with a controller is MUCH better than with keyboard, which is a swich, since I'm normally a keyboard & mouse gamer. However, the responsiveness in turning and braking seems easier to control via controller. Ultimately, I think it's been worth the purchase and I'm looking forward to seeing the finished results of the completed game (currently playing in Early Access).","October 27, 2014","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The classic road rash games never had guns. it was melee only. I suggest being stingy with ammo in PVP. Even still there is an interesting balance hurdle here. If you steer with keyboard WASD, you'll have the typical non ideal stiff WASD driving controlls but the trade off is your fireaim Aim will be massively OP with the mouse... but if you use a controller, your steering will be better than the keyboard but the tradeoff is your Aim with guns will be awful via thumb stick aim @ PCmaster race keyboard+mouse=superior aim  @ controllers suck for aiming crosshairs in anyway shape or form.  I for 1 would much rather use a keyboard and mouse but steer poorly via WASD because the guns are just too good of a trade off. It's just much simpler to drive stiff with WASD but then blow everybody away with guns as opposed to trying to race them traditionally... and is that really the route they wanna go down in what's ultimately a driving game.. aim and shooting being more important than driving?

Holy crap, this game is absolutely AMAZING. It's so fun and addictive that I had to keep coming back to it everyday! I love the feeling when you smash a baseball bat straight in someones face, or when you launch them sky high with a Sticky Bomb or Grenade Launcher.\n\nI've never played Road Rash, but I will say that you do not need to play that game to enjoy this. I had a great time shooting people off their bikes while flying in the air on rooftops while zip lining from helicopter to helicopter. All the different areas are long and very entertaining, especially when you're destroying everything in sight.\n\nThis game however, can be difficult. Car storms are challenging, fun and frustrating to drive through, while crazy traffic causes mass mayhem and destruction, but it doesn't stop there. Once you beat the normal Campaign (1-3 hours depending on how good you are) you unlock Campaign+ and holy crap, it's hard.\n\nThe Gameplay overall is awesome, fun, challenging and sometimes aggravating. It will keep you entertained for sometime. The great thing about this is, even though there's only about 3-7 Hours of play, the game is has a lot of replay-ability, with having almost all the levels different each time, with a leveling up system that works pretty nice. Plus, the game is still being developed with a competitive mode in development!\n\nNow for the look of the game, the graphics are really good. The texture quality could be improved a bit, and there should be a bit more optimizations rather than the normal Unity start up menu,  but that's just something I'd prefer.\nThe Shadow quality is pretty good as well, but it could be improved upon a bit as well.\n\nOverall, a great game with great graphics, great gameplay and lots of replay-ability.

After writing my original review the developer requested me as a friend in the Steam network.  They recently removed my "friend" status.  I have no idea why.  There was zero bad blood between us, in fact there was very little communication and my review had not changed.  Removing supporters of the game seems like bad news indeed.  Is development over with?  I can think of no other reason to remove people other than complaints about lack of progress.\n\nI still continue to recommend this game due to my high hopes and satisfaction with how the game currently plays.  I may change this review soon, if there continues to be no progress or communication.\n\n\nOriginal:\nThis is by far the best early access experience i've had.  The game was in great shape to begin with, and there have been constant updates.  Very fun to play, a great spiritual successor to Road Rash.  And the developer is taking the game in a very smart direction with a rogue-like element and some very arcade-like situations such as car rain.  (That's when cars fall from the sky in your general direction.)\n\nIf you know and loved the Road Rash games this is perfect.  If you want simulation racing look elsewhere.

I love the days of Road Rash, was one of my favourite games growing up, and there's a lot to like about Road Redemption in comparison with it. Weapon variety is great, and the arcadey feel is in the ballpark of what I was hoping for.\n\nHowever, this game is very much early access. The content seems rather shallow and limited, it doesn't do a couple of big things which I considered great from the classic Road Rash games... which I hope will change as development goes on. Buggy as anything as well of course, and I'll forgive a lot of it (too easy to get stuck behind objects, I know there's the option in the menu to put you back on the track, but having it on the controller would make more sense) but the big down for me is that it crashed 3 times within just over an hours play. That's bad, even for an early access game (especially one which has been around for a fair bit).\n\nI'd like to say I recommend the game, but as it stands I can't. Of course, things will change as the game gets closer to release, and it's not one I've given up on either... there's enough fun there at its core that with a lot of work it will become more playable as time goes on.","June 19, 2015","false","3.4"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","0"

Even though this game was given to me by the Dev I can not use that for this review, and hope the overwelmingly positive reviews are not positive because it was given free to them.\n\nI surpass the minimum and recomended specs yet playing on the Fast game settings, the quailty is really poor and the framerate is around 10ish frames intermitant and not smooth, really shuttering. Gonna try Fastest next time. No multiplayer that I could find first play. I find the no gun weapons to be quiet hard to use. This is not a racing game it is like a deathmatch game, but this is nothing like Twisted Metal. The gameplay reminds me of another game on a console I used to play where you could hit people off, but in that game you are racing. The controls are ok, yet trying to shoot behind you and drive is hard. It is easier to shoot behind while driving in GTA.\n\nThe gameplay is ok, I do enjoy going off road, and the ragdoll. but it just is unplayable with the framerate issues. I find it impossible to hit the ramps, yet it seems like I am driving stright into poles pretty easy.\n\nMusic is great, so are the sounds.\n\nWill play more and reupdate and hope this game improves.\n\nUpdate 1: Switched to Fastest and Set Launch Options to -dxlevel 80 longer bursts of good frames but still have periods of bad bad frames and pauses. A lot more fun to actually be destructive for once. Can't wait till they optimize it and make it to where it does not shutter or stall/pause!","November 5, 2014","false","0.8"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

I feel it is already fifteen quid well spent and I haven't even played yet -- I write this review having not yet passed the Intro screen!\n\nI can say this, however:  As a long-standing Road Rash player I can tell you by extension that this is a good game based entirely on the feedback from other long-standing Road Rash players.\n\nTime to join the mayhem, I think...\n\n\n","February 26, 2015","true","50.0"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Better fly 200 meters and get killed.\n- Drive off a cliff, respawn, i'm 1st, what?\n- Controls for certain weapons (such as the gun) are done very poorly.\n- The game trailer is done very well, however when you play it, it's nothing like the trailer\n- No spedometer, how fast am i going?\n- The only thing this game has on road rash is the graphics, which is expected for a 2015 game vs a 1991 game\n10/10 would not play again","July 16, 2015","false","1.2"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You just pick some random rider on a random bike; rather than being in a gang, progressing through the street races, buying better equipment etc etc, so you feel completely disinterested in the whole game really.  Not to mention there are no saves, so once you are dead - you are dead.\n\nWorst of all though - the races are very boring and only last about 3 mins.  They also have this ridiculous 'knock off other riders in the time limit' rather than races, which gets old even the second time around.\n\nHard to wreck a classic game concept, as they couldn't have butchered this game any more in they had of tried.  Not a scratch on Road Rash; so do yourself a favour and go and get a PS1 emulator instead of this crap.\n","November 12, 2015","false","3.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Has a ways to go for completion but I am having a ton of fun. If you miss road rash this game can scratch the itch.","March 7, 2015","true","7.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

After idling for cards one day, I forgot about the game entirely for a month or two.\n\nThen I felt guilty and decided to fire it up, figuring I would quit after 30 seconds and move on.\n\nI did not expect to get sucked in immediately.  Particularly as I have not liked a racing game since the early 1990s.\n\nThis game is a great balance of absurdist action fun and enjoyable racing; even trying to do something as simple as watching for cars barrelling straight at you while you also try to maneuver into the perfect position to club a nearby racer to death proves excellently challenging.\n\nBut what really seals the deal of this being a game worth playing is the reward system--receiving cash at the end of every race that you can use for temporary upgrades, and then experience upon death (based on your successes in the races) that can be used for permanent upgrades, is a pretty addictive system.  It certainly kept me playing longer than I expected, and I found myself planning out my next upgrades without even realizing it.\n\nSo, overall, a racing game worth playing for people who hate racing games--probably even for people who love racing games!","March 21, 2015","true","4.7"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"
