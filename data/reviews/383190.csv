Easy to get into but with a lot of depth. Can't recommend at full price but under a couple bucks or in a bundle like I got it it's definitely a winner.","March 27","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turns out it's pretty tricky and even better it makes a satisfying puzzle game.\n\nThe difficulty starts out slow but quickly ramps up to include multiplication, division and exponentials.  The tutorial only explains the details of the scoring mechanic after whiffing c couple three star results but it's easy to go back and clean up.\n\nIn the end, Sumico adds up to be a fun and challenging game.","May 19","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
