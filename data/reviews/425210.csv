You play as Shadwen, a ruthless killer turned babysitter for a girl called Lily. You come across Lily being questioned by a guard because she’s eating an apple and so you take out the guard to help Lily. Despite the fact that you’re on a mission to kill the King, you let Lily stick around and it seems that her main purpose in the game is to natter on about how awful killing is. You’ll have to make sure Lily can safely move through the game’s levels without being spotted.\n\nVisually, Shadwen is a bit of a mixed bag. The graphics are great, even on medium it’s a good looking game and the overall look of the game helps get across the dark and uncivilized nature of the city you find yourself in. The animations are what let the game down in the visual department. The animations are really clunky and in some cases unnatural, the movement of the guards was particularly clunky and some of Shadwen’s animations fall into the unnatural category. I was also a bit disappointed by the lack of any movement for dead guards when you drag them around, they’re completely rigid and it just looks weird.\n\nThe actual gameplay in Shadwen is also hit and miss. Most levels are split up into three different sections and your goal for each of these sections is to help Lily reach the end of the level. There will be several different places for Lily to hide and she’ll move from hiding spot to hiding spot so long as there aren’t any enemies in the way. The way forward for Lily can either be achieved by simply killing the guards in her way or by distracting the guards away from Lily so that she can slip past. While killing the guards is obviously a lot easier I found that distracting them was actually a bit more enjoyable. Although having Lily as a companion does lead to some interesting challenges in dealing with guards, I didn’t feel like she was important to the game at all. Other than using her to open doors you have no interaction with Lily and her only purpose within the game is to give you a reason to kill or distract guards. I get that she’s necessary for that purpose but it would have been nice for her to have other stuff in the game to do. More on Lily later.\n\nKilling being easier doesn’t mean it’s entirely safe. First off, if a guard spots a dead body they’ll move to investigate and once they get close they’ll enter an alert status and shout out, triggering nearby guards to enter alert status too. A guard in alert status (who hasn’t spotted you) will run towards the nearest alarm bell and if he reaches it it’s game over for Shadwen. It is possible to pick off one guard in alert status but you’re screwed if more have been alerted. The other way for a guard to enter alert status is if he actually spots you, there’s really not much you can do here as this (in my experience anyway) always leads to death by crossbow bolt. Thankfully you can rewind time!\n\nOne of the biggest mechanics in Shadwen is that time only moves when you do and you can also rewind time whenever you want. The whole time only moves when you do mechanic works reasonably well in the game, mostly due to the fact that there’s a key which (when held) makes time continue even when you’re not moving. The problem I have with time moving when you do is that it makes the game considerably easier, even easier when you consider that there are no consequences for failure since you can rewind time. The combination of these two mechanics, while reasonably fun to play around with, make the game feel more like a puzzle game than a stealth game as you’re just trying to figure out the solution that gets Lily safely to the end of the level since if you get something wrong you can just re-do it right away. Maybe that appeals to you but if you’re expecting a traditional stealth game experience or a particularly challenging game you won’t find it here.\n\nWhile we’re on the subject of difficulty, Shadwen features three difficulty levels: Easy (Line of Sights visible as well as “Helpful Highlights”), Normal (just “Helpful Highlights”) and Hard which features neither. The difficulty levels do not change how tough the enemies are in any way. Helpful highlights consists of enemies who are searching for something being highlighted in yellow, red for enemies in alert status and white for enemies who are speaking. None of these difficulty levels offer any real challenge due to the game’s time mechanics and the fact that the guards are pretty easy to deal with which contributes to the game being far too easy overall. I like to be challenged when I’m playing a stealth game and Shadwen just didn’t challenge me in any way.\n\nCircling back to the levels themselves, the game has fifteen of them. The levels start out with reasonably short lengths but they gradually increase in length and difficulty as you progress through the game. An increase in difficulty essentially equates to how many enemies there are and how close together they are. Obviously, the more guards there are the more guards you’ll need to kill or distract and if they’re closer together it’s harder to create opportunities to pick off guards one by one though it doesn’t make distracting guards much more difficult. The level design in the game is fairly basic in the game and despite different settings the enemy layouts are often identical, for example you’ll find two enemies talking while another guard patrols nearby, there just isn’t enough variation in the levels. The level design also contributes to the game being far too easy because you never need to deal with more than two or three enemies at a time.\n\nBeing a stealth game, the quality of the AI is rather important. Unfortunately Shadwen’s AI is fairly weak. The AI will notice movement (if you’re far enough away they won’t realize you’re actually an enemy so they’ll come to investigate) and they will check out any sounds they hear but there are some serious flaws. The biggest issue is that (in my experience anyway) the guards don’t always see Lily and so you can actually instruct her to move to a new location and she’ll walk past the guards, pretty much makes escorting her pointless. The other problem with the AI is that they’re just too simple. Yes, they will detect you but if three guards go to investigate something and only one comes back, he doesn’t bat an eyelid and they seem to have absolutely no periphery vision as I was able to leave dead bodies or even walk beside enemies and they wouldn’t notice.\n\nJust a couple of things to wrap up. Firstly, I didn’t find Shadwen, Lily or the overall story particularly interesting. The story just didn’t grab my attention and neither did the characters. However, I did enjoy the dialogue between guards, they did a good job at world building with the dialogue and while there were only three or four different voice actors the conversations were usually new instead of being repeated. The fifteen missions do offer a fair amount of content for the price but there’s not much in the way of replay value unless you want to go back and replay the levels for achievements (you’ll need at least two playthroughs to unlock them all). I would have liked to have seen a little more variation with the guards since there were only two different types and even then the only real variation was that one of the guards required an aerial attack to kill.\n\nVerdict\nShadwen may be enjoyable for some but its weak AI and the fact that it’s far too easy really let it down. If you’re looking for a stealth game that’s not too challenging you might want to grab it, if not I’d suggest waiting for a sale.\n\nLone Ranger Reviews.\n\nEl K.","May 17","false","5.4"," 600 of 764 people (79%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","79","600","764","30","34"

I'm just not recommending it. Here's why.\n\nShadwen is an odd game, cobbled together from various other mechanics and it's good that indie developers try stuff like this. However, this time it doesn't work so well.\nThe core game plays like early stealth games, not so much Assassin's Creed as Tenchu Stealth Assassins. The stealth kills are fairly bland (I count 3 I think, neck stab, throat slit, double kidney stab). There's a grappling hook which gets you spotted more often than not and is best used for dragging objects to cause distractions. There's the rewind time mechanic from Prince of Persia: Sands of Time which having no in game explanation or any restrictions pretty much wrecks any challenge in the game. There's also the "time only flows if you move" thing most recently seen in Superhot. It's cool, it's very very cool... but it doesn't bring anything to a game that has no combat... There's not one single moment where it comes in useful.\nThe game can be played as a murder hobo (kill everyone) or a stealthy (kill no one) kinda deal... Sounds great right, kill no one? Pro Stealth? That would be great except the whole thing is one giant escort mission of a girl called Lily. The guards can't actually see her... but you need to provide her with cover to get from point A to point B. Sadly often her AI refuses to move even when the coast is clear so murdering people is far easier than trying to stealth it. Sadly, Lily has no personality whatsoever and will chastise you between levels for murdering people... On top of that there's very little in the way of story, no character progression, hud, skills or loot. Oh there's some sort of crafting system but I finished the game just fine without crafting anything in 6 hours. A pressure mine doesn't seem so cool when it's game over the moment the guards see a dead body...\nAnd why is Lily even there? Because my Assassin on a mission to kill the king for reasons unknown happened to get spotted by her and decided to drag her along instead of slitting her throat? O_O\n\nUltimately, I don't dislike the game. It was an ok six hours, but that's all it is. One evening's entertainment. You may get more mileage if you really wanna go through twice for achievements' sake but the level design is linear and unimaginative and the game just doesn't live up to the potential.\nThe time stopping is cool though... I can't deny it. Pointlessly cool.\n\n(Edited for typos)","May 18","false","6.0"," 261 of 320 people (82%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","82","261","320","10","25"

Lily follows Shadwen on her adventure throughout the kingdom, and you have to make the moral decision along the way of whether to murder enemy guard’s right in front of this poor little girl’s eyes or find another way around.\n\nThe main game play in Shadwen is quite simply, remain hidden from enemy guards. If you get caught or detected, you will fail. The game’s rewind time mechanic allows you to rectify any mistakes you make really easily and you will make a lot of them. Accidently knock over some glass bottles and alert the guard? Just rewind time and be more careful next time! The game also offers a unique element where if your character is not moving time freezes. This took me a while to get used to as it can be a little disorienting when you are used to the world just carrying on around you when you are idol, but you soon get used to it and are able to use it to your full advantage. It allows you to plot your next movement precisely without worry of being caught, it also makes clambering up buildings and scaffolding much easier as you can pause time and carefully aim where your next grapple hook is going to land.\n\nSpeaking of the grapple hook, this will also be a key piece of equipment throughout the game. You can use it to grab onto objects in the environment to cause a distraction for the guards. You can pull crates, shelves, pretty much anything which can be moved around with your hook. This will allow you to slip past guards unnoticed and without brutally killing them. You can even make deaths of guards look like it was an accident, maybe by pulling a box down on their heads, and whilst this does count as you killing them, the guards won’t instantly become alert of any suspicious activity.  You will also be able to create traps and decoys too, these more or less will also kill the guard, but in much more interesting ways than just stabbing them in the back, with items such as poison traps and spiked devices.\n\nThe aim on each level is to create path safe for the young girl Lily to pass through unharmed. The game right down to its core is essentially a long escort quests, but don’t worry – Lily’s AI is absolutely stellar. She will remain hidden in shadows, boxes and haystacks and not cause you any unwarranted hassle. You can more or less forget about her right up until you reach the end of the level and have to backtrack to clear a path for her. She won’t just walk out in front of guards, or make any noise which you wouldn’t normally expect. I was really impressed with how well Lily reacted to every situation thrown at her such as guards unexpectedly changing their patrol path. Lily will stop where she is going and immediately find somewhere to hide. This is how escort quests should be done!\n\nShadwen looks absolutely stunning.  The game is ran using the developers own game engine, which doesn’t have a published name yet, but it is safe to say they have a real asset on their hands. The almost photo realistic environments and character models are something special to gawk at. Lighting and shadow is used perfectly to not only create a dark atmosphere but also to enhance the gameplay elements of stealth and deception. Character animations throughout are fluid and realistic too. You can really get fully immersed in this game’s world as it will suck you in with its beautiful art style. The game’s voice acting is spot on as well; between levels you will get some dialogue between Shadwen and Lily, and throughout game play you also get to listen out for guards chattering between themselves too. The sound effects play a key part in the game, guards really pay attention to any sounds and will investigate. Anything you bump into, move or interact with will cause a sound, so you really need to pay attention to what is around you at any time.\n\nAt the start of the game you have three levels of difficulty. The easy mode will remove most of the game’s challenging aspect and allow you to ghost past a lot of the levels with much ease. This will add a cone of sight on all enemies making it easy for you to see what they can see. If you want the full experience of stealth you really need to be playing on the medium option. You can change the difficulty of levels on the fly which is always nice to see in any game.\n\nWhilst there is about six hours of content on offer in Shadwen, I don’t really see there being any real replay value on show. You could possibly get a second run throughout of it, as depending on how many guards you kill throughout the story, will affect the way Lily thinks about Shadwen during and at the end of the game. This is the sort of game which would really benefit from seeing some sort of daily challenge mode included, or an extra game mode that we saw in the likes of Dishonored with its time trails.\n\nI was impressed with how well the game ran, I was able to get a steady 60 FPS with all the graphical settings turned up to max. The only grip I had with the game was you cannot change the graphic settings whilst in game, you have to quit back to desktop to change anything but a minor issue none the less. I played using a keyboard and mouse but full controller support is available.\n\nShadwen is a game that caught my attention right away from its gorgeous graphics and interesting game play. The core game play mechanics remain absolutely key to the game’s success and any stealth and action fans will definitely need to be checking Shadwen out. This is coming close to Frozenbyte’s best game that they have released. The regular price is well worth what you are getting in terms of production values and gripping game play.\n\nDisclaimer: The following review was conducted on PC via Steam.

Even if all those ideas aren't totally polished, there is a very strong foundation here and it's definitely worth picking up.\n\nStealth games are one genre that I have wanted to love so much, but I felt tended to be quite restricted to "the experts". When you do find one you can play, it's often because it feels like it's been made "forgiving" for you, like allowing Sam Fisher to storm the gates with a silenced shotgun (Or, silenced Tranquilizer Machine Gun if you're playing pacifist). Guards may find you, but give them a few minutes and they'll forget you - and in spite of a story that says "They can never know we were here", you will get spotted and hide many times. The concept feels like it could be so much fun, but only if you're a grandmaster of it; if you're the 47 silent assassin type who knows the guard patrols before even hitting New Game.\n\nShadwen could be called "forgiving", but I prefer to think of it as being much more forgiving of experimentation. Reflexes are in no demand at all because time only moves when you move (SUPER. HOT.) Hiding in the correct alley or using the right tool the moment a guard turns a corner becomes a *choice*, not a required instantaneous response. Taking reflexes out of that equation turns out to provide many, many more options.\n\nExecution is also a major flub of stealth games. Everyone has had a moment where they crept up behind a guard in a game, hit the attack button, and missed, resulting in the entire base going on alert. Worse, the next thing that happens is either you run and hide, extending a part of the game you don't enjoy, or you instantly go to Reload Checkpoint, using the game's of-course-achingly-slow loading times. Shadwen has a physics engine that is part of the core mechanics - so it certainly doesn't give precise results to rectify that type of fumble. But, it does let you rewind time at any point; which initially feels like a complete cheat, but essentially imitates little more than the quicksave-bog many old PC gamers have already trod through. And, it allows the designers to safely try out a number of scenarios.\n\n- You can never be caught. Instead of any kind of ALERT phase, guards simply instantly kill you with a crossbow (showing "Rewind to continue" onscreen, like Braid).\n- Physics items are a big part of distractions and even special kills in the game. Even if you happened to push one off a ledge at a bad time, you can try again right away.\n- Single use items can be experimented with freely, rather than worrying about accidentally wasting one.\n- As a nice aside, if you interrupted a guard's unique conversation by kicking a dog, you can rewind to hear him speak.\n\nPlenty of times in other games I've only figured out the right time to use the right item in the right spot *after* the moment has passed. This happens in Shadwen too, until I realize I can just go back to that moment.\n\nThe topic of Lily, the girl you escort, will likely come up as the only thing more horrific in games than "escort mission" is "stealth escort mission". In reality, Lily is little more than the result of a game design session where it turned out that with merely an hour's practice, players could use the game's Grappling hook to fly through the level at mach 2. Lily cannot actually be caught by guards - but she will only move when they're not looking or dead, meaning even if Shadwen herself has many movement options, you still need to work out a safe ground path to the objective.\n\nOn the topic of killing, Shadwen also makes pacifistic runs pretty difficult, and it feels more rewarding. There is no "knock unconscious for an hour" button, only the ability to briefly distract guards in various ways. There may be a later difference in ending for never killing anyone, but that's not the reason I'm trying it. Shadwen simplifies stealth enough that it actually becomes fun, rather than a slog, to challenge yourself in a way that you'd prefer.\n\nA few small negatives I will note, firstly (although it's a pretty common negative that's never made a game much worse for me) is pretty dumb AI. Hearing the desperately-varied "I heard a noise" line gets tiresome, and seeing guards confused by the rogue hiding behind a twig-sized bush is kind of silly. In addition, most of the storyline is told through concept art cutscenes, which are not stellar but serve their purpose. These are little bits of polish that might have been nice to see rounded off, but they don't affect the package - especially for its price, Shadwen has much uniqueness in the stealth genre to offer.","May 19","true","2.1"," 48 of 56 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","48","56","0","0"

The guards all have the same model and voice, the levels have a similar look, and sometimes the physics go a bit wonky (however, this often results in amusing things happening and anything can easily be fixed by the rewind feature). With that being said, Frozenbyte have done a great job with what they had to work with and I'm sure that with a larger budget these minor irks could have been solved.\n\nThe game looks really good, it's nothing spectacular, but it's more than acceptable and the levels are not un-pleasing to the eye. The world feels like it should, it's rather dark and it conveys the turmoil being felt in the kingdom well. The characters control well, and the grappling hook mostly provides a smooth experience. The scenes between the levels are done really well. The voice acting is clean and clear, and the artwork in these scenes is fantastic.\n\nThere are elements of the story that have been created in order to assist the gameplay. The fact that Lily is caught stealing an apple by a guard and then joins Shadwen on a very dangerous assassination attempt is rather ludicrous. On would think, being the talented young lady that Shadwen is, she could easily ditch young Lily and have a much easier time. The rest of the story, including the background of the world and the events that have lead up to this moment, is mostly told through the guards conversations, which I find very endearing. Hiding in the shadows and listening to what the guards are saying is very rewarding. Sometimes they'll be talking about mundane nonsense, but other times they'll paint a picture of the kingdom and really help bring it to life.\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple. You need to clear a path for Lily to move from hiding spot to hiding spot. This can be done by distracting the guards or dispatching of them completely. However, if Lily stumbles across a dead guard she will not like it. The game can be played by not caring about what Lily sees and this would create a rather easy experience. You can also play by tactically killing the guards and hiding their bodies, not just from other guards (preventing the alarm from being raised), but also from Lily's innocent eyes. This creates an engaging experience, as you must decide when killing a guard if you will have the time to hide the evidence from the other guards and Lily.\n\nThe AI is a little stupid. Sometimes Lily will run right behind a guard who will not notice a thing. Guards are easily forgetful and happy to put minor disturbances down to them hearing things or "dark spirits". There are a few graphical inconsistencies where the game will think you are hidden, but a large portion of the character model will be sticking out of a bush in plain view. Everything that is a let down can be forgiven though. The game is really fun and engaging to play.\n\nThe key feature in the game is the time manipulation. Time only moves when you do, or by holding down a key to allow it to progress. You are also able to rewind time any time you wish. This makes the game a more relaxed experience and shifts it from an action game to more of a puzzle game. It gives you time to think about your strategy and encourages you to attempt different ways of handling a situation. Should you make a mistake it can easily be rewound. Some might think this takes the challenge out of the game, but it's more a convenience factor than anything. If you make a mistake in a level you don't have to restart the whole section, you can just rewind to the last place where everything was going well.\n\nShadwen is slightly flawed, but if you look past the little annoyances and lack of budget there's a very enjoyable stealth-puzzle experience to be had. The price is fair for the content and enjoyability to had. if you're still on the fence about it, once it reaches a 50% discount I strongly recommend picking it up as there is more than enough about the game to justify it.","May 22","true","6.9"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","44","53","0","0"

Receiving it for free will not discolor my review of this title.\n\nAs a fan of stealth-action as a genre, I can recommend SHADWEN to anybody looking for casual stealth-action fair.\n\nSHADWEN is the story of Shadwen, an assassin on a mission to assassinate a king; it is also the story of Lily, an orphan girl whom Shadwen befriends at the game's outset, and becomes her temporary ward in a thoroughly grimy kingdom. The fiction is sparse in this one, communicated primarily through animated paintings and excellent voicework. The animations in-game are pretty smoothe (with the notable exception of Shadwen's unpredictable French braid); the kill animations are swift and satisfying. It's a short game, took me only about six hours to complete, but I enjoyed every moment.\n\nVISUALS: SHADWEN is decidedly lo-fi, but in a very charming way. The characters are not rendered in a hyper-realistic style; think more like BioShock, where features are exaggerated and proportions aren't necessarily accurate. The environments themselves are highly reused assets arranged in different ways, but they're all well-crafted, so it isn't a problem.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Sneaking-and-stabbing, if you so choose; otherwise, sneaking-and-distracting. The objective in each level is to escort Lily, your ward, to the end. To achieve this goal, you can either go on a murderous rampage (my style), or you can distract the guards with a variety of traps and tricks. The grappling hook is your friend: use it to navigate the level, or yank distant objects to create a noisy distraction.\n\nI have to say it: the AI is exactly as smart as a bag of hammers isn't. There's an option to let you see the enemy's field of view, but I found it unnecessary. It's easy to guess where their senses begin and end. Stunts you would get killed for in Splinter Cell or Metal Gear Solid are easy to get away with in SHADWEN.\n\nLily is pretty much invincible, and doesn't make a move until the guards are dispatched or otherwise unawares of her presence. Several time she clearly walked into their field of vision, and she wasn't caught; it feels that if the objective is to protect her, there ought to be some penalty for her being detected.\n\nGADGETS: Shadwen can loot various crates throughout the game and use schematics to design weapons to kill, maim, or distract the guards. Personally? I never found them necessary. Once you create the grappling hook, there are very few circumstances that require you to use more than it or your knife. Of course, having the option to use non-lethal gadgets is always great. Accommodates many play-styles.\n\nSOUND: The voicework, as I said, is great. Shadwen is moody and angry, and although the fiction never delves deeply into her past, the story that's there works. There seem to be only a couple of voice actors for the guards, but they have enough unique dialogue that listening to them doesn't get old. The levels are realistically rendered, with watery docks having appropriate shoreside sounds, and crows cawing in the background of high-street medieval living. The music is very atmospheric, and changes depending on your circumstances (gets a lot more intense when you kill someone or are being pursued, say).\n\nOVERALL: SHADWEN suffers from the same problems that afflicted the first Assassin's Creed title: every level plays basically the same. The in-game meshes and assets are heavily reused in different ways, kind of like LEGO blocks: some are harder, some are easier, but all are enjoyable. The up-shot to all this is that the game runs like a dream, and plays especially well with a controller.\n\nRATING: 7/10 - it's not perfect, but it's a decent little adventure for the money and builds a solid framework upon which a solid series may be built. I hope to find out more of Shadwen's past in subsequent releases. Worth the cash, worth your time.","May 20","true","6.5"," 30 of 38 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","30","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/recommended/425210/","gamesear","Gamesear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamesear/","31 products in account","Product received for free\n\nShadwen is a stealth-action game from Frozenbyte, the creators of the Trine series, and while it doesn't feature the same sort of whimsical art style it does manage to perform a miracle of its own, and by that I mean somehow making an entire game based around an escort quest an actually enjoyable, thought surprisingly easy experience.\n\nThroughout all 15 levels you will be accompanied by a poor peasant girl named Lilly that you brought along because... uhh... reasons, and while she isn't able to pull off the same combat and grappling hook manoeuvres as you are she is quite adept at sneaking around, so her presence is never an annoyance, but rather an extra element to the stealth-based puzzle Shadwen presents you with.\n\nWhen it comes to stealth games the first question anyone should ask is: "How good are the controls"? The answer to that is thankfully a positive one as Shadwen always feels instantly responsive and never seems to get bogged down on terrain, though there are some issues when it comes to how the grappling hook works and how it spazzes out when you're trying to swing too quickly. Its not enough to ruin your game given that you can rewind time, but it did impact my enjoyment of the movement system since it never allowed me to go wild with the swinging without some sort of a visual glitch popping up.\n\nAs for the escort quest business, most of it comes down to ensuring your companion Lilly makes it from one shadowy corner to another undetected. You can accomplish this by creating distractions and sending her forward at opportune times, or if you're feeling particularly maniacal, by butchering every guard in sight. This might sound like a herculean task, especially since stealth games tend to be hard enough when you have one character, let alone two, but Lilly operates quite similarly to Ellie from The Last of Us in the sense that guards can't see her.\n\nIn other words, all you need to do is make sure there is a potentially viable path for her to undertake and she will try her best to do so, but if it fails she will simply return to where she was and you can try again. This was a design concession that had to be made in order to keep Shadwen's long escort quest actually entertaining, but it does somewhat cheapen the puzzle aspects of each mission when a little girl is able to solve them without you even doing anything.\n\nAnd if you needed even more help, time grinds down to a complete halt when you're standing still, so you can easily survey your situation and act accordingly without having to rush things. Even if you mess up, however, there is an option to rewind time to any previous point, so as long as you have even a bit of perseverance you will be able to beat Shadwen without too much trouble.\n\nPersonally I found Shadwen to be a far too easy, but not every game needs to be tailored to the hardest of the hardcore, but it is well worth mentioning that those looking for a Hitman-esque style of gameplay that revolves around meticulous planning, open-ended levels, and perfect execution will not find their place here. To me Shadwen feels like an introductory game for the stealth genre as its difficult enough to get your brain-gears turning, but never so frustrating that you would consider purging it from your PC, though this does also means the replayability is fairly low.\n\nThe final thing I wanted to mention, and this one excites me greatly, is the presence of not just modding support, but an entire map editor that comes pre-loaded with all of the campaign missions! If you think Shadwen is too easy, or needs more than 15 levels, now you have the chance to create them yourself, or download some from the Steam Workshop. Here's to hoping someone less lazy than me ends up taking the time to slightly rebalance Shadwen with a more 'purist' approach in mind.\n\nClosing Thoughts\nShadwen is occasionally clunky, and personally far too easy to be something I would ever replay, but I can't deny its charms or the fact that I've managed to binge through the entire game in two sittings. Not because I forced myself to do so, but rather because I had a decent amount of fun in the process, though I'd imagine the fairly short run-time also helped ease some of the repetition.\n\nIf you're looking for a hardcore stealth game in the vein of the Hitman series you will not find it here, but if you're new to the genre, or simply want an engaging "sneak and peek" through a medieval castle that will never grind its pace down to a halt due to difficulty, then by all means give Shadwen a try.\nIts certainly not an amazing game, but there is plenty of fun to be had with it, especially given the budget price.\n\nIf you're interested in a more detailed review I welcome you to either check out the written version I've done:\nhttp://www.gamesear.com/reviews/shadwen-review-an-escort-quest-made-fun\nOr the video that backs all of this up with some pretty pictures:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzdeqNCwwJY","May 17","true","6.5"," 65 of 99 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","65","99","6","2"

Took me about 6-7 hours to finish the 15 levels, I played on easy with a no gadget run. Enjoyed every bit of it, story falls very flat though. Almost not in there.\n\nOriginal Review: 99 minutes and 5 chapters in, this game is a big improvement from the demo, which I was very overwhelmed with even with the strange tutorial videos in it. The finished product however is very good at explaining things, its simple, has a great atmosphere, which is probably its strongest point. After every level/chapter which goes on for about 10-15 minutes, you get a picture of the city with Shadwen and Lily have a small line of dialogue to progress the story, in which mostly for the first five levels they just started to getting to know each other.\n\nYou have to escort a girl called Lily in the game. Fear not however, Lily's AI is great, she knows the waypoints of her opponents, so shes never running into them by accident, if shes programmed to know that they turn around, she goes hiding in foresight, which completely makes frustration not happen ever in this game. Escort yes. But in a good, clean way.\n\nThe technicalities are a little rough around the edges. You can not turn off FXAA by default, you have to go in the Appdata folder for that, which is very strange. Why would I want my screen to be blurred like hell, just so I cant make out any edges?\n\nI encountered a few bugs along the way. I got out of bounds and fell through one spot in the second level, being the first level you control Shadwen in, which can be reproduced every time, but since you can just revert time, stuff like that is no problem in this game - kills immersion however. Also, reverting time while triggering the end of a level, makes you hear the revert sound forever until you revert time again. Stuff like that shouldn't happen.\n\nLast  but not least, the controls are a little clunky. Using the grappling hook to climb can be a big challenge in some cases. Still, totally recommended, I am not a Trine kinda guy, but I am a Shadwen kinda man.","May 18","true","6.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","22","26","3","0"

You play as Shadwen, and the game starts off with you on your way to assassinate the king, and right away you stumble upon a little girl named Lily confronted by a guard near where you’re trying to enter. If I’m an assassin, chances are that I may be a sociopath, so I’m not sure why I would bother helping Lily. Then, if for some reason, I’m not a sociopath, then I would be concerned for her safety and sure as hell NOT take her on my assassination quest that will certainly be dangerous, and where she will be a  liability to both her safety and mine. Either way I look at it, the story makes no sense to me, and I think there are other stories that could have fit the escort stealth gameplay better. Maybe like trying to rescue the girl, and bring her to safety, and not take her further into harm’s way.\n\nAnyway, onward to kill the king, you have to escort Lily through all the guards from one hiding spot to the next to get her to the end of each level.\n\nGuards one-shot you if you are in sight long enough, and if they see another dead guard, they sound the alarm, and you die. On the bright side, you can rewind time whenever you mess up, so the game is very forgiving in that sense. It was certainly helpful throughout the first 11 chapters I played as a pacifist.\n\nThe last 4 chapters, I started killing people in secret, and hiding the bodies, but then a message popped up that Lily saw a maimed corpse. I rewound the game time about 10 minutes from when the message first popped up, and still couldn’t find what she found. I’m not sure why the message came up so late, but I just said screw it and kept going anyway.\n\nThe AI for Lily was inconsistent. She would usually just go on her own with no problems at all, and sometimes even lead me where I needed to go. Then other times she would run back and forth between previous hiding spots for no apparent reason. I would try to command her, she wouldn’t listen or stay; it was very annoying when it did happen, but luckily it wasn’t all the time.\n\nPros:voice acting was done well (especially the conversations between Lily and Shadwen)\nconsistent with most stealth games, where not killing is always harder and more time consuming than killing guards\nthere are some schematics to craft different tools to use\nmusic was alright, but didn’t really stand out as THAT great\nwhether you kill secretly, blatantly murder people in front of her, or don’t kill anyone at all, it feels like your actions do have the potential to change the outcome of the story\nCons:the entire premise of the story is dumb and makes no sense\nguards talk way too much, and it's very repitive and annoying\nguards rarely, if ever, look up - they are also oblivious to the ropes when you repeatedly grapple hook next to them, and through them\ngrapple hooking to climb felt awkward, and often you just hang there not being able to climb up\nwhen grappling objects to pull, you have to move to pull them (the rope wind does not work), which often leads to falling off of narrow beams you are perched on\nnoticeable bugs with textures\nguards behave strangely, and have wonky animations (i.e. bumping into things)\nlevels mostly felt and looked the same (with the exception of about 2 out of 15 chapters)\ncrafting materials are limited, and most of them are lethal, so you don’t get to use them THAT frequently\nusing the time rewind makes makes the game too easy if you plan to kill guards instead of playing as a pacifist\nplaying without killing constantly gets very tedious since you have very few non-lethal tools at your disposal - you will mostly be using your grapple hook to pull yourself higher and to create distractions by moving objects (more tools, and a way to knock out guards by hand without killing them would have been nice)\nThe game took me about 7.5 hours, while playing mostly as a pacifist. There is replay value if you want to try see the difference your choices made, and for achievements. But for as much as I enjoy stealth games, this one had a lot of annoyances, and it’s not that I hated the game, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I would either.","May 18","false","8.4"," 85 of 138 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","85","138","4","4"

I would say it is a good game, and its a good trial for the company to swich the 2D game into 3D. I see some common features with the Assassin's Creed Series so it would be a piece of cake if you have played AC series a lot.\n\nFunny moments:\n\nThe funny part of this game is that, sometimes you need to move the boxes to prevent enemy sights of seeing you. Well, if an enemy spotted you and see the 'Strange Position' of a box, he would investigate it and return after a short time. So if you go with non-killing route, you would probably need to create some Labryinth of boxes!\n\nSomething about the routes: ( YOU CAN IGONRE IT)\n\nI dont want to talk too much about it, but I suggest a pure non-killing route first and all-killing the second. Non-killing route requires more time thinking while killing route is easier. Besides, each route has 2 endings. You can choose to kill/punish the king. The final decision will affact the ending the most.\n\nPros:\nOne of the shining points of this game is the great idea of time flow design! You don't need to S/L wihile you died/change your strategy. It helps me greatly come up with better sneaking solutions.\n\nCons:\nI feel the AIs are kind of stupid,,,(forgive me to say that and I just play with the normal difficulty). In this game, u can only give desitinations for Lily to go. If she was spotted while she was almost at the next cover( bush/grass), she would "Go straight" and the enemies seemed to ignore her. I actually used this 'bug' to help me achieve non-killing record for the first time(non-killing route). When she was spotted or going to be spotted and was  less than half way to the next cover, she would return back to previous one AUTOMATICALLY. I found this is kind of annoying and I always needed to flow back time and gave her more detailed instructions.\n\nNo skills needed and the segments and blueprints are useless. You can still use them if you want, but I just did not use them at all in both non-killing/killing routes. (I will talk about the 2 routes later) You just need to drag the boxes all the time to distract them and get Lily to the destination.","May 18","true","16.9"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

I don't think it's $15 worth though. The graphics are pretty nice, kinda like a fable-esque look to it. (that was actually what made me purchase it :P)  The grappling hook is wonky at times, and to me the most frustrating thing is that when you tell Lily to go somewhere, she doesn't stay. I suppose that's intentional to create more of a challenge, (if you don't want her seeing you dragging a body or killing something)  but I find it more frustrating than fun. The gamestyle seems really cool though as far as being able to reverse time if you ♥♥♥♥ up or being able to grab things to move them. Overall its a cute game, maybe about $10 worth but I suppose the pretty decent graphics make up for the game. So far, I think it's cute if you have a little extra money you don't mind spending on a game you probably will only play once or twice (if you are curious about the story line if you let Lily see you with the bodies) However, if you want something action packed and adrenaline inducing, then I would suggest something a bit more fast paced. I will update as I continue the game! ^~^\n\n***Update: Major Spoilers***\n\nI just finished the game. Another thing I noticed with Lily is that sometimes even though the path is cleared, she won't move, or she will move when the path isn't cleared. The endings aren't very good, in my opinion, but that could be because I'm used to the typical "Yay I did good now my companion will follow me" route. Overall, as I said previously, it's a cute game to play if you're bored and like stealthing around. But you will most likely become very frustrated with Lily at times.","May 20","true","7.7"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

That said, I'm really enjoying Shadwen. The demo, once I got used to the mechanics, proved fun, and the full release is proving to be even more so. The game is a lot more polished and functional than the trailers might lead some to believe, and I've not seen any problems that detract from the experience. Great new game from the makers of the most excellent Trine series.\n\nI was most worried about the 'morality' system - that is, how Lily looks at you for killing guards. Thankfully, unlike Dishonored the system doesn't punish you for killing guards, you just have to hide them and not kill them in view of Lily if you want her approval. The game immediately lets you know when she sees a corpse, and so you can rewind time and fix that if you so desire. Lily in general is pretty smart and sneaky, and requires little effort to manage. Combine that with your rather impressive arsenal of abilites (time control is huge) allows for a fun, not frustrating, stealth experience.","May 22","true","10.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","1"

Killing is easy and makes the sections relatively easy as well.\n\nThe game also has the time stops when you stop mechanic. You can resume time when holding Q if stationary, otherwise you gotta move to move everything else.\nThere's loot in chests that allows you to gather materials to craft weapons and tools. You also need to find schematics first. Your main tool is a grapple hook that can be attached to wooden things. You can also pull and push wooden things as distractions (Trine influence).\n\nThe sound and level design is very nice and you can easily get immersed in the setting but there's a lot of clipping and awkward movement and camera glitches, possibly because of the time stopping mechanic.\n\nThe guards have very crappy peripheral vision and they don't care if one of them suddenly goes missing so at times, trying to not kill them is a really big challenge. They also talk about dark spirits the entire time, another reason to want to kill them.\n\nIf you mess up, you can simply rewind time with R. There are no checkpoints or deaths, you simply rewind time and try again. It saves a lot of frustration and I like it.\n\nOverall I like it because we need more stealth games and this one gives you a great challenge to not kill people. Depending on an AI that you need to escort is slightly irritating but it's not that bad. If I had to give it a score I'd go with 6.5/10 based on 2.6h of playing but that will likely get up to 7.5 because the game has poison darts, mines and a lot of other stuff that can spice things up quite nicely.","May 17","true","2.9"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","30","50","0","1"

I love a violent sweep of the area, picking off enemies one by one, and this game delivers that well.\n\nThings got a lot easier once I realised I could do an aerial kill, and could assign a keybinding to turn off the "pause time" feature. My best bit so far is a long swing on my grapple, jumping off the end and diving into an aerial kill of a guard in a tricky to reach spot.\n\nTo be honest if you are playing the violent way you can forget about the little girl, she just catches up to open gates. I imagine you have to take more care over her if you are playing non-violent.\n\n[Update] I started a non-lethal playthrough, much harder and more annoying. Then I realised you could get the non-lethal ending despite killing if you hid dead bodies from the girl. Now this would be easy if the girl went to the waypoints you set and stayed there... but she had an unhelpful habit of running straight into my murder scenes.\nIn the end I went back to ignoring her and went for a stylish lethal playthrough. One thing I learnt on my 2nd play is that while enemies can normally only be knifed from behind, if you do a tiny bunny-hop it turns into an aerial kill and you can knife them in the face - great when you're taking on multiple opponents on the ground.\nSo I had lots of fun on 2 playthroughs, and even got the hang of traps the 2nd time (You're traps restock between missions, so have fun with them!)\n\n[Update 2] The physics works really well in this game. Rather than just having a few obvious set-pieces, the world is full of physics objects which you can use as cover, distractions or even weapons. So now my 2nd favorite moment is attaching a mine to the front of a cart and rolling it into a group of guards, and my third favorite is pushing a crate of a high ledge to kill a couple of guards then diving down myself to finish of a third with an aerial kill.","May 21","true","126.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Could (and should) be the next big thing.\n\nEscorting Lily is a real pleasure, largely because she never gets into trouble. She is better at this strealth lark than you are, so all you need do is clear a path. One technique I found useful was to get ahead of the play and leave Lily trapped by one or two guards. That way you can kill the guards ahead, hide the bodies and save the wee girl from getting a broken heart.\n\nA wonderful wee game that takes a common element from it's bigger budget bretheren and makes a nicely rounded exploration and assassination experience. Not particularly challenging, but a lot more fun because of that.\n\nThe only real weakness was with the looting/crafting system, which I never had to use.

"Wow, this game is awful," I thought. Then I figured out that that was the mechanic - similar to SuperHot, the world only moves when you do. This is incredibly handy as the game progresses, and indeed is almost essential at some points to make some of the cool grappling hook maneuvers and synced kills (if you go that route).\n\nSome random thoughts on the game:\n\n- The AI is not great, but passable for a Stealth game; not great, laughably terrible at dealing with certain things, easy enough to game once you understand the patterns... but just complex enough to be a bit of a challenge rather than just a time waster.\n- The grappling hook is a ton of fun. The physics around it gets pretty silly at times, but this is a fun adventure game, so that's not really a negative.\n- There's a morality system. And like most morality systems, as far as I can tell it doesn't really matter much. At least this one has the benefit of being unique in that you're not really concerned about whether or not you kill, so much as whether or not you let the little girl see you doing it.\n- The graphics are great, I really like the atmosphere in this game.\n- The guard conversations occasionally made me feel bad about killing them. :)\n\nOverall, despite a few rough spots this game is quite a bit of fun. If you find dumb AI frustrating then you might not get as much out of it, but if you're okay with that then I'd say it's worth at least grabbing and farting around the first level. The modding system looks like it could potentially extend the value of the game further too.\n\nMoney well spent!","May 24","true","11.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's probably not surprising this game is an empty shell of a story with boring characters, but even the features I expected to redeem it were shoddy at best. You might now be thinking, "But... but... what about the _______?"\n1) Grappling like Rico or Spider-man! Yaya!\nNo. You'll fall... a lot. There's no freindly blip telling you what's in range (a sub for depth-perception). Many grapple points are placed just out of reach, requiring you to jump and frantically mash the trigger, hoping your aim is exact.\n2) Time effects! Just like Superhot or Prince of Persia!\nTrue, those work well... as a convenience. Their unlimited use is forgiving to the point of removing fear of failure completely. But besides that, I never saw either time effect implemented creatively. For the most part, you'll find them most handy in taking back those failed grapples I mentioned.\n3) Stealth! I love stealth games!\nI know, right?! Theif 2 was my jam in the day! But the AI and visibility mechanics in Shadwen are a step down from those games, not to mention the sub-par level design.\n\nIn summary, this physics puzzler only parades as an innovative stealth hit. Though not especially bad, it fails in its main selling points. I hope I was of some assistance in clearing up this foggy ruse. See it for what it is, and then decide whether to buy (definitely not worth full price).","May 21","false","1.4"," 34 of 63 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","34","63","0","0"

The items and harder enemies spice things up a bit, but not enough.\n-Lily should stay much longer away from the player/corpses that are being dragged if player presses T. Now I needed to repeatedly press T, T, T and T to hide the body without Lily seeing it.\n-Felt odd that dragging corpses was F and not E which is the most natural keybind as general action button. Had to check the key from menus as the tooltip for it triggered late. Immediately after returning from the menus the tooltip triggered.\n-Ctrl keybind for dropping to ledges and from ledges wasn't taught at all to the player or then I just didn't notice that.\n-Tooltips and hints that pop up to teach player stuff shouldn't be active when on inventory as they interfere with it.\n-It would be good to teach the player that crouch key ctrl is a toggle and you don't need to hold it unless you want the time to pass. Figured it out later accidentally after my little finger began feel strained.\n-Would be nice that the Q key for passing time would behaved more like a toggle rather than hold button to remove finger strains and give player another reason to do it. Create an icon to UI to inform it's current state (similar to the crouch icon) and after character action or second Q press, it would toggle it off. Now holding ctrl does pretty much the same as Q, making Q key feel just a second way of doing the same thing, but with a better finger.\n-Encountered nasty bug: "Lily has seen corpse" message bugged out after time reversing and stayed there forever. That's annoying as now I'm not sure if the game believes that or is it just visual bug.\n+Good amount of haysacks and bushes everywhere to hide corpses.\n+There seems to be good amount of levels and content.\n\nMinor extra nitpicks:\n-Dragging corpses on stairs glitches visually as the guards legs goes inside the stairs.\n-Pushing crates glitches sometimes as the pushing animation doesn't trigger. Happened on the very first crate I pushed on the game.\n-Guards sometimes walk still, getting stuck and don't really work that well with the dynamic crate objects.\n\nOverall I think it's a decent game. 7/10.

Shadwen then makes her way towards kings castle while protecting Lily.\n\nShadwen is a pretty good game with clever mechanics that lets you play it "your way". You can kill everybody (with lots of different ways) or use distraction to advance through levels. Lily will take note on your actions and your choices affect how the game ends. Some thoughts about the game:\n\n\nPROS:\nBeautiful background graphics and modeling\nStorytelling\nEnough content for more than one playthrough\n\nCONS:\n80% of the levels were graphically in pretty similiar environments.

It took me three or four evenings from berginning to end.\n\nThe patrolling guards move as though they have sore feet and hemorrhoids.  Which is to say they move like soldiers in every army since we began killing each other in groups. The town/castle nicely invokes medieval Eurpope.  The milleau thankfully avoids all the magic fluff found in other games set in the period.  The story is adequate.  The voice acting competent.\n\nI feel that games with a dependent NPC are quite involving.  They require different strategies than do more direct _blast through to the big boss_ games.  In fact, being responsiible for Lilly encouraged me to change my play style a bit..\n\nInstead of manual saves the game uses _Save Points_ and  a _rewind time_ mechanismd that I don't recall haveing encountered before.   I found time rewind to be more interesting than other methods, such as serial saves.  It also provides more information since the I could quickly assess where my mistakes. I don't favor save points but these are well enough placed that even redoing  a scene is not particularly annoying.\n\nIf I had to voice a criticism it would be my personal dislike for third person POV.  There is a technical issue uner MacOS Yosemite with the launcher failing to exit cleanly and creating multiple instances of the application.

In Shadwen, you play as an assassin named Shadwen who’s off to kill the king. Along the way, you’ll meet a young girl named Lilly who’ll follow you around, and that’s about it. You’ll stealth it around, kill guards (or not), time travel backwards to reverse yourself from doing really stupid things, (how? Who cares! It’s probably space magic.) all the while trying to make sure Lilly doesn’t find out you’re a brutal, killing monster. We’re not quite sure how Shadwen explains to Lily where all the guards suddenly go to after a death scream, but it’s probably more space magic. That, or the guards are all get brutally butchered by the seven millionth crow which they seem to find is the cause for floating boxes, poison darts, and outright murder.\n\nYes, Frozenbyte is at it again with another attempt at a fully 3D game. For the sake of this review, that other game doesn’t actually exist. In fact, we don’t even know what we’re talking about.\n\nSo yes, Frozenbyte’s first fully 3D game is here, in all it’s really flawed beauty.\n\nWe actually really liked Shadwen, but we have some caveats with the term ‘like’. The game plays similarly to assassins creed in some aspects. Go into hay or bushes to avoid being caught, you can jump on enemies or stab them in the back, you can find some random loot crates where you can use that said loot to craft traps, you can grab onto ledges, you have what could only be described as the hook from the more recent Batman games which you can use to grab boxes and reach certain platforms, and you have a few different ways to go through the game either stealthy or murder everything in sight. You also have the ability to travel back in time to avoid being spotted, avoid Lilly seeing a body, etc. Believe it or not, it’s the more stable of the features in the game, and works out quite well. However, it’s really out of place in the game and as a result, and makes the game feel rather silly. When you’re not moving or holding down a button, the world stops moving around you. Again, it’s really out-of-place and makes the game (and the animations) look really jerky and off. We’re not saying that the time stopping when you stop isn’t cool, but we wish there was a way to turn it off. The crafting is also too simple, and leaves a lot of choice to be desired. The grappling hook also glitches out at points, causing Shadwen to do a superman style pose. Along your way through the 14 chapter six(ish) hour game, you’ll come across a girl named Lilly. Lilly is where the ‘escort mission’ bit comes into play. Lilly will follow you, and you’ll have to find a way to distract (or kill) guards so she’ll come to you.\n\nThis would normally be the point where we go “this is the dumbest thing ever. One of the things gamers like the least, and it’s the main feature of the game!” However, there’s a point of note here: She can’t actually be spotted.\n\nThis was something that was really bizarre. No matter how close a guard is, Lilly can’t be spotted. The only actual ways to get an end-game are if you’re spotted, an alarm is raised, or if Lilly arbitrarily drowns. This doesn’t make the game easier, it just means it’s not really an escort mission game as much as it’s a game where a character follows you. This also makes Lilly as a character both unnecessary and useless as a result. The only real hindrances she has is that she’ll follow you as soon as you kill the guard preventing her from following and you have to move bodies in order to avoid Lilly finding out you’re a murdering, evil jerk if you want the good ending. It does make the latter sections of the game more difficult, but not impossible by any means. The only time we raged quit for a bit was when Lilly found a body in chapter 12 she shouldn’t have been able to see, and she only saw it as the game was fading out. So, we tried to rewind time but couldn’t. As such, we thought “Oh, okay, we’ll just replay the previous level!” Nope. Once she knows you’re a killer, she knows you’re a killer for the whole game, even in previous chapters where she didn’t know you were a killer. We think it’s just a bug, but that didn’t mean we were going to replay the game all over just to get the good ending.  The game is actually quite alright in the other regards of difficulty. Enemies do somehow have pinpoint accuracy with ******* crossbows, but you really don’t have to worry about them until the other half of the game. An idea that we had mid-way through was to just stealth it through as Shadwen, then just play the missions backwards. So if you’re trying to get the good ending for the game, just do that, because it worked more or less every time except on the last chapter. We’re not sure if you’re supposed to do that, but we did.\n\nIt really didn’t help that the AI is about as dumb as a sack of potatoes. It’s not terrible, it’s just really dumb. They either have the eyesight and readiness of killer robots, or they run into boxes and walls. There’s really no in between, and it’s a shame because it makes the game terribly easy or frustratingly annoying.\n\nWe actually liked the guards small talk though. We won’t spoil everything, but let’s just say that the king is really afraid of Shadwen, and some of the guard dialogue references events that you’ll find out about later. She herself is fairly average as a character, but that extra touch with the dialogue was nice, and reminds us slightly of a side quest that might have been presented to Geralt in Wither III.\n\nVisually, the game is fairly average. The textures are over the place in terms of quality, but the lighting is nice. It’s not the best looking game out there, but it has a slightly interesting fantasy style that we liked.\n\nAs for settings and controls, you have an array of different options to choose from. The controls aren’t rebindable, but the game visually has enough options to make up for the lack of control customization. You also have the option of controller or keyboard, and both were acceptable.\n\nSo the question comes down to ‘Do we recommend this?’ and the answer is, yes. At least mostly. The game could certainly use another pass-through with the bug spray, and the AI could certainly use some refinement, but we had fun, we enjoyed the game, and we think it’s worth close to if not the retail price of $16.99. It does have some downsides, but we don’t think any one of them are enough to pass the game up because of them. Overall, Shadwen is a fun (if a bit simplistic), flawed stealth-action game and while it was fun for the first go around, we're not sure if it's 'fun enough' to play again.\n\nPROS •	Simple, but fun stealth action combat\n•	Level design is fairly similar, but diverse enough to stop from getting stale\n•	Nice lighting and background dialogue with guards helps to build atmosphere\n\nMEH •	Music and audio are okay\n•	The minor glitches and bugs present\n•	Lack of enemy variety\n•	crafting is too simple to provide adequate choice to players\n•	Dialogue sometimes repeats, but not too often.\n\nCONS •	Really dumb AI\n•	The stealth element is sometimes a little too simplistic\n•	Karma system with Lilly is too simple, and feels weak\n\n\nIf you'd like to read the review on our website (it's basically the same thing, but with pictures) click here: http://yourwolfsdengaming.com/2016/05/19/shadwen-review-yourwolfsdengaming/","May 19","true","7.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chiper/recommended/425210/","Chiper","-ßЯҢ- Wridel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chiper/","459 products in account","Interesting take on the stealth genre. Gameplay is a lot like Supahot, where time only moves when you do. At any moment you can reverse time to undo your actions, seemingly limitlessly. The majority of the game is using your grapeling hook to swing, climb and move boxes in an attempt to distract guards so that a little girl named Lily can navigate from hiding place to to hiding place. You can also kill the guards by dropping things on them, luring them into traps, or assasinating them, but if the body is spotted by another guard then you lose and have to reverse time to choose again.  There is no story explanation for why this time control is present, you're just meant to take it in stride.\n\nThe game also features a moral compass. If Lily sees you kill someone or encounters a body you didn't hide, that negatively affects her opinion of you, which is reflected in the dialog between levels. It does not appear to affect the story at all, however, and the final cut scene is determined by if you choose to kill the king in a Yes/No question. The story itself is told by listening to the guards as you move through the game. A corrupt and possibly mad king is driving his kingdom to doom, burning the forests and the crops out of fear of "dark spirits", a phrase uttered so frequently in the game that you'll get sick of it. Despite how little story there was, the characters of Shadwen and Lily felt very fleshed out and I felt attached to them. I want to know what happens to them both after the end of the game, and I want to know more about Shadwen's backstory and how she became a rogue.\n\nIn terms of content the game is probably reasonable for its $17 price. It took me about 9 hours to play through without letting Lily see me kill anyone and I feel like I got my moneys worth. However, the game really could have used some more interesting mechanics in the later levels to break up the repetition. Some levels have movable parts of the terrain, but they don't contribute anything to getting through the level and seem to be there just for flair. The most mechanical thing one does in the service of completing a level is to use the hook to pull a locking bar out of a door.\n\nThe game features 9 deployable traps which you unlock by finding schematics in chests, and then constructing the traps from parts also found in chests. However, the traps are not reusable and supplies to remake them are very limited, so the traps end up falling into the "Too Awesome To Use" trope. Every time I used one I ended up reversing time and finding a different way to accomplish the same thing.  The traps also become completely useless if you're aiming for not killing anyone.\n\nVoice acting was pretty good, but not very diverse. There are perhaps three Guard voices, and the same lines get used over and over again as the guards react to things moving in their environment. This becomes comical eventually, as the guards react to things moving right in front of them with "Did you hear something?" The game also suffers from a lot of animation problems, such as the player character going rigid while being whipped around on their rope, or all the guards walking like they have to use the bathroom, and several times I managed to get objects (including Lily herself) stuck in the terrain. This was very frustrating at one point where I lost portion of my progress because a tipped over cart in the previous area suddenly sprung out of the terrain and killed a guard, raising an alarm.\n\nIn spite of these flaws, I enjoyed the game quite a bit","May 22","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Shadwen reminds us of how bad they can be when they are not done right.\nBioshock Infinite's Elizabeth finds you food, ammo, and money, and The Last of Us's Ellie helps you fight hostiles and crawls into narrow spaces to open up secrets and paths.\nWhat can Shadwen's Lily do?\nWell, she can hide on her own, so she does not alert guards, and that is pretty great.\nShe can help you open doors... Which you would not need opened if you were not stuck escorting a child through the city, as Shadwen is acrobatic enough for an Assassin's Creed game, and could probably just have strolled casually along the rooftops all the way to the King's castle.\nAside from that, she can get mad at you for killing people, and if she sees you doing so, you will have to spend every loading screen since hearing her comment on you being a bad person. Which is still marginally better than if you do not kill someone in front of her.\nAnd finally she can rat on you to the guards about you being a murderer (if she has seen you kill people), which (again, if she has seen you kill people) is the whole reason you are escorting her anyway. Because Shadwen is afraid she might alert the guards if not kept under a close watch. Which is why we spend the rest of the game sneaking her through the city, frequently letting her within inches of the guards she would rat on you to.So, your companion is little more than a child-shaped ball and chain shoehorned into the game to give it some semblance of a story, but at least the stealthing is fun, right?\n\nAnd... Yes. Yes it is. The stealth is actually really well done, the guards are not completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as they often are in stealth games, and you have a wide array of options for sneaking around them or killing them as you see fit. You also have a nice grappling hook allowing you to scale structures and swing between ledges and stuff. Pretty fun stuff actually. Shadwen would leave Al'Tair, Ezio, and the rest of the Assassin's Creed protagonists eating her dust.\nYou also have a Superhot-esque feature in which time only moves if you are doing something - or holding Q - allowing you to place your hooks with 100% accuracy midair and do other similarly precision-dependent tasks with ease. But honestly, most of the time it just gets in the way by requiring you to constantly be doing something, and really the game would have been better had this feature been replaced with a simple pause button.\nYou also have a nice rewind time feature in lieu of saving or checkpoints, so if you miss a jump or are discovered you can just rewind time to the exact moment you made a mistake and fix it. But there is no limit to this, so as a result, Shadwen is probably the easiest stealth game in the world. That said, the lack of a save or checkpoint feature also means you have to start from the very beginning of each level if you quit before the end of the level, which are on average ~twenty minutes long, unless you are trying to get the don't-let-Lily-know-you're-a-murderer ending.\n\nAll in all it has a great game mechanics for stealth and acrobatics, so you can really have fun stealthing around, and it might have been a fun game had there been anything to really use these abilities for.\nSadly, there is not much to do in the game except: Get from point A to point B without being discovered.\n\nEvery single of the 10 levels I could force myself to play through is the same. Every single one.\nGet from point A to point B without being discovered by the guards. And yes, you have to bring Lily too.\n\nThe settings vary a little - barracks, dungeon, city streets, back alleys, king's castle, but it is all the same gray stone, brown wood, guards with crossbows, bales of hay, barrels and boxes, and getting from point A to B without being discovered.\nIt got boring after the first four levels, and I gave up all attempts at completing the main story after about ten levels - ca. three hours of gameplay. Judging by the achievements (which barely qualify as achievements - you get one for each level completed, and for doing so without killing anyone or killing everyone, and the same for completing the whole game), there are about fifteen levels, so maybe there is some monumental change in the twelfth level or something that leads to a break in the monotony, and some actual objectives, but I will definitely never know.\n\nThere is a steam workshop integration for making new levels, so maybe in the future we will get some missions worth playing, but until then this game simply is not fun. At all.","May 30","false","3.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Overall score for this game is 7/10. I'll probably play it a bit more, but it's not on the top of my list to finish.\n\nIts pretty. Well, the cutscenes are. The art style for those are rather interesting and very nice to look at while listening to the voice acting. The game itself doesn't stand out as a beauty or any cutting edge. I compare it rather evenly to Dishonored on Xbox 360.\n\nThe gameplay itself is pretty standard for a stealth game, avoid the guards, get creative to move them where you want them, proceed to the end of the map. Nothing much there. Creating different noise makers, darts, or bombs is interesting though. You do have to find parts that make sense for the mechanism you're making, and you can only build a thing once you've found the schematic for it. These can be found in chests scattered around the maps, some are well hidden and some are blatently obvious. Again, pretty standard fare for this type of game.\n\nSome folks in our chat, when talking to the devs compared the look to DIshonored, Tomb Raider or Assassins Creed. Honestly, its not quite that good looking, but close. Again, I directly compare it to Dishonored. The game play is much the same as any of those games, so if thats your bag, you'll enjoy this one.\n\nOnce you get used to the controls for the grappling hook, getting around the maps really open up. It IS a bit interesting to figure out the speed in which you have to aim, shoot, jump, aim again, and shoot... in order to make those cool swings from point to point. But, practice makes this a bit easier. There are a few places that you would think you could swing to, but for some reason it wouldn't allow me to get there. (Could have been off map, or some buggy area that was blocked by the devs.)\n\nI have only one major complain about the time I've spent in game. It's one GIANT escort mission. After the 2nd area, you're stuck with this child that judges you for every "evil" action you make and sasses you in the cutscenes when she sees something she's not a fan of. That much I could deal with, but she's not the brightest AI in the bunch. Granted, there are some places where she got away with walking directly in front of guards that should have been alerted, but more often than not, she was stuck in a bush waiting for a guard halfway across the area to turn around. Supposedly you can direct her with a button press, but most of the time it made no difference. She'd go where she wanted, or go where you aimed her then immediately go back where she was before. There may be missions later in the game where can go solo and get some work done, but for as far as I got, I was stuck with the little twerp.\n\nI'll recommend this to my friends that like these kind of stealth games, and I'm sure my wife will enjoy playing it.","May 19","true","1.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Very pretty, supports 144Hz monitors, and is pretty fun. Very very annoying that you have to hold R1 while not moving in order to pass time, though. In my (4.4 hour) playthrough, I found myself never needing nor wanting to use any crafted gadgets, because enemies were always easily dispatched with the dagger. For this reason, despite the rather grim setting, I can't help but think this game's place is for playing with your kids, as an entryway to stealth games.\n\nThe controls need a lot of work. When you're in the crafting menu, you use left and right on the D-pad to cycle through schematics, and then use the analog stick to select ingredients for the schematic, which is just kind of bulky, and I think they should have made it so that you select a schematic, and then use the d-pad again. As stated before, time stops when your character stops moving, unless you hold R1. I found my right index finger getting fatigued due to constantly holding R1 waiting for guards to move around and such.\n\nLastly, this game is very, very short. It took me 4.4 hours to go through the full game (15 levels) once, that's an average of 17.6 minutes per level. If you're looking for a stealth game that takes patience and skill, go play Thief 1, 2, and I dare say 3. Not the reboot though, the reboot sucks.\n\nWhether or not a game of this length is worth $17 to you is ultimately your decision. I enjoyed the game, but, honestly, I'm having a hard time recommending it due to its short length, and I simply don't think I would purchase it again. I will, however, leave it as a "yes" because I prefer to err on the side of positivity, and because the Trine devs are pretty cool.","May 18","true","4.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

You have a grappling hook and there is usually a large vertical area to traverse each level, making sneaking past guards easy for you.\n\nEdit: At level 13 of 15 right now, 4.6 hours into the game.  This feels very short, and the level design is repetitive.  I've gone the entire game so far without killing a guard, and I don't feel challenged yet. My initial review was from when I was ~6 levels in, but nothing really significant has changed. Story is boring, and escorting Lily at this point feels like a chore rather than a story progression or game mechanic.  Stopping time in a stealth game would only ever be necessary for some getaway mechanic, like shooting the grappling hook in mid air, and holding Q to pass time is annoying.

In this game you play as both the little girl Lily, and as the Assassin Shadwen. Shadwen is forced to kill a Guard in front of Lily’s eyes as she is on her way to assassinate the King for…. Reasons. Through the course of the game you do have options in how you go about achieving your objectives. You can either choose to kill the guards as you go through or, out of respect for Lily, choose to simply stealth around the guards, leaving them alive. These two choices do effect the narrative and how Lily perceives you. DO you care if she thinks you are a monster? Do you choose the purpose-driven route to where you will only kill your objective? Or are you the stone cold killer that has no problem leaving a sea of corpses behind you? It is your choice and you will experience a different narrative for these choices."\n\nOverall I have had a good amount of fun with this game and I look forward to seeing the narrative differences that can be found here!\n\nSee my full critique on YouTube:\nhttps://youtu.be/Rjomzab0Lgs","May 21","true","10.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Lily runs to and fro like a rabbit while you drag half the interactable things on the map around trying to corral the guards (who refuse to see the rope from your "grappling hook" pulling things about) into some corner that makes her feel safe. Assuming you don't just kill them all out of frustration.\n\nThe achievements are set up so that you have to play through 4 times to get them all, including a play through with no kills at all. That was the playthrough I intended to do first, but after playing 6/15 levels in less than 2 hours (more through rewinding and playing with barrells until Lily Rabbit would move than by being stealthy myself) I've decided it's just too easy. Both characters can walk right behind or beside guards without being spotted or heard and the guards don't have the sense to look up or follow a rope.\n\ntldr; Great idea, poor execution. This would have been a great ps2 game years ago, but for a modern title it's just not acceptable. If they finish this (i.e. re-work the a.i. code completely) I'd love to come back to it to see if the story gets better.","May 20","false","1.9"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","4","12","0","1"

In fact, this game is so gorgeous, that it is the first ever game that I ever bought that made me took 40+ screenshots within the first hour of gameplay...\n\nThe only three cons:\n1. The game could be polished a little more. Some character movements are a little awkward. Certain tricky ways to move need some figuring out because of bad aesthetics and glitches between unit collisions and the playable characters. Sometimes it's possible to hide under solid objects like stairs or walls, yes like walk inside the wall and remain hidden... xD But I'm guessing this will be patched up soon.\n2. AI for guards is a little bit too simplistic, I mean even for non-lethal playthrough. What makes the game difficult is the objects and guard placement in difficult positions, not the guards themselves, which should pose certain difficulty.\n3. Gender locked playable characters. I don't like gender locks in any games. Or genderbased classes or playstyles. Game devs should stop with gender locks, this is 2016. And yes I do understand that it requires more resources and funds to create storylines for each gender seperately, but this should be standard for all the games. Diablo3 is good example of how a great storytelling doesn't have to be genderlocked for different classes.\n\nCurrently personal rating 8.5/10\nWhy?\n1. Very low price for such a beautiful game.\n2. Gorgeous.\n3. I love different kinds of stealth or puzzle games such as this.\n4.

"Fire Grapple Using Button 18!" Seriously, how do you let your game out the door with stupid things like that?\nI also hate that you can't just reverse the Y-Axis on the camera without reversing the X-Axis as well, which I found annoyingly counter-intuitive as I tried to aim my crosshairs at precise points for the grappling hook. Lastly, my controller won't seem to perform a stab, no matter what I bind the stab action to. Works fine with the keyboard, though, but I can't stand WSAD controls, and holy crap the mouse responds sluggishly no matter what sensitivity I use. Tried reinstalling the game to see if this would get fixed, but nope.\nThe soundtrack could be a lot more developed; I've heard so much great stuff from indie sountracks lately that this seeming endless loop of the first few notes of "Scarborough Fair" get old quickly.\nIs this a salty review? Yes, it is, but from the other reviews this was going to be a fun little stealth game rather than a frustrating few hours of semi-platforming and stupid guard AI evading.

She says Lily on the way to slaughtering a King and decides it would be best to let her tag along on her murder adventure.\n\nShadwen is a woman that likes to stab things but can’t do it as much as she’d like due to of Lily’s predisposition to corpses. So Shadwen uses ropes to pull objects and bounce them around to distract guards. Luckily, the guards are like little kittens chasing balls of yarn and are easily distracted.\n\nSometimes they don’t fall for the ol’ rope and pull trick and kill Shadwen dead. It’s okay though because Shadwen has the power to rewind time. Did I mention that time doesn’t even move unless Shadwen wants it to? Man, she’s a nifty time traveler but that’s we’re never sure if that’s her powers or just a mechanic in the game.\n\nOh well! Shadwen stalks around in a brightly colored landscape with beautiful textures and a crisp sky. The animations are a bit iffy compared to the surroundings but the gorgeous world allows you to ignore it.\n\nAt least until you begin jumping around on things and notice that the rewinding button was probably placed there for that very reason. Let’s just say that Shadwen isn’t really that good at jumping to different platforms with any sort of grace. If we couldn’t rewind time… there would be lots of people shooting expletives at the screen like Q-Bert.\n\nShadwen is a puzzle game with a stealth backdrop. Get ready to shake a lot of boxes and barrels and tuck dead guys into haystacks so Lily doesn’t see a dead body. Is it the best stealth game ever? Nah. It’s fun though and definitely worth the asking price if you don’t mind sloppy platforming.\n\nPositives•	Puzzle based Stealth design\n•	Beautiful Graphics\n•	Good Voiceover\n\nNegatives•	Horrible Platforming\n•	Some Janky Animations\n•	The story is kind of non-existent\n•	Rewinding time makes the game easy\n","May 17","true","2.7"," 5 of 15 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","5","15","0","0"

You can use your whip almost like the female ninja in the Trine games, climb and stealth a bit like Assassin's Creed or Styx Master of Shadows.\n\nYou want to disrupt the environment as little as possible by killing few to no guards to make it more challenging. I look forward to playing a lot soon, will advise if I encounter any bugs. I got Doom upon release, but played this first.
