That's fixed, great? No. Trying to skip the splash screens will crash the game, and upon (kindof) loading into the first level, it's just a black screen, and alt tabbing doesn't work so you have to go to task manager, only to see "game" is not responding.\nAlso alt tabbing out of the game and back in breaks it, as in there's a blank window on your screen, and closing said window will still leave a Metro 2 process open which continues playing the menu music until you close it too.\nSteam, if you want to be like GOG and sell older games, make sure they freaking work.\n\nOk, now that I've finally got it working (by not running the highest resolution, and turning music OFF), it's not that bad of a game. The guns feel ok, despite lack of iron sights. Movement is meh but it works, though there's annoying head bob you can't change. The body physic when people die are ok, everything else is, well... I don't call it Nvidia Physux for nothing...\nGuns have some kind of ballistics simulation to them. Depending on the surface you shoot at, and the angle, your rounds will richochet, possibly injuring you as well as enemies, which is quite fun and even though I don't see myself using it for anything, it's nice to see.\nLevel design seems kinda meh, I go through the whole level and it's empty, only to go back and find enemies in an area they weren't in before. It seems that you have to go through the semi-open levels in a specific order, so enemies will spawn and other areas will open up.\nMy favorite weapons to use right now are actually the Makarov and the APS, the pistols feel really good to me ingame, though I wish they would shoot faster (yes, APS has automatic mode, but it's burst). And with my limited time on the PTRS41, I like that as well, rounded a corner and turned someone into little chunklets of meat.\nOverall I'd recommend the game, despite the issue I had, I did get it working, and for a 4 dollar game, it's not bad.\nI'm still keeping this as not recommended though, simply because of all the issues I had with it. Steam does need to have some quality control, and stop trying to be GOG.com, selling older games that are barely/not even supported, and/or not telling people workarounds to get it working.\n\nNew additions: After some more time with the game, and replacing the outdated audiere.dll with the newest one, I'm having fun with this game actually. It's definitely worth the 4 dollars, though the trouble I had at the start still deserves a Not-Recommended status.\nI was spraying at some enemies with the PPSH and the richochets came into play, I killed 3 civvies around a corner with them, oops. Nice to see it effects gameplay somehow.\nAlso be sure to save manually all the time, the autosave didn't save when I went to the next level so I had to redo the last one again. (also because it doesn't restore your health between levels, keep multiple saves so you don't screw yourself over in a bad spot)","September 23, 2014","false","5.0"," 89 of 117 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","89","117","5","4"

First off, there are a lots of technical problems about the game, but i am not sure what is causing this, perhaps my system is different, or not fully supported, i had black and too bright textures too, also there was long loading times if i wanted to go main menu, game has been stopped for 20-30 seconds, also had some adventures under the graphics, and for this, sys components are not an excuse.\nThere was some atmosphere in a few maps, but usually they were repetitive and poor looking, game lacks of open areas, there is about 2 of them, one is near the story's start, one is at the Kreml, as far as i remember thats all. Character models also looks the same, there is about 5 total.\nThe menu is so oldschool, no extra useless options, however, naturally the multi player is dead, but this isn't a problem.\nThe menu's music is f*cking awesome, big cheers goes to Julia Lytkina for that, instant fav for me. Some maps have good tracks too, there are also cheap boring tracks, nevertheless the music is a big advantage in my scoring.\nI'd gladly recommend almost all the games that focusing for Singe player story, because we are lacking them these days. TSS's game time is around 7-8 hours in single player, which makes the game worth for a buy on a highly depressed price.","May 28, 2015","true","8.1"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

Narrative is sketchy - it's nice that you are playing flashbacks but out of body experience and changes of protagonists rarely fit the FPS genre; story itself is weak. Graphics are rather good, while animations and voice-acting are trashy. But music is god-tier.\n\nThe most mixed thing is level-design. First half of the game consists of same corridors, same underground stations (but unlike ones from Metro 2033 these are realistic and pretty ones, and not copypasted brown dumpsters full of hobos, so there is some local flavour there) and same train segments, which remind similar level from unreal tournament. While they are really fitting thematically they are very linear and boring. Later levels are more complex, but still, overall game is full of unclear objectives and boring fetches in semi-linear and samey labyrinths. Though sometimes developers really tried to do everything right. Sheer dullness of these levels made me nostalgic for unreal, and i don't even like that game.\n\nTechnically it's stable and works on modern systems, but resolution is capped, alt-tab freezes the game and it can't be played on surround.\n\nIt's ok. At least not another console soapy movie. Still it drags on a little too long.","July 7, 2015","true","6.1"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","19","27","2","0"

And because of that, The Stalin Subway comes with all of the same technical issues of Dusk-12. Fortunately, this time around the games forums were very helpful in providing fixes and I could enjoy this game without too much hassle.\n\nSpeaking of which, enjoy this game I did! The Stalin Subway is a great classic shooter.\n\nGraphics:\nNothing too amazing here, but nothing awful either. In comparison to their other effort, Dusk-12, The Stalin Subway actually looks better. None of the models look too stiff and the game runs fine without too many hiccups. However, in some of the Metro levels the games engine has some... interesting ways of showing shiny reflective surfaces.\n\nGameplay:\nClassic FPS like Quake/Doom etc. You got health/armor meters (though it seems armor drops are extremely rare) and a plethora of guns to use. You can't sprint in the game, but if you want to get across the level quickly you can just jump strafe to victory for a lightning quick way to get down long corridors.\n\nSound:\nRe-used gun sounds from DUSK-12 so all the guns sound pretty weak and rather unsatisfying to shoot. With a new Audiere.dll file, I actually got to hear some music while I played this, and it wasn't bad at all.\n\nStory:\nYou play as Gleb Suvorov, a KGB liutenant. On a routine shift in a secret base, KGB Officers begin an insurrectection against Stalin. The plan on blowing up Moscow with an atomic bomb. It's your job to track down the traitor of the Motherland and stop the bomb!\nPretty simple, and enjoyably shlocky. Stalin himself appears in FMVs but, he doesn't seem to have any idea whats going on or even when he does, not all that concerned about it. The voice acting is pretty brutal here, and a lot of mistranslated lines which kind of adds some charm to it.\n\nOther Stuff:\nBack on the armor thing.. I find it weird that you have an armor meter and start the game 100 Armor, but I only once found any armor thoughout the game. It's like the devs just forgot about armor drops. Either way, it's not a hassle since most enemies drop health items and you shouldn't have too much trouble getting through the game.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe Stalin Subway is a rootin' tootin' Soviet shootin' good time.. GET IT.\n\n","December 27, 2014","true","5.5"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","65","22","34","4","1"

If you skip the opening credits to the game, it crashes. If you minimize the game, it crashes. If you try to bring up steam or xsplit overlay in the game, it crashes. When loading or starting a game, there is a 50-50 chance the game will crash. Same with when you die in the game.\n\nModeling in the game is extremely lazy. All characters I have seen have been one of about 5 variants.\nThe AI is awful as well. Enemies will be standing about 5 feet away from a firefight and not notice. Enemies will rush you for no real reason.\n\nThe level design is also complete ♥♥♥♥. After advancing to the second floor in the game, I was completely unable to figure out where to go next. There were a multitude of completely empty and useless rooms with no real apparent reason for them to be there at all. While the attempt to create an expansive map is appreciated, really it just adds to player confusion and doesn't improve the quality of the game. Not to mention the huge vent system, which, when I explored to see if it was the way to progress from the second floor, took me back to the start. Why such a pathway leading back in the game was included  to begin with eludes me.\n\nI bought this game with the knowledge that it would be awful, and played it because I knew it would be bad. I played for comedic purposes.

There's just some sort of weird charm to them that makes them interesting to play.\n\nBut enough of that: let's get the bad out of the way.\nThe Bad\n- Crashes at random points.  Seriously: for absolutely no reason at all, the game will crash.  On the other hand, it only takes about 30 seconds to start the game and load your last save, so that's not too big an issue.\n- You either have to turn off the music, or replace the .dll file.  There's no way around it.  The cheaply produced, off-European tunes are actually somewhat catchy, so I recommend replacing the file.\n- You can't skip through the splash screens, or your game will crash.  Whatever.\n- No widescreen support.\n- Currently, I'm having some wonky texture glitches that make random parts of the floors and walls just completely black.  Not sure how to fix that.  There is also a plethora of other graphical bugs and glitches as well.\n- There's only about three or four enemy character models.\n- Not quite sure what the story is about (not that I care).  It appears to be some sort of insurrection inside the post-World War 2 KGB?  You're a KGB agent and you're killing other KGB agents.  Or Chekists.  I don't know.\n- Absurdly difficult, even on normal.  However, this is countered by the massive amount of ammo drops in crates everywhere, so you're never short on bullets.\n- Speaking of, it takes a lot of bullets to take down enemies.  It's fine, because the cheesy animations and decent physics sort of counteract the fact that you just sank an entire AK magazine into one guard.\n- There's probably more I could say, but this is what I dragged up.\nNow, the good.\nThe Good\n- The voice acting is so terrible that it's hilarious.  Seriously - you'll have a good time listening to cutscenes and whatnot.\n- Guns are pretty satisfying.  Decent list of weapons at your disposal.  Sound effects are cheesy and low-budget, but what do you expect.  The Shpagin is probably my favorite: straight up spraying bullets everywhere is pretty fun in this game.\n- For an older low-budget game, the graphics aren't too shabby.  You get what you pay for.\n- I actually really dig the effects - destruction, physics, etc - in this game.  Sure, it's no Havok or Euphoria or whatever, but the setpieces are pretty nice.  Ricocheting bullets, shattering glass, blowing out portions of the floor and wall, etc.\n- Just a good time, Russian shoot 'em up.\n\nSo, in short, yes, the game is plauged with technical errors and glitches.  But if you can pick it up for cheap, and you're looking for a straightforward shooter, then this isn't your worst bet.","February 8, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For me, there's some sort of charm to this game, one that I can't really describe. Playing with friends made it better, since we enjoyed laughing at all the game's flaws and inaccuracies. In the end, it's a sort of guilty pleasure game.\n\nYes, the textures are crappy at times, and the voice acting is pretty bad, but that's all part of the charm. It's a game to be made fun of, while blasting away rouge KGB and GRU forces.\n\nPlease note: I understand that this game has problems when you first start it up, my suggestion (and the one that fixed the crashing glitch) is to disable music. After that it was smooth sailing..or rather subway riding for me.\n\nWould I recommend it? I suppose I do, but even for this low of a price, I'd say wait for the sales.\n\nHowever, for the love of god, don't bother with this game's sequel.

I didn't and got black screens.\n\nThis game is dated as it is from early 2000 techno, perhaps earlier. It feels like a cheap Half Life but with crappier animations and worse sound effects.\n\nThat said, the game has a kinda style to it that you don't see much. Mostly I think because it was made in Russia, and was one of the few games that came out during that time. The art style is typical East-European \ Russian in the sense that the colors-scheme's are sober and not Disney-like. The best part though is the objects in the game. They actually feel authentic for that time (1940's). White plates and cups were common objects then and are in the game, simple chairs, locking mechanics. It all adds up to a authentic feeling.\n\nGameplay itself is like a corridor shooter. On easy you can walk up to a guy and shoot him in the face without much getting much damage yourself, which is a bit too easy. Weapons feel ok but not great. All in all a game you need to want to play, be it just for the style.\n\nRecommended therefore just for the authenticity, for great gameplay load up something else.","September 24, 2014","true","1.9"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","0"

And the brief, mysterious, indescribable noises you hear without visual accompaniment when you first launch the game really help to build the atmosphere of being a blind man trying to navigate a confusing world of communist dictators and underground rolly-mabobs.\n\nThe Stalin Subway stands tall with the other legendary AAA titles of this era of games that strive to make their audience FEEL things.  Mass Effect made us feel companionship and intrigue, The Walking Dead (Season One) made us feel desperate and saddened, and The Stalin Subway makes us feel blissfully confused.\n\n10/10, would bleach again.\n\n(To those interested in trying to get the game to work for realsies, I found that I could get the actual game to appear to navigating to the game's folder within 'steamapps', right-clicking 'metro2.exe', going to "Properties", then "Compatability", and then checking the "Disable desktop composition" checkbox.)","November 24, 2014","true","0.3"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","48","16","33","10","0"

In « The Stalin Subway» you play as KGB officer Gleb, who gets involved in a conspiratorial plan in Moscow of the early 1950's. Some regime enemies plan to kill Stalin by detonating a nuclear bomb in his personal bunker in Moscow. As heroic Gleb it's now up to you to save that mass-murderer's ♥♥♥ and the whole population of the city from getting pulverized.\n\nOf course you do so in blowing away « traitors» and other dubious henchmen. The action is uncomplicated and straight-forward; grab your SKS rifle and fight your way through the Metro-2 underground system. No real puzzles, no alternative routes, no deep conversations, just another linear low-budget FPS. Don't buy this game if you're expecting a AAA title with excellent story and presentation. The music is nothing noteworthy as well; a bizarre modernized version «March of the communist brigades» as the menu theme and some outdated techno tunes during the later parts of the games sound definitely out of place for many western ears...\n\nBut everything else that « The Stalin Subway» offers turns out as quite enjoyable. Ever dreamt of blazing away traitorous KGB soldiers with your PPSh-41 and tons of other Soviet guns? And the whole thing in subterranean Moscow during the 1950's? Then give this game a go.\n\nJust remember to install the official patch for Windows 7 and upwards. It works for both this game and its horrible sequel « Red Veil». And no, don't buy the latter game. Unless you really really want to know how the shallow story goes on. Honestly, don't buy that crap.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Some detailed surroundings\n+ Good selection of weapons\n+ Fast-paced and uncomplicated action\n+ Interesting setting and background story\n\nThe Bad:\n- Strange selection of music\n- Unspectacular ending\n- Rather short\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Again horrible tech support by publisher.

I really liked that bullets can deflect off surfaces and do damage to the player and enemies and the guns look nice. But they never fixed all of the major ingame bugs. It was too short and the graphics was barely passable at the time it was released. The concept was neat but the game is not acceptable. Luckily it is really cheap and is always on sale. 5.5/10 would skip!","June 1, 2015","false","5.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

None of it has been fixed or improved, it's all still there. Once again you have to replace the audiere.dll in the game folder with an updated one, once again the highest resolution you can play at is 1280x960, once again ridiculous flickering and black textures all over. Why are recommending this game for Windows 7 then? Both, Vista and 7, still can't handle this old game properly. Don't even think about playing it on 8/8.1. The developer on Steam isn't listening to me at all, even if you speak in russian to him. I know he's perfectly aware of it all, he's just refusing to do anything about it, yet making cash out of this broken mess is perfectly fine, Don't forget about the huge release delay, in the end it was not worth the waiting. Beware of the upcoming games from these developers, no matter if it's The Stalin Subway Red Veil, Hellforces or The Hunt, the will all keep the problems they had back then. You've been warned, avoid this.","September 25, 2014","false","8.8"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","1"

It has a punishing difficulty and the levels are a bit repetitive but fun nonetheless, one can play much worse games than this IMO.\n\nMy critisisms are that I had to fix this game before I could play and there was a level which was bugged so it wouldn't end, the one where you were chased by a train, had to replay that level a few times, so be sure to make a savegame at each level start.","August 22, 2015","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game was half-a$$ed.\n\nAlthough slightly repetitive, the soundtrack was pretty catchy. I liked the assortment of weapons, the overall concept of the game, and also trading cards, however the cons outweighed the pros. Some levels are literally a copy-paste job, textures are bleak, and the enemies are ragdoll clones that sometimes fly around the room with only a few shots fired at them. The English translations were wrong multiple times and the voice acting was cheesy. Oh, and glitches.\n\nThe Stalin Subway had a potential to be a great game, but considering that it was done in 2005 makes me wonder why it couldn't be polished further (with the availability of technology) to become a solid Russian hit.\n\nLet's see if the sequel to this game is any better, but this particular title I do not recommend unless you're getting super nostalgic.\n\n4/10","December 26, 2015","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
