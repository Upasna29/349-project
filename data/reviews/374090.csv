Seriously, they are underselling their product by calling it a trilogy.  Sure, it's a trilogy of games, but that one game "Winter Sports" contains 11 different games and 18 disciplines.  The other two games, biathlon and downhill skiing, are included in Winter Sports as well, but the mechanics are not as detailed as they are in the solo versions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pWhZed2qr8\n\nThe best part here is that Winter Sports 2009.  It contains Halfpipe Snowboarding, Alpine Skiing, Ski Jumping, Speed Skating, Biathlon, Bobsleigh, Luge, Skeleton, Figure Skating and Curling.  Each one of these sports is done very well, easy to understand and play in arcade mode, but they also include competitions, career, and campaign modes.  There was so much content here that even playing 1 race in each mode took 1.5 hours.  That's substantial, I can't wait to try out some of these other modes as well!\n\nThere was only one flaw out of the whole package: in Ski Jumping 2007, it detected my secondary monitor's resolution instead of using my main monitor.  Specifically, I game on my primary 1080p display and my secondary is a 1680x1060 display so I was not able to game on my primary in true 1080p.  I'm sure if I disconnected the monitor it would have worked, maybe I could have used a config file or done some other workaround but that was the only issue I had.  The Biathlon 2008 was pretty good but since it's included in Winter Sports 2009 anyway, it is no loss if this happens to you.\n\nA strong recommendation, especially at the current sale price.","September 10, 2015","true","1.6"," 48 of 54 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","48","54","4","14"

For $5, it's great value and a lot of fun.\n\nWhat's frustrating is that the game does not explain its mechanics properly to you. After playing for a few hours, I now get 95% of those mechanics, although there are a few questions I still have about how a few things work.","September 11, 2015","true","31.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","0"

The game is slightly dated and not able to provide 1980X1080. It does provide some interesting commentary and some fun individual events.\n\nWinter Sports Trilogy is (I think) an Olympic game. Though not all winter sports all available to play (such as Hockey), the game will provide some replay-ability and fun. I'll start with my absolute favorite sport in the game : curling. Much like bocce is on grass, curling is about the same on ice. Most controls throughout the game are quite basic and most time is spent either setting up or executing quick button presses. In curling, you (as the thrower) throw the rock down the ice and inform your teammates when to sweep. There are two skiing events : downhill and jump. The downhill is relatively fun and they've added a few more buttons to make it immersive (carving and crouching).\n\nThe jump is quite basic where you need to keep your balance as you're going down the ramp and in the air. Landing is also another skill required to successfully complete the event. Biathlon is a neat event as well where you have to keep your heart rate below a certain amount or else the player begins to fatigue. Going up and down hills your HR (heart rate) will change and the frequency in which you press the buttons will need to adapt as well. Shooting is quite simplistic and the ability to hold your breath also exists (as most sniping games). Crouching is also available in the event and is extremely useful when going downhill to rest your character. Speed skating is an okay event where you essentially have to press two buttons synchronized with the skaters legs. Snowboarding is another okay event. They literally took the fun out of it as there is no real freedom. You can move around on your own will and jump when you need to jump. When it comes to a skill or a trick, they give you one and you must obey their QTE (quick time events). This totally took the fun out of the event as you leave real time a few times during the event. Luge is pretty basic and specific in where your launch matters and where your steering is really difficult to control (especially with a keyboard).\n\nUpon starting, you have to keep in between two orange lines that are marked on the ice. If you start getting too close to one side, the side of the screen will slightly blur to indicate you are too close to the walls. Even though this event is a bit dull, it does gives the player a bit of insight into the sport. Skeleton is essentially the same thing. Figure skating has the camera following the performer and while they are doing their tricks, the user must complete QTE's which comes from the left and right side. Lastly there is bobsled which closely resembles luge.\n\nThe visuals are okay and not completely out of date. Although a bit boxy at times, a lot of the animations (such as the dancing mascot) is appreciated. There is an atmosphere thankfully. The sounds are okay and are suitable for what they are supposed to signify. The announcer are completely another thing. There is an English guy then an American sounding ex-athlete who consistently banter about random topics. The English dude will talk about the sport and commentate (at times). To fill the void, the English guy will start bringing up controversial topics about the ex-athlete how he got called a "bendeho" by an Argentinean diplomat while he was performing. Some of the conversation topics will have you scratching your head wondering how did this sneak into the game. The menu is pretty easy to navigate and provides most of the options you need for adjusting options. I have to admit, they did a pretty damn good job here. Only complaint is the same song they use over and over.\n\nOverall, not a bad game. I would (HIGHLY) recommend purchasing on sale as I got this game, Axis football and a few other games for under $3. It is not the greatest sport game in the world, but may be the only thing for sport enthusiasts on steam.\n\n\nRATING : 6.4/10\n\n\nGameplay	B-	Story / Campaign	B	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	B-	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C+\n\nScreenShots :\nA glance at what the menus look like\n\nThat lady in the backs job is to simply guide where my rock goes\n\nSWEEP...

If you like to get told how much you suck and that the world is better off without you then these narators are doing a perfect job :P\n\nThis is intended as a serious game, but it is so cheesy in many ways that you can't take it serious while playing it.  Because of this I am thumbing this game up, the game is (unintentionally) funny like a cult B movie or an FMV game.\n\nAnd to be honest, it does have quite a lot of content for a small price, even though the gameplay and controls feels like a 10 year old game.
