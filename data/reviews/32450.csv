Some say this may be better because it allows for more of a free-roam experience, but it led to confusion at times when searching the overworlds for certain stages. Plus it's required that you know what character are needed for each level, if you one that is equipped with the wrong item, you have to go back to the overworld, grab a character that fulfills the required item (eg. shovel, whip, bazooka) and only then can you advance.\n\nOverall I would give this a 7/10. Again, I can't be too critical as this game is meant for kids, but it does seem significantly easier than previous installments in the LEGO game series. Maybe just completing the story you may find it a little lackluster, but with that being said, I did have quite fun completing it too 100% and suggest anyone pick this up if it ever goes on sale. Usually Lego game are at a consistent $20 which, in my opinion, is pretty steep, BUT if you ever find it at 50%-75%, it really is worth it.","April 24, 2014","true","27.5"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","43","48","0","1"

Boys, was I wrong! All the levels from the first three movies have been completely re-created and they managed to make The Crystal Skull interesting, despite it being really not as a movie. Also the in-game sections between levels got major improvements, now being half hubs and half open-world: all the bricks (not only red now, but also green and blue) are here, all the races are here, all the characters are here, most of the fun is here. "Free Play" in levels is different from other LEGO games too, and more interesting IMO. I could never stop telling how much I liked this game.\nI played all of the Traveler's Tales LEGO entries on Steam bar one and Indiana Jones 2 is one of the best 5 (maybe 3) and for sure it's the best of the "Old" games, the ones published before 2011.","March 29, 2015","true","22.9"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","28","31","0","2"

So just to be clear for anyone else wondering this is an all new game, half the game is based on the Crystal Skull and half is based upon the original films. This has all the good things I have come to expect from LEGO games and is a lot of fun. I have not seen the Crystal Skull so I didn't really have much idea what was going on through those parts of the game, I'm not sure what was the madcap zaniness of LEGO and what was actually from the film. The interesting thing to note about this game is it a little different to the other LEGO games. It is divided up into separate chapters which have separate characters to unlock. The levels are shorter and the freeplay mode has been replaced by a treasure mode where you have to solve single puzzle. New characters and vehicles are unlocked by finding stuff in the level hub. All in all this is very different to the original and still great fun so I would recommend getting both.","September 25, 2015","true","18.7"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","20","21","3","0"

Labcoat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LtLabcoat/","1680 products in account","Haha, so Indiana Jones 2 is considered one of the worst Lego games, and it's like that for two reasons:\n\n1: There's very little secret hunting. Normally a big feature of a Lego game is that there's HUGE amount of hidden secret objects to find, but this one scraps it completely - instead, replacing it with more levels.\n\n2: The game really loves featuring stuff that weren't in the original movies at all. At ALL. Like, just about every chapter ends with a boss fight with a big monster (despite obviously not being in the main movies), and that's just an example.\n\nIt's still good, mind you, and still worth getting if you're a Lego game fan, but if you haven't gotten the other Lego games you should really pick a different one.","January 28","true","15.5"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","19","22","2","0"

It's very rare to see this on sale so if you're a fan like me, I'd suggest just buying it now.\n\nSpecific areas lack of certain sounds and glitches can fall in your lap sometimes, but it runs better than Vanilla Darks Souls (at 60 FPS in 1080p). Before you make a comment about the Crystal Skull, let me just say it's actually a good movie...when everything's Lego and the characters speak gibberish. Some of the most memorable levels are from Crystal Skull. It just somehow works. This is coming from a guy past even his teen years. Like the Star Wars saga, Lego's take on Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull makes more sense than the film ever did.\n\nYou can also play through a second batch of the original films. If you've played the first game, forget what you know. The combat in each is revamped, vehicle chases are more fun, and the cutscenes aren't just ports from the last game. You can also build your own levels, but without Steam Workshop support, I can't see this being a selling point in the digital age.\n\nVery much reccommend this if you want a pick up and play experience with few laughs mixed in.","October 5, 2015","true","2.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"

Most levels last around 5-8 minutes, for starters, compared to the past were most levels averaged out like 15 minutes or so. Each "world" consists of 15 levels, 5 story levels, 5 "post-story" levels, which are levels you play after finishing the story levels, and 5 bonus levels. I really enjoy the post story levels because you get to come back to the level after you beat it with everything changed after what happened in the story level. Take for example if you're playing a level, and something explodes near the end of it, when you come back, the level would be charred and burned from the explosion, which is super cool.\n\nHowever, the fact that there's 6 "worlds" in this game makes the formula get a bit stale quickly. If you're an extreme LEGO lover, as well as a sandbox lover, I'd pick this game up. Otherwise, I'd pull out a chair and wait until this game goes on sale. I've only seen it on sale once...\n\n8.5/10","August 19, 2015","true","21.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

(I also owned the first title but thats a different story) Then when I got lego worlds but didnt have the system requirements, I was quite disappointed then I thought about this game. I love lego games and played almost all the lego tiles and this has to be one of best of them. This game introduced free roam in multiple hub worlds from the movies. It's also the only lego game to have a level creator and "Choose your own adventure" (create your own story mode). This game also shares humor which made me chuckle. Story levels might not be as long as regular levels in various lego titles but still makes story mode playable and fun. I managed to 100% the game but I use level editor and "choose your own adventure". In the end, Lego game still advance but I still think this is the memorable fun and entaining lego game of all time","June 24, 2015","true","78.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/32450/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Lego Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues is yet another LEGO game, still by same Travellers Tales, released in 2009. You still can't die, you still mostly play to break bricks and collect studs, there is still no online multiplayer. still same casual game to play with kids.\nIt also came out for Xbox 360, PS3, Wii, Nintendo DS and PSP. Nintendo DS and PSP versions are most interesting. This time they both are based on what appears to be different Indiana Jones LEGO games. Like, exploring the island, where into each stage that you go there is some LEGO NPC that will ask you to do something. Core gameplay is still same though. Yea, DS is a bit worse.\n\nActually, it's not true that it's same old. Well, things I already mentioned are same, yes, but they changed stuff up, which some liked and some didn't. And LEGO games as franchise have a big problem of getting stale, at least going from 2004's Star Wars to 2008's Batman, that COD and Assassin's Creed will look more fun. So any change in gameplay is a good change. Or at least this is what I get for playing these games solo as adult. Don't blame me, memories of Lego Star Wars when I was younger made me belive that I will love it all up. Otherwise would had never purchase any knowing that I can't die.\n\nThe level design got changed completely. There is no single huge hub. You got instead a bunch of separate hubs for each Indiana Jones film, with Crystall Skull having 3 parts. And each of those hubs are bigger and got more interesting stuff to do than global one in previous LEGO games. The only bad thing about them is occasional lack of direction, when you don't know into which way to go to arrive to the next level. Each hub now has 5 story levels and 10 non-mandatory ones. Levels themselves are now much shorter, taking only single screen. Some of them are boss-like and some are vehicle-focused. Story levels also don't have Free Play options, all the puzzles can now be immeditly solved, which I found really nice, as I always felt in previous LEGO games that I am wasting time in Story Mode so I could then get everything in Free Play.\nIf forget that they don't have any collectibles aside from studs in story mode levels. So it actually doesn't really does was I hoped for. Well, gee.\n\nIt does mean less reasons to come back to level and less collectibles in levels themselves. So, depends on what kind of person you are.\n\nThey also introduced mechanic where when you play in local coop, the screen will split apart if you go too far apart. This one stayed in franchise. For good reason.\n\nVehicle physics got more complex. Well, I mean, not controls, just the way it simulates physics, rolling around and such. And they became less responsible. It feels like it was made with vehicle story levels in mind, since there you have to ram every other vehicle, so all the chaos is pretty fun. Shame that only one level of those had cliffs to ram stuff into far below. However, there are bonus challenges in hub world where you must beat a lap by going through gates within time limit. Now this is where worse controls mean much less enjoyment.\n\nThe first three films are also different. Which is good, because the previous Indiana Jones LEGO game came out only year ago before this one. Developers took big liberties and decided to mess with people who not only watched movies, but played previous LEGO Jones too. Lego-mimic of Lego-mimic. Actually they took liberties with 4th film too, but it's still more similar than what they did with the first three here. Though, the parts they took for the first three parts are quite random, not even most important ones.\nSo yea, owning both LEGO Indiana Jones games will not feel like you purchased same thing.\n\nBut the most unique part of this LEGO is level editor! It is nothing like your old FPS level editor, it's simple pick-up-and-put stuff, though it's still good enough for many ideas. You can customize characters look here too, like in previous games, and you can combine levels you made into bigger campaign.\nSad thing is that it doesn't have online way of sharing levels, it's still something local thing. Enjoy with a kid, they love such stuff.\nA more sad thing is that it never was implented in future Traveller's Tales's Lego games ever again, as far as I am aware.\n\nWhile still a casual if-you-have-friend-or-just-kid territory, if you are into this franchise, then this title is completely worth owning just because it's different and because it has the unique level editor.","December 20, 2015","true","7.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Now, for Lego Indiana Jones 2...I welcome the change in pace and in general formula but it's a damn shame than most of it is a failure. The change in the process of redoing a level to collect treasure is a nice idea but limiting you to two characters (the ones that you have currently) makes an unnecessary frustration when you have to find the level on the hub, enter it to find who you need, get out, find the two characters that you need (who are wandering in their own part, beside the group of Indy's friend that is always around you) and then redo the level to get the one treasure, that whole process, done 5 times per zones gets tedious very quickly.\nThe driving in itself is not terrible but the physics and collision surrounding it is so shot it must have been sabotaged. Your vehicle constantly turns over on its roof and then waits up to 2 seconds after the car is still to get back up, sometimes, your car will randomly fly up on the other side of the screen, for no reason and when it happens 2 to 3 times per time you use a car, it gets very grating. I like the idea of finding and destroying things in order to get the special bricks, do the race to unlock characters (if the collision in car wasn't so horrible) and I liked the revisiting of the levels after the events but I wouldn't recommend that game to a die-hard fan of the lego games.","July 29, 2015","false","30.6"," 10 of 24 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","10","24","3","0"

If they had done that herewhile tacking on Crystal Skull, I would tell you to buy it at full price, even if you already had the original. (Especially if you have it on CD instead of STEAM.) Unfortunately, they gutted the gameplay of the first 3 movies to make room for the level creator, even though there was more than enough space.\n\nPart of the major appeal of the other LEGO games is hunting for minikits. That joy is gone, as is being able to enact the movie with other characters in Free Play. No more running around as someone from a different movie, collecting stuff[/i][/b].\n\nThe level editor is nice, but not being able to share your creations makes it rather a waste of time. About the only way I can think of for others to play your levels is if you can hack through and copy your save file, then email it to someone.\n\nTaken as it's own self and by itself, it's a pretty good game, but all the changes from the original make it unworthy of calling itself a sequel.","January 18","false","10.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
