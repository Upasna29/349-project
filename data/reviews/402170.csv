"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071861833/recommended/402170/","76561198071861833","Gaben's Emissary","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071861833/","56 products in account","--OVERVIEW--\nI just got this game on release day, and I must, say, it's surprising! Puzzle Ball is, in essence, a spiritual successor to marble-based games like Marble Blast Gold, Ballance and Marble Madness. Being a lover of Marble Blast Gold, I thought that this couldn't hurt and gave it a try. After playing with a few of the scenario levels and checking out the level editor, I must say that this game is amazingly fun for 3 dollars. This game is not as much of a skill platformer as others in its genre, but is more of a puzzle, like the name implies. Figuring out the order in which to accomplish challenges for a high score is important, as some points can be permanently missed if you don't do them at the right times. However, there is never so much chalenge that you will get angry at the game, as the game does live up to its "casual" tag This, the beautiful graphics, and the relaxing music combine to create a surprisingly fun experience, as watching each levels' mechanisms come to life is fascinating, and there is some satisfaction in completing each level.\n\n--THE EDITOR--\nIn addition, the level editor is quite easy to use, as the description states. It is a simple "pick block and place" style editor. However, the camera and controls of the editor are a bit weird, so there is definitely room for improvement there. Other than that, there isn't too much for me to say about the level editor, as I'm not into taht sort of thing.\n>NOTE: There is a "level budget," so you cannot make infinitely big levels! :(\n\n--MENUS--\nThis is where my criticisms start. After launching the game, you will be treated to a small graphic informing you of the controls. There seems to be no way to bring this up again besides restarting the game. After dealing with the graphic, you will be treated to a menu with no logo and four buttons: "Levels," "Editor," "Options" and "Quit." Clicking "Levels" takes you to a bland screen with the 11 scenario leves shown, with the options to look at user levels. Clicking "Editor" throws you straight into the editor with no options or preparation screen. Selecting "Options" brings you to an options screen where you can edit your screen resolution, quality (idk what this exactly means), your languages (choices of English, Russian, and Dutch), something called "Image Resolution" (I really have no idea what this does), your sound/music volumes, whether to be fullscreen/windowed, bloom, and SSAO. There is no way to rebind key controls, although they are standard (WASD) and you shouldn't have trouble with them. While the menus certainly are functional, they are bland and lack depth; but as this is a 3 dollar game, it is acceptable.\n\n--PROS--\n>Interesting gameplay\n>Very nice graphics\n>Relaxing music\n>Infinite replayability with the level editor\n>Good learning curve\n\n--CONS--\n>Only 11 built-in levels\n>Lame menus\n>Some typical functionality missing (rebinding controls, advanced graphics, etc.)\n>Small music selection\n\n--VERDICT--\n>9/10<\nDespite a few flaws, this game is simply astounding for 3 dollars. Enough levels come bundled in to keep you busy for 2+ hours, depending on how slow you take them, and if you get bored after that, just wait! I'm sure the community will make some great ones soon. If you enjoy chilling out and rolling a marble (technically a ball, it's made of wood) around, then this is a definite reccomendation for you! Thanks for reading!\n\n(If you didn't like the review, I'm sorry! This is my first one EVER. Trying to get better at these...)","October 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","30","32","3","0"

The sometimes Russian text is a small bug that shouldn't take too much to fix. I'd like to have access to all the levels shown in the preview video, there are definately some missing from this first release.\n\nGraphically the game is fairly good, I am glad to find others who like this genre enough to create a game and add a level editor.. I have to say thank you for that.\n\nNow, there says there is a Multiplayer option, but I cannot seem to find much information about it, or access it in game, any Ideas? - Also this would be perfect for sharing user-created maps surely?\n\nAnyway, for £1.99 - If you enjoyed Ballance and fancy something simerlar.. Buy Puzzle Ball.","October 19, 2015","true","1.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I wish this game was even remotelly as good as the game it strives ti copy - Ballance , but its not. Lame puzzles that will sometimes leave you stranded , thanks to poor level design that lets you go to the end of the level before you have activated all the check points , making you unable to complete the level and go back , leaving you with the only option of restarting. I wont even go into the whole "the menu is in 10 different languages" rant , as other reviews have covered it enough,I was hyped for a Ballance clone on steam and I feel ripped off to the extreme.\n\nOn the plus side: Controller support has been partially implemented so there is that. You still cant navigate the menus with it but at least you can roll that ball into a dead end.","March 31","false","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Let me explain:\n\n- Menu's: Well, to be honest, if you press options you don't even get options.\nThe sound itself is standard quite loud and you can't turn it down in-game, which is annoying.\n\nLanguage: The game is supposed to be available in 3 languages; what I consider 3 languages:\n3 fully completed texts in different languages.\n\nWhat this game give: A weird combination between Russian, English and German. I forgot to take screenshots, but I'm pretty sure I've seen 3 languages in the same sentence a few times!\n\nAll in all: It's a fun game, it really is and I honestly do like it.\n\nHowever: it's unfinished, only has like 13 short levels, feels a bit expensive for what you get, and I think it belongs in early acces instead of in a full release.","December 24, 2015","false","20.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mario11168/recommended/402170/","mario11168","MarioDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mario11168/","249 products in account","This game is pretty bad, but for $2 it's hard to argue with. I don't know how many people these days have played or even heard of Ballance, and I have no idea how many other games are similar to Ballance or what Ballance got its ideas from, but Puzzle Ball feels like a worse made version of some of those other marble puzzle games.\n\nEither way Ballance is rather old, and doesn't have a level editor. The puzzles in Puzzle Ball are pretty fun though extremely easy, but with the level editor the possibilities are endless but since I'm not a creative type I doubt I'll see much use out of it.\n\nWhat makes the game bad? The music is terrible, a mouse cursor always flashes in the middle of the screen, the menus overlap, there's no 'next level' option when you beat a level, you can't actually close menus in 2-player mode without exiting the stage or restarting the level, deaths are rather meaningless since there's no lives or penalty that I can see, and only about half of the vital text is in English, the other half in Dutch or something. This made the tutorial totally useless, but the idea is pretty easy: use WASD or the arrow keys to guide your ball to the end using two other ball types (a stone and a paper mache ball) to solve the various puzzles. Each ball is better at different things, like paper being able to go over water (but wood can't float enough apparently) and stone being able to do some heavy hitting and fall through glass.\n\nOther irks are the vertical split screen, horizontal would do better on some monitors and having the wider angle is easier to see anyway. It takes too long to load a level, I don't know why it has to do each individual block over the course of 10 seconds (and this on a not-weak-by-any-definition computer). The level editor has a block limit (come on we're on the PC here) and I wish a few of the graphics blended in a tad better. There aren't nearly enough actual levels (or scenarios) which I'm guessing is the purpose of the user-made levels, which, as you expect, range from absolutely terrible to waste of time impossibly hard. I also seemed to unlock achievements while idling on the home screen, and I'd get the same achievement 13 times after that. Weird.\n\nWhat's good about it? The controls are good, the graphics are good, the puzzles are good, and this game is cheap as Puzzle Balls. Value wise this is a great buy, but game wise it still needs work and feels unfinished, or at least "we worked hard on this game, it's close enough, let's release it without smoothing out the rest" finished. So far best Steam Wallet buy but least favorite marble puzzle game buy.","October 7, 2015","false","0.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
