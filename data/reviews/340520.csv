Then my goal was to conquer the double digits which is when I started realising that approaching enemies with a little more tact goes a long way.\n\nPositive thoughts so far (from a laymans perspective):\n\nReplay value! The randomly generated levels and loot provide a different challenge each time\nwhich means no muscle memory re-runs. It also leads me to...\n\nRandom Loot! As a Diablo 1 fan this will win me over every single time. That little chance of acquiring something godlike and turning the local sprites into a fine red mist is a feeling that can never be surpassed - even if only for a couple of levels.\n\nHectic weapons! Ok, i'll admit it... curiousity and repeated deaths on my part killed the cat: Sarcrificing all the kittens and going god mode early on has proven enormously entertaining - especially with a suped up katana. Teleporting wildly throughout the level hammering the ♥♥♥♥ out of Mouse 1 and leaving explosions of red pixels in your wake is enormously entertaining.\nBut don't get carried away - in the mid teen levels even 100HP won't keep you safe if you're too reckless which leads me to...\n\nIt's challenging! Particularly if you let those purple shooty ogres stun you - so watch out for them because they'll end your streak in a matter of seconds - especially if you encounter a special room.\n\nIt's intuitive: Ok there's a starting room that basically spells everything out for new players if they wish plus a comprehensive help menu BUT if one doesn't want their hand held then the basics are there from the get-go: "you have an axe", "you have a shield", "there's an enemy", proceed... and it builds up very naturally introducing you to new obstacles, enemies and bonuses without any Office Assistant type interruptions.\n\nA couple of constructive criticisms:\n\nIn the future it would be great to see new wall textures. I'm down with the pixel-gritty style of the whole game but I feel the large, repeating block textures used to make the walls let the atmosphere down a bit - particularly as the game progresses and there's no variation. These contrast quite strongly with the detailed sprites, effects and background wall textures.\n\nI'm on the fence with the music - in some ways I want it to be more atmospheric and dark to match the dungeon crawler theme but at the same time it definitely fits the slightly retro art style, hectic combat and humour. I think a happy impasse would be to introduce a wider selection of background beats and ambience in the future - perhaps with event cues - eg hydra music. Maybe some music that creates a stronger emotional response from the player... get that "awww ♥♥♥♥" feeling going on....\n\nThe combat is actually pretty good responsively - when I go wild with the axe it feels like it's connecting with an enemy as I click the mouse - especially when they 'splode - BUT perhaps there's room to make killing blows feel more satisfying? Get the "Crit Crunch" effect or something similar to really make it feel like you've katana'd an elf so hard she created a sonic boom? I remember this being enormously satisfying in Baldurs Gate.\n\n(bear in mind i've only played as far as level 15 - we will probably all look back on this post at level XXXXX in the future and shake our heads at how naivie this sweet summer child was to what awaited him.)\n\nWow - that was way longer than I was planning - a fridge full of vodka and ginger ale leads to a night of tireless typing.\n\nAnyways - fantastic work, I would certainly recommend it to any curious readers - the price is a steal and the gameplay makes up for any graphical reservations anyone might have a thousand fold.\n\nLooking forward to seeing what develops in the future!","March 4, 2015","true","33.2"," 63 of 66 people (95%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","95","63","66","6","2"

On the surface the game looks fairly simple.  Mash the attack key when you're in someones face, block when neccessary, dont stand on spikes or in fire.  Try not to sacrifice the kittens.\n\nMy key advice?  Block.  Block all day.  Block like your life depended on it - it does.  Also, don't go overboard on the Katana - it'll get you into trouble.\n\nVery enjoyable game, my new go-to when I feel like packing half a dozen frustrating deaths into a 15 minute break.","March 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","30","31","7","0"

Check out my video review!\n\nPros:\n_Game plays really really well: The combat is really satisfying because your character attacks as quickly as you tap the button. Jumping is floaty but you can do it indeffinitely (so it's like your character just have a jetpack on all the time). Blocking is instantanious and feels precise. Overall, this game plays like a dream.\n_Good sounds: Music is barren but manage to never feel repetitive or annoying. The "voices" (which are just made up of random tones, kind of like Animal Crossing's voices) are also really charming.\n_Random rooms: Every room is randomly generated. So if you're into that, then you're into that.\n_Great weapons: The weapons aren't just reskins. Every type of weapon you pick up alter the way you play the game rather drastically. For example, picking up the Katana will allow you to teleport to enemies when you attack.\n\nCons:\n_Looks kinda bad: if you just judge this game on screenshots alone, you won't want it. The game looks bad, especially the environment. Animation is bare-boned as well, but that might be there to highlight the responsiveness of your attacks.\n\nPros/Cons:\n_You can sacrifice kittens to gain health. Yup. You can do that.\n\nOverall, you'll like this game if:\n_You like 2D sidescroller that focuses more on combat than platforming.\n_You like Rogue-likes.\n_You can look pass the janky graphics.\n\nIs it worth $15? It absolutely is worth 15 bucks. Wait, what do you mean it's only $5? IT'S 5 BUCKS? WHY AREN'T YOU BUYING IT ALREADY?\n\nShameless plugs time! Did you like my review? I do more than just that.

However, unlike many other roguelike games, there's no handholding, there's no carry-over of skills, it's just, "Here's the dungeon, Tiger. Go get 'em."\n\nWhile there's a bunch of random events (which seem to be tiered, as in only certain events spawn after a certain number of levels), there's not much to it, after that. It's the same enemies, the same completely random drops, the same walls even - but the gameplay is just so good that none of it even matters.\n\nFirst off, You're just dropped into the game and all of the configuration is done there. You can fiddle with it any time you want, as there's usually a town portal in most of the rooms. Want to not be able to use potions? Want to have enemies get double health? You got it, thanks to the dude in the town room. You can even sacrifice kittens for a permanent health boost. Any time. You can just go there and murder a baby cat. For health. For free. That's a service you usually have to pay for.\n\nDid I mention the controls? They're so tight you'll have to ask if they're legal. It's like the only rule when making the game was "When they hit the button, the thing that should happen when that button is pushed HAPPENS, DAMMIT." You can literally flappy-bird your way to success if you feel like it. The floor is lava, go nuts.\n\nThese folks pretty much focused just on gameplay. Don't let the looks fool you. This game turns from Binding of Isaac into a 2D Serious Sam so fast you won't have time to even notice the graphics, as you'll be infini-jumping and flamethrowing and grenade-throwing and rocket-launching and ice-wanding to even care.\n\nThis game is so bananas, even Gwen Stefani is like, "DUDE."","March 7, 2015","true","3.7"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","22","28","10","1"

Katana is good weapon but it can get you quickly into trouble since you move where the enemy is in split seconds.\nMy personal favorite weapons are ice staff, flamethrower and rocket launcher.

The reason I do this is because every so often, I find a game like Tallowmere!\n\nI absolutely love this game. It's equal parts fun and frustrating. You really learn and develop your tactics the more you play. You have to figure out the best way to use your weapons, and what weapon is the right weapon to use in any given situation, and even once you've learned that, you have to be careful not to get too cocky or careless, because mistakes can kill!\n\nThere's nothing better than the thrill of demolishing enemies with the katana, or raining grenades down upon the unsuspecting mobs below, or sneaking up behind and stabbing an enemy with an emerald dagger. You find a rocket launcher for the first time and go nuts with it! Then you realize that the subtleties of the ice wand are sometimes preferable, even if the wand doesn't have the launcher's range.\n\nYou die. You die again. You curse the mobs and you curse yourself for not being good enough to get past the mobs yet, or making a stupid mistake. You quit the game in frustration. But then you go back, because you know you can take everything you've learned and make it a little further next time, and sure enough, you do!\n\nIt's so wonderfully retro in that it's the sort of game that you just have to keep working and working to perfect your reactions, your tactics, your skills. It's brutally unforgiving when you mess up, but your willingness to soldier on and learn from those mistakes is rewarded when you post a new top score on your personal scoreboard. It's got all the punishing beauty of a classic arcade game. Instant favorite game for me!","February 2","true","22.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

I made the mistake of thinking that the katana made me invincible but in fact enemies still target you when you teleport so you will die if you don't pay attention!\n\nThe premise is simple, Lady Tallowmere sends you into her newly made dungeon (funnily reminiscent of Adventure Time but not sure if that was in the dev's mind!), with each room being harder than its precedesor.

The dungeon rooms are randomly generated, as are the items and weapons that you'll find inside the chests throughout which means that no 2 runs are ever the same. The game never takes itself too seriously and the dialogue is generally pretty funny because of it. There is an interesting system where you have the option of, ummm, sacrificing kittens to grant yourself more base health. While this makes the game easier on the player, it places your end score in a different ladder. A neat little twist on difficulty adjustment in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I rate this game an 8 out of 10. I'd go higher if it were for the totally obnoxious yellow gas cloud traps that are rampant throughout and if the enemy AI was a bit stronger. All in all though this is a fun game and for under $5, I totally recommend it. Especially if you're into the rogue-like genre.","March 4, 2015","true","9.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sincostang/recommended/340520/","sincostang","SinCosTan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sincostang/","187 products in account","There are roguelikes and rogue-lites that are difficult, but satisfying because of their polish and depth. There are also roguelikes and rogue-lites that are difficult, but unpolished and lacking in depth. This game qualifies as the latter.\n\nThis game is plagued by repetition and artificial difficulty. Its repetition stems from the lack of variety in dungeon creation, the lack of diversity in the weapons you'll be using in one run, and the lack of enemy variety. Starting with dungeon creation, I'd like to say that I'm a roguelike enthusiast and I have an appreciate for randomly generated environments, as well as difficult games that require you to learn and think critically... when they are done properly. Many roguelikes include exceptions and special cases in their procedural generation to aid the player and the eliminate unfairness. Tallowmere, however, does not take this into account. In my short time with the game, I was forced to take damage because of poor trap placement; I was required to drive my body through saw blades to progress, and I was forced to sit in poisonous gas to reach certain areas. The often awkward and clunky ways in which the dungeon walls affect your movement has already had me slamming my face into spiked walls, which litter nearly a third of the walls in the game and are placed thoughtlessly.\n\nWhile there are numerous weapons, the weapons you'll be using almost exclusively are those that benefit from your armor. If you have a shield that confers +5 damage to ice wands, why would you be using anything else unless strictly required to do so (which is often based on the poor dungeon generation qualities mentioned before)? On top of that, many of the weapons have strange and inconsistent interactions with enemies and the environment. If an enemy is near a wall and you're trying to take him out with a melee weapon, you're just as likely to hit the wall and be immobilized for a second or so.\n\nEnemy diversity is, at least within the first 15 rooms or so, very lacking. You'll be fighting the same 5-8 enemies over and over, and a number of them aren't even distinct enough from other enemies to qualify as their own entity. Further, the inclusion of the "Ogres," the potion-throwing annoyances that can end a run without even showing up on your screen by stunning you, are dreadful (in the bad way). If the developers saw a need to include a potion specifically designed to ward the frustrations of one enemy, why even include the enemy? Additionally, the potions are heat-seeking and they go through walls (they also speed up the longer they're in the air, but that's a different frustration entirely), which, for me, at least, was extremely off-putting and difficult to adjust to.\n\nThis game looked interesting to me; it looked sort of like Magicite, but the $5 price tag made me wary. Then, I thought, many great roguelikes and rogue-lites are free or cheaper than $5, so I gave this game a chance. My conclusion is thus: this game feels like it's in a very early beta stage. It feels like nothing in the game works the way it was intended to, but that the developers decided that it was fine to release anyway. The game is a total mess, but really only because of some issues that have simple fixes. It's a game I'll be keeping my eye on, but it's a game I won't be enjoying any time soon. If you're a fan of polished and satisfying roguelikes/lites, I would stay away from this game. However, if you're not so familiar with superior roguelike elements and you have $5 to drop on a cute time-waster, this might be the game for you.","June 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

However, I got a bit of enjoyment out of it, so let's go through the Pros and Cons:\n\n\n+Addictive: If you're the type who delights in combat in which you are invariably victorious, you'll enjoy this game, with its rampant explosions, fancy level up decals, and flying chunks of gore.\n+Variable Difficulty: There are options in place that let you make the game harder or easier. They exist, but I haven't really felt the need to use them.\n+Weapon Variety: There are several classes of weapons that (despite their incongruency with each other and/or the game's hardly-there theming) are actually pretty unique when compared to each other.\n-Cheap Shots: There are two actual threats to you in this game: Ogres that throw purple stunning potions, and Elite enemies, which take much longer to kill and do a lot more damage. This is how Tallowmere does difficulty.\n-Enemies, or, a lack thereof. There are maybe seven enemy types in this game. They all do one thing, and have no other features other than that.\n-A lack of direction. There's a character called Lady Tallowmere. She has a dangerous dungeon. You go into it. That's it. OH NO SHE GETS KIDNAPPED! Oh you just rescued her. Oh look, weird potions on the ground that do inexplicable things. They're gone by the next room. That's all the story you're getting.\n\n\nI could go on, but continuing to write this is like continuing in Tallowmere: increasingly boring and relatively pointless.","May 16, 2015","false","1.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","0"

Now with all of the achievements gotten, I wanted to do a quick review over here. Now let's start!\n...\n...\nYes, the intro is short and not very informative, but I'm writing this at 12:28 AM, what are you expecting?\n\nActual review:\n\nWhat is this game? Just what it advertises from its long-♥♥♥ trailer: a rogue-like platformer where you explore rocket launchers and shoot stuff with dungeons. Simple, yet... well nah, that's pretty simple, mate, pretty simple. Did I mention the trailer is unnecesarilly long?\n\nThe gameplay consists of a never-before seen elements before: platformers and rogue-likes. Never have I ever heard one of these combos before(coughSpelunkyRogueLegacyRiskofRaincough). With that out of the way, you esentially guide your hero through a never ending room generator, splicing/chopping/burning/booming your way to the top of your personal leaderboard. You also have a shield, which blocks damage from upfront and the interesting mechanic of infinite jumps. If this does not sound enjoyable enough, you can pretty much attack your foes at the speed of sound. That means god speed already. If this still did not leave your mouth watering, then we move to the next point.\n\nWhile progressing through the game, you will need to upgrade yourself, and the loot you get will mark your run a LOT. The diversity in weapons is surpisingly big, not that I have the same thing to say about clothing, headgear and shields, but if I have to take some picks, if you haven't seen the trailer already, daggers that make you invisible, katanas that teleport you like a maniac and rocket launchers 'cuz why not.\n\nThe weapons are the icing on the cake for me, as every start with different weapons makes you change the playstyle and I love that! Not only that, but as you progress from room to room, you will need some upgrades, and here come the tiers in play: from uncommon to other-wordly, these tiers offer the weapons and armor all sorts of different stats, from simple resistances to health on kill, health regen etc. What I do not like is the fact how all of these stats are the same for everything. What do I mean by this is like, sure you have this dagger that grants hp on kill, but this shirt does the same thing too. You can also have resistances on the dagger and increased damage on the shirt, makes no sense. At all. In my opinion this was outright lazy, but hey, it's stackable, so I don't really brag too much on it. Just throwing my 2 cents in there.\n\nMoving on to the enemies, all I can say is "few, but diverse enough".\n\nA problem I seem to keep stumbling on in rogue-likes is the amount of powers the mobs have. For some examples are being how many reskined stats chasing enemies you can encounter, ranging from low health chasing enemy to high hp chasing enemy. That kind of problem is only to blame on the devs' lack of ideas, and that's not a thing we have to be ashamed of, we all run out of original concepts at some point, yet creativity is always replenishable(in most cases anyway). Back to Tallowmere, the enemies here are well designed, ranging from simple archers to huge ugly insects that catch you with your tongue and drag you half a kilometer to it and their thousand of friends below them. Heh.\n\nThere is a catch here though, and that is some of the room generations. The RNG in this game is to make rooms with either a lot of nothingness or a lot of corridors and blocks, and some of the enemy placements can outright ♥♥♥♥ you up, and not having corresponsive loot, you can wave that run goodbye. While you can still be very resistant to normal enemies, the champion ones are dangerous and a high priority target in your eyes at all time. These guys are normal enemies that glow red, are a bit bigger in size and deal more damage coming up with a x10 on their health bar, too. If there is one thing that can end your run in this game, it's these guys, and let me tell you, some champions are terrifying(leapers beware ;-;).\n\nThere are also bosses in this game, and what can I say? Use the shield a lot and just spam the rocket launcher and GG.\n\nThe lobby might not seem the most interesting of areas, but many things can happen here, such as:\n-Challenges! One suited fellow will like to get you on a wild ride of "x weapon" only runs or even some disabled stats.\n-Challenges of death! These aren't necesarilly challenges on their own, but they do affect your normal runs, which include no hp regening(ever), less damage, more enemies, more champions etc.\n-Kitty cats! If you suck at the game, you can take one of these cute kitties on your journey to wonderland! Just kidding, you take them out and gut them to death. But hey, you get +10 hp for every kitty slain! You sick ♥♥♥♥.\n-And lastly, Lady Tallowmere! She is a more interesting character, as if you have the chance, you can go back to her when hurt and she will fully heal you. I say interesting, as a lot of rogue-likes tend to be tough as balls, with random health drops and what not, but having the opportunity to leave your enemies as damaged as they are and you to return with full strength is just lovely in my eyes, I really enjoyed this concept, and I still do.\n\n\ntl;dr This was a quite short review, if you read this first you're a lazy person. But, let's say you're in a hurry for some reason and you want the verdict: Tallowmere is a game that gave me what I expected, and that is what it advertised. While some room generations can be a real downer and the game is played pretty slowly, each particular weapon feels fantastic to use, the item effects can turn tides and I can't stop smiling from using the rocket launcher. Ah, yes, I forgot to add the fact how you can shoot a rocket launcher at the speed of sonic. It is not satisfying, but very satisfying. Overall, Tallowmere gets an 8.5/10 from me. Perhaps it'll go to to a 9 once I try the android version, which I cannot wait, but for now I can't say I regret buying this game at full price, and I recommend both casual and hardcore parties on getting this whenever possible.\n\nThis has been your random reviewer, signing off, and have a nice day!

The game also has a quirky sense of humor, plenty of blood and gibs, and a surprising number of Zelda references. There's a lot of good stuff to be found here, and I've only scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.\n\nThe only real downsides come from a few really annoying enemies, a lack of online play, and the fact that it only gives you one save slot, which it deletes when you die. I lost a really nice Legendary flamethrower because of this. :X Other than these complaints, which are relatively minor in comparison to all the things I like about the game, I would definitely recommend this.

You run through procedurally generated dungeon rooms one by one, slaying the enemies to drop a key to the next room. It sounds simple enough, but it gets very intense the more you go in. The game can quickly run from walk-in-the-park to hair-pulling difficult in the time of one room change, and when you die... You're dead for good, having to start over from square one. One of the really neat things I've seen in this game is how the random generation doesn't apply only to items/equipment and the dungeon rooms themselves, but also to the objectives. In one playthrough, the 7th floor required me to slay the mighty Hydra, while the second runthrough I was asked to retrieve Lady Tallowmere's flag. This is a really nice thought by the dev, as it keeps it more interesting in terms of what you have to accomplish to advance throughout Tallowmere's brutish dungeon. This is a very fun game that has hours upon hours of playability in it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves Rogue-likes, Rogue-lites, and Metroidvania-style RPGs. Although at times it can feel a little frustrating, you'll quickly notice the fun factor easily overshadows these moments.","May 6","true","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a game that really wants you to go in swinging, presenting frequent opportunities for frenetic action that will either leave you alone and surrounded by the viscera of your enemies, or bleeding out on the dungeon floor.\n\nYou like to double-jump? Heck, go ahead and do it ad infinitum -- you can basically fly. Your weapons swing/fire fast and deadly, and your shield can block most shots perfectly. So, you feel powerful, but there's still a great challenge, because the levels and enemies are just as unforgiving as the power curve is generous.\n\nIt has its rough edges, and definitely has the feel of a one man effort. My biggest gripe is with item selection -- you hit up and down on the game pad to choose your weapon or item, which is both easy to do on accident and easy to lose track of. You just picked up two new weapons; quick, how many taps to get back to the ice wand when you need it? Oh no, you accidentally selected your only health potion and used that instead? Too bad. Yeah, that could definitely be way better. Also some annoyances with the game pad setup (it detects a different device as player 1 than most other games, and at one point my triggers stopped working and had to be remapped). I wish they weren't there, but they don't stop me from playing at all.\n\nTallowmere provides nice bite-sized action if you want it, or a more substantial progressive challenge requiring practice and skill development if you want to go deep on it. I think it would appeal well to fans of Spelunky, so if you like that game you might give this one a try as well.","March 4, 2015","true","3.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The graphics are so crisp and lovely to look at. The gameplay, at least to me, feels like a bit of a mix between Rogue Legacy and (at least the combat in) Terraria. The combat is very satisfying. You can attack as quickly as you can click the mouse/ press the button.\n\nThe game works really nicely with a controller, and although it feels like a lot of multitasking at first, you'll quickly get the hang of smashing foes from left to right all the while using your (might I say) vital shield to protect you from incoming attacks.\n\nThe movement is incrediby fluid. While I would like it if the shield switched directions if you press different directions, it does make some things easier, such as backing away from enemies.\n\nThere appears to be quite a number of weapons, all the ones that I have used so far have been really neat and responsive.\n\nThis is definitely a high quality rogue-like game which I think will share the same pedestal as some of the greats currently available. It doesn't feel like a cheap game, which makes it more than worth the price considering some of the features such as randomly generated rooms that get bigger and more challenging as you progress. There's a lot of loot, a lot of waypoints for you to teleport quickly to be healed entirely for free and then return, all within a few seconds.\n\nThis game has so much of what I look for in a rogue-like; number 1 being replay value. The dungeons are apparently endless, so you basically just progress as far as you can before submitting to your inevitable fate.\n\nThere is also infinite jumping and lots of sparkles.

The only thing stopping you from running full-tilt into all danger is the presense of ogres who throw stunning potions that home in on you and never ever miss ever, requiring you to use the shield, but since you can buy 5 minute stun-proofing potions for half a ha'penny they're not an issue either at later levels.\n\nNo weapons have attacking speeds, they go as fast as you can mash the attack button (which is the left arrow key for no discernable reason) so there's really no reason to not nuke every room with a rocket launcher and grenades from several lightyears away. Boss monsters include a giant cat who fires shots that you have to block before you attack, a giant flying robot which requires you to block his shots and then attack, and a giant three-headed hydra that has you blocking shots and then attacking. You can see we have a very diverse spread there.\n\nThe first 25-30 floors have events sprinkled throughout them to make them interesting but after that the next 20 or so  have nothing but more empty space and more of the same seven monsters to fight, three of which do nearly the exact same thing and two of which that do the exact same thing entirely. I also wasn't kidding about empty space because the levels are completely 100% randomly generated and a lot of the time it's nothing but a giant room full of enemies shooting undodgable lightning and stun potions. The generator for the levels is painfully lazy as well, traps can be placed in any spot, so when a giant circular saw is in the middle of a hallway with no way around it you're just going to have to take a hit. Additionally, the generator isn't polished enough to make levels that would always be completable with a finite jump height so they just made it so you can jump eternally like you're using a game genie instead of actually putting effort into improving level layout.\n\nWhen I got to hour two of this game I thought to myself, "This is actually pretty good for an early access title," but then I remembered that this is supposed to be a fully completed game and I began to furiously rub my temples in shame and regret. Don't make my mistakes, kids.","March 5, 2015","false","3.7"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","25","49","0","1"

It's been a long haul for him, and I'm super impressed with how amazing he managed to make this game. Tallowere is ---one of my favorite--- my favorite rogue-like game, for sure. It has some original enemies that stay true to the rogue-like dungeoneering theme while still being unique. The rooms, while not impressive in some ways, are procedurally generated. You'll never have a run that has even remotely the same rooms. The difficulty definitely ramps up as you proceed from room to room, and Lady Tallowmere can definitely screw you over with bad stat gains or bad weapons/other items, but it's totally random. If this run you only get three health gain as well as only a basic katana, next run you might have more attack then health as well as an EPIC rocket launcher. It's nice to have so much replay value in a game like this, I am nowhere near tired with it and while I only have about 20 hours on the Steam version I have played countless hours of Tallowmere while in development and while being sold on IndieGameStand.\n\nPros:Amazing gameplay\nDefinite curve in difficulty as the game progresses\nUnique rooms every run\nVaried weapons and stat gains (every run, again. I'm going to stop now :P)\nInfinite replayability\nVoices and other sounds are amazing. Lots of time spent on these for sure\nLocal multiplayer with multiple controllers. Definitely a pro, spent a long time playing with other people, especially with  my PC hooked up to a TV.\nCons: Art is kind of meh, but who can blame him? It looks good enough and carries the point across. Well done in my book.","March 4, 2015","true","20.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdentityNon/recommended/340520/","IdentityNon","TRU±Identity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdentityNon/","287 products in account","For 5$, Tallowmere is an absolute indie gem. The graphics (read: tilesets) are a bit repetitive, but they are good. Grungey yet crisp. I feel like the character's sprite art (this includes weapons/armor) could be a bit better. but to me, this seems like a stylistic choice. The focus is on the gameplay...so on to the gameplay...\n\nIt is almost like a 2D platformer meeting an oldschool arena shooter like quake or unreal tournament. The movement is a bit slow, which is fine. Tactical yet makes things challenging. The twist that reminds me of the oldschool games, however, is the ability to jump infinitely, floating through the air like a maddened butterfly throwing grenades and shooting rockets. For those struggling, there is a hilarious and very saddening (for some) mechanic that allows you to make the game easier, be that for learning or for casual play, do note that this puts you in a different highscore bracket. There is a variety of weapons and enemies that will all change the way you interact with them slightly, keeping things fresh and interesting.\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is the tutorial...or lack there of.\n\nLet me explain. It doesn't hold your hand and let you go through a cheesemode scenario where you kill one bad guy and as you work your way through the platforming mechanics to get to them, it spews dialogue at your face that you can't skip, and its voiced, and assumes you are an idiot. No, Tallowmere respects you. Tallowmere gives you a few NPCs you have the option to talk to or not, some helpful unobstructive messages at the top of your screen, some kittens, and an escape menu to view tips and tricks before sending you on your journey. If you like games like Rogue Legacy or Legend of Dungeon, or any rogue-lites/roguelikes or fun action platformers, you will probably love Tallowmere.

Though I personally am not a fan of the starting over after death mechanic (at the very lease, instead of saves perhaps implementing a "revive token" that is very expensive from vendors to allow people who have progressed to have at least a second shot at some of the more challenging areas), the randomly genorated nature makes each new adventure in the game different enough from the last that it's still a fun game to return to.\n\nIf you want gameplay or a more in depth review, check out mine here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro_rEF5j4DY","March 4, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is a great idea in theory but 4 things make this game a DON'T BUY:\n\n1) The animation is truly terrible. This is coming from somebody whose first video game system was an Atari 2600! Video game sprites from the 80's had 2 frames of animation for movement. 30 years later, we can offer at least that much! With almost zero animation (but the odd super-cool flame or blood effect), it feels less like a video game and more like a comic book with no dialogue or storyline. It removes a lot of the fun and immersion. Original roguelikes have zero animation as well but they have a lot more depth in their mechanics, which I will get into later.\n\n2) If the animation is not there, at least give me some variety in enemy attacks. Most enemies are just long-range attackers and that makes each run incredibly dependent on weapon drops. The grenade and rocket-launcher are so useful and everything else...not so much. The other weapons each have glaring weaknesses and your game is reduced to spamming grenades and rockets from an extremely far and safe distance. If that is the gameplay, I really don't need monsters and shields and tactics. I can just shoot rockets and grenades into an empty pit and listen to the explosions, right? Shallow mechanics.\n\n3) The dungeons have a random layout, so nothing was designed with playability in mind. This sounds like it will always be fresh but it is often frustrating because you cannot see what you are walking into and you can end up dead in an instant. You can move slowly to avoid trouble but you can easily trigger an impossible situation where your death is nearly guaranteed unless you slaughter all monsters in an instant or make an amazing escape. Of course, this won't happen if you just carpetbomb all open spaces with grenades and rockets.\n\n4)  No static unlocks. This is easily the worst part of Tallowmere and it kills the game. Playing a game that starts over from the beginning every time is fine if it is an arcade experience. But arcade experiences do not have random death from procedurally-generated dungeons. Imagine if you put a quarter into an arcade machine and the game randomly just blew up your ship after 2-5 seconds? If you cannot save the game and no levels or gear or stats carry over, you need some sort of progression via learning the game. Even a fighting game that has no saves and random enemy strategies doesn't have random enemy attacks. Chun-Li's kicks will not suddenly do more damage because she is a randomly "higher-level/big-head" Chun-Li.\n\nTL;DR The challenge is supposed to be random, not the fun.","March 10, 2015","false","9.4"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

The vertical gameplay and ability to really customize your game at the start of a run feels fresh for a genre that has a lot of the same concepts, and the weapons all act rather differently, making you really want to change up the weapons per situation.

My advice to anyone who is thinking about buying this is to save your $5 and get 5 to 10 more dollars and buy vagante or catacomb kids. but even then those are both early access(a wave wich needs to die) so the content is also limited and the full games wont be down till like 2 to 5 years from now (im looking at you starbound!). id pray to the heavens for more content but lets be honest,thats not going to happen.","March 13, 2015","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You must arm yourself, paint the walls with the blood of innocent guards, take their possessions, and feed their souls to petrified demons to increase your power. To make things more entertaining for herself, Lady Tallowmere occasionally joins them in tormenting you by forcing you to fight her malicious pet, summoning huge monsters to attack you, doubling the patrols of guards you must slaughter, or distorting the flow of time itself. When you inevitably die, she will cackle and create another clone to set forth.

The game is very accessible in the various options and gameplay areas.  If you find the game too hard, sacrifice some kittens and get 10 more HP per kitten killed!  Yeah, yeah!!!  It's a terrible thought, but it works well for this game.  IMO, the dev's made a rogue-lite game that works for many levels of gamers!  That is a great feat in it's own right!  If you find the game is not hard enough, there are a ton of options you can turn on or off.  The game is very configurable and that makes it fun for a lot of people.\n\nThe graphics are good for a pixel art game and look better if you turn on Anti-Aliasing.  They have a flat look to them during the turning animations, but this is not developer laziness, but part of the graphical charm of the game.  The controls are very tight and you have full control over your character during jumps.  You can use the keyboard or mouse to fight, block and choose weapons and items.\n\nI like the game a lot so far.  I fully recommend this game to any rogue-like or rogue-lite fans.  Even if you don't like them because they are usually too hard, you can configure this game to your level of experience!   If you have a problem sacrificing kittens, then stay away from this game!  lol  Review pending more gameplay time.","May 11, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It started out extremely challenging, I gradually got better, and eventually one of the chests in the third or fourth room dropped armor so overpowered that i was able to knock out over half the achievements in one two hour run. Oddly enough, this coincided with the time that i was about to get sick of the game anyway, so it will remain an overall positive experience in my memory.\n\nI'd recommend it if you can handle that the drops are basically THE deciding factor in your run's success.

Then once you actually play the game you learn that it was all there; Local Co-op and all of the features mentioned* *(Now with Xbox controller support)\n\nThis game is a hack'n'slash for one minute and then a stealth game once you find a better item. Tallowmere has a fair amount of weapons ranging from the simple axe to a ♥♥♥♥ing rocket launcher.

Has a few usability issues and very basic design flaws such as improper mouse hiding (I have to click in menu for the mouse to finally disappear), no item stat comparision makes inventory management a little tedious, some projectiles go though walls, and some projectiles follow the player when it doesn't feel like they should be doing that (Stun grenades), and somehow the mini-boss leapers seem to kill me very fast (might not be a bug). But nevertheless the game is very fun to play, with a suprising amont of variety in both enemy types and combat styles.","January 20","true","28.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then once you actually play the game you learn that it was all there; Local Co-op and all of the features mentioned* *(Now with Xbox controller support)\n\nThis game is a hack'n'slash for one minute and then a stealth game once you find a better item.

This game is not a rougelike I would classify it about 2-3 steps away from a rougelike but it is still very good. You have to manage your health, resources, and also avoid damage although there are points in the game where that seems impossible. You can add even more challange to the game by adding punishments to make it easier to die and also challange stages to complete. I got to level 10 before I died and that was without sacrifiing a kitten. I really, really don't want to but I will eventually just for the achievments. The level up system is unique and enjoyable as it is kill xyz monsters and collect their souls. I really enjoy this game and this is all based off my first impression after a little over an hour in the game.I plan to play more of this and master it. I would recommend it for someone that wants a challage with some randomization and ways to make the game even harder. I would not recommend to someone that rages or is a super casual.","July 29, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
