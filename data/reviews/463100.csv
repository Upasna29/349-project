I guess the rest are in a different language.\n\nNormally i don't review a game until I beat it, or until I've spent enough time with it, but this state of "reviews" made me decide to review it early.  I may change my mind as I play more.\n\nWhat it is:\n\nAn artsy platformer-gunner.\n\nThe Good:\n\n+It is cheap.\n+The graphics are sorta attractive, in a retro kind of way.\n+The controls, as they are, are responsive enough.\n+The music is actually pretty good - at least until you pick up ammo (you start every level with none) and the combat song or whatever kicks in (some may like it though, you can hear it in the trailer and decide for yourself.)\n+Infinite lives (respawn at the beginning of the level)\n+When you reenter the game, you can continue from last level you reached\n\nThe bad:\n\n-Framerate seems lower at times, even though shows as steady 60fps.  NOT as low as you see in the trailer though, don't worry - unless you're using a "slow time" powerup.\n-Unlike the music, the "sound effects" are beeps that belong on an Atari 2600.\n-These are the controls: http://i.imgur.com/SqkwcZF.jpg (+E to activate inventory powerups):  They are not rebindable.  There is no gamepad support, it's keyboard-only gameplay.  The menus are MOUSE-only.  During the gameplay the mouse cursor uselessly dangles on the screen (perhaps it's used in later levels, but I doubt it as the platforming and shooting takes both hands on the keyboard.)\n-There are no options of any kind, not even windowed mode.  The game seems to be some sort of Chrome app actually, so maybe that's how they work? I dunno.\n-Enemies fly at you quickly diagonally from above.  You can only shoot horizontally.  It is almost impossible to not get hurt while you try to shake them off and fire a few shots at them, but you have a lot of health so the game obviously expects you to get hurt a lot. Strange design choice.\n-Obstacles that hurt you on contact look like part of the background.\n-Pick-up-looking objects floating in the air are actually part of the scenery.\n-The extended barrler of your gun is part of your hit-box.\n-If you decide to try the "SUPERHOT Mode" whatever that is, you lose all your progress in the game.\n-In some levels you pick up a journal entry, which covers the screen for maybe 30 seconds to let you read a couple sentences, and can't be dismissed manually.\n-The New Game intro is several minutes long and unskippable","May 4","false","3.2"," 64 of 70 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","64","70","2","5"

Hardcore platformer fans may appreciate the goals the game set out to achieve however Liveza ultimately presents an unsatisfying experience.","May 5","false","0.4"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","29","33","0","0"

As of writing this review there are 50 reviews and I can only view 4 of them, 1 positive and 3 negative. When apparently there are 45 positive and 5 negative. Keep this in mind for this game.\n\nIntroductionLiveza: Death of the Earth is a platformer/gunner game that tries to releate back to the older more retro platformers like Super Mario Bros and tries to bring back that sort of nostalgia feeling that you get when playing retro games now a days.\n\nGameplayLiveza: Death of the Earth takes upon a platforming, gunner game whereby you play as a survivor and your objective is to investigate the anomalies that have settled upon Earth. With the game having barely any story at all, you are set to play through the game as you normally would any of game. As you might of already guessed from just watching the trailer, there is a fair amount of platforming and shooting up enemies. That's bascially the whole game. A few issues with the game that I would like to point out first though.\n\nThe first point being you can only shoot horizontally and the enemies move diagonally. This wouldn't be a problem if your character could shoot upwards but for some reason you are unable to do so. This means that you will most probably lose a lot of health and have a lot of cheap deaths with the enemies just moving into you diagaonally. As you can imagine this will most probably cause a few people to rage when you are trying to shoot the enmeies before they get to you. Along with the odd controls (seem more about the controls below), it's kinda diffcult to jump and shoot at the same time as shooting again leading to more cheap deaths throughout the game.\n\nNext, the games controls are a bit odd from the way that the game could be played out. They are very responsive though, but for a game of this type of genre I am suprised that the developer hasn't actually added controller support for this game. I feel like the game would be much easier to play on a controller rather than on a keyboard with these odd keybinds for controls. Above all the game, doesn't even allow you to rebind the keys so you are going to have to stick with these odd controls throughout the entire game. On the topic of optitions, there isn't a optition menu. I mean I get that this game (might?) be trying to replicate a retro platformer but for a steam game you need a options menu. This means that there is no way to mute the music or any of the sound effects that are played in the game, and funnily enough the sound effects are very annoying bleeps so have fun listening to those.\n\nPros+ Nice music\n+ Cheap price\n+ Good game for hardcore gamers who like a challenge\n\nCons- Bare storyline\n- Overall difficult game\n- Can only shoot horizontally while enemies move diagonally leading to cheap deaths\n- Control sheme is odd, and unable to rebind the keys\n- No options menu, meaning no control over sound effects, music or switch to window mode\n\nResult / Final ThoughtsSo the final verdict of this game for me. The game tries to be a retro platformerbut is so much more difficult than the game needs to be. No options menu to control sound or to change to window mode. I would only really recommened this game to hardcore gamers who really like a challenge.\n\nRating: 4/10","May 7","false","6.5"," 29 of 37 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","29","37","2","0"

The controls are responsive, but are not rebindable and kind of odd. It doesn't have controller support which in my opinion all platformers need. It doesn't have an options menu, no windowed mode, no way to mute the music or the annoying beep sound effects. Your gun shoots only horizonally, but the enemies fly at you diagonally causing a lot of damage while you are trying to shoot them with a gun thats stuck in one postion. Its very frustrating trying to shoot enemies while jumping with the weird control scheme and a gun the shoots either right or left. This game is not enjoyable at all, maybe being able to rebind the keys or better yet controller support would make it a better experience.","May 5","false","1.7"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

Wierd controls with no way to change bindings, no options menu, escape takes you to the main menu where if you press continue you start the level over again. There is also no exlpanation as to how to play or even why. Every new area "resets" your weapon so that any leftover ammo is gone. It was a waste of money and did not deserve even the few minutes of time I wasted on this piece of garbage.","May 9","false","0.1"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","1"

First off, absolutly no music. Just the constant ping of you getting hit and losing health. Second, what am i trying to do in this game. I guess wonder around and collect items that have no importance at all. I guess you can't expect much from a two dollar game or whatever this piece of ♥♥♥♥ was but come on. They would have been better off just making this the old metrodvania/shooting platformer or something. I really love the fact that games are art and anybody can put their creations out there for others to experience it but I think Steam should really start filtering/weeding out crap games. I would rather go and play some atari games. On a final note, I'm not trying to be negative but don't waste your money on this boring game and also don't believe any reviews that say its good. Its most def. NOT!!!!!!!!","May 4","false","0.5"," 31 of 50 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","31","50","4","6"
