I enjoy the piano music in the background and the attention to detail in each frame.\n\nHOWEVER:\nI was very interested in this game because of the plot. It seemed mysterious and alluring. This is not the case. In the first 5 seconds everything is revealed to you. (The bad guy is actually named "Murderer" not exactly mysterious.)\nAlso, some play-throughs of the game take 20 seconds. No, this is not an exaggeration, 20 seconds from start to finish. There is no interaction with items in the back drops that can extend the gameplay even marginally. I was given two-three 'choices' in each play-through (I've completed 4 so far) and they each led to a swift ending.\n\nI am truly hoping that this is just the alpha version of the game and that more content is to come. However, as the game stands, it seems unfinished and brief with clunky dialogue and unfinished plotlines.","April 12","false","0.5"," 42 of 58 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","42","58","0","3"

And if you never had anything to do with RPG Maker horrors and wonder why I could have big expectations (especially regarding the low price), I recommend you, dear reader, to try "The Witch's House", "Ib", "The Crooked Man" or "Mad Father" - all great, free RPG maker horror games that could easily compete with much bigger, commercial titles in terms of intriguing plot, depth and atmosphere. But let's go back to this game. What isn't working here?\n\nMusic.  The first thing I've noticed right after starting the game. We have girl speaking about her mother's murder and music in the background is annoying and not fitting at all, it's not dark nor sad. Even though in most games music is not that important, in horrors, especially smaller ones, like RPG Maker, it's crucial to building the right atmosphere and this game is failing on that from the very beginning.\n\nMany endings.  Riiiight. You know, when you tell me that this game has "many endings" I assume you mean actually well done, fleshed out endings and not series of "bad ends". Imagine Telltale counting each time you could be killed in "The Walking Dead" as another "ending" and you will understand what I mean by that.\n\nShort.  And price cannot be explanation here - not with so many great titles out there already that are available for free. You could finish it (and by that I mean ALL "endings")  within 30-40 minutes.\n\nNo substance.  This game is based on dark idea about young girl who's trying to revenge her mother's death. There are few intriguing details thrown here and there on various "routes", but it gets nowhere. It's not interesting, it's not scary, it has absolutely nothing to offer further.\n\nNo mystery.  Non. Whatsoever. You will understand what I mean by that soon after launching the game. You can argue that there's another type of "mystery" as to what exactly happened with protagonist's mother, but it's really poorly done.\n\nIn short? Don't bother with this one.","April 15","false","4.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","4"

Maybe the murderer isn't who everyone thought to be. If you expect an exploration game with more action, interacting, moving around...etc. then I don't recommend this.\nIf you want a short story to read with choices to alter the ending, this should be your thing. Dear RED isn't about finding and killing the "murderer", there's no point in that as the dev already named someone "Murderer". It's more on learning who RED is and her dark past that the dev reveals so little about, to feel the bitterness of vengeance and see who suffers from it.\nYou don't have much info or background story to work with but all of the dialogues hint a little here and there, you can easily put one and one together to find out the truth.\nThe game shouldn't take you longer than 30-45 mins to finish. A bit pricey considering its content isn't all that different from the free version before. I got this from a bundle for $1 so for me, it's a perfect price but if you really have some money to spare then this can be a good passtime.","April 14","true","1.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","2"

You can get all the endings within an hour.\nYes, it's simplistic. You walk around and make some choices.\nBut also yes, it's incredibly cheap and it's not trying to be something it's not.\n\nPlaying through the game feels like Groundhog Day, or even Edge of Tomorrow. One playthrough will not give you the full story. Every cycle will give you a new experience and reveal new information, and gradually you get to put the pieces together. It's nothing crazy, but it's a charming short story that you have to form yourself.\n\nThe fact that it spoils who killed her father by having his name as "Murderer" was hilariously terrible to me at first and I thought it could have been a good twist, but after playing enough I found a cutscene that revealed why, and it's a good twist.\n\nAchivements would be nice though, Dev!

There's an abundance of endings available, but most of them will hardly last you any time at all, and even the "real ending" is pretty short. Even with playing through quite a few "normal" endings and getting the real ending, I still hardly understood what was actually going on in the game. It seems to be all over the place. One of the other things that turned me off was how scary Red's portrait looked, and that the guy you are going after is literally just called "Murderer".\n\nGiven the price of this game and how short it is, I cannot recommend it at all. I was thankfully able to get it through a bundle since I cannot imagine paying $3 for the length of this. If you want to get Dear RED then find it on a major sale ($1 or less), otherwise just give this game a pass.","April 21","false","5.8"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","9","12","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/seigagenesis/recommended/453850/","seigagenesis","Turret Syndrome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/seigagenesis/","167 products in account","This game has some really great potential, though it could definitely use some polishing. More than anything else, the game would greatly benefit from some fleshing-out of the characters and backstory. I like how the story is revealed in small pieces, but the pieces don't add up to much of a coherent story in total. I enjoyed the character of Red very much, she was a strong if not slightly psychotic protagonist- but it would be nice to have learned more about her. Perhaps if there were more interactive objects within the game, it would lend a little more to giving you a better idea of her inner thoughts and personality.\n\nI love the concept of "truth/lies" and the multitude of ways to get to various endings to the game; though some can be called more of a simple "game over" rather than an actual ending. It was fun to see how many different ways the game could actually end, especially when more elements of the story are introduced. I wish the endings had more of an impact, though, maybe with a cut-scene or more voicework of some kind, or at the very least some kind of title given at the end to differentiate them.\n\nI hope that the developer will consider fleshing out the game a bit more, but if not, this is a fine first effort in my opinion.","April 15","true","3.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

I enjoyed my time with it (the rest of the time spent was just idling for cards as there is no more replay value in this one).  Overall very nice potential, just not fully realized.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ktr0x/recommended/453850/","ktr0x","ktr0x","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ktr0x/","64 products in account","Ok, so I bought this game because I love beautiful games with deep storylines. This game, at first was giving me some pretty nice thoughts about a medium sized indie truth or lie game. But the truth is that the game lacks content. It starts and you can finish the first ending in 15 seconds, and I did... This 'Extended' game makes me think what the normal version will be like. Will it have even less content? Will you be able to finish an ending in 5 seconds? I'm very disappointed. I don't have many nice things to say about this game other than it needing to be in for beta testing or get some freelancers to review the game before its release.\n\nStory\nThe story was fairly clear  You are a girl named Red, a man named murderer kills your mother and murderer has a sick daughter  It was a nice story for this type of game but it didn't give too much of Red's backstory. But the man being called murderer... Why not call him Bob, Bill or Jeff. Why give away all the fun of wondering who the murder is and maybe a twist being hidden in the story?\n\nSound\nThis game's sounds didn't feel sad at the sad parts and a bit of music when Red is outside the house would've been nice.\n\nGraphics\nThis game had some fairly nice Pokemon style graphics and fit right into the theme. The graphics were possibly the best part of the game. Except the part where you start teleporting around the house. Red is obviously not God so maybe Red can just follow murderer around the house so it's more natural.\n\nReplaying\nOk, this game is hard to replay to try to get the different endings. There are no achievements, so no end goal. It would be nice to have achievements and have a better ending every time instead of  Stabbing murderer  and giving no real value towards replaying it, making people bored after they play through once.\n\nControls\nThe controls need to improve. It took me 6 minutes to find out I was supposed to use the arrow keys instead of the mouse. Being able to interact in the menu with the mouse would be a nice feature. But after the menu, the controls are nice and simple.\n\nOptions\nNo options. No fullscreen. No resolution. No steam overlay. And many more options that are non-existent. I believe EVERY game needs options. Even if it is just fullscreen/windowed or controls or something. Also, an option to skip the intro for those people who don't like stories (I know a guy).\n\nFinal Comment\nThe game has so much potential and if I was the developer I would be making this an early access game so people know I will spend more than two hours on it. The game is way too short which has made people stop playing after 5 minutes. The storyline also has a possibility to be deeper and maybe we could learn more about the sick daughter by talking to her? Lastly, I rate...\n\n3/10\nThe game has lots to offer and the developer will hopefully continue working on this game to make it better and longer. I did enjoy the game for the few minutes I played it but it really needs more content and I would love to see some improvements :)","April 14","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/recommended/453850/","Bechstein","Bechstein","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bechstein/","296 products in account",""3SPOOKY5ME!"\nA very brief Choose-Your-Own-Adventure about revenge, family mysteries and shock endings. Well-made for something which can have all its endings cleared in 10 minutes; clean graphics, smooth camera, horrifying and eerie music to fit the mood, and no true satisfying ending.  It's good as a quick vignette, but there's an issue with its Ruby coding and stack control. It's probably making recursive calls. If you could fix this, developer, that'd be great. Not necessary, though, as it's such a short story.\nSeriously, Dear Redtended gives me the spooks. Can I borrow someone's nightlight and blankie?","April 12","true","4.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Yet I took 10 second (this is NO JOKE) to get my first ending. And yes I red everything. No skipping.\n\nThe other endings are as easy to gain as the first one and the story is rather confusing. You have to play it several times to understand even a little what's going on. In my first run (the 10 seconds) I didn't even understood in the  slightest what was going on.","April 30","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
