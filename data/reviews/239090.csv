It's AMAZING fun, don't get me wrong, but there's only so much you can do with two modes, the second of which at first glance isn't heavily different from the other (Versus and Survival). My other problem is that there's just not clear communication with some parts of the game - sometimes you'll win even if you have less than 10 kills, or a showdown will end and nothing will happen.\n\nIt's extremely solid as a game and I commend the focus on no-online cause it really does shine on couch versus, but there just isn't enough in this for a full price recommendation in my eyes.","December 19, 2013","false","1.0"," 132 of 186 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","132","186","0","0"

He published only one patch since the game was released and is now working on a different game.\n\nIt's got really good gameplay but is not feature-complete. Here's a list of the stuff that should be in the game but somehow isn't:\n- replays\n- tournament mode in which you choose how many matches you want to play and the winner will be the one who wins the most. There could be some stats shown between each match. You could choose which levels you want to play or have the game randomise them.\n- any match modifiers such as timed matches, no guns, no super jumps, etc.\n- any kind of stats that carry over the matches\n- unlockables/secrets\n- an option to base spawning on the proximity of the enemy, so that you won't spawn near players and be able to instakill them just because you got lucky.\n\nI can't recommend getting the game at it's basic price. It's really fun and has a great soundtrack but at the same time it feels like an early beta at this point. Wait for a sale (UPDATE: the dev didn't even bother putting it on Summer Sale). And get Towerfall Ascension in the meantime if you're looking for a good couch deathmatch game. It's a bit slower in terms of gameplay but at the same time it's superior in pretty much every way and is still getting new content and updates.","July 1, 2014","false","3.4"," 125 of 184 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","125","184","2","4"

There's almost no learning curve at all and then it's just non-stop action, drama, conniving strategies, and a lot of yelling. The controls are simple to start out with, but open up to more complex gameplay as the subtle specifics of the mechanics reveal themselves. This game is hilarious and heart-pounding; one moment we were cracking up at the absurdity of it all, and the next we were literally on the edge of our seats.

So much fun to slice and shoot your friends or mess around with the AI.

Spent hours and hours and hours playing this with people. It's probably one of the easiest pickup-'n-play fighting games on Windows and really gets everyone going. I definitely think this was my game of 2013. I've spent far more time playing it with guests than any other game I own since I bought it on Christmas.\n\nBecause there's absolutely no documentation, there's a lot of learning in terms of moves and rules. For instance, if you press your sword and jump and a direction at the same time, you do a mightier jump in that direction than normal. Also, you're limited to 3 bullets a life (gets rid of bullet sniping or camping), and you can hold down to play dead (you'll die in water if you do this). There are a bunch of stages all with their own little intricacies. If there's any game I'd recommend for party play on Steam, this is it.\n\nI'm using Logitech F710 controllers because they have an amazing d-pad for this kinda stuff. Definitely something worth trying out if you're having issues w/ a 360 controller's analog stick. PlayStation controllers should work as well based on their d-pad positioning and functionality.\n\nBased on what the game offers, I do think the price is high; although, that's not something I ever think about. Of the hundreds of games I purchased in 2013, it was by far the best and most-valuable.","February 11, 2014","true","15.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slyboots/recommended/239090/","slyboots","Sly Boots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slyboots/","477 products in account","I am really glad I got this one. It's fun, addictive and really easy to get into.\n\nSamurai Gunn is an extremely fast-paced arena combat game in which players use a katana as their main weapon and may fire up to three shots from a gun as a support weapon. The gameplay relies on players' abilities to quickly move around the levels my means of running, jumping and executing their opponents in one lightning-fast strike. Shots from guns may be used to cover long distances in a straight line, but may also be deflected at the shooter by parrying them with one swing of the sword. Additionally, levels often include environmental hazards such as spikes and moving platforms which can squish any character against a wall, floor or ceiling.\n\nAn impressive amount of attention to detail is revealed through such things as bullet casings falling to the ground after each shot. What's more, the casings remain there and may be pushed by any character who steps on them. Another example is the water: if someone dies in a pond, the water acquires a red tint which becomes more intense as more blood is spilled, only to be washed away after a few seconds of no blood-spilling on the same spot. To top it all off, standing in water renders your gun useless even when when you get out of the pond, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe soundtrack is a perfect match for the action. Based on traditional Japanese instruments, it's reminiscent of soundtracks from chanbara movies and animes with a historical setting. At times, it reminds me of Samurai Spirits, only faster-paced (depending on the track). On that note, the sound effects are hugely satisfying. Most of all, the katanas cutting through the air (or your enemies, ideally). There's something about that loud metallic *schwing!* that makes you want to keep pressing the sword button for more, even if you're not hitting anyone.\n\nGraphically, it's a beautiful game. The sprites are simple but perfectly distinguishable from one another and each is full of personality. There are three characters for each faction and, even within such simplicity, all of them can be told apart at a glance while keeping a common element that identifies them as belonging to the same group. The levels offer a rather wide variety of colours and designs. The intense lime green and clear brown of the bamboo forests, the purple rocks and pale green bushes of the mountain pass with its Buddha statues or the white snow, dark trees and clear water of the winter areas are all pleasant to look at and brimming with detail. Each gives the battle a particular mood or atmospheric feeling. And yet, they managed to do all this with no real distractions for the player, thanks to its retro-style pixellated graphics. Combining an old visual style with modern-day gameplay fluency is a path that numerous indie developres take, and it was yet again the right choice for this title.\n\nAll of it is wrapped up into an elegant presentation that fans of chanbara films and samurai pop culture in general will recognise and love. From the moment we see the title screen, we know what type of world we'll be thrown into. A red band with black silhouettes belonging to a bunch of samurais running through a field is an extremely effective introduction to a high-paced game such as this one and it also serves the purpose of creating a classy main menu. In-game, the brief stop produced by a kill, with the blackening of the screen save for the strip which shows killer and victim, is a charmingly abrupt way of making everyone aware of the death. The slow-motion plus zoom that frames the final kill in a fight always provides for an interesting composition and flaunts the game's colourful palette as well as its sprites, still lovely and worth of appreciation with their pixels brought to a bigger size. The menus are simple and use one font, and the signs which recount the kills at the end of a match have a neat parchment feel to them, with easily recognisable icons depicting each death and its cause.\n\nI recommend obtaining this underappreciated gem while it's on sale, since playing it with friends is the best way to exploit its wonders. Survival mode is fun, engaging and addictive, but nothing beats the variety and unpredictability (or lack thereof) of playing against human competitors. As more people get this game, the more fun it will get for all of us who share it.","July 26, 2014","true","2.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

There are a couple of reasons for that.\n1. So little content. For 15$ you want more variety in characters, more diverse game mechanics, a decent options menu and a better single-player experience. Which leads to my next point...\n2. Multiplayer with 2+ people is the only fun option. Unless you have a 2-3 controllers and have people who would play with you on the same computer, there is absolutely no point in buying the game. No online play, so forget about that. AI isn't all that challenging \ interesting, so single-player tends to get boring fast.\n\nDon't get me wrong - Samurai Gunn is well polished. It does few things (too few in my opinion), but it does them quite well. The controls are responsive. The game is immersive and atmospheric. The attention to detail is remarkable. There just isn't enough of a game there to justify getting it at this point.\n\nMaybe one day in the future, some bonus content is released and this review won't be relevant anymore. Maybe not.\nRight now I'd stick to Megabyte Punch if you're itching for a nice brawler (though not a 1-hit-kill one), or just wait for Towerfall to make its way to the PC in a couple of months.","January 14, 2014","false","6.2"," 32 of 57 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","32","57","2","4"

It's extremely hard to stop playing this game even if you're losing every time.\n\nThe showdown mechanic is the single most incredible idea for resolving draws - everyone always secretely wishes for the game to end in a draw so they could feel the intensity of the showdown, where every hit means game over and where mindgames are even more important.\n\nAdd to that quite a bit of secrets - like the double showdown, alternative sword stance or hidden characters and you will not be bored by this game for a long time.

Take the samurai films of old, ramp it up to eleven with the Tarantino-style violence and blood, and then imbue that with the lightning-fast white-knuckle pace of Hotline Miami, and that's Samurai Gunn in a nutshell\n\nChoose a samurai, choose an arena, and then fight. One hit kills. Armed with only your blade, your handful of bullets, and your agility, you must survive against increasingly challenging waves of enemies in increasingly complex arenas. Like Hotline Miami, death comes fast and at a moment's notice; a single lapse in timing, in reaction and reflex, and your blood will stain the ground rather than your opponent's.\n\nThere are no power-ups to equip, no special swords to unlock, or abilities to use. You and your foes are equally matched; superior skill and reflexes are your only advantages. Each battle is one of hair's-breadth dodges over swinging blades, of smart positioning, perfect timing to strike down an enemy in mid air or deflect his bullet back at him. And that's just against one opponent; it only becomes more intense once you're down to one life and three enemies are out for your blood.\n\nIt's not just this frantic dance of death that makes Samurai Gunn so compelling, but the sheer variety of arenas as well. From levels consisting of moving platforms and traps to levels with spike pits and saw blades, to levels made of nothing but easily breakable bamboos so that the layout changes and shrinks as you play, they are numerous and each must be learned and mastered if you wish to succeed.\n\nIt's the little details that round out this impressive package. Fall into a pond and your gun won't fire but instead misfire and discharge spurts of water. Your blood and bodies stay behind, monuments and reminders of your past failures. Play dead among the corpses to confuse your enemy. Slash at your foe at the same time he does, and you'll clash swords and fly apart, leaving a dust trail in your wake.\n\nSo again, I've only played single player, but I can only imagine that multiplayer is even better thanks to human players instead of AI. You can play co-op against bots or fight against each other in Versus mode. As for Samurai Gunn's future, the developer has said he's "interested in experimenting with different types of enemies, modes, and other things" so there's only more frenetic bloodshed to come.","December 11, 2013","true","8.7"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Bullets are fast enough that you have to react, but slow enough and limited enough that they're best saved for a moment when you're just a little outside of reach. The showdowns are beautiful, tense, and dramatic. It's a great game for new players to pick up and jump into for a casual setting, but it stays fresh even once you've grasped all of the mechanics.\n\nOn the other hand, a few different options regarding the matches would go a long way. Aside from changing the length of the matches, you really don't have any settings at all. There are no other game modes, and nothing to unlock. At the least, I wish there were a few more maps to choose from.\n\nIf you are a person who has the chance to play local multiplayer games with 2, 3, or 4 people, I recommend picking this game up - but maybe when it's on sale.","October 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The premise is fantastically simple- You have a sword you can swing, and a gun you can shoot. Kill the other players- But the strategies build in complexity pretty quickly if you're playing with three or four people.\n\nWithin seconds, you can shoot at one enemy to your right as someone drops down above you. They go to slash, but you intercept with your sword, flinging them back up. At this point, the bullet you shot gets reflected back at you, so you jump over it and towards the guy that dropped down, swinging your sword as you jump. This propells you up into him, netting you a clean kill. But at this moment, the fourth player wraps around from the left side of the screen and shoots you. You barely just landed, and only have enough time to deflect the bullet with your sword, but the guy is already in the air, jumping over the reflected shot, bringing his sword down on you.\n\nThis takes about three or four seconds, and the default mode is 10 kills to win. If someone has at least 9 by this point, it'll enter a showdown between the victor and the close second. These arenas change depending on the stage: One can have a rain of arrows to deflect and dodge, while another turns you both invisible. The variety is fantastic.\n\nThere IS a singleplayer mode, but it's merely just a gauntlet, pitting you against waves of enemies. It's fun for a bit, but starts getting kinda monotonous. Also, there is no online. This was built for local multiplayer, and if you can take advantage of that, I can guarantee that you and your friends will sink hours at a time into this.","February 3, 2014","true","11.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Although I would love to play with my friends without having them here I do feel that the fun level would decrease, in short, its much better when your friends are within punching distance. I do wish that the different character had different weapons or moves, maybe some designed for ranged more then melee and vice versa. I also think that being able to make and share maps on the steam workshop would have been amazing. Overall, I think this game is bloody brilliant, the only major flaw being lack of online multiplayer but online multiplayer could be against the point of the game.

For example the movement and combat system is easy to learn and handles extremely well on the keyboard and controller. This game also relies on your skill and reflexes, so it rewards you for being good at the game allowing for exiting matches with clutch comebacks and outplays. Furthermore, the maps offer lots of diversity granting some replayability aswell as each map being well designed for the fast paced combat and controlls. And the final good thing i have to say about this game is the audio. the soundtracks for all of the maps are a good fit with the oriential artstyle of the game.\n\nUnfortounately, this game lacks some core details that would turn this fun party game into a amazing fast paced fighter.\nfirst of all, there is no online multiplayer in this game, not even LAN. even though this an Xbox arcade game you would think that they would at least implament a LAN feature to the PC port. so unless you want to play bots, you have to try and play with 3 other people playing on one kayboard.

First of all, it's important to know that this game really flourishes as a party experience. 3+ players and you're looking at an amazing time. If you're looking for a single player game, I'm not sure how this holds up - but I'm guessing not very well.\n\nI've had a recent obsession with Local Co-Op and multiplayer games and this was definitely one of the best I found. The games are fast, so if you get behind it's not frustrating. Everyone has those less-expienced friends or sore losers. Play this game with them. It's so fast paced you hardly have time to be upset about being cut to pieces.\n\nPreviously I mentioned the gameplay is simple. Let me expand on that:\n-You run\n-You jump\n-You can jump off walls\n-You swing a sword in one of 4 directions (up, down, left, right)\n-You shoot your gun (with limited ammo) in 4 directions as well\n-You can deflect bullets back in the direction it came at by swinging your sword at it\n-Clashing swords with another combatant causes one or both of you to fly backwards and take no damage\n-One hit kills\n-First to 10 kills in multiplayer\n-Killing yourself loses a point\n-When you share a similar score with the winner, you may go to a 1v1 showdown\n-There is some destructable terrain\n-There are spikes of deathy death and squishy death squishes by moving platforms and icicles\n-The maps are circular, meaning when you drop from the bottom you will come out the top. From the left edge of the screen to the right.\n\nThat's really about it.\n\nI highly recommend having CONTROLLERS for this game. Playing with a keyboard in a fast paced semi-competitive platformer is a good way to make yourself upset. :]","September 23, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The matches get crazy when you have 4 people to play with. Anything less, though, and it does tend to get boring. There is a huge variety of maps and some even have hazards, which adds another level of strategy to your gameplay. There is a survival mode that you can play alone, but the AI seems pretty simple. I've only loaded it up to be used as a tutorial. It is sort of disappointing there is no online mode so I can play it more often, but I'm sure the lag from online would ruin the fun.\n\nI would recommend buying this game only if you have friends come over often since it is a local party game.","May 12, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sword-and-gun gameplay is tight, and stalemate "sundown" duels are a riot. Controls are simple and quick, and the game can be played with SNES gamepads or something comparably cheap (also XB360 controller compatible). Soundtrack is awesome, levels are mostly balanced and make for some close encounters. The game works extremely well in an arcade-style setup. If you like Yojimbo or Samurai Champloo, you'll like this game's aesthetic.\n\nCON://\nNo online multiplayer - the AI bots don't cut it as a substitute, and other than bot fights there isn't any single-player game to speak of. The in-game menus can be a little finnicky. Some folks may find that the original retail price ($15) is a little steep for what you're getting.\n\nSUMMARY://\nI'm a huge fan of this game, and it's great when you have other people to play with, but it lacks any real single-player component.

While fighting the (fairly decent) AI in the singleplayer is alright, it's nowhere near the frenetic, foolish, fantastic fun you get out of hacking and blasting your friends apart.

The lack of powerups of any kind might be a missed opportunity, but at the same time the simple rules and controls are a boon in their own right.\n\nThe fact that's there's no online multiplayer should technically be a strike against it, but I'm personally glad to have a strong local multiplayer game in a age where more and more developers eschew local play in favour of online multiplayer only.\n\nAlso, the music and overall sound design is pretty tight. :P","April 17, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The matches get crazy when you have 4 people to play with. Anything less, though, and it does tend to get boring.

I've only loaded it up to be used as a tutorial. It is sort of disappointing there is no online mode so I can play it more often, but I'm sure the lag from online would ruin the fun.\n\nI would recommend buying this game only if you have friends come over often since it is a local party game.","May 12, 2014","true","28.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sword-and-gun gameplay is tight, and stalemate "sundown" duels are a riot. Controls are simple and quick, and the game can be played with SNES gamepads or something comparably cheap (also XB360 controller compatible). Soundtrack is awesome, levels are mostly balanced and make for some close encounters. The game works extremely well in an arcade-style setup. If you like Yojimbo or Samurai Champloo, you'll like this game's aesthetic.\n\nCON://\nNo online multiplayer - the AI bots don't cut it as a substitute, and other than bot fights there isn't any single-player game to speak of. The in-game menus can be a little finnicky. Some folks may find that the original retail price ($15) is a little steep for what you're getting.\n\nSUMMARY://\nI'm a huge fan of this game, and it's great when you have other people to play with, but it lacks any real single-player component. However, the local multiplayer comes highly recommended.","November 30, 2014","true","12.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's hands down the most competive and entertaining local multiplayer game I've enjoyed with my housemates.

The game has loads of visual style and minor interactions which make watching and taking part a joy.\n\nIf you like to play multiplayer, competitive games at home with your friends, I urge you to pick this up. The game isn't represented well if you play on your own, but it shines with company. Do yourself a favour, invite peeps over and cut loose, take names, defend honour and all that samurai goodness.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nMinor beefs from a house that has played A LOT of this game:\n\n- Spawning can sometimes be unforgiving.\n- A level editor would blows minds.\n- Everyone says it: Online multiplayer.","April 21, 2015","true","68.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If Super Smash Bros. is coffee, this is a shot of espresso.\n\nEveryone freaked out when consumers complained about the lack of online multiplayer, but I think they were right to. The addition of online multiplayer would be a welcome one, but maybe you'd lose a lot of the fun to lag.\n\nStill, I had fun playing against the computer. I'm not sure I'll ever convince some friends to crowd around my keyboard like a bunch of idiots, so I can't speak to the multiplayer. The way the single player is however, leads me to think that playing it with other humans would be even better.","December 11, 2013","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

No online support, but that shouldn't stop you from buying it if you are planning on having a party anytime soon (and you can hook up your PC to a bigscreen TV).  It's similar in artstyle to Towerfall, and similar gameplay to Smash Bros with 1-hit kills. Games are VERY fast and adrenaline pumping. You'll be yelling at your friends in no time, but also always noticing how fair the game is.\n\nLook, this review is coming out weird. It's a great game. There's plenty of videos out on the internet showing the gameplay. Lack of online doesn't kill this game (as it doesn't need it), but some people don't have a good local co-op setup.  While there is a single player mode, it's the multiplayer that makes this game amazing.  It's like Smash Bros. It didn't have online multiplayer for the longest time, and that didn't stop it from being one of the greatest brawlers of a generation.  Judge it like that.\n\nTo those that *need* online (due to limitations of gaming setup or prejudices), they should probably consider a different game.","December 11, 2013","true","1.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I have only played a few versus matches and I say that is where the game shines the most. Fun, fast, and chaotic battles where everyone has a chance at getting the upperhand on their opponents. The single player survival mode is addicting and a perfect way to hone your skills as well as challenging yourself against the unpredictable AI. I would love to have more stages, game modes, and more multiplayer options added in the future. I hope that it is coming especially given the current price of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonnyShadow/recommended/239090/","JonnyShadow","Doppelganchor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonnyShadow/","419 products in account","Samurai Gunn is a fast paced arena style "Bushido-Brawler." It's extremely easy to pick up and have hours of fun on the couch with your buddies. From the 10 life/kill Death Match to the life or death Shogun Showdown, the battles get intense.\n\nOnly having 3 bullets in your chamber makes ranged battle high stakes, but worth calculating. You have the ability to block strikes with your sword, but whoever swings second goes flying in the opposite direction, making battles even more dangerous when traps are activated or when the floors are spiked.\n\nAlthough the price may seem steep for a local "party-game" this day and age, the single-player survival mode redeems the price. Some may disagree, however the difficulty starts strong and only gets more difficult with each level. It's a challenge not to be over looked.\n\nOverall I'd say Samurai Gunn is an 8/10 and worth a purchase regardless, but it's even more worth a purchase if you have three friends with game pads to decapitate each other. It'd be difficult to implement online capabilities since the controls are heavily based on precise timing, therefore latency would cause issues. This game is exactly where it needs to be, and provides hours of entertainment regardless of couch-buddies.","April 26, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

When someone swings you can parry their attack and both of you get stunned. it makes for epic multiplayer battles.\n+Limited bullets make for fast paced gameplay\n\nThe bad\n-I have had local players "Camp" in high places or in a spawn and just spam attack.\n-I have fallen through the map before and returned locked inbetween the surface\n-Bullets tear right through you. Their distance is not limited.\n-The sword doesn't seem to leave it's sheathe. The swinging animation just looks like a white mass.\n-The AI are very dumb and get trapped in the moving parts of the map and either get gltiched or crushed. It makes for a lame fight. Fun for multiplayer though. :D\n-I have no friends.\n\nOverally it is a very good game. I can be fun for parties or just by yourself....plus it's pretty cheap! :D","December 13, 2013","true","8.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As the developers never seemed to care about the future of this game, all they wanted was a 'beer and chips' game. But...\n\nThey created something a little more than that, a game that was fast, fun, competitive, and had some depth to it. With incredibly creative levels, and all sorts of different ways to die, it quickly became one of my favorite games. However, as I started to grow and become much busier in life than my high school days, I just couldn't find the time to bring people over *just* to play Samurai Gunn on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ desktop. What the developers wanted was a local multiplayer game that was fun and brutal and unfair, and it was. But who in their right mind wants to play (with me) on my tiny ♥♥♥ screen in my cramped room?\n\nFurthermore, this game was released on STEAM, a place where PC gamers usually buy their games (due to gaben, our lord and saviour). What PC gamers expected, was an online multiplayer and what I expected as well. There were some debates here and there. The fact remains, I could never just sit down and play this game, I'd have to call everyone to my house just to play Samurai Gunn. It would be so convenient to just be able to play the game, online. I have friends who have since, moved on to military and are now working overseas, across the globe. People move to different states, etc, you can't always just sit down with friends to play this game.\n\nThis game really needs a working multiplayer, I'd take the lag spikes, regardless. In fighting games, I really don't mind the lag, as long as I'm having tons of fun. Here, I did have plenty of fun, and the alternative to multiplayer in Samurai Gunn is just bad.\n\nSo, for what this game is worth, I just can't recommend it. Had I bought it on console I'd have the luxury to play on my couch with more space and more people, maybe I would. But this game, as a STEAM game, is just not worth it's price. A hilariously bad and poorly thought-out single player is not a good alternative. There was, a lot of potential to make this game much better than it is now, like adding different weapons as an example. But I just can't recommend it.","May 12, 2015","false","17.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Most of the time, though, it isn't.\n\nThe game looks gorgeous. The levels do, anyways. The character art is ugly. The soundtrack is dope. The level design is varied enough that it doesn't get stale, there is a plethora of different environments to slash around in.\n\nOnly problem? The game is only good when you have friends to play it with. Oh, but you may be thinking, "that's fine, I've got plenty of friends to play with online!" Excellent! I'm happy you have a good social gaming life. But that will do nothing for you here. The game is local only. No online.\n\nThat's not to say you can't play it alone. There's a Survival mode, where you play bots. But it's utter garbage. The bots are stupid, but stupid powerful. Some (a lot) of the levels have a nice high place you could go tuck away in, and the bot wouldn't be able to get at you, since they can't traverse the map to save their life. And there's never a time when they aren't slashing. The bots are veritable button mashers, mashing away nonstop. This is where it gets unfair. Getting in close is a death wish, because they'll slash and slash, and chances are, they'll get you. The bot is also overly aware of where you're going, and where you're going to be. It seems like they're programmed to react to your button presses, not to do their own thing. You do get a gun, but it does very little in terms of strategy, or shaking things up. You only get 3 bullets, and they can be deflected, or should I say, will be deflected, since Slashy McSlasher is button mashing until the cows come home. It can be continuously be deflected, but it speeds up each time, so it doesn't do much good against a bot.\n\nUPDATE 01/11/15: Something else I learned since I wrote this review, that is probably worth mentioning, is that the game seems to decide who gets to win in face-to-face fights, and they just get to win no matter what. My friend and I noticed these shenanigans after we'd played for a bit, so we decided to test it out. We got right next to each other in a face-off, we'd both push the attack button at the exact same time, and... He got all 10 kills that round. Next 2 rounds, I got all 20 kills. Then he got all 10. It just doesn't have any sense of balance.\n\ntl;dr It's a fun game with friends (but since it's local only, unless you have friends over all the time, it's not worth it), it sounds good, and it looks good. Otherwise, it's trash.","August 1, 2014","false","2.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
