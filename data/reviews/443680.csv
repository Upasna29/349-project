"http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/recommended/443680/","abbydonprime","AbbydonPrime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/abbydonprime/","515 products in account","This is a very hectic, on-rails shooter. I was expecting more freeform nagivation, but it's just swarms of different ships with different types of firepower coming from the right as you progress from the left. I should've noticed the "shoot-em-up arcade" part in the description.\n\nYou can pick up power-ups that will change your cannons to use fireballs, mines, and so forth. Your ship, as well as the enemies, fires in different directions and at different distances. Since it is on rails, it's very important to dodge and fire as fast as you can. If you're lucky, you'll pick up repair items and extra lives.\n\nIt's quite a straightforward arcade shooter, except it's boats instead of spaceships or airplanes. This isn't my usual type of game, but if you like shooters where you are constantly moving forward, you only can move Up/Down/Left/Right within your current frame, and you just shoot like crazy with unlimited ammo while avoiding getting blitzed by an abnormal number of enemy ships... then this might be for you. It's only $0.99, so why not?\n\n---\n\nFor more... My Reviews || My casual gaming...
