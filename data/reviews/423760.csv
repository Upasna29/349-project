"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/423760/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.\nHit Tank PRO is a challenge mode based action strategy game, releasing on December 2nd 2015, by a single developer Bacq Stellan.\n\nGameplay in Hit Tank PRO is set in a birds eye view of a small simple map, where you are in control of a single tank, and you have to destroy varying numbers of enemy tanks. Each of the maps are set out differently, some come with mazes, some have destructible objects,  whilst others have a fog of war mechanic, leaving you in the lurch as to what you can see.  Whilst the gameplay is very simple, it comes with a very addictive nature to it, and the higher levels can get really fast paced and hectic as the levels progressively get harder and more enemies that you have to deal with. I would really liked to have seen some sort of levelling process for your tank, or some sort of customizability, maybe to upgrade weapons or your armour, but the only sort of customizing you get, is changing the speed of your tank at the start of the game. You can obviously make your tank the fastest, but this will in turn give your score a handicap compared to if you didn’t make your tank faster. There are 60 levels in this game too, so quite a stack of levels to go at.\n\nGraphics are very basic, the top down view helps it a little here, but honestly the graphics are nothing to shout about. I was a little let down by the sprites of the tanks and the overall aesthetic of the game, it would have been nice to get some better looking maps to fight in. The sound effects are OK, however the music is weird…it sounds a bit like Wild West music, but in tanks? I don’t quite know how to explain it, something just didn’t sound right about the music in Hit Tank PRO.\n\nThere are a varying amount of difficulties here, there are four difficulty settings, Easy, Normal, Medium (aren’t they the same?) and hard.  Onto of these difficulty settings, you can also make the game harder or easier by changing the bullet speed, your hitbox size, and of course, your tank’s speed. This adds another layer of difficulty settings, allowing you to tweak how hard (or easy) the game is for you.\n\nI have been playing on Normal difficulty for about half an hour now, and I have managed to clear all sixty levels, that to me show that whilst there are a lot of levels, there isn’t anything really challenging unless you ramp up the difficulty settings to a higher level. You could probably get three or four hours of more content out of the game with varying levels of difficulty, but that’s about it.\n\nI sadly had a few annoying technical issues, one is that the game doesn’t use any direct x engine, so I was unable to capture any footage using Fraps. Secondly (and the most annoying) is the game doesn’t lock your cursor in its window, this is only really an issue for anyone with more than one screen – you’ll often find your cursor has wandered across to your other screens, you’ll click and the game minimizes, this is an infuriating bug which almost always results in you dying. The third and probably the biggest big, is a game breaking one unfortunately. Some levels you’ll end up clearing all of the tanks you can see, and the game will insist that there is one tank left alive, when there quite clearly isn’t. This is even more prominent on the levels past stage 50. You can’t even kill yourself by shooting a rocket into yourself, the game just breaks, you actually have to quit the game in order for it to work again, and obviously this loses your scores.\n\nTo sum up, I really like the premise behind the gameplay of this game, but sadly in its current state it isn’t going to be recommended. I am not going to lie; I did actually have fun in the game, when it worked. I think the game can improve a lot on the graphical front, and include some customizability in to make completing the levels feel more like an accomplishment. I personally think that this game would really benefit from a local or online multiplayer mode as I can see that being a ton of fun too. Most of all, the bugs and glitches need to be cleaned up ASAP.  The game is priced at £1, 99 when not on sale, and there is also a demo to try out too if you are still interested in trying it out.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/423760/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Hit Tank PRO reminds of an old game, whose name I can't remember, where you're a tank pitched against others. You have the same core mechanics here. And thanks to Bechstein, I found the name: Battle City.\n\nYou're directing a tank through different levels and your goal is to destroy every enemy present. Some of them are stationary and slow to fire, while others are moving and sending many rockets towards you. You get hit? You're trying the level again with all enemies spawning again. Depending on the difficulty, you will have less lives to do.\n\n8 minutes is short to write a review. However, when you've played some levels, you know already how the game will be. The graphics are correct and the soundtrack is just a jingle and tanks sounds.\n\nThe game is itself a nice little one when you want to take a little break. However, my main problem is the menu in the Missions mode. Indeed, while it's great to have included the three different types of moving (arrows, WASD and ZQSD), while it's great to choose for each level your difficulty, some options, your speed or the hit box, the problem is that when you're pointing your cursor on the keys options, speed or hitbox, you can change the options you have set. And when you're think that ZQSD is chosen and that in reality, you have the arrows.... I mean, it would be great that at least, the choice of ZQSD, WASD or arrows is on another menu and not on the one where you're setting your preferences for the level. Also, when you finish a level, instead of advancing to the next one, you're sent back to the menu (which is normal if you want to change the difficulty or anything else) and if you don't click yourself on "Next", you're going to play the level you've beaten again.\n\nHowever, the Mode Pro/Challenge is changing that way: you set your configuration, your number of life (Pro), level and difficulty and you'll be passing from a level to another without being sent to the menu.\n\nBecause of the menu in Missions, I'm not quite satisfied - it should have a description of each mode - I would have gone directly to the Mode Pro instead of Missions. In itself, it's a good challenging game though. And here's a challenge: if you're on orly, you can write a review of 50 characters instead of copy/pasting official description or reviews from others. If you can't do it but resort to copy/paste what isn't your work, I've been on a rampage to report you. I'm not taking my time to share my experience with others for your greed.","December 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","5"

Reminds me of Combat for my old Atari 2600. 3/5, controls can be an issue.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nGreat throwback! Are there limitations, yes. There are. So, I'll cover those first. Controls are an issue and you will be resetting these between levels IF you do the missions one at a time, during the "Challenge" mode this is not a problem (except setting them initially for each run). The interface is a tad clunky, but you get used to it really quickly. The music is also good, but after hearing the same track between each round it can get hold. This is not a reflection of it's quality at all though, I actually liked it. It simply got repetitive. That is it though, for the limitations. The actual positives in this game were far more numerous than I originally expected. It allows for some nice customization (difficulty, hitbox size, etc) that can increase/decrease difficulty as desired. There are three game modes, one of which allows you to essentially practice on any level you choose. The Online Leaderboards make this one to run and stack High Scores up with your friends. All in all, for $3 this is actually a nice little gem. A great little casual game to pass the time and as you get hooked, there are aspects to keep you playing. Fans of Speed Runs or achieving High Scores are going to want to be all over this one. No achievements or cards, so steer clear if that's all you want. Good fun to be had here on the cheap.\n3/5 and would definitely recommend at this price!\n\nHappy Gaming!!!","December 11, 2015","true","1.9"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","12","21","0","1"

The best thing is that the game has a variety of maps and the difficulty which you can choose to taste without stalling a long time in it. As you progress more interesting it is and depending on how you move some obstacles can play against or in favor. Very useful to use the walls to bounce your shots and thus evade enemy fire if you want to not be very exposed because the enemy anticipates your moves.\n\nThe best of the shots is that you can spam infinite missiles. If you win well but if you lose experience a feeling of revenge or something like that, it creates addiction. The controls can be changed if you want. No experienced errors or glitches that prevented play, all very fluid and simple. I really enjoyed the game even to play it sporadically any time.

The missions are boring and when you finish a mission it brings you to the main menu and you have to manually move to the the next mission and to make it even worse you can beat each mission in roughly 10-20 seconds even on the hardest difficulty. In fact all the hard difficulty does is limit you to one type of weapon and 1 life and I don't need more than that anyways because the missions are very easy. It has no achievements or anything to keep you going. The description is also actually a lie. In the Steam Store. It says: "Hit Tank PRO is an addictive game of fast action that combines Strategy, Action and Challenge." But it actually quite the opposite it's not addictive at all, it got boring real fast and it doesn't require strategy at all and there is no action at all and neither any challenge as I mentioned above. I wouldn't spend one cent in this game.","March 11","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
