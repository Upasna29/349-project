With the decline of arcades and the birth of new genres in 3d, the popularity of beat 'em ups waned, making way for new gaming zeitgeists. In recent years the 2D beat-em up has settled for reboots of classics with little success, luckily the love for the genre burns in the hearts of indie developers and with this, Aces Wild Manic Brawling Action comes to life. Does this beat 'em up deliver a first round knock out punch or does it feel like being roughed up and having your lunch money taken away by a bully?\n\nTaking control of the title character Aces Wild, who must participate in this year's Maximus Circuit in an attempt to preserve the lands held by the Wilder Family. His brother Rex has struck a deal with key entrants of the tournament to ensure his victory so he can sell the lands for a hefty sum. In classic beat 'em up tradition, the story stops there allowing you to pummel your way through the games stages without narrative interruption.\n\nAces Wild's obvious key focus is it's stylized fast paced aerial combat. The controls consist of a light and heavy attack which are linked to the wild meter located at the top left corner of the screen. The meter is filled with every light attack landed increasing the potency of all your attacks. It's also used for health recovery, and charged attacks. These simple mechanics create a system in which managing your wild meter becomes crucial. You'll find yourself debating on whether to use it for a quick heal, full on charge attack or conserving it just a bit longer for an array of potent light attacks. The three selectable characters also bring a distinct combat style to the table, each with their unique skill set. If you find yourself in a bind consider a new route by selecting another character.\n\nThe combat is a bitter sweet. While it is mechanically solid, the level design and enemy encounters undermine it's strengths. One minute you will feel like you are a part of a knuckle sandwich catering service and the next you will find yourself beaten, battered and tossed out on your @$$ like an unruly patron at a biker bar. This often becomes a one sided affair in the later stages when the screen is cluttered with enemies, and one missed dodge results in ten enemy hits. A handful of sword, fists and draggers to the face is a high price to pay for missing one dodge in a cluttered an chaotic melee where sometimes the greatest challenge is keeping track of where your character is at among the action. Enemy's moves don't necessarily evolve either, spamming becomes their default strategy and it becomes extremely irritating when the difficulty is ramped up by cluttering the screen with enemies instead of providing a clever mix of foes that complement one another's attacks and patterns.\n\nBoss battles continue the trend of being frustrating. Like their lesser counterparts, they have a bit of a penchant for spamming the same attacks again and again creating very narrow windows in which to land attacks. Small mistakes and missed dodges are also punished severely. Earlier bosses are formidable at first but quickly become a joke as you learn their patterns. Later encounters ramp up completely taking much of the fun away as they become tedious and annoying. Knowing what to do is one thing, but succeeding is another when everything consuming the screen seems to be at the right spot to put a hurting on you. All is slightly remedied though, as you can select any stage whenever, infinite lives, and the instant respawn with full health after a loss. Still, place fragile valuables in a safe place while playing to ensure their safety.\n\nLeaderboards have recently been added for those looking to ascend them and local mutiplayer is available if you and friend want to tackle the challenge as a team. Co-op play isn't all that exciting though, other then adding a second player on screen the game is exactly the same. If played on a small screen the zooming in and out of the screen can be a pain, making it even more difficult to keep up with what is going on. Unless you have a large monitor and two controllers at hand consider passing on this feature.\n\nAces Wild channels the style of late 90's Capcom fighting games and side scrolling titles with the UI design and the character animations but is a bit lacking when it comes to detail. Many of the environments feel lifeless and static. There are few interactive objects nor props. Generally, stages are constructed with a photographic backdrop layered with platforms that are crisp and clean but lacking in personality or style. A more dynamic environment could easily add another layer to the static world of Aces Wild and payed better homage to a genre where using objects in the environment as weapons has been a long standing staple. There's also a dearth of detail missing throughout all the characters with little to no animation involved. Fortunately, the soundtrack is well done delivering some fantastic 16bit tracks and sounds.\n\nIf Aces Wild Manic Brawling Action gets a sequel a more polished experienced shouldn't be too hard to achieve. The foundation of a great game is present but the overall experience becomes a bit repetitive as the variation in enemies and environment do little to evolve along the way. Manic Brawling Action is a tough game with some infuriating segments, there is no escaping the anger along the ride, but in some ways, that's inherent to the genre. Aces Wild is large dose of nostalgia for a low price, if you're itching for a beat-em up and have run out of other options pick it up. It might just be enough to scratch you right where you need it.","September 23, 2014","true","1.0"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/269230/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Note: video review embedded below.\n\nAces Wild: Manic Brawling Action is the sort of game that would have blown my 10 year old mind.\n\nIt’s like a lost classic brawler gem that’s been hidden in the back of an arcade for years. It plays like a hyperactive beat-em-up with the sensibilities of a saturday morning shonen anime. At its core it’s a fairly simple button masher, but it moves so fast and has such a ludicrous amount of style that its basic mechanics never stuck out to me, at least at first.\n\nAces Wild’s strongest asset is how it feels. The game moves with a bombastic confidence, every character being powerful enough to knock another person around the room like a human pinball and stay in midair by the sheer power of their attacks. If you’re ever on the ground in Aces Wild you’re probably doing something wrong, as fights are almost always structured around your ability to zip around like a rocket, sometimes removing the floor entirely as it forces you to chain attacks to stay afloat.\n\nThe combination of free-form movement afforded by your ability to go in any direction quickly and accurately, and the perfectly timed slowdown when you take out an enemy creates a feeling of power that is truly something to behold. Functionally you only need to hit one attack button and time enemy strikes so as to dodge and counter, but Aces Wild bombards you so heavily with visual and mechanical feedback for those basic actions that I found it difficult to keep my composure as each fight one-up’d the last with how over the top things could become.\n\nAces Wild’s weakness is that it doesn’t realize when it’s time to end before the feeling of embodying a speedy anime badass wears off, with the second half of the game exposing issues of counter timing and some rather cheap enemy patterns. Aside from some interesting level designs, there’s very little new to see in these later stages, which instead of introducing new enemies simply inflate the health bars and quantity of old ones, leading to drawn out repetitive fights. The bosses also become progressively less inspired, relying on a dull AI pattern of beginning in a disinterested state and then closing every opening as it feverishly beats you down. It was in these fights that I had to control myself from hurling my controller at the screen, as I was placed into fights that sucked all the energy out of the game and seemed almost broken even on the easiest difficulty.\n\nEven at its worst though, Aces Wild never stops being fun. Its later stages are far less balanced and creative than the first half, but its fighting system is such a finely tuned machine that even in its weaker moments there’s just something awesome about landing a perfect hit and watching an enemy three times your size bounce wildly around the room. When the action is this outrageous, it’s hard to blame the game for not wanting to stop.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMbwZJCb6bI&ab_channel=MrNinjaSquirrel\n","March 23, 2015","true","3.8"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","3"

Countering with the dodge will let you follow up with a light or heavy counter depending on which button you press.\n\nThe best way to describe this game's problem is, imagine if a game like Bayonetta never introduced Wicked Weaves, dodge-offsetting, or anything else beyond the basic set of mechanics, and your whole strategy has to revolve around abusing Witch Time so you can lead up with button mash combo spam. In order to make itself more difficult, it just throws more and more high-tier enemies onto the screen to the point of being a giant chaotic mess where you spend more time dodging the onslaught than actually attacking your enemies.\n\nIt's weird in that the skill ceiling is very low, but it's very difficult, just in a way that doesn't entirely feel fair. You're limited to the same process of spamming dodge and the combo button, with the occasional heavy attack for health sponge enemies. Because the difficulty curve becomes so unforgiving, it highlights how shallow the actual combat system is.\n\nAlso one of the 3 playable characters is flat-out more powerful than the other two to an absurd extent, like he's supposed to be a secret unlockable character but they just give you him at the start so there's little point in picking anyone else.\n\nThere's so, so much potential here and I'll occasionally load up the first stage just to be reminded of why I initially had hopes for the game, but by stage 3 or 4 it becomes a painful repetitive slog.

After playing a half hour, my hands are tired as ♥♥♥♥.  Everything about the control and combat of the game is rock-solid.  There wasn't a single point where I felt "oh that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t" - it all came down to my (lack of) skill, and the skills I was picking up as I was learning to play.

Since its Humble Store release I've spent dozens and dozens of hours playing, and my time with this game is far from over.\n\nThe controls are easy to pickup but are incredibly precise. You can do crazy combos and fly around the screen with your aerial-powered fighter using a minimal amount of buttons.\n\nThe game is challenging but fair. Cliche statement, yes, but true in the case of Aces Wild. Nothing that the game throws at you is outside is unbeatable if you've got the skill.\n\nDo you want a score-attack focused game without those annoying unlockables or DLC? All the content in Aces Wild is available to play from the get go. Do you want to jump straight to the final boss on hardest difficulty? Go for it! It's all good!\n\nLastly, and possibly what Aces Wild does best, is how much you can simply improve playing the game and how rewarding that feels. The skill ceiling in Aces Wild is absurdly high, and playing through the five difficulties gives a gradual learning curve instead of creating brick walls to bash your head on. Soon enough you'll be flying through dozens if not hundreds of attacks each minute, crashing your fists/swords against enemies so hard *it kills everything nearby*\n\nIn short, this game is incredibly challenging, incredibly deep, and incredibly great.

A really good cake. I mean really good. Iz rly gud. Anyways this game is like cake that is really good, but  its a nice little box. A rly nize lil box, underneath a ton of garbage. But once you go dumpster diving and discover it seemingly at random its looks neat. So like the filthy pig you are you just stick your hand in and eat the cake by the handfull. After about a second you realise this wasnt cake. No it was never cake. It was a stash of cocaine. Really good cocaine. So good in fact, it tastes like cake. Thats when it hits you, like a truck, delivering cake, or more accurately a truck filled with a ton of cocaine speeding away from the cops with a nitro boost on a powerstar about to take off at light speed into the moon after you jump infront of it by chance in your seriously messed up state of being more hopped up on drugs than ol' thumper hippity hops to Cosby's Bippidy Bops Zippy Zoop Pokeyman Pikachu...\nBefore this gets anymore out of hand, or the cops find me, lets get the the ACTUAL REVIEW shall we? I don't know which will happen first. BUT anyways this game is the bees knees, if they were bashed by a baseball bat for looking at a guys girlfriends really good chest, but then replaced with Cyborg Enhanced super knees that every middle-aged man would kill for.\nREALLY THIS IS THE ACTUAL REVIEW\nThis is the best dragon ball game that was not called dragon ball. Missing the stupid filler episodes and stupid energy attacks.\nCOMBAT :  The combat around 90.8754654% of the time (actual statistic calculated at the F abulus A erial K ombat E ducation Center) will be in the air. You punch/slash/dancearoundandstuff enemies as you are greeted with a fantastic almost seizure enducing visual experience only seen in bullet hell games. Much like bullet hell games blocking is for sissies, you go all offence all day and dodge things like a man and when you do, you can put back much more hurt than it was worth.\nIf you have made it this far, I can wholly assume with a full conscience, that you can read. Doing so will allow you the wonderful gift of AHLLLL the combat manuvers and nuances in the description of the game.\nVISUALS :  Aside from the wonderfull bursts of effects and projectiles the game looks pretty ok. The game is otherwise hand drawn and animated which is nice. The stages, while not really varied, offer a variety of cityscape environments. The three characters you can play as (ill touch on this later, just like ill touch on my dic..tionary) Aren't the most fluidly animated things in the world, or the most detailed, but the simplistic style is nice and works, though shrowded by the smooth polished particles this was probally a smart choice.\nSOUND  :  YES. thats it\n\n...what? Its great ok. Wonderful heart bumpin chiptune techno music. My only gripe is that each stage has diffrent music, but the bosses (asside from the final boss) have the same music, and them being as good as they are (ill touch on it later) you will have to listen to it A LOT, but it being good in the first place kind of alleviates that. Every song is catchy without being to repetive and similar enough to be described with the same adjectives, but diffrent enough that it doesn't sound like one meshed up track.\nCONTENT: This game lets you select everything from the beginning, which at first I was like, YO DAWG 7 STAGES SHEEEEEEEEET SO SHAWT. You start the game on the "normal" mode aka "sassy!" and you don't "breeze" through, you can just keep throwing yourself at the game, no halt of progress for dieing, or quitting for that matter and coming back. You will probally get stuck on bosses for a majority of your deaths. Why? They are ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. The way this game is designed you can, in theory as deduced by the wonderful men and women at the F.A.K.E. canter, not take a lick of damage, same for bosses. BUT Bosses are hard, but not unfair. You miss a dodge they will combo you and punish you, much like you would have done to them if you had done that dodge correctly. This brings the replayablity factor in, knowing that you can not take damage, and effectively not die, that lets you get higher ranks for not doing so, inducing satan himself in the form of OCD in a fashion pulling you into a black hole of getting dem S's on higher/the highest difficulty. The difficulty levels in the game are FREAKING PERFECT. You may think. "Oh harder difficulty is stupid in games like this, you just get hit harder" but that is not the case here. Its not harder, its faster, well along with harder, but the main point is the aggressiveness of enemies. Jumping even from sassy! to wild!! and especially on MAXIMUS!!!! you will notice the enemies blinking red more and more often then an emo chick cutting herself on her period. Making missed dodges punished by several enemies touching you inaproprately like uncle Steve, at the same time and hurt you something swell. Same goes for bosses, and you can die in one or two messups on bosses if you are on full wild, like your mom in her college days. ALL OF THIS, ON 3 DIFFERENT CHARACTERS. Now 3 you may say seems like a few, spoiled by streetfighter are you you cheeky sonofANYWAYS eaching character shares the same mechanics, but an ever so slightly changed moveset, Im not going to go in depth about all of the characters, but each character has their own "style" of gameplay along with some better visual flair.\nVERDICT:tehnhowtatehnwoodplaiagen\nno really\nPros\n-Fun as poop combat\n-Seeminly basic, but complex combat system\n-pure skill based combat, no "unfair" challence\n-bumpin visuals and effects\n-bumpin sound\n-EXTREME!!!!!! replayability\nCons\n-Aces ♥♥♥♥ing voice\n-Everything at the beginning?

You have to get good in order to progress.

It's a fun 2D arcade brawler with tight, simple controls and multiple ways to put yourself to the test. At higher difficulties the gameplay becomes punishing, but by the time you're ready to play them, you'll have the skill that you need to win. Or, if you don't, the game doesn't punish you. You'll be docked points and you won't be able to get SSS ranks by sucking, but one feature of Aces Wild is its instant load times and seamless transitions. You can keep trying at the specific point you want until you give up. It's everything arcade action gaming ought to be.

There are times it gets a little hectic even on the Normal difficulty.  It's a simple brawler with deeper mechanics like learning different enemy patterns and learning the trajectory of knocked-back enemies to garner more combos.  You have only two attack buttons, but there is plenty to learn and plenty of different ways to combo.\n\nThe enemy count on screen can become a little hectic, and first time playing, you won't beat the later bosses first try.

You’re able to continually punch and kick while remaining motionless in air, and you can even fly if you tried. Most enemies are easy to beat, but some, including what I thought to be a doge-like dog, are really difficult to defeat if there’s no combo going. The more rapidly you attack, the higher your combo, allowing more damage to be dealt.\n\nAces Wild makes use of arcade-style graphics, but with a simplistic style to them. Almost like a cartoon, actually. The game is a side-scroller, so once you find yourself in a battle, all enemies must be defeated before moving on.\n\nOverall, the game feels really good to play. The satisfaction of wiping out dozens of on-screen enemies at once is awesome. The game may be difficult at parts, but it definitely deserves my recommendation.","February 17, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","A 2D beat em up that plays more like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta than Streets of Rage or Final Fight. The action is faster, the characters can move across the screen in a flash, and you can have 10 enemies randomly appear poised to attack.\n\nThe crux of the game is balancing your use of your 'Wild' gauge and not dying. As you attack enemies or are attacked your 'Wild' gauge builds up. Past a certain point you can use 'Panic' mode, which depletes the gauge but restores health. Or you can charge up your attacks and inflict some serious damage; you can use up the entire gauge for a single charged attack if you wish. As you attack and build up your gauge, your rank goes up which makes your attacks stronger, but your enemies also become stronger. You want to stay alive as long as possible to continously rank up; using Panic lowers your rank.\n\nThe game is pretty fun; but its also pretty simplistic. Gameplay boils down to mashing the attack button and is really more about balancing gauge use and keeping your score up. It's status as an indie title shows: there are 5 level backgrounds in total and the enemy variety is minimal. Your characters have a limited variety of moves and unlike titles within the same genre, like Muramasa (fantastic game, btw) or Double Dragon Neon (BUY IT NOW), you don't get to customize your repertoire of moves and you're pretty much stuck with the same move set. Which would be alright if it were still 1993.\n\nOverall the game is pretty fun, though, but it could use more polish (variety, upgrades, more varied levels). It's pretty damn bare bones as it is, so why the recommendation? Because it doesn't do anything wrong, it just doesn't do enough of it. I can SEE where the appeal might be and I can SEE where the fun might lie, but as it stands it could use more polish and more variety. There's nothing wrong with it as it is, it just doesn't do enough to draw me in and didn't warrant my attention.\n\n5/10:meeehhh. Also, a 5 isn't an automatic ''♥♥♥♥ this title'' in this scenario. A 5 means alright; it isn't an atrocious score. I recommend the title if you can get it under 10 bux; 5=alright. Not a must-have, but alright if you're into the genre and are into the game system and mechanics.","February 14, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can’t help but feel like a badass as you send multiple enemies flying across the screen in a charged attack. The enemy variety isn’t huge, but it isn’t small either, and the occasional boss or mini-boss battles help keep the momentum going between the waves of squishy enemies.\n\nThe game does however suffer from various technical issues, such as getting inexplicably stuck on the title splash, or the game adding a second player if you have a controller plugged in. All minor problems, but sadly diminish the over-all experience.\n\nThe verdict:\n+ Fantastic visuals and effects.\n+ Charged attacks and combos feel badass!\n- Lack of move-set or variety in combat.\n- Has various minor technical issues and bugs.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10","February 12, 2014","true","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has the same fast, over the top fighting action in a full-screen environment, filled with colorful backgrounds, a pumped up electro-pop soundtrack and a wacky, yet interesting amalgam of martial arts, samurais, ninja clans and military technology. The "Wild" mechanic adds a new layer of depth and strategy to the game, requiring you to manage your resources to go either for high damage, high stakes fights with huge waves of enemies, or a more slow paced, defensive approach. Beware of this game though, as this one is not begineer friendly in any way, not even in the "easiest" difficulty. Lots of touch-of-death beatdowns, cheap enemies, and deceitful stages wait for you to get frustrated and consumed in gaming rage. This title required a lot of patience, trial and error, rinse and repeat gameplay, and of course, practice, for me to get at least decent.

Arrow keys are completely ignored, as is the mouse.\n\nKeyboard setup is handled so badly that it's practically guaranteed to screw up your controls so badly that you have to dig around in the game's files and delete the configuration. This is one of those "go down the list and assign every single command" kinds of setups. Escape is registerred as an input during this, presumably so you can immediately start screwing things up. If you get past that and are successfully inputting your controls, you will then notice that the movement commands are at the very bottom of the list. Some VERY LOGICAL alternatives people could use for movement are the arrow keys or the numpad's arrows. Except those aren't recognized by this game. So then you're stuck having to navigate menus with some random set of keys (or giving up and deleting the config. Again) until you can reconfigure them.\n\nI've been encountering this kind of thing in a lot of games lately, and it seriously needs to stop. I don't care if a game "plays better" on a controller. That is no excuse to cripple the experience of keyboard users.

A fast paced ariel beat'em up.\n\nConcept:\nIt's super-simple, hit dudes until your 'wild' gauge increases so you give/take more damage. You can then expell your wild to restore your health and give the enemies an explosive bang. They've also got a dash and a dodge button, because that's just cool.\n\nPros:\nPut this concept in front of some visually wonderful backgrounds and pair it with a soundtrack that can only be described as awesome, and you've got this game.\n\nCons:\nBut that's the problem, you're not going to get much else besides mechanics, pretty stuff and an intro.\n\nMebbe more?:\nMaybe this game could use something for players to expand upon. Missions, a leveling mechanic, a more in-depth fighting system, more understanding of characters/the fighting circuit, etc. There just doesn't seem to be enough to keep people coming back.\n\n\nIs this for you?:\nDepends, were you raised on the 2D sidescrollers of the 90s? If not, this game's probably not for you. If you so, BUY. THIS. NOW and grin a little when it catches your eye in your Library.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manliness/recommended/269230/","manliness","Manliness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manliness/","76 products in account","tl;dr vers - fun game until it betrays its own design, it also wears out its welcome with uninteresting and/or frustrating fodder areas just to extend its length.\n\nThis is a twitch-action combat puzzle game akin to Bangai-O. The focus is on watching enemy AI and trying to figure out the best way to take them down. Combat is fast and feels great - which is good, because that's the basis for the entire game. The game revolves around its Wild meter - you build it with weak attacks and use it to do a heavy one, heal, or fly.\n\nHerein lies Aces Wild's biggest problem - the fly mechanic, which is used to chase enemies and generally travel around every stage, drains your Wild. It drains the longer you hold it, which is an issue because -\nA) bosses LOVE to run away and (with the exception of the Guile-type enemy) have ranged attacks that can combo, doing tons of damage -\nand B) the latter 2/3rds of the game feature instant death pits. You can air jump infinitely, or tap fly so it uses barely any  meter, but that's a timing window so it's inadvisable - you'll lose focus on enemies and they'll just push you into the pit anyway. I played through this without using the fly mechanic, once I lost to a boss because I drained my meter trying to avoid her floor filling attack that stays until the battle is over. Let me tell you, it was much easier since I wasn't wasting it on foolish endeavors like avoiding damage. It actually becomes unuseable on boss fights like VS Gene.\n\nThere's no interim save either, so if you're trying to get a high score run, well, better put some time aside for it. For the rest of us who just want to see the game, you can stage skip, which is nice.\n\nHowever, the game runs out of unique enemies pretty fast. This wouldn't be an issue if all the screens had interesting or unique solutions, but unfortunately many of them are just "here's a million dudes, don't die." Don't get me wrong, some battles are fantastic BECAUSE they have tons of enemies in it - but there's just too much sameness everywhere that you start going through the motions.\nThe boss rush section near the end is completely unsatisfying - there's no power growth so they're just nerfed versions of ealier bosses. More fodder to extend playtime. The final boss has somewhere around 4 health bars, and on his last one he throws out an attack that - unless you're near full health - will insta-kill you if you don't dodge it right away. Have fun doing literally the entire fight again!\n\nUltimately, the game is challenging and feels good, but the flying mechanic is a wasted opportunity. The saving grace is the utility of dodging, but even then the game just feels too long - mostly due to lack of enemy variation.","February 16","false","8.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","3"

I managed to beat him in one try, ffs.\n\nThe flying directions after a major hit need to be more predictable/deterministic; I never felt like I truly got a good grip on the mechanics because of its seemingly random nature. When a bunch of tougher enemies were on-screen and I had full meter, I just used it all up on the nearest enemy, insta-killed them, and then watched as my most recent victim's corpse bounced around and increased my body count by proxy.\n\nThat's another REALLY annoying thing: While the difficulty does increase over time, a good chunk of it is due to higher defense values amongst enemies. It seems like the devs couldn't find another way to raise the stakes than to make enemies eat more hits before being able to actually be stunned. This is especially a shame, because some of my favorite moments involved beating out opponent parries with my own, an event that could've manifested itself as its own boss.\n\nAlso, there REALLY needs to be SOME sort of progression/higher amount of content: All characters and levels are available from the word "Go", and you don't get any upgrades. This is pretty unfortunate, because the game could benefit from a larger player arsenal, which would allow for more combos and, in a few cases after a major reworking, better control of the enemies' flying directions (Particularly by way of having player upgrade attacks move the player in a certain direction, like an Akuma-esque dropkick, that also moves the enemy upon contact).\n\nAll in all, an ok game with pretty good challenge and a fair amount of skill involved, but to say it needs more work and more in general is an understatement.\n\n7/10\n","May 9","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A world where attacks exist off screen so that you can run into them as they appear on screen for 4 frames if you're lucky. A world where your damage values are miniscule, the enemies damage values are much larger, your HP is tiny and enemy's HP are damage sponges. You are meant to exhibit completely nonsensical movement, flying through the air as though no physics exist, and can even propel yourself from mashing the rapid attack button. HOWEVER, if there is any set dressing of any kind in the way, such as a street light or even a warehouse light hanging from the ceiling, you and only you are inhibited by it. Enemies can counter themselves into ceilings, out of view, and attack you through solid objects. Did I mention the offensive amount of projectile spam?

Difficult to master, hard to play, not responsive or intuitive gameplay... I was under the impression that games like these couldn't be marketed anymore but Culture Attack proved me wrong on that one.\n\nSimplicity can make awesome games but in this case it's a mess. You fight hordes of seemingly similar enemies for reasons that can best be described with a Duke Nukem one liner. Two player coop is broken and makes the game crash at the time of this review (I hope they will be able to fix it). When you start the game you need to press enter to remove the blank screen and unpause the game... I really don't understand why. You can't use the directional pad on your keyboard with this game, not even if you set the controls yourself.\n\nThe art style of this game makes me question the professionalism of the people working on the game. Would you pay money for a game that has graphic template like this?\n\nhttp://i15.photobucket.com/albums/a398/Aramax27/WorkOfArt_zpsc589fcf7.png?t=1399347344\n\nAs if this was not enough you get trolled as you play as well since I'm pretty sure that the Inu Shiba enemies that you fight are a result of the Doge meme and why does the ninjas burst into dozen of ninjas if you hit them too much?\n\nThe music is good but doesn't catch my attention and this is where this game should have excelled if it wanted to get the approval of most gamers.\n\nYou can select one of the 7 the stage you want to fight in arcade mode and what area of that stage you want to fight in, you can even go directly to the Boss battles if you wish but everything feels the same, just select one of the 3 characters and beat everyone up like a real honest-to-goodness beat'em up game... but empty inside. The moves you can perform are amazing you can throw punches like E. Honda, fly in the air like dragon ball-z, dodge attacks, counter attack and you can heal yourself or perform devastating attacks by using your wild meter that you fill up punching baddies who throw all sort of projectiles your way and attack you in a predictable pattern that never changes.\n\nIn short Aces Wild would be a decent free game on some website that has advertising... at best. It needs a lot more work to become a decent game that will become memorable.\n\nFinal verdict: 5/10","May 5, 2014","false","1.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It's clearly trying to be like something made by Treasure and for a while, it really feels like it succeeds in doing this. The core parts of the game feel great, but there's just too many things letting it down.\n\nThose core parts work really well - the movement and combat are simple while having a decent amount of depth. Rapid attacks build up the 'Wild' meter, which is used for both charged attacks and restoring health. It provides an interesting balance that adds a nice risk/reward element. The combat is fun and satisfying when it works out.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a lot dragging this game down. There are only about five types of enemies, with a couple variations on each. This might not be a big deal if the fights felt like they were carefully designed, but later levels usually throw more enemies in at once. One missed dodge can lead to taking a string of hits and losing a large chunk of health. Boss battles have similar issues. Plenty of things simply feel too unforgiving or even unfair. If there was more variety in enemies along with more carefully designed fights, it could be a great game. It just ends up being difficult for dumb reasons, which is a shame because it has a lot of potential.","August 28, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aces wild is an interesting mix up between crazy action beat um up, and old school side scrolling beat um up, That does the former much better than it does the latter.\n\nIt’s crazy to think that an Indy made game like this, could have out classed so many games made by major publishers, if it weren’t for a few key features missing from it’s incredibly fluid, over the top play style. The games basic controls consist of two main attacks, a dash, and a guard, The light attack button is your standard combo attack, and the other is the heavy crash attack button. The game also has an extremely interesting mechanic that holds it all together, called wild meter. The wild meter fills up as you preform combos. The fun thing about it is that it has a large variety of uses, wild can be used for preforming crash attacks, for charging  crash attacks, crash counters, extended dashing, and activating “panic”. Not only this, but the more wild you have the more base damage your combos do, which constantly keeps you thinking about how much wild you spend as opposed to keeping it in to do more combo damage to your enemy’s. Also unlike a lot of other games, all of these skills are essential to master, and none of them feel pointless. The game has a great deal of enemy variety, all of which demand a different way of fighting. The weaker foes in the game can be mowed down with basic combos, but it gets really tricky when you have to fight enemies who are not affected by hit stun because of their shields, or enemy’s that spam projectiles, and others that counter. The game makes you think about what enemy’s you want to prioritize, as well as what you want to use your wild on. Sometimes it will be more beneficial to fight a good long fight while dogging all incoming attacks mixing up your basic, and crash attacks to gain wild faster. Or sometimes it will be better rolling into the part of the level, and destroying everything with one fully charged crash attack, causing all your enemy’s to knock into each other at full force. Or you just might want to play it safe till you get enough wild to use a panic, which restores a great deal of health depending on how much wild you have.\n\nAnother huge part of the games great combat, is how the dashing and dogging work so well, it never gets old watching your enemy’s fly to the other side of the screen, and catching right up to them, in a split second just to keep the beat down going, then sending the body whirling into the rest of the enemy’s. It also serves as a great tool to catch, and pummel many of the bosses before they are able to perform an attack, if they don’t have a guard up. It’s also nice to see that dogging has an extended window of invincibility which makes it easier to preform counters which comes in handy to beating most of the games earlier foes. The game does a fantastic job at keeping the action going even at some of its more chaotic points, dashing around preforming a combo, finishing a guy of and diving right into the rest of the group with a fully charged crash attack is satisfying. The game is a complete joy to play, and delivers on making the player feel like a badass, as the action never breaks, till the last few stages.\n\nUnfortunately as much as I want to gush about the games combat it has some extremely large draw backs as the game moves on. Now it should be said that these games are difficult by nature, but towards the end of the game, you can be punished with death for the slightest mistakes. It’s all fun and games till you have around one hundred enemies on screen, and twenty of them are throwing projectiles at you, making it look more like a smup than a beat um up. At this stage one missed dodge will open you up to a fifty or more hit combo taking half your life away, only to wind up in the same position less than a second later because you failed to take out any enemies, because they were too busy styling all over your face. It’s also not fun to run into twenty or so enemy’s that all have shields, and aren’t affected by hit stun, and are essentially invulnerable, while they mercilessly hack away at you. In fights like these, the games mechanics begin to break down. Counters become worthless; with only limited invincibility leaving you open to punishment after only killing a few guys. And crash attacks become almost unusable, as you may never get even the one second it takes to charge them up to guard break. And even if you do, it’s easy to wiff, and wastes your entire wild meter on noting, while you put your controller down, and get styled on into oblivion. Just whiffing a crash attack at certain times can spell instant death, because you may not get a good chance to gain enough wild back to guard break. The games main problem is that it doesn’t include any kind of upgrade system that is seen in any of the games 3d counter parts. The game makes itself into a perfect example of, why such things are needed in a manic brawler. Being able to customize how you fight keeps it so you can keep playing the game the way you want to play, instead of the game playing you, as you are forced to conform to enemy patterns, or die. It would have been fantastic to put points into the counter mechanic so that you could remain invincible while you perform a crash counter, so you know you’re not going to burn your entire wild meter for nothing. Being able to upgrade key mechanics is a must for games like this, 3d or 2d. It just can’t stay true to its old school arcade street brawler roots, where you don’t get any kind of upgrades, and you have to rely on basic mechanics. If things stay to basic, the enemy verity begins to cap out at a point, and you end up with a game that just poor’s on the hurt to artificially extend its length.\n\nAnother one of the games sore spots is its presentation it’s environments are clean, but dull, character animation’s outside of aces, are very poor, and aces are very lacking, and enemy designs are very hit or miss. You only get two playable characters with only minor differences. The game is only about seven to eight hours long, and the game has no reliability, or online play at all. However the music is pretty good for the most part. Over all it’s an amazing game at its core, I’ve never played a 2d game as fast nor as furious as this one, but its un polished no matter where you look at it. 7/10","July 17, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The fact that all the ninjas fly around is weird but it works with gameplay and essentially makes you use more of the 2D space. If the game looks fun to you, it will be. Only complaint really is that the enemies turning red before they attack is weirdly inconsistant like some enemies/attacks have it and others don't and it also has a really wide range of when something will turn red vs when the attack will come out. I think its just a stylistic choice but the red is out of place enough that I get the feeling it should be an overall game mechanic which it isn't.

I haven't played it for long, but I've enjoyed every minute of it's button-mashing action. I grew up enjoying many a cartoon-looking side scroller, and this one not only delivers in the nostalgia department, there's definitely lots of fun to be had for newbies.\n\nThe game looks like it should have been made in the 90s, but this isn't a bad thing. Genuinely good arcade games have been scarce of late, especially the side scroll, button mashing, high scoring sort. Games like Cadillacs and Dinosaurs and Final Fight were hits because of the ridiculous number of enemies you had to beat down until your fingers hurt and the insane boss fights. This game is no exception.\n\nThe action is smooth, comboing enemies into all corners of the screen is fun, and if you're worried it's too easy, don't. If you're like me, you'll go down a few times, but still want to come back for another round. You can also adjust the difficulty, so you're never short of a challenge. Each time I play I get a better feel for it, so after an hour or so you'll settle into a rythm, dodging ninjas and counter attacking until your wild meter is nice and full.\n\nKudos to the game creators! They've got a hit here. It still feels like it needs a little refinement or more detail but it's good as it is. I'd give it a solid 8/10 - a must buy.\n\nMake sure your controller (or keyboard) can take the hammering. You're going to want to keep that Wild meter full for the extra damage, flashy effects and ricocheting enemies ;)","February 5, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is like an old school beat-em up/brawler game. It may remind you of games like Streets of Rage, Golden Axe, River City Ransom, Comix Zone, Double Dragon, Battletoads.......\n\nThis is a very satisfying game if you let yourself get to know it. It's a simple design with a detailed gameplay experience. The controls are simple and so is your goal. The experience, however, WILL challenge you. It demands all of your skill... anything less and you will be punished. This is a high paced action game that throws a lot of obstacles in your face (and all at once in some cases). It will intimidate you, frustrate you, and mock you... but in the end you may feel a sense of proudness and badass-ery when you clear that stage and/or boss, even after dying numerous times.\nEven after beating it, which I honestly wasn't sure I was going to be able to do, I still find myself coming back to it because even after becoming better at the game I'm still challenged by it (in a mostly fun way). There's even a few more masochistic difficulty levels for the die hards out there. The gameplay feels fresh every time I play it because I try to play better than last time for the sake of personal achievement. To me this equals a game that was well done.\nThis game also has an awesome soundtrack to go with smashing up your enemies. Can't really say more than that.\n\n8/10 is what I'd say. Buy it.\n\nIt doesn't get a 9 because the stage 6 boss is designed poorly for the overall game experience, I think it ruins the game a little, it doesn't match the skill pace.

It's clearly trying to be like something made by Treasure and for a while, it really feels like it succeeds in doing this. The core parts of the game feel great, but there's just too many things letting it down.\n\nThose core parts work really well - the movement and combat are simple while having a decent amount of depth. Rapid attacks build up the 'Wild' meter, which is used for both charged attacks and restoring health. It provides an interesting balance that adds a nice risk/reward element. The combat is fun and satisfying when it works out.\n\nUnfortunately, there's a lot dragging this game down. There are only about five types of enemies, with a couple variations on each. This might not be a big deal if the fights felt like they were carefully designed, but later levels usually throw more enemies in at once. One missed dodge can lead to taking a string of hits and losing a large chunk of health. Boss battles have similar issues. Plenty of things simply feel too unforgiving or even unfair. If there was more variety in enemies along with more carefully designed fights, it could be a great game. It just ends up being difficult for dumb reasons, which is a shame because it has a lot of potential.","August 28, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wild boosts YOUR damage of all attacks significantly, but ALSO boosts the damage you take. Crash is the best way to break through shields, but charging it drains Wild. So it’s often more advantageous to NOT charge it at all. And Panic restores HP and reduces the damage you take, but it does not clear the enemies already on screen. And you lose ALL Wild, so most of your damage potential is out the door. A lot less intuitive than Fairy Bloom Freesia, but similar gameplay at the core.

The game adds a very unique and interesting meter which builds up as you attack more aggresively, the meter results in your attack power increasing but it also makes enemies more aggresive towards you. You can lower the meter by using charged attacks for serious damage (think of it like releasing energy that you built up). This meter keeps combat interesting and manic and makes the game extremely fun.\n\nThe controls are perfect, without a single tutorial I found the controls easy to understand, they felt intuitive, easy to get the hang of and very natural. However, just because the controls are easy does not mean the game is - the game is very hard and is constantly exciting and addicting.\n\nI'm not going to write a full review just yet since the developer is still hard at working fixing bugs and improving the game - one particularly annoying bug is that the game occasionally crashes, it is frequent enough to be annoying but not frequent enough to become unplayable.\n\nAt this stage, I'd give a weary recommendation - don't expect a finished product if you think about buying it.

The fact that all the ninjas fly around is weird but it works with gameplay and essentially makes you use more of the 2D space. If the game looks fun to you, it will be. Only complaint really is that the enemies turning red before they attack is weirdly inconsistant like some enemies/attacks have it and others don't and it also has a really wide range of when something will turn red vs when the attack will come out. I think its just a stylistic choice but the red is out of place enough that I get the feeling it should be an overall game mechanic which it isn't. Also its short, but its an arcade game so that's expected and proper.\n\nScoring system seems pretty based on not needing to use the panic button ever which seems hard from the little I've played but definitely possible since the game never "makes" you take damage.","May 4, 2014","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even though it's one lane only, it's an extremely fast one, with lots of aerial nonsensical madness. With really tight and luckily not complicated controls, you can see through all the mess on the screen by not having to remember the buttons, but trying to figure out the best possible timing in their usage.\nThe mixture of dashing, dodging, jumping, combo mashing and slam bashing provides a great satisfaction and joy as you progressively get better at the game, and cage all the chaos caused by hordes of enemies and projectiles on screen.\nWith three different characters to choose from, with slightly different movesets to give player the choice of playstyle, between heavier and longer attacks, or faster and shorter.\nThis games gives you a lot of possibilities for improvement, it gets much tougher each stage, sometimes a lot tougher, it requires the player to take his/her time to grind the skills to perfection- in order to advance in game, and that's something that may throw off some people. Because it's pretty much impossible to go through in one go (unless you were good at that stuff prior to playing), it's a game of mastering, much more than completing.\nThe player here is who makes this game, rather than a writer, you get rewarded visually and by score the more you kick ♥♥♥, and if you don't, then the game won't give you any consolidation prizes at all.\n\nSo if you want to git gud, and have the game represent your kick ♥♥♥ performance magnificently, then grab it and play it till you drop!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raviden/recommended/269230/","Raviden","Raviden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raviden/","218 products in account","Aces Wild: Manic Brawling Action!\nWhat kind of game is this? How do you play? What do you do?\nAces Wild: Manic Brawling Action is a side scrolling beat em' up. This game focuses on maneuverability and the featured "Wild" meter. You will be battling your way through 8 levels of enemies, each stage different from the last. You can play through it with a friend, or go alone. The “Wild” Meter is a familiar Gimmick. It allows you to deal more damage based on how full it is, but you will also take more damage. While we’ve seen this used before in JRPGs and such, I’ve never seen it used in a beat em’ up.\n\nControls\nLet’s start of on a bad note, the controls in this game aren’t so hot if you are using a keyboard. You will use wasd to move, and a few keys in the right to attack. Its meh, you lose a lot of mobility when you play this way, and it’s really not the best way to play. It’s even worse trying to play co-op on one keyboard. You and your partner will be crammed around one keyboard, with your hands mashing against theirs. Lucky, the game supports Xbox controllers and other gamepads. It even managed to pick up the NVidia shield controller fine, which was a nice surprise. An additional note, it allows one keyboard player, and one Controller player. If your just on a keyboard, you’re not going to have near as much fun as the controller alternative. I’m going to give this 2 scores, because it completely depends on what control scheme your using. 3/10 for keyboards, but 10/10 for most gamepads\n\nSound\nThe games sound track is pretty good. Perhaps a tad small of a selection, and it would be better if the music intensified with your "Wild" meter, but it does the job well. 8/10\n\nGraphics\nThe game takes a Saturday morning cartoon style.it looks great in most all resolutions, but the FOV could be a tad larger in my opinion. 9/10\n\nDifficulty\nThis game has some difficulty issues. There were parts where I would fly through enemies, but then there are moments where the level design is made to hurt you, or a boss is overpowered. one of the toughest parts of my play through was when I died at a boss, and was unable to fill up my wild meter, because there were no minions to kill. I was unable to fill my "wild" meter, so I couldn’t dish any real damage to the boss. It just makes the game seem very unfair, if not hateful to the player. 5/10\n\nStory\nThe only story you’re going to get out of this game is the opening cut seen. Its real just an excuse to fight people, but it’s a decent enough plot. I feel that there is much room for improvement, as some of the boss designs are quite unique. I would have liked back story on each playable characters. At this point, it’s just lost potential. It passes, but it doesn’t come near to excelling. 6.5/10\n\nMultiplayer\nWhile it is simply and optional added feature, it’s the way I enjoyed the game most. This is probably one of the best couch co-op games I’ve ever played. Its rather worthless on one keyboard, but if you have 2 input methods and a spare friend, this is the way to go. 10/10\n\nOverallAces Wild is a very strange game, it’s one of the indie genre's organized messes of a game. The best part about this one, is that all it needed was a bit more polish and it would’ve been near perfect. Sadly, this is not the case, we simply have what we have, and what we have is something pretty damn fun if you have the correct setup. For $10 and a spare controller, you can’t go wrong with this one, but go in knowing that it has a few ups and downs, and is not the most polished or perfect game in the world.\n\n7.5-Recommended","April 4","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather than complex combos, you really just have one combo that you mash over and over, but doing this builds your potential to do more damage over time as well as cash it out for gigantic burst damage. The dodge mechanic is nice for the bullet hell style gameplay, and you cant just spam dodge to win, which is nice. Yeah, an over the top bullet hell beat em up, that pretty much sums up how fun this sounds. Again, Its really easy to get into, and even harder to not crack a smile while playing. The soundtrack is chiptune, which may or may not be your taste. But as someone who can enjoy chiptune, I thought the soundtrack was pretty solid. For a traditional art style, the animations are very smooth and match the hitboxes of your attacks very well. My ONLY complaint is that my favorite playable character is a reskin of a common enemy, and that can lead to losing track of where you are while playing him; However, you can change the palette, which helps quite a bit with that.\n\nTL;DR\nits a gud one, a hidden gem, even.

The game is marketed as a brawler, but it isn't one really.  It's very floaty and has bullet hell elements.  It feels more like a bullet hell/platformer game than a brawler, but the floaty part is what gets me the most.  I'm not saying it's a bad game, because it isn't...it's just very different.  As highlighted in the trailer, the music really is awesome, so if you're looking for a game with an awesome soundtrack, there you go.\n\nStory?  Meh.  Characters?  Bleh.  Plot or intrigue?  Nah.  Then again, those aren't entirely necessary in action games.  The game is simple in delivery, but it takes time to really learn how to play it well.  I'm hesitant to say it takes skill so much as it takes you understanding it's not really a brawler.  If you go into it understanding that, you may enjoy it.","December 31, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
