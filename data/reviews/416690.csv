This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the new Free-To-Play game on Steam, Oh...Sir! Oh....Sir! was released on Steam on December 21st, 2015 by Developer Vile Monarch and Publisher Gambitious Digital Entertainment.\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/lDp48htyflc\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nIt is Free, it was made in 42 hours. Funny concept, could use more lines. 2/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nIt take a second to realize the turn-patter/rhythm of the game. It is actually a pretty cool and funny concept that could very easily be developed into a fantastic game. As is, the dialogue is SEVERELY limited. Do keep in mind, this game was made in a mere 42 hours and is also quite free. It is worth a try. Go give it a few clicks, spend about 5-10 minutes with it. Hell, I could even see it being a fun drinking game as is. Great concept and I would LOVE to see a fully fleshed out, online-multiplayer version. Maybe even with a random partner drawn for each round. All things considered, 2/5 simply because it's likely you'll try it, love the concept, but not play the game again.\n\nHappy Gaming!\n","December 21, 2015","true","0.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

It's broken. Really, really broken. My opponent insulted me by saying "That dog is a english dog pig, I bet!" (which would actually harm his own health) and I insulted him by saying "You are vile, sir!" and he scored a ton more than me. If you don't see what's wrong there...\n2: Some word combinations that should work don't, such as "Your hovercraft talks to strangers and your hat, mate!" doesn't work because it wants a verb after "your hat", so when I tried picking "mate!" it damaged me for making a bad choice... what!?\n3: You know what I said about the airplane this game was made in? Yeah, it's also a major thing.\n\nThis is just an overview of the several problems I encountered while playing this for about half an hour.\nIf your game's point is to have revolutionary game mechanics, yet those same mechanics are broken to the core... your game truly sucks.\nAs I said, good concept, horrible execution.\nIf these problem were fixed (which I doubt as games made within a timelimit don't tend to update), this game would be great. I just don't want to bother anymore because I'll get less points for saying something short and direct ("You and your father are vile!") versus something longer and completely stupid and irrelevant ("That dog is a dead parrot, and I have proof!").

The voice recording is awful quality, the sentence fragments fit together very jarringly, and the people doing the recording are clearly not comfortable enough with English to make you believe it's actually the characters speaking.  The layout is a little offputtinig, with no form of instruction or help as to how it all works short of trial and error.  The graphics are passable for a goofy little game like this, but give nothing worth remembering.\n\nTL;DR: cute idea, roughly executed.","April 3","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A 2-player game where the winner is determinated by the one who has the best insult. The better the insult, the higher your chances to win. For example: "Your mother still uses windows vista, sir!" or "Your father is stone dead". It's not anything revolutionary, but it's funny. It's a game developed in a very short time, so don't expect anything with superb quality, specially because it's a free game. And this aspect is notably cheap in terms of voice acting. But, thinking about it, the cheap voice acting is part of it's awkward charm.\nIf you have someone to play "Oh...Sir" with, you will have a lot of fun. And by a lot of fun, I mean you will play it for about 15 minutes, and then probably you will delete it from your Steam library. Not because it's bad, just because it doesn't have a lot of content (or any content at all), and after this 15 minutes you will notice that the insult options are very limited. But still, give it a try. Those 15 minutes will be awkwardly funny.\nBut make yourself a favor, if you are going to play it alone, don't even think to download it. Or the gameplay value will reduce to 5 minutes. Because trying to insult yourself isn't very fun. But maybe you have a different definition of what's "fun".","December 22, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't isolate controls from the two players, it lacks controller or keyboard suppert, and it's generally more a simple proof of concept than a full game.\n\nHonestly, the bigest fault is that it could REALLY use a computer-controlled oponent.\n\nHowever, it is a lot of fun, even by yourself, it's a small download, and it's completely free.\n\nFurthermore, it has a dry, blunt, silly, humor straight out of the Monty Python and other sketch comody shows.  If that is enough to get you to download it, you'll have some fun with this game.\n\nWhile I probably wouldn't pay for this game, (or at least wouldn't pay much for it or pay for it individually) it is a fun game none-the less, and would honestly make a very good mini-game as part of any other game.","December 22, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is a hiarious turn based linguistic puzzle game of sorts. The storyline is like something straight out of a Montey Python bit, whereas a constumer has returned to the show from which he has purchased an ex-parrot, it is no more, it has ceased to be. Players take turns exchanging insults piece by piece. A turn is completed when a player has selected a short phrase from a joint word bank or a personal work bank or when their time has run out. A round ends when both players are ready to insult eachother or when there are no more phrases left to be had. The game ends when one of the two player's HP bars reaches zero. The game is actually rather fast paced with limited time to read options and decide on the best course of action before time expires on your turn. For a game completed in 42 hours it's actually pretty awesome. I would have liked a handful of more phrase options through which to cycle for subsiquent rounds of play, but again, 42 hours. The voiceovers in the game are okay, nothing spectacular, but the worst is the bla bla... sound effect. Overall, decent game in short doses, very funny, well worth the download since it's free to play.","March 21","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't isolate controls from the two players, it lacks controller or keyboard suppert, and it's generally more a simple proof of concept than a full game.\n\nHonestly, the bigest fault is that it could REALLY use a computer-controlled oponent.\n\nHowever, it is a lot of fun, even by yourself, it's a small download, and it's completely free.\n\nFurthermore, it has a dry, blunt, silly, humor straight out of the Monty Python and other sketch comody shows.  If that is enough to get you to download it, you'll have some fun with this game.\n\nWhile I probably wouldn't pay for this game, (or at least wouldn't pay much for it or pay for it individually) it is a fun game none-the less, and would honestly make a very good mini-game as part of any other game.","December 22, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.\n2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.\n3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.\n4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed\n5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.\n6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.","December 22, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even with his health depleted the game did not end.\nIts quite funny at times, using many phrases from Monty Python, however the scoring seems somewhat arbitrary and the random combination produces some surreal insults: Your cousins car is your father... seemed to be the phrase that killed the game.\n\nAll in all, the game is an amusing diversion, and is free to play. I would recommend taking a look.","January 7","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Many insults revolve around making fun of family members, a cousin's car, any kind of Swallow, and hamsters, saying that they worked with Nazis, they STILL use windows vista (though I would've gone with still uses XP because some people can't get with the times), they smell, they can't dance, and/or are silly. You can then also end it with an exclamation such as "Sir!" or "You silly!" and my personal favorite, "And I have proof!"\n\nThis game has only local multiplayer, so maybe one day we'll have some kind of way to play it online with friends like in Jack Box. Great game to play with people you know, especially with people who love Cards Against Humanity.","January 5","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
