What we have here is an enhanced port of a PSP port of an enhanced edition of a windows remake of a combined turbografx-16/pc-engine remake of a pair of games on an ancient japanese pc. Rolls right off the tongue and I'm not even gonna get into how many ports the original games themselves got. I'm fairly certain this won't be the last remake either.\n\nNow that I got that bit of nonsence out of the way let's move on to the review.\n\nStory\nThe island of Esteria which is known for its trade in silver has been cut off from mainland Europe by a phenomenon called the stormwall for the last six months. Enter Adol Christin, a 17 year old young man with a passion for adventure and measuring women and little boys. He sails to Esteria from the port town of Promarock (or Promalock depending on the translation) but his boat gets caught in the stormwall and he shipwrecks off the coast of the island. He is found by villagers and taken to the nearby town's clinic. This is where the game starts. From here on cue battles with monsters, ancient civilizations, saving the world and the usual business when it comes to JRPGs.\n\nOverall the story is not a groundbreaking epic that will shock you with amazing plot twists, but it is really well written and will suck you in if you take your time with it. Even the most trivial NPCs usually have something new and interesting to say as the story moves forward (this is something Nihon Falcom does a lot). Ys II takes place immediately after Ys I, so my recommendation is to play both games in one go. There's also a bit of humour added by XSEED which fits quite well since it's put in the right places and doesn't feel forced.\n\nmuh grafix\nIf you've read the nonsence at the top or looked at the screenshots you should already know what to expect in terms of graphics. Enhancements or not you're looking at slightly improved visuals from a 1997 Windows game. That said Chronicles does have a nifty feature where you can pick from the original PC interface or the PSP one as well as picking between the original late 90s anime artstyle or the more modern artstyle for the character portraits. That's all there is to be said about the graphics, wether you like them or not is up to you, but I wouldn't judge the game based on looks alone.\n\nPS: There is no FPS lock, so stop whining, you babies.\n\nMusic\nINCREDIBLY BIASED OPINION INCOMING\nAs far as I'm concerned Falcom Sound Team JDK are musical gods and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.\n\nWith that out of the way, you have the option to pick from three different renditions of the soundtrack in the options menu (or just mod in whatever the hell you want because PC). The original PC-88 soundtrack from 1987, the PC Complete soundtrack from 2001 or the new Chronicles soundtrack from 2009. All three are great, though which one you go with depends on you. My personal recommendation is to mod the turbografx-16 audio in and enjoy one of the best versions of the soundtrack (why they never bothered to use it again is beyond me), some dude posted a mod for both games on the forums, you can find it if you look around.\n\nLong story short: Music is 11/10.\n\nGameplay\nWhile the rest of the games in the series are more traditional in terms of combat, Ys I & II are more of an acquired taste. The reason for this is because unlike most action RPGs at the time here you don't press a button to attack enemies. Instead you ram into them (slightly off center), that's it. In Ys II you get some spells which allow you to attack at range but the meat of the combat is once again dryhumping things with your sword (hence why a lot of people call it the bumper cars system).\n\nPersonally I wouldn't call the lack of an attack button a bad thing since in this case it makes the combat LIGHTNING FAST. I'm not even joking, you'll be murdering masses of monsters with such rapid speed it'll make someone like Guts look like a pansy in comparison (you don't mess with Adol Christin, the guy's a walking apocalypse). It also makes the usual grinding in JRPGs almost nonexistant which for me is a plus. I don't hate it mind you, but it gets stale fast if the game relies on it too much. Anyway on normal difficulty you'll be swimming in cash and exp before you know it.\n\nThe boss battles are the highlight of the series. In Ys I they are mostly hit and miss. Some are really good and there are others like Vagullion aka THAT !@(*$^ BAT and Dark Fact known as Dalk Fukt in Japan (if you manage beat him on nightmare mode you have the full right to rub that in everyone's faces because you earned it). Things get much better in Ys II, but it's also the better game. Ys I is essentially a glorified prologue but you shouldn't skip it since you'll miss half the story.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is where the Ys series started from. The games are great but they are not for everyone. However if you do try them out and end up liking them you'll be in for one hell of a ride you won't soon forget.","November 26, 2015","true","34.9"," 74 of 76 people (97%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","97","74","76","12","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/223810/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Ys I & II, being the first two games in the long-running Ys series, have had quite a number of releases over the years. It’s hit a number of different platforms, including the PC88, TurboGrafx, PC, Nintendo DS, Sony PSP, and now PC, each with their own tweaks to the game to fit the platform they were released on. XSEED Games and Falcom, who started their partnership  with the release of Ys Seven, have set out on bringing the definitive version of Ys I & II to the PC. The question is, how does this port in the long list of existing ports fare?\n\nOriginally released in the late 1980s, Ys I & II definitely shows their roots in their story presentations. You play the role of Adol Christin, a (now very well-known) red-haired adventurer who sets off on a journey of excitement and ends up washing up in a nearby coastal city where he learns of demon attacks which are driving the country’s citizens into hiding. As you progress through the game, it becomes clear that things aren’t as simple as they seem, with items called the Books of Ys being collected as you progress through your journey. These later become important to unraveling exactly what is causing this country’s plight and showing how to set things right.\n\nMost memorable for its combat, Ys I and II combine all the elements of a traditional JRPG: towns, shops, NPCs, equipment, character levels, exploration, and even some minor side quests and secrets. Ys I is more simplistic than its sequel, but both games are strikingly similar and tell two parts of the same narrative, even if those parts are two nearly identical story arcs. Each game can be beaten in less than ten hours, both have moments of great frustration, and they both climax in thrilling and memorable bosses. Ys I and II may be most well known for their shared "bump" combat system in which our hero Adol collides with enemies to injure them (and to be injured by them). The lack of an attack button and Adol's swift running speed make the action so frantic as to be absurd, and at times I found the red-haired sprite's action downright hilarious. I was skeptical and critical at first, but I learned to enjoy the simple combat, particularly during boss fights, which require much more thought than the dull standard enemies. Unfortunately, diagonal attacks are so overpowered in Ys II that regular enemies are slain with ease, and both games suffer from clumsy menus and balance issues.\n\nBeing that this is an older RPG, there are some grinding issues present in this release. Ys I, being merely a prelude to Ys II, only allows for Adol to level up to Level 10. Levels control whether you win or lose in Ys I, and at times you’ll have to grind in the initial dungeons to get through some of the bosses. This issue becomes a bit worse in Ys II, which ups the level cap to 55, but lessens the EXP gained from enemies as you level up. This requires players to, at times, spend time farming enemies in one area of a dungeon, lest they get instantly killed by enemies in a later part which Adol can’t touch with gaining more levels and grabbing enough gold to get the best weapons for that period in the game. Some of the latter bosses are particularly unfair in this regard, forcing players to gain 3-5 levels above what the enemies are at just to get through the boss fight with a sliver of life remaining. While this only occurs in a few parts of the game, it’s still an annoyance that could have been fixed with a few slight tweaks by Falcom for this release. Players who enjoy a challenge will find no problems with this though.\n\nAs both titles were released back in the 1980s, the RPG mantra of including key items in obscure places holds true. Numerous times in Ys I players will be unable to progress through the story because they forgot to talk to or walk into a specific story event that was either barely mentioned or not mentioned at all. While Ys II fixes this for the most part, there’s one key item in one of the final dungeons which requires players to go to a unmentioned room instead of a house in town, which is where players would assume it was located due to the game’s dialogue. The game could have greatly benefited from some streamlining for newer fans of the series.\n\nEven with those negatives, as with most Ys titles, the first thing players will notice is the game’s soundtrack, which like in Oath and Seven, runs circles around most other games. The soundtrack, composed by video game music legend Yuzo Koshiro of Etrian Odyssey fame, along with Falcom stalwart Mieko Ishikawa, is easily the shining gem of this compilation. As explain before, Ys I & II have appeared on numerous platforms in the past, so the game compliments this by allowing players to choose between three different versions of the music.\n\nOne of the most impressive parts of Ys Chronicles outside of the soundtrack has to be the game’s storyline and translation. For a title which was released back in the 1980s, the story still stands shoulders above many other titles of that era, as well as some of the RPG hits of the 1990s. This combined with the music and the general artistic presentation of the game makes for some very heartwarming moments. The main storyline was translated in a way which feels authentic without falling into the “ye olde” trap that most remakes of classic RPGs fall into. XSEED also threw in a couple pop culture jokes in some of the more obscure areas of the game for those who take the time to check out everything.\n\nDespite some of the negatives I've listed here, I thoroughly enjoy playing through these adventures. Being a long time Ys fan I owed it to myself to play the adventures that started them all. There is magic in Ys, and everyone should get a chance to see it.\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","May 2, 2015","true","56.3"," 55 of 64 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","55","64","2","0"

A plus is that you can recover HP if you are standing still in most places. If you are familiar with Y's Book 1 and 2 on PC Engine, you have a pretty good feel for this story , however some elements have been reworked to provide an element of challenge in order to advance to specific portions of the game. Some early bosses - You will find out quickly that you have to level up so high in order to beat them. That may take a long time but in the end, your Gold Level will rise high and you can buy some of the more expensive items from the get go.\n\nAnother plus of this game is the choice of soundtrack. You have Chronicles, Complete and PC-88 to choose from. For nostalgic purposes I turn it on PC - 88 because I love the retro music.\n\nBeing that I own Y's Oath in Felghana and Y's Origin , I had to play this. I had realized that this was also released on PSP but never owned a PSP.\n\nBeginners and seasoned Y's players will find a variety of stuff to do in both of these games and its a bargain for the price that was paid for the game.

What really makes them stand out is the combat. Instead of turn based, selecting your move from a list, Ys instead adopts a mechanic wherein you “bump” into the enemies. This is done by walking into the enemies either off centre in the first game or at a diagonal in the second game.\n\nThe games overall are relatively simple. Bump into enemies, level up, continue on your quest. If you can no longer damage enemies you need an equipment upgrade or to level some more. The story is also pretty simple in both games as long as you pay attention to where you need to be heading, otherwise you can find yourself getting one hit killed by encountering certain enemies too early.\n\nBoth games have a great soundtrack, are bundled at a cheap price and are JRPGs that don’t take 60+ hours to complete.

These games were released in 1987-1988. Despite ports on many platforms and numerous remakes (including this one), the game-design has remained unchanged. This is interesting, considering that Ys III was given a complete re-imagining in 2005 (Oath of Felghana). While I'm sure many people would love a Felghana-level version of Ys 1 & 2, there's something to be said about allowing a classic to stand on its own.\n\nThere isn't much to say about Adol Christin. He's the guy fate calls for when evil threatens the world. Every adventure seems to start off with him showing up at just the right time. Either that or he's just prone to shipwrecks. He's not particularly talkative, aside from his knack for explaining the current situation. In Ys 7 and Memories of Celceta he even says a few words during battle. He's not mute, but he's usually surrounded, by extremely talkative NPCs that do the talking for him. Adol prefers to keep quiet, so he can save his strength for the next fight.\n\nActually, the Ys series doesn't fit the description of "action-rpg" all that well. This is especially apparent in the first game. The level-cap is a mere 10, and you'll be max-level before the first 1/3 of the game is completed. Money will cease to be relevant half-way through Adol's adventure. In fact, the latter half the game takes place in the lovely Darm's tower. The average play-through should run about 5 hours, maybe a bit more due to the freakin' backtracking right before the final boss.\n\nAs it has been stated time and time again, Ys 1 has a "bump2win" combat system. There aren't any buttons to swing your sword, you simply run into the enemy. Not directly of course, that would be suicide. This off-center approach represents the entirety of your interactions with monsters. Aside from the bosses, you don't have to worry about projectiles, sword slashes, clawwing attacks, or anything else when facing demons. Combat can get annoying, especially if you choose to leave diagonal-controls turned on. Like I said though, once you max out your level, there isn't any incentive to fight. The boss battles are definitely challenging, since they fill the screen with dangerous crap, and it isn't always apparent when they can be damaged. For the most part however they are fair and entertaining to fight.\n\nExcept for Dark Fact of course. He is one truly bull ♥♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥. Fighting this jerk on normal is what caused me to grow my first white hair. I'm not ready for nightmare-level Fact.\n\nOn the bright side, once you defeat him you can move onto the much-improved sequel.\n\nYs 2 employs numerous changes to the combat system. On the surface it's still "bump2win" but there's a bit more to it. Well, maybe less depending on who you talk to. The off-center approach works just as well as before, but now enemies can be diagonally attacked. This simple move is far more effective. The enemies of Ys have seen changes to somewhat counteract this. Enemies will now fire projectiles, swing weapons, and generally move around just a bit more. The game has still become easier, but it's also become more dynamic, and more fun.\n\nThe combat changes include the ability to cast spells. Early on, Adol receives a fire rod. This weapon completely changes almost all of the boss-battles. Now you're not expected to run into the openings, you just have to blow them away. The boss-battles somewhat resemble a 2D shooter, or one of those genre mash-ups like The Guardian Legend.\n\nUnlike the previous game, Adol explores a larger variety of locales. The final dungeon is pretty massive, but it doesn't take up half the game like Ys 1. Instead you get to explore great locations like a fire cavern, some mines, a land filled with snow, sewers...Hey where are you going? Oh...yeah I guess going through the same areas as every other videogame can be really tiring. Keep in mind that this was all really novel for a game made in 1988. Of course, this excuse doesn't fly when Ys 3 (1989!) also features a fire cavern, some mines, a land filled with snow, and sewers.\n\nThe entirety of Ys 1 & 2 isn't just running through dungeons and bumping into foes, there are some light adventure elements as well. At a certain point in Ys 1, Adol has to wear a mask to see hidden passages (at the expense of seeing dangerous monsters). There's a staff in Ys 2 that allows Adol to change into a Roo, and actually converse with demons. Some additional scenes can be viewed by fulfilling certain conditions (most of which also award achievements). While they don't affect the game-design, they're a nice touch all the same, especially for fans of the series.\n\nThe first entry in the Ys series can be difficult to appreciate. The story isn't anything special, the combat -- while not without its charm -- isn't even a patch on Ys 6 and beyond, and there are some flat-out dull moments. Early on you're practically required to grind for experience and cash. I still believe that it's worth a play-through. If nothing else, you get to embark on an adventure without a lot of fat, and see the humble beginnings of a classic action (with RPG elements) series. I think Ys 2 holds up far better. It's more approachable, still retains its identity, and is generally more fun.","April 6, 2015","true","8.2"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","23","28","4","0"

The soundtracks are definately a standout which you can hear in the trailer. All combat is in real time and remarkably fun. It works on a bump system so depending on what angle and direction you hit the enemy determines a sucessful hit. The story is pretty simple and the hero is a bland, enthusiastic young kid but the gameplay easily supports the game's few negatives. And after you're done the achievements are a lot of fun to go back and solve.\n\nYs I: The leveling system is so perfect in the first game. Every level makes you feel more powerful and that you've achieved something. The maps are serpentine but not too frustrating. The areas feel distinct and the art is just beautiful. The boss battles are really quite wonderful and the final boss was easily the hardest part of the game for me. It involved so much genuine strategy and forethought that finishing the game felt so darn satisfying.\n\nYs II: Very similar to the first game in music, art, maps, story, and combat but with the introduction of magic. One spell basically dresses you in a kangaroo onesie so you can talk to enemies. Every enemy. I honestly felt bad for killing hoardes of enemies that just wanted to go home but were there because I was their badguy. The biggest negative would have to be the final boss. They were a joke and the easiest boss in the game due to the items they give you beforehand. The third boss gets a special mention because they may be the most horrifying thing I have ever seen in 16-bit. Ys II is just more of a good thing and is immensely fun.\n\n","January 1, 2014","true","13.6"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

That said, I really enjoyed both Ys I and II.  Despite the original games being more than 25 years old, Ys manages to hold up remarkably well.  It’s fast paced and accessible and the story is simple yet charming.  Sometimes the game does show its age with baffling maps and level design and there are a few annoying puzzles sprinkled throughout like relics from an earlier age of game creation.  But the game is competent and fun overall.  Of special note, however, is the music from Ys: it is fantastic, and the updated versions present in Ys Chronicles are a joy to listen to.  All in all, I can see why the Ys series has so many fans.","November 10, 2015","true","7.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Rarely have I felt so much satisfaction after defeating a video game boss (specially the last one of Ys I, which I can proudly say that I defeated on nightmare - and which I am ashamed to say, took me a few days to do).\nNeedless to say, this is not for everyone: you will see the game over screen a lot. But the game is not unfair, every boss has a weakness or pattern of attack that can be exploited (though it still requires some skill to do so).\nThe other strong point os this game is the soundtrack, the developers really put their efforts in it. The soundtrack of Ys is, by far, my favorite.\nAfter playing this game I became a fan of the series. The mechanics of the game changed a lot over the years, but the difficulty, awesome music and memorable boss fights remained.

Retro. Action RPG. While we're at it, Ys Chronicles+ kicks Major ♥♥♥ (this is an E rated review)! The game mechanics are so simple and so addictive that you can literally spend hours grinding monsters, just because! And then you look at the clock and think, “Holy Pants! It's tomorrow! ...But maybe just a little longer...” and then you turn into a zombie. Yea, this is a hyperbole, but it's not as much of an overstatement as you might think.\n\nAnd did I mention that this is a package of two games? Quick history lesson. When Falcom was developing Ys, limitations forced them to split the epic into two, resulting in two games, Ys I and II, collectively called (in this case) The Ys Chronicles (Ys Complete, Ys Eternal, Ys Epic Remake VII, these two games have seen a plethora of remakes, and Ys Chronicles+ is the latest and arguably greatest).\n\nPros:\n- Impossibly good soundtrack\n- Addictively simple (or simply addictive) gameplay\n- Epic, just epic\n- Two games in one\n- Too many subtle little things to list\n\nCons:\n- Some bosses (Ys I only) can be frustrating\n- A few very minor things\n- Review doesn't do it justice (but hopefully comes close)\n\nYs soundtracks are... you know what, there is no word that can properly describe how phenomenally awesome the music in Ys games are. In fact, Ys soundtracks should have their own special term. No really. I'm going to make one up right now: Ystoundingtrack. ...Maybe a work in progress. If you think the music doesn't somehow contribute to the addictiveness of this game, think again. The gameplay is addictive on its own. Now throw in the energizing rock music from the Ystoundingtrack and suddenly you have such an unstoppable locomotive of energy that you just want to cheer every time an enemy explodes into the aether (what a mouthful). The track that stands out the most in this respect is the Ys I overworld music. It's perfect. The rest of the Ystoundingtrack in both games are kick-♥♥♥ (darn E rating), but it's that overworld theme that's going to awesome the hours away.\n\nSpeaking of gameplay, Ys Chronicles has one of the most unbelievably simple yet inhumanly addictive gameplay ideas to every grace the world of video games. You ready for this? You sure? Well here it is: you bump into enemies, and they die. That's basically it. The game is presented in the standard top down perspective of retro RPG fame, and all you have to do is bump into enemies off centre to damage them, and then they die (if you run into them dead centre from the front or they run into you, you take damage... it's a little hard to explain with words alone). Now you might be thinking, “but how can something so mind-numbingly simple be so mind-numbingly addictive?” This gameplay element has been described by it's creators as the game equivalent of popping bubble wrap - they're not wrong. The gameplay results in very tight, fast paced action, and that only helps contribute to the energy of the game.\n\nOther than the basic gameplay element, this is also an RPG. In Ys I, the RPG element is very downplayed, and by the time you reach the big mid-boss of the game, you basically have to be at max level (level 10) in order to face him. In Ys II, the RPG element is more developed and balanced. You also get the additional gameplay mechanic of magic in Ys II through the use of magical rods (bologna! they're magic wands - for those who don't know, bologna is pronounced: boloney). Ys II has a lot added features compared to Ys I (I'll get into some of these as I go along). In Ys I, the only thing enemies do is run around at varying speeds. It gets repetitive. Fortunately, Ys I is a short game, and it makes up for it's repetitive nature with creative and interesting locations (extra points for the enemies looking cool). In Ys II, however, every enemy has its own unique attack in addition to the regular means of damaging you.\n\nThe bosses are where Ys I becomes fiendishly hard. Don't believe me? The big bad mid-boss is a monster! A superboss!! Add to the fact that you can only properly fight him with... well I won't give it away, but if you've talked to everybody, you should have an idea of what you need to fight this boss. And that's not even the hardest boss in the game. That trophy goes to Ys I final boss. Every other boss can be defeated on skill alone, once you know what to do. The final boss, however, has such a luck factor involved that it's... awesome! Unbelievably, they somehow managed to make a luck based boss that's, in addition to frustrating, so frakin fun to fight that it's awesome. Don't ask me how, I honestly don't know. The bosses in Ys II aren't as challenging. In fact, that's the one thing I though was a downgrade from Ys I. The challenging bosses in Ys I is one of the things that I found made the game so enjoyable and memorable. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of enjoyable and memorable to be had in Ys II. And the bosses are challenging and fun, just not as challenging as I would have liked. Also, most of the bosses can only be killed with fire magic. It would have been nice to have some of the other magic come into play, but... oh well.\n\nYs II makes up for this by being a huge game compared to Ys I with a much grander story to go with it. The story in Ys I is more basic with fewer characters, and because it has fewer characters, it feels like they had more time to focus on and develope them. In Ys II, while the many characters do get time for developement, it's hard to focus on any one character because there's just so many of them. Heck, there's also a present system in Ys II, and if you give people presents they'll say something different than before. Heck+, with the right spell, you can TALK TO EVERY ENEMY IN THE GAME! Did I mention you can BURN VILLAGERS?! (They don't die, they just say something funny). Everyone and everything has something unique to say, and often more than one solitary thing. The most memorable characters of both games leave a lasting impression for one reason or another (in one case, literally because of a hole in the wall). The plot of both games is basically the same, and it's RPG generic, but the story weaves its way around the plot in such an interesting way that it transforms the simplicity of the plot into a foundational strength. That takes serious skill. While not what I would call a perfect story, the characters, the locations, the events, it all works together to make for a truly fun and enjoyable experience.\n\nAs a retro RPG, these games do have some minor annoyances. In Ys I, there is one point where you have to talk to a character about something pointless before being able to proceed to the final dungeon of the game. All the other stuff you have to do makes sense, but this short conversation... doesn't. Why was it necessary (maybe it's a bug)? Ys II doesn't have this problem. Instead, it has the hide important gameplay elements issue. There is a very minor gameplay element that is critical for dealing with one boss (you can technically fight the boss without it, but that's nearing the realm of impossible). So, what do they do with the explanation of this gameplay element? As far as I know, one of the characters tells you about it, but only if you give them enough presents, and there are a huge number of characters in this game. Personally, I don't think stumbling onto gameplay elements is good game design. It's always fun to have some puzzles in a game, but these puzzles should be a unique application of the gameplay elements you already know, not somehow stumbling onto the fact that if you press a certain control a certain way for a certain magic, something different will happen (as an Easter egg it would be OK though).\n\nYs Chronicles+ are two phenomenal games filled with great energy and fast paced fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spootaloo/recommended/223810/","Spootaloo","Spootaloo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spootaloo/","191 products in account","Ys Chronicles+ is a decent two-for-one package, though mostly only for the second of the two games provided.\n\nYs I\n\nYs I was originally developed in the 80's as one of Falcom's first games, and its age clearly shows. Normal enemies are all incapable of anything but walking in the four cardinal directions and attempting to ram your character for damage, with the only difference between enemies being the damage they deal, the amount of hits it takes to kill them, and the speed at which they move. It ends up making for pretty dull, repetitive combat once you get the handle of the bump combat system. This is slightly broken up by the boss fights, but sadly boss design typically only falls into one of two categories: Ridiculously easy, or obnoxiously random/luck based.\n\nMoney and exp distribution in Ys I is somewhat unbalanced as well. You'll most likely reach the low level cap well before even starting the final dungeon (which makes up about half the game). You'll also get tons of money drops in the final dungeon, all of which is completely useless since you can't backtrack out of the last dungeon to buy more items. There is a positive side to this, however, as it does mean you can bypass late-game enemies without worrying about missing out on anything (unless you're an achievement completionist).\n\nYs I does have a few redeeming traits, though. There's a wide selection of difficulty levels to accomodate any player. The combat system is extremely simple and easy to pick up, and as a whole, the game is short enough for the combat to avoid getting too tedious and repetitive. The story is decent with a fairly wide variety of characters. The updated visuals look nice, and the rearranged rock soundtrack is absolutely kickass.\n\nOverall, Ys I is not that bad of a game, but its age clearly shows. I would only recommend Ys I to players who are already fans of the Ys franchise. For those just looking to get into the Ys universe, I'd instead recommend starting with this game's prequel, Ys Origin.\n\nOverall: 6/10\n\nYs II\n\nNow this is a massive step up from before. Ys II pretty much addresses everything that was wrong with Ys I fantastically.\n\nCombat is much more engaging. Basic enemies can now move in more than the basic four directions, and have varying traits beyond boasting different strength, HP, and speed values. Some enemies are immune to certain types of damage, some have projectile attacks, and some have much more erratic movement patterns than others. Boss design is much stronger in this game as well. Successfully taking one down feels like a good accomplishment, rather than being a free victory or a matter of getting a good dice roll.\n\nAnother big change is the introduction of a magic system. This allows for alternative combat options to the old bump system. You can use fire magic to attack at a range, time magic to freeze enemies and make them easier to kill, or alter magic to turn yourself into a demon and avoid enemies altogether. The amount of detail put into the alter magic is impressive; every single enemy spawn in the game has unique dialogue that you can trigger while in demon form.\n\nThe level system is now broken up from a short 10 level system to a more game-length-appropriate 55 level system. This allows for more consistent growth throughout the game with level-ups occurring at a fairly frequent pace. There is also a significantly higher amount of items for purchase throughout the game, ensuring that gold keeps its value throughout the duration of the game without abruptly becoming totally useless halfway through.\n\nThe strong traits from Ys I are also present here: Good variety of difficulty levels, strong storyline and cast of characters, nice visuals, and a robust modernized rock soundtrack. The game is somewhat longer than Ys I, but thanks to all the fixes to the problems mentioned above, that instead simply amounts to there being more of a good thing.\n\nOverall, Ys II manages to take the same formula from Ys I and turn it into something pretty impressive, especially considering its age. It still stands up remarkably well today, and it's a game I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone who is interested in a more old-school action RPG.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10","January 24, 2014","true","12.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Personally I didn't find it to be a problem - in fact, it makes the game even more action-packed this way. The two games also sport absolutely phenomenal music - some of the best I've ever heard. Ys I though is very archaic in its design - it's easy to get lost, and the game doesn't give you enough clues to tell you what to do next. The map is confusing. The game also doesn't have much variety - just ram into enemies and talk to villagers. Ys II, on the other hand, corrects all the problems of Ys I. The inclusion of magic makes the combat significantly more fun, and the game now has a ton of variety of scenarios - my favorite is disguising as Roos. Ys II is just pure, unadulterated fun.

A simple RPG with an equally simple combat mechanic: no button-mashing or commands, just run around and bump into enemies. Direction and angle are the only factors involved.\n\nThe updated version gives this game a whole new life and feel. What was once before a barebones plot akin to the games of the late 80s (here's a paragraph of exposition, now go be a hero) is now a storyline you can follow and become involved in. Cutscenes and NPC movement add to the narrative, and a few NPCs—and even some items—that were once inconsequential have purpose to the story. And all the NPC now have little stories of their own. The monsters have a 'bestiary' as well now, and you're encouraged to fight them more to learn all there is to know about each one.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are both greatly improved, giving it a feel of a later-generation game. Even the simple combat is improved with the addition of sword-slashing animations and SFX, and enemy death animations. Rings can be swapped with a press of a button, you can toggle the display of stats and equipment (or turn them off completely), and there's even an option to turn off the blood effect, if you want the game to be more kid-friendly. Also, the controls are now configurable with 'righty' and 'lefty' options, one giving you the classic NumPad/arrow key movement and the other the now-standard WASD movement.\n\nThe only downside, and I hesitate to call it that, is that like many other old 'remastered' games, it removes the inherent advantage of hardware lag and makes some gameplay elements harder than the original. For this remake, it's mostly in the boss fights. While a couple of them are actually *much* easier than the original, the rest are significantly harder and rely on luck a little more than is fun. This is especially true for the final boss, which is now a 99% luck-based bullet hell DPS race with an instant death factor. To be fair, it's the same exact fight as the original, but the original's hardware limitations at least gave you a fighting chance. However, the remake has introduced difficulty levels (though personally, I can't even begin to imagine beating the final boss on Nightmare), so you can make those tough boss fights a little easier.\n\nAll in all, a great older title that paid for itself many times over in every way, and a fun nostalgia trip to boot. If you're at all a fan of the old school JRPGs, Ys Chronicles is well worth picking up.","March 10","true","11.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I remember playing Ys: Vanished Omen on the Sega Master System as a child and puzzling out how to get past each roadblock in the days before internet walkthroughs were a thing. I was always impressed with how much fun the game was despite being very simple. To kill enemies all you had to do was bump into them! (Preferably from the side or back.) This is probably my fourth time playing through this game on a different platform (Sega Master System, MSX, Turbo CD, & PC) and it still grips me to this day. It's definitely worth trying out.

You must also sniff every girl who needs rescuing and frolic in their beds when they aren't looking... Also one boy became the target this one time. >_>\n\n[Difficulty - good]: I've heard myths of the higher difficulty levels of some bosses, you won't be disappointed if you want a challenge. For those with poor reflexes, easy is totally playable and you shouldn't have too much trouble even on the most difficult bosses.\n\n[Story - good]: Ys I: Climb a tower and leave nothing alive as you climb to the top. Ys II: Climb a variety of places while leaving nothing alivefireballs now included. It may be short and simplistic but it's still well-written and easy to understand...besides, this is an action rpg and you're really here to kill things. :)\n\n[Combat - excellent]: It's really a pity that Ys I & II are the only games to ever use the "bump" mechanic because I ended up having a blast using it. Ys I did not have magic but Ys II fixes that and polishes the "bump" mechanics a little more to make it even better. You can't go wrong with combat that allows you to literally plow through enemies and thus never have to stop moving to make for a very fast progression through the lands and dungeons.\n\n[Graphics - good]: Though everyone has preferences for graphics, I'm in the retro crowd and prefer older games. Besides that, there's a lot of animation and detail packed into these games and they even included the option of the original character art or a newer style AND it has some rather beautiful cutscenes.\n\n[Music - head bangingly awesome]: Seriously, you will get at least one song in either of these games stuck in your head at some point. They offer 3 variations of the musical score including the original score. I ended using the most recent variation which is orchestral and rock which was really well done.\n\n[Replay - average]:  It would actually be bad but given the challenges some like to do on higher difficulties, there's the option to make it last longer. It does have amusing achievements though.\n\n[Overall - good]: Ys I & II's combined playtime is about 10 hours on easy, give or take idling time. I had a lot of fun with both and really hope more Ys games will make it to Steam one day... For more adventures with our troublemaker, Adol.","January 6","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Essentially split up into two games, the two games actually rate differently from each other, with the second game likely to be your favorite.\n\nFirst, Ys 1 is a good game with a great story, it just gets pulled down by the inconsistent boss fights that were more from a lack of game design. Essentially, at least two bosses require the kind of patience of a Jedi Master because the controls and the gameplay are so inconsistent. Still, there are plenty of laughs to here, and I liked the way Reena is built in the game.\n\nAnd yet, Ys 2 is amazing comparatively. Not only are the fighting mechanics improved, but throughout the game they change accordingly to the story. Compared to Ys 1, Ys 2's battles feel more mature and feel more satisfying in victory. Furthermore, the story is fantastic in Ys 2, with amazing detail for everyone you meet. Even the monsters you fight have things to say, and I was really impressed.\n\nYs 2 is without a doubt a masterpiece and together the story fits perfectly in a book or movie (there are some shows, but it was early Anime and not much effort is given). I loved how the game pulled me into the story, made me feel nervous and desperate as Adol races towards the top of a tower in one of the focal points of the game.\n\nLikely, you'll beat Ys 1 and call it conquered, but Ys 2 will be the game you will nostalgically remember and play again. A fantastic series that was waylaid by its own mechanics in the beginning, Ys 1 and 2 stand out as fine examples of superior JRPG story-telling, and really feel in many ways like your watching the events unfold in front of you.","April 18","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It suffers from many of the same problems the original did, like confusing dungeon layouts and an occasionally directionless objective. The Ys I ending/Ys II intro cutscene also doesn't make a whole lot of sense compared to previous versions, It feels a lot more rushed. The addition of new escort missions is also somewhat aggravating.\nThat being said, the originals were great games and the Chronicles+ remakes are no exception. The dialogue has been touched up and it makes the story a lot easier to follow.\nThe improved graphics are great, although a part of me misses the brighter colors of the originals. But by far the biggest improvement is the gameplay. The addition of 360 degree movement really takes away the frustrating aspects of the originals, especially during boss fights.\nThe ability to choose between different versions of the soundtracks released throughout the years is a nice bonus (although an option for the Turbografx-CD music would've been nice)\nOverall, if you've never played Ys I & II before, or if you have and just want to re-experience them, this is a perfectly fine way to play them.","January 22, 2014","true","6.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I had played Ys: oath in felghana before and I absolutely loved it, but Ys I & II blew me away. The combat system is unlike anything I've ever seen before: you basically have to bump into enemies at precise angles to maximize damage without getting hurt and your character will automatically attack as you bump into the enemies. This makes fighting extremely entertaining, with its extremely simple yet fast-paced and challenging-to-master mechanics.\nThe game is filled with cool secrets / extras that add tons of replay value along with the newly added steam achievements which will make you want to play through the game all over again.\nThe soundtrack is asbolutely amazing and I loved every single track of it. I am going to play the hell out of this game and probabilly get as many as the achievements as I can.","July 8, 2014","true","25.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you're like me and got into the game at Complete, then having the music from both that version, and the PC-88 will make you feel happily nostalgic. The translation is beautifully done, and while I dislike some of the changes from the Complete translation Deuce originally released (Rance being Lance makes sense but I dislike it, Zeptic being Zepic just doesn't sound as good, etc) it corrects some that were... bothersome... (Lair was the original translation for Reah, afterall!)\n\nIf this is your first time playing an older Ys game, it will feel primative. It came before Zelda, before Hydlide, from the game makers that set standards to be improved upon by themselves and others. Bump combat is archaic in many ways, but can be so much fun. Ys II's addition of magic gives you more tools to work with, but most of the games your combat is about aligning properly with an enemy, and bashing them as hard as you can with Adol's body. This is easier in Ys II as the enemies gain attack animations and diagonal becomes more of an effective tactic.\n\nFor completionists theres plenty to do, people to meet in a rich world where everyone has a house to live in and feels like it could actually work within the rules of its own universe, and there are plenty of easter eggs to find. As a 100%er myself, I loved the achievements they added to the games to give you more reason to play.\n\nBoss Rush in these games is also different from later games, in that if you die its game over. You can't just retry. Boss Rush for Ys I suffers in this regard I find, because Vagulion (the bat boss) is frustrating to fight repeatedly just to get the chance to die against Dark Fact. But it is so satisfying when you succeed!\n\nIf you like Zelda, and want to be drawn into a world that has more of a focus on combat, no confusing timelines, and amazing rockin' soundtracks, this is your game. When I first played Ys I Complete years ago it made me need to play Ys II, Felghana, Mask of the Sun, Kefin, Napishtim, and Origin as quickly as I could. While it may not be for everyone, I think this game is a must try.\n\nIf playing this game feels dissappointing due to its age, I reccomend giving Ys Origin or Ys Felghana a try, as they are much more modern but keep all of the other important aspects alive.","March 7, 2013","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Want to be an anime sprite but tired of choosing attacks from menus? Take control of Adol, the red haired anime who just wants to adventure. Adol wakes up to find himself up to his (your) neck in adventure and must uncomfortably bump his way out.\n\nOkay enough summary time for the review! *cracks knuckles* Ys Chronicles is a lazy game for newbs who don’t know how to play (or make??) a REAL RPG. Combat consists of you rubbing against an enemy until one of you explodes. I’m serious you can brush elbows with a Goblin and it’s just a horrible pixelated bloody mess everywhere. It’s an RPG where you must get a better sword and shield, like I haven’t seen THAT one before!\n\nSo more anime shows up and there is a big tower? The story is elegant in its simplicity while the remade vendor graphics and sprites are charmingly well done so it’s like an indie game if it were made by real people in the late 80s. The explores are pretty phat too. Phat explores. A JRPG title with this little substance is never going to happen again folks. I’m trying to think of more to talk about but that is literally it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crache/recommended/223810/","Crache","Crache","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crache/","713 products in account","Ys I & II use a different combat system than the newer games in that you only have to walk into enemies to attack them and the direction that you walk into them determines if you will take damage.  In Ys II you do get some direct magical attacks, though they are mostly useful for boss fights.  It keeps the pace of combat pretty quick and really almost relaxing.\n\nThe storylines aren't bad for a JRPG, the music is really high quality and the games aren't all that long assuming you don't try to be more comprehensive with achievements and such.  The games are designed to encourage grinding before boss fights, but I never had to spend unbearable lengths of time doing so in order to progress. There are sections of both games that can be a bit convoluted or would require a bit of running around/backtracking to figure out and find missable or hidden items, so I would suggest using walkthroughs for a number of areas in the interest of time.\n\nThe only bug I encountered was with the final boss of Ys I, where running the game in fullscreen causes him to spam projectiles at insane speeds, so change it to windowed mode before then and then back to fullscreen before the ending if you prefer.  Might only occur on 120hz displays.\n\nBoth games come with a launcher that lets you set the visual mode to Chronicles+, which gives you a better fullscreen view without all of the fluff around the edges, adds improved art and I think more cinematics as well.  Definitely turn that on, as I don't think it is by default.\n\nIn the end, if older JRPG games appeal to you then these are great quality PC releases.  I wanted to go through them to get some context before playing Ys: The Oath in Felghana which is the remake of Ys III.","August 5, 2013","true","9.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Just tell me another game that you can get the "measures" of a girl in a creepy corner of a dungeon? LOL.\nWhat about the soundtrack? Ahh, the soundtrack! It's great as always.

Want to be an anime sprite but tired of choosing attacks from menus? Take control of Adol, the red haired anime who just wants to adventure. Adol wakes up to find himself up to his (your) neck in adventure and must uncomfortably bump his way out.\n\nOkay enough summary time for the review! *cracks knuckles* Ys Chronicles is a lazy game for newbs who don’t know how to play (or make??) a REAL RPG. Combat consists of you rubbing against an enemy until one of you explodes. I’m serious you can brush elbows with a Goblin and it’s just a horrible pixelated bloody mess everywhere. It’s an RPG where you must get a better sword and shield, like I haven’t seen THAT one before!\n\nSo more anime shows up and there is a big tower? The story is elegant in its simplicity while the remade vendor graphics and sprites are charmingly well done so it’s like an indie game if it were made by real people in the late 80s. The explores are pretty phat too. Phat explores. A JRPG title with this little substance is never going to happen again folks. I’m trying to think of more to talk about but that is literally it. That’s all. That’s the whole two games. I think an NPC goes through a wall at one point which is a big deal to fans of the series.\n\n\nFeatures:\n- Late Game Bromance\n- Numbers Getting Bigger\n- Tale of Souls & Swords\n\nLacks:\n- Light Hearted Minigame\n- Bros Before Hoes (#1reasonwhy)\n- Combat Gameplay Mechanics\n\nThis game does nothing for me because I don’t own a single wall scroll.

In Ys II you do get some direct magical attacks, though they are mostly useful for boss fights.  It keeps the pace of combat pretty quick and really almost relaxing.\n\nThe storylines aren't bad for a JRPG, the music is really high quality and the games aren't all that long assuming you don't try to be more comprehensive with achievements and such.  The games are designed to encourage grinding before boss fights, but I never had to spend unbearable lengths of time doing so in order to progress. There are sections of both games that can be a bit convoluted or would require a bit of running around/backtracking to figure out and find missable or hidden items, so I would suggest using walkthroughs for a number of areas in the interest of time.\n\nThe only bug I encountered was with the final boss of Ys I, where running the game in fullscreen causes him to spam projectiles at insane speeds, so change it to windowed mode before then and then back to fullscreen before the ending if you prefer.  Might only occur on 120hz displays.\n\nBoth games come with a launcher that lets you set the visual mode to Chronicles+, which gives you a better fullscreen view without all of the fluff around the edges, adds improved art and I think more cinematics as well.  Definitely turn that on, as I don't think it is by default.\n\nIn the end, if older JRPG games appeal to you then these are great quality PC releases.  I wanted to go through them to get some context before playing Ys: The Oath in Felghana which is the remake of Ys III.","August 5, 2013","true","9.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Just tell me another game that you can get the "measures" of a girl in a creepy corner of a dungeon? LOL.\nWhat about the soundtrack? Ahh, the soundtrack! It's great as always.

You are missing the damn point then.\nThe exclusively movement controlled melee is the reason you should try the original Ys, here in the best form possible. The high point is the remixed bosses, which are nothing short of brilliant. At least in Ys I. The magic fighting in Ys II ends up making it disappointingly easier. It's still excellent, with some gorgeous looking and fun to fight bosses, but the problem is that the final boss of Ys I was the damn high point of complex bump'em up combat, and at least I expected Ys II to push it even further like it did in the Turbografx version.\n\nStill, these are the absolute best versions of Ys I and II and the best way to experience their unique combat design. And if you get a taste for it, by all means check out the PC-Engine version of Ys IV for more high-quality bump'em up action.","January 4, 2014","true","20.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Also not available until Ys II\n***Disclaimer 3: ♥♥♥♥ bump system\n\nSerious time. This series started in 1989 on the PC-Engine, predeccesor to the TurboGraphX 16. Betcha haven't heard of either of those, have you? I grew up with a TGX, but i believe the PCE was Japan-only. *ahem* Now, these aren't the original games, obviously. This is Chronicles+. The steam version of Chronicles, which was originally released on the PSP, as a remake of the originals. there's also Ys I&II Eternal, Complete, and a (Terrible) DS version: Legacy of Ys.\n\nIf you've never heard of these games before, Ys is widely-known for it's balls-hard difficulty, bosses in particular. Unfortunately, the bosses in these two games aren't very fun. In Ys I, you get a VERY small window of attacking for all of them, save for two which you just have to tank all the damage for and hope you can out-damage them before they kill you.\nYs II is a bit better, though every boss Except for Dalles and Darm Can only take damage from Fire magic. It's about as lengthy as you'd think.\n\nLet's talk music, which is easily the best feature out of all of the Ys games. It kicks some serious ♥♥♥. Give it a listen.\nYou also have diffrent options for the music, i might add. Heading into options, you can swap out your reorchestrated masterpieces for... er... the original PC-88 chiptunes? And the soundtrack from Complete, which is like a remix of the chiptunes, and actually sounds good! Like it came right out of a good SNES game.\n\nBut gameplay, oh boy...\nIf you're playing the series in chronological order and you just came here from Origins? Prepare for an ♥♥♥-whoopin', sonny. These games use a "Bump System". Which you will hate. It goes against all logic you'd expect of a gamer and it'll screw with your head by the end of this.\nSo what IS this bump system? Well, you attack enemies by running into them. But if you don't do it off-center, you'll take damage. There is no attack button. You swing your sword automatically. This is PAINFULLY bad, especially in Ys I, as you have no other means of attacking. It's a big learning curve, but it's actually quite fun when you get used to it. When i moved to Oath in Felghana, i actually subconsciously started running into enemies.\nYs II handles this MUCH, Much better. For starters: You only take damage if the enemy is facing right at you when you hit them. this is a GODSEND. You can also attack diagonally, which is reaaaally helpful, and makes the system a lot more fun. There's also Magic, if you hate the bump system as much as i do. Fire magic, Light magic, Return magic, Alter magic, Time magic, and Shield magic.\n\nThe story is also great! Though there are a few plotholes if you've played Origin.\n•Gee, Darm tower sure has changed drastically in the past 700 years even though no one can go inside.\n•So apparently, the whole land of Ys went up to the sky, and not just Solomon Shrine? I thought the land of Esteria WAS Ys.\n•No mention of Hugo or Yunica. Cain being Darm isn't adressed either. *sigh.*\nAs well as others that i either can't recall or won't bring up here.\n\nOverall, these are great games. I reccomend giving them a shot when they go on sale, but if you're in it for the story, play Origin first.\n\nYS I: 5.5/10\nYS II: 7/10","February 27","true","9.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

It's a remake of a NES game that's so simple you don't even have an attack button, you just bump into the enemies at off-center angles to deal damage.\n\nYs 1 hasn't aged too gracefully, even with all the updates. The entire game is basically a fetch quest. Most of the boss fights are simple to the point of not being much fun and the game tries to compensate for its small world with constant backtracking. The power curve is also screwy since the max level is 10, so a boss will be impossible until you gain a level at which point it'll be a cakewalk. Funny enough it actually improves during the final dungeon which takes up half the length of the game.\n\nYs 2 is much better, the bumper combat has been improved so that it feels like less of a crapshoot, and the power curve is much smoother. The boss fights are still simple, but the new magic system makes them fun, and there's far less backtracking than in Ys 1. Both games are very uncaring towards the player. Ys 2 will let you kill yourself against a boss over and over again without telling you that you need to learn how to throw fireballs to damage it, it's usually not too hard to figure out you're missing something, but there's that.\n\nThe music for both games is pretty rad, you even get the choice betweeen the original PC soundtrack, the Chronicles soundtrack or the soundtrack from the 2001 port. It's a bit rough but still fun (mostly Ys 2). Oath and Origins are better though.","July 9, 2014","true","6.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The bumping in the first one just feels off, it's almost like both the analogue and 8-directional controls ruin it, IDK how since I didn't have the same problem in the second game. I say play the TG-16 version of the first one, and only play this for the second game. Overall, Ys 2 on this compilation is the best out of the 4 games/versions, so it's most definitely worth playing..

This game is definitely an example of a retro-stryle of gaming.\n\nI'll warn the readers RIGHT NOW. You probably need a gaming controller to play this, because it utilizes this rather unique (read: slightly annoying sometimes) combat system called the "bump system". You run into enemies to hurt them. So with a keyboard, it's rather hard to maneuver sometimes. But if you go into this game with an open mind and expectations of a challenge like I did, it's rather fun.\n\nI am nearly finished the first game, Ys 1 (95%, at the final boss and stuck! Haha -_-"), and the difficulty of the game is rather good! I'm only playing on normal mode, and it's harder than most games today. In comparison with other RPG games readers might have played, Ys 1 is HARD in my opinion so it may not be for everyone] I've yet to play Ys 2, but I hear it's a great improvement upon Ys 1, so I imagine it can only get better.\n\nMy overall score for the game is 8/10. It's retro, it's has nice neat illustrations/graphics that give the player a feeling of playing a piece of the past, and the music is not bad.","February 17, 2014","true","35.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can now write my review of this classic RPG title.\n\nYs I & II Chronicles+ is a mix of both the first and second titles that I have no clue how I never knew about. It is one of those amazing JRPGs that perhaps not many know about.\n\nYs I is a very short and simple game compared to the slightly longer Ys II, but it introduced me to a unique battle system I didn't expect, the Bump system. Tho I was a bit weirded out by this, I quickly started to enjoy the combat, I started to believe that some recent RPGs like Half Minute Hero may have been influced by Ys, but now I'm just rambling away. Going back to the review, Ys I will not hold your hand and lead you to the quest, that is for you to discover, something I honestly enjoyed as many games tend to hold your hand and lead you without thinking for yourself.\n\nThe music for both titles is absolutely amazing and well done, personally my favorite was the Complete version, and I played that soundtrack in its entirety through both games the majority of the time. The world of Ys itself is beautiful to view, even with the good old graphics. The game is filled with great characters to meet and talk to, you may grow attached to some of them on your journey.\n\nThe story of Ys I & II will captivate you, it presents a great story for such a small package. The enemies are difficult depending on how much you grind and what weapons you buy/find on your journey. I advise those to grind a few extra levels for good measure, especially the 2nd game as the first, you'll max out very quickly. The one thing I want you to remember is when you meet Dark Fact, he will show no mercy to the weak, if you are hardcore, Dark Fact will behappy to see you over and over again.\n\nOverall Ys I & II are classics I wished I played in the past, but thankfully it is never too late to discover amazing games now matter how old they are. Now I am interested in playing the other titles in the franchise, thus I have become a fan. You will not regret playing these games.","January 27, 2015","true","7.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DCT/recommended/223810/","DCT","DCT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DCT/","559 products in account","These are remakes of the first two Ys games Ancient Ys Vanished: Omens and Ancient Ys Vansished: Final Chapter which really are more like one game split up into two parts then one game and it's sequel given that there isn't much diffrent between Ys 1 and Ys 2 in terms of gameplay or really plot since the story of Ys 2 is just a countiation of the story of Ys 1, though Ys 2 is the longer game of the two and the only real changes made are the ability to attack a monster diaganally and the use of magic.\n\nNow if you played Ys Oath in Felgana, Ys Origin or Ys 6 you may find yourself dissapointed with the combat, there is no hack and slash system in these two, these use the "bump" system from the NEC PC 88 orginals where you run into your opponent off center, from the side, from behiend or in Ys 2 from a diagonal direction or else you will take damage and more often then not get killed really quickly. Now sure it sounds antiquated and lame but once you get used to it, it's kind of fun and is quite fast since if you land on your target right you land alot more hits.\n\nAlso since these are faithful remakes of two old 1987 Japanese action RPGs orginally made for a old series of 8bit computers the game is fairly grindy but not too bad at least on difficulties lower then hard, I found myself reaching the max level in Ys 1, which is 10 btw, by time I reached the third boss which was in the second dungeon and had almost all but the highest level gear and in Ys 2 I bearly level grinded at all and still did alright of course in Ys 2 I found myself getting lost so often that I end up killing tons of monsters anyway. Yeah Ys 2's levels can get pretty maze like the worst is the last level.   Also in Ys 1 there is some slight padding especially in the final dungeon where you will find yourself reaching the final floor of the tower only to have to back track back down to level 11 to speak with one guy to get one item that you need to unlock the final door and fair word of warning the last boss of Ys 1 is the hardest boss in the series all I can say is watch where you attack him as for every hit you land on him he takes away the peice of the floor you were standing on when you hit him so you have to watch for that and the massive rain of fireballs that come down during the fight.\n\nAnd the story in Ys 1 is pretty weak but that's mainly do to the fact it's a set up for Ys 2, all the story is there for is to lay the foundation of what you get in Ys 2. The music is fantastic and you get 3 renditions of them the newer arraganged version which I personally love which was done in house by Falcom's in studio band, the 2000 midi versions and the orginal PC 88 version. While it would of been nice to have been able to get the TG-16 CD/PC-engine CD-rom version of the soundtack as well but eh what can you do.\n\nI know it sounds like I am being hard on these but you got to point out the low points. But I do love this series and these two in paticular there is a reason why I keep going back and playing Ys 1 and 2 after all these years, I just love them and they are that damn good if you can look past the few old school flaws.  Highly recomended but if you want something that is a bit more modern try Ys: Oath in Falgana which is a complete redo of Ys 3: Wanders of Ys, Ys Origin and Ys 6.\n\n\n","April 29, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Instead of pressing buttons to use your weapon, you run into enemies to hurt them.\nYes, you run into them.\nThis is the first game I've ever seen to use such combat mechanics. And no, I'm not saying it's bad, but it really needs some getting used to, especially at the start of the game, when you have very low health and many monsters can kill you pretty quickly.\nYou also run into NPCs to talk to them, which can be annoying once in a while, because they tend to walk around aimlessly, often crossing your path, which leads you to run into them, which triggers a conversation (or a monologue, to be exact).\nAfter you familiarized yourself with the combat, you shouldn't have too many problems along the way, although some of the boss fights might be a tad annoying (especially the end boss).\n\nOther than the combat, the game is pretty much your standard fantasy action RPG. You have lots of characters to talk to, many places to visit, monsters to fight, equipment to get and so on and you really should pay close attention to everything or you might miss some rather important things. And I'm not talking story here, I'm talking equipment, that is rather vital to your survival and progress.\n\nThe game features not only a great soundtrack, but it also looks really nice. Reminds me of the good old action RPGs of the past, which this game actually is, too, as it was first released around 1988.\n\nThe combat is rather strange, but apart from that this is an absolutely great and fun game, albeit a bit challenging from time to time.\nIf you've played The Oath in Felghana and/or Origin, give this game a try, too, even though the combat is vastly different.\nAnd if this is your first Ys game and you didn't like it (because of the combat), give Origin and The Oath in Felghana a try, because it has pretty much your standard action RPG combat.\n\n\nADDITION:\nJust finished Ys II, but as you can't write a separate review for it, I'll add it to the review on Ys I.\n\nThe sequel takes place pretty much right after the end of Ys I.\nAfter killing Dark Fakt, you're transported to Ys, where you have to once again defeat evil.\n\nThe story is, obviously, pretty standard for a JRPG: save the world from evil and stuff.\n\nGameplay-wise it didn't change much, but additionally to the bump combat you now get to use magic, too, which I only used in the boss fights (where you have to use it, because most bosses are immune to melee attacks). The bump combat stayed pretty much the same, although I found it to be much easier to kill enemies now. Just run diagonally into them and keep on doing that and the enemy can't evade or counter in any way. You obviously have to look out for other enemies while doing that.\n\nThe graphics, imo, have aged pretty well. While it certainly isn't some fancy 3D stuff, the graphics look absolutely beautiful, especially when you consider that the game is over 25 years old.\n\nThe soundtrack, again, is quite good, too and you can even find the whole soundtrack in your Steam folder! And not just the new arrangements, but the original versions, too :)\n\nIf you liked the first game, then playing this should be a no-brainer, especially because you already own it anyway :P","December 30, 2013","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It was very easy to pickup and immerse myself In. It it reminiscent of old SNES games in both the style of artwork, play style and difficulty. The combat system is easy to learn, but it takes real skill to master. Basically you run into enemies until they explode. This makes for really quick gameplay and doesn't take away from the pace of the game. This is one of the few games I've played where difficulty actually dictates the game, the hardest difficulty isn't like most games, enemies aren't just stronger, the bosses have different attack patterns, are less forgiving and gold and xp are harder to come by, also every enemie after a certain point has max health. I have beat the game on Nightmare, for my first playthough I was enjoyable, and not soul crushing as most games on the hardest difficulty are, as you can save basically whenever except boss fights. A couple of drawbacks that Ys I has is that you reach the max level fairly early, as LVL 10 comes quick when your grinding for a new set of gear, and you'll almost always do Darm's tower at the max level. Ys 1 is also a fairly short game when you get down to it but, the final boss, Dark Fact, singlehandedly one of the hardest bosses I've ever faced. Also filling the bestary takes a load of time and makes it seem to fall into the department of redundancy department when your slaying megabeasts just for the entry at the top of Darm's tower. Overall Awesome Game! For Ys II, it follows the exact same thing, as it is on continuation of Ys I, solid game with a whole new set of epic music, boss fights and magic! Along with being able to use items in boss fights its a glorious sequel to a stellar game","February 26, 2014","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Any comments I make here will be based on that game alone, since I haven't gotten to #2 yet.\n\nSo far, the game is reasonably entertaining, as far as action/RPGs of its generation go. The combat system is a little overly simplistic, though: you attack by running into monsters, and whether or not they hit you depends on the direction they are facing and the angle at which you hit them. You don't need to hit an "attack" button to smite your foes, and you don't need to hit a "dodge" or "block" button to deftly evade their attacks. Frankly, you could play most of this game with one hand. If that doesn't sound particularly entertaining, this game probably isn't for you.\n\nStory-wise, you're looking at a pretty generic JRPG plotline - some warrior-type wakes up in some village, and goes on a quest to slay monsters and ultimately save the world/kingdom/etc. It's a little more detailed than that (as one might hope), but I'm sure any prospective players would prefer to not have the spoilers.\n\nAnyway, if you want an action/RPG that's a bit on the light side, this is as good a game as any. $15 is a pretty reasonable price tag for two games, and if you snag it on sale, so much the better.","April 14, 2014","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/recommended/223810/","aejira","aejira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/","537 products in account","Summary: A remake of a short action-RPG with gameplay elements similar to The Legend of Zelda, Ys I is challenging and will easily frustrate the average gamer. The game is largely unforgiving and boss fights will make you want to tear your hair out as they rely more on luck and chance than actual skill. When starting the game for the first time, I highly recommend normal difficulty and secondly, to save often as there is no automatic save feature. All in all, the game is a 3.5/5.\n\nOriginally for the PC-Engine, Ys was released in 1987 and received critical and commercial acclaim. It paved the way for Ys being a flagship RPG title in Japan and with localizations in the US. Interestingly enough, the story may have roots in the mythical city of Ys (Is) that was built off of the coast of Brittany in northwestern France, a city that had befallen the same plight as Sodom and Gomorrah and due to the sinfulness of its' inhabitants found itself swallowed up by the sea. The world of the game Ys however, takes place on an island called Esteria, where the ancient kingdom of Ys once stood. A young adventurer named Adol Christin decides to cross the Stormfront, a massive seastorm isolating Esteria, and finds himself shipwrecked and rescued. Nursed back, Adol adventures through the land and a seer named Sara guides him into collecting the books of Ys. Six books that tell of the history and downfall of the ancient kingdom of Ys. As Adol goes forth to collect these books, he will meet a host of characters that shape and guide his adventure until the fateful encounter on top of Darm Tower.\n\nPlot-wise and of course understanding that this is a remake, I found no real issues, things generally made sense and where I needed to go next was generally not a problem. There are only a few characters that you will meet reoccuringly, but given that the game is roughly 5-6 hours long, you won't develop any strong bonds with any supporting characters.\n\nThe gameplay probably needs the biggest explanation as it really doesn't fit nicely into any game I've played. Sure, the easiest way to explain it is, "it's like The Legend of Zelda," but even then there are some big differences. You don't control any type of attack animation, to attack an enemy target you simply move Adol into them. If you're offset, or hit them from the side or behind, you do damage and avoid damage to Adol. This can be frustrating sometimes, find enemies in a narrow corridor and your options are limited, enemies move at the last moment and you get damaged. Just remember that saving often is imperative in this game, there is no auto-save and you will die alot...ALOT. Just the first few battle sequences are challenging and once you start your first boss battle it will be harsh and unforgiving. Adol does level up with each monster he defeats, but there is a cap at Level 10, which you will probably have by mid-game. You can't simply farm yourself or strongarm yourself through the game, and being anything less than level 10 by the time you tackle Darm Tower is suicide.\n\nThere are some bosses that will just make you livid and frustrate you. The final boss is the perfect example, because it's simply a matter of luck and chance rather than skill that will carry you to win. The first boss can also frustrate new players because of how unforgiving one wrong move can be, but remember to save before each boss battle and to just keep trying. It took me about 40 tries to get the final boss, and the more you play it the easier it will become to predict his pathway.\n\nThe graphics is so-so, it's a remake but obviously there are limitations in how much could be changed without alientating the fans. The music is fantastic in some levels, especially when you start up Darm Tower, and although I never played the original, I'm guessing that they are remakes from the original PC-Engine tunes.\n\nOverall, if you want a quick but challenging action-RPG, I would recommend Ys I. I'm planning on playing the second game, and with everything I've read it should improve on everything from the first game. 3.5/5","January 25, 2014","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/recommended/223810/","aejira","aejira","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aejira/","537 products in account","Summary: A remake of a short action-RPG with gameplay elements similar to The Legend of Zelda, Ys I is challenging and will easily frustrate the average gamer. The game is largely unforgiving and boss fights will make you want to tear your hair out as they rely more on luck and chance than actual skill. When starting the game for the first time, I highly recommend normal difficulty and secondly, to save often as there is no automatic save feature. All in all, the game is a 3.5/5.\n\nOriginally for the PC-Engine, Ys was released in 1987 and received critical and commercial acclaim. It paved the way for Ys being a flagship RPG title in Japan and with localizations in the US. Interestingly enough, the story may have roots in the mythical city of Ys (Is) that was built off of the coast of Brittany in northwestern France, a city that had befallen the same plight as Sodom and Gomorrah and due to the sinfulness of its' inhabitants found itself swallowed up by the sea. The world of the game Ys however, takes place on an island called Esteria, where the ancient kingdom of Ys once stood. A young adventurer named Adol Christin decides to cross the Stormfront, a massive seastorm isolating Esteria, and finds himself shipwrecked and rescued. Nursed back, Adol adventures through the land and a seer named Sara guides him into collecting the books of Ys. Six books that tell of the history and downfall of the ancient kingdom of Ys. As Adol goes forth to collect these books, he will meet a host of characters that shape and guide his adventure until the fateful encounter on top of Darm Tower.\n\nPlot-wise and of course understanding that this is a remake, I found no real issues, things generally made sense and where I needed to go next was generally not a problem. There are only a few characters that you will meet reoccuringly, but given that the game is roughly 5-6 hours long, you won't develop any strong bonds with any supporting characters.\n\nThe gameplay probably needs the biggest explanation as it really doesn't fit nicely into any game I've played. Sure, the easiest way to explain it is, "it's like The Legend of Zelda," but even then there are some big differences. You don't control any type of attack animation, to attack an enemy target you simply move Adol into them. If you're offset, or hit them from the side or behind, you do damage and avoid damage to Adol. This can be frustrating sometimes, find enemies in a narrow corridor and your options are limited, enemies move at the last moment and you get damaged. Just remember that saving often is imperative in this game, there is no auto-save and you will die alot...ALOT. Just the first few battle sequences are challenging and once you start your first boss battle it will be harsh and unforgiving. Adol does level up with each monster he defeats, but there is a cap at Level 10, which you will probably have by mid-game. You can't simply farm yourself or strongarm yourself through the game, and being anything less than level 10 by the time you tackle Darm Tower is suicide.\n\nThere are some bosses that will just make you livid and frustrate you. The final boss is the perfect example, because it's simply a matter of luck and chance rather than skill that will carry you to win. The first boss can also frustrate new players because of how unforgiving one wrong move can be, but remember to save before each boss battle and to just keep trying. It took me about 40 tries to get the final boss, and the more you play it the easier it will become to predict his pathway.\n\nThe graphics is so-so, it's a remake but obviously there are limitations in how much could be changed without alientating the fans. The music is fantastic in some levels, especially when you start up Darm Tower, and although I never played the original, I'm guessing that they are remakes from the original PC-Engine tunes.\n\nOverall, if you want a quick but challenging action-RPG, I would recommend Ys I. I'm planning on playing the second game, and with everything I've read it should improve on everything from the first game. 3.5/5","January 25, 2014","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Both have somewhat redesigned maps, a little bit of additional items and playable content, unlockable boss rush modes, and (most significantly) the ability to move diagonally, but these are both still essentially the same games as the originals.\n\nThere are some elements of the games that haven't aged well, notably some inscrutable puzzles (save yourself hours of confusion and just look at a guide once you get the hammer in Ys I), mandatory level grinding, and plenty of backtracking through large, mazelike dungeons.  That said, these are still charming action RPGs with a fun and unique battle system, well-designed bosses, and what are still some of the best soundtracks in the history of video games—and you get three versions of them!\n\nYs I & II Chronicles is too similar to earlier versions of the games for me to highly recommend it to people who have already played them, yet different enough that I can't quite call it the definitive version.  If you have a Wii, you might want to download the Turbo CD version (Ys Book I & II) instead—it was one of the earliest CD games and is really interesting from a historical perspective.

Instead of pressing buttons to use your weapon, you run into enemies to hurt them.\nYes, you run into them.\nThis is the first game I've ever seen to use such combat mechanics. And no, I'm not saying it's bad, but it really needs some getting used to, especially at the start of the game, when you have very low health and many monsters can kill you pretty quickly.\nYou also run into NPCs to talk to them, which can be annoying once in a while, because they tend to walk around aimlessly, often crossing your path, which leads you to run into them, which triggers a conversation (or a monologue, to be exact).\nAfter you familiarized yourself with the combat, you shouldn't have too many problems along the way, although some of the boss fights might be a tad annoying (especially the end boss).\n\nOther than the combat, the game is pretty much your standard fantasy action RPG. You have lots of characters to talk to, many places to visit, monsters to fight, equipment to get and so on and you really should pay close attention to everything or you might miss some rather important things. And I'm not talking story here, I'm talking equipment, that is rather vital to your survival and progress.\n\nThe game features not only a great soundtrack, but it also looks really nice. Reminds me of the good old action RPGs of the past, which this game actually is, too, as it was first released around 1988.\n\nThe combat is rather strange, but apart from that this is an absolutely great and fun game, albeit a bit challenging from time to time.\nIf you've played The Oath in Felghana and/or Origin, give this game a try, too, even though the combat is vastly different.\nAnd if this is your first Ys game and you didn't like it (because of the combat), give Origin and The Oath in Felghana a try, because it has pretty much your standard action RPG combat.\n\n\nADDITION:\nJust finished Ys II, but as you can't write a separate review for it, I'll add it to the review on Ys I.\n\nThe sequel takes place pretty much right after the end of Ys I.\nAfter killing Dark Fakt, you're transported to Ys, where you have to once again defeat evil.\n\nThe story is, obviously, pretty standard for a JRPG: save the world from evil and stuff.\n\nGameplay-wise it didn't change much, but additionally to the bump combat you now get to use magic, too, which I only used in the boss fights (where you have to use it, because most bosses are immune to melee attacks). The bump combat stayed pretty much the same, although I found it to be much easier to kill enemies now. Just run diagonally into them and keep on doing that and the enemy can't evade or counter in any way. You obviously have to look out for other enemies while doing that.\n\nThe graphics, imo, have aged pretty well. While it certainly isn't some fancy 3D stuff, the graphics look absolutely beautiful, especially when you consider that the game is over 25 years old.\n\nThe soundtrack, again, is quite good, too and you can even find the whole soundtrack in your Steam folder! And not just the new arrangements, but the original versions, too :)\n\nIf you liked the first game, then playing this should be a no-brainer, especially because you already own it anyway :P","December 30, 2013","true","9.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As I already played Ys Origin (that I really liked) I expected having similar fun, though I knew from beginning that this games have different (unique) combat system.\n\nAll combat is done by bumping to your enemies - you bump his back/shoulder, you deal damage. If you bump your enemy directly in the front, he'll also deal some damage back to you. It's not complex at all, it's pretty much undemanding. But here comes the right question - Is it fun?\n\nWell, it might be fun for the first time, but after you beat tenth NPC? What about hundredth NPC? If you are going to play Ys I & II, plan for grinding. There's a lot of grinding for experience and gold with obsolete formula - if NPCs around you are too hard to beat, return to previous zone and kill as many enemies as you can. Once you get stronger, get back to the following zone and beat everybody, thinking about how easy it is.\n\nThe game even encourages you so hardly to grind enemies that you'll clearly see that any NPC you kill is respawned in few seconds. Welcome to the game where running and bumping enemies with your sword is the meaning of life.\n\nAll this grinding actually ruins impression from the environment and story for me but if you can get over it, you can be happy for many seriously written fantasy dialogues, sweet pixelart graphics and good soundtrack.\n\nAnyway, if this review make you lose interest on Ys, I'd still recommend you to try other Ys games as they have taken different (and more classic) take on combat. I'm still definitely going to play the other Ys games later.","February 3","false","5.9"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","4"

You don't swing a sword or cast spells in this game, you simply run into enemies and depending on the trajectory of your bump, you do x amount of damage and take y amount of damage from the enemy.  There's something to say about just bashing into your enemies, like how any Pac-Man action game should've played out.  You still get equipment and stuff, but it just affects how much damage you do and how much you take.  Level-ups are also a huge thing in this game.  They make big differences and an enemy that was giving you trouble on Lv.4 is trivialized by being Lv.6.  It's also very likely you'll hit the level cap a ways before the end of the game.\n\nThis version of the game has a few different alterations to choose from.  You can change the character portraits between a classic and remake version and there's also a number of different soundtrack styles to pick from.  This is a cool feature more remake games should try to implement.\n\nBeing a remake of an older game, Ys I gives you a bit more freedom to go about things than a more modern game of this type would.  It doesn't give you equipment to start the game and it's quite likely you'll head into your first dose of bump combat outside the initial village and die.  That said, annoying as that can be, it also lets you find good accessories and armor early on by not gating certain areas, so if you feel like running around a mine dodging enemies, you can loot the place a number of levels before you're supposed to head there.  There's a decent bit of interesting things like this in the game.\n\nThe game lets you save wherever, whenever.  Thank you Falcom for this.  I don't care for arbitrary save-points, and this being a a PC game, I like being able to save a step away from a boss in case I die and not have to re-run parts of the dungeon.  As for the bosses, there are two in particular that are just extremely annoying and got me this close to putting the game away for good.  This is mainly because bump combat makes fighting them a pain.  The story is completely throwaway.\n\nAll said, a solid 2-D action/RPG that's fairly short.  Has some interesting old-school conventions in not holding your hand at times but can be frustrating due to game mechanics and how reliant the game is on levels.","June 25, 2014","true","13.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The method to kill them was generally unclear, requiring you to die repeatedly (or use a guide) to figure it out and even once you had figured it out, it was difficult to believe that you had because, more often than not, skill was at best half of what you needed to win, and the other half was luck.

The games are brief experiences, even when paired together, so luckily this history lesson does not take a long time to convey. Equipment and story progression is fairly single-track and are not very deep in and of themselves. It’s impressive when you factor in the time and situation in which the game originally released, but it just doesn’t hold up.\n\nThe art and music are great, and there is just enough story to hold everything together. It was quite interesting to see the “callbacks” to Origin, having played them in the chronological order instead of the release order.

The game itself is very frustrating, but not in a good way that encourages you to grind more and level up (the player's level caps at Level 10 and I reached that after the second boss of I think seven), but in a demotivating way, that makes you wanna dump this insult to the RPG genre. The frustration does not come from the difficulty of the game, but from the ridiculously bad battle system - you basically have to ambush the enemy from a certain angle to damage him without being injured, what becomes very boring and annoying - especially during boss battles. And it always is a gamble.\n\nNow that we talk about boss battles, I have to mention something: The bosses don't have ANY relation to the story and fighting them is even more repetetive than grinding. The player needs to think of a different approach for every boss, which  I quite liked, but once he figured out what to do, the boss battle loses everything that made it interesting - and even that was little. Especially the second to last boss had nothing to do with having fun playing a game. It was mere routine and repetitive ambushing from a certain angle for about 5 minutes.\n\nIn short: If you have the money and want to experience this failure of developers and an insult to RPGs and RPG fans, then go ahead and buy Ys I. Else I'd recommend buying 14 cheese burgers with the cash. I certainly regret not having done that.\n\nI have only played Ys I and I will give Ys II a chance, but not just yet. I need a lot of distance to this game series for a while.","April 2, 2014","false","8.8"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","7"

I liked the story tho it was exceptionally short at best leaving out massive gaps. The soundtrack was ok, but i really dislike the walk into things to attack it's the weirdest thing to get used to in a game. i highly recommend a controller do not play on the keyboard. It's totally doable as I beat the game with a keyboard but my hands hurt from sitting in the same position to long, so take breaks. The graphics are what you expect but i really had a massive issue with navigating thru the final part of the game. It's supposed to be a circle but you'd never know if you didn't google the maps to figure out by shape which floor your on. With like 25 floors that's highly annoying. I'd say if your a fan of the game get it, but if your like me who never even heard of ys I'd totally pass. Its a game for games sake but that is about it to be honest. As soon as I finished it I deleted it and never plan on going back. I was disappointed. Thankfuly this was a christmas gift so I got it for free, my friend claims he can beat it in 30 minutes and I still think he's lying as it took me  4 hrs via using google taking pics of the maps with my phone and going back into the game so that I could figure out where I was and what I needed to do. For a game this old I shouldn't have to google every 5 feet to play it. Will say if you do play this game look up a guide (make sure theirs no viruses on the site and that its FREE do NOT pay for any guide ever!) and get the heal ring. Also just like the elder scroll series, save save save save save. I had 5 seperate saves going just in case especially at darm tower.","February 13, 2014","false","14.6"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","2"

As spoiler-free as possible. It started out pretty straightforward, and once I accidentally discovered some game mechanics which for some reason weren't mentioned in game at all, it wasn't too challenging early on (which it shouldn't be anyway, on Normal).\n\nLater on, there didn't seem to be much direction whatsoever, and I eventually just got into the habit of checking a walkthrough every step of the way just because I wanted to finish it. Half the time after following the directions I just laughed, thinking "how the hell was I supposed to know to do that?". There is vague direction, but it's mostly trial and error if you're trying to move on with only the information the game gives you. I don't know if it's supposed to be like that, maybe figuring out the randomest things imaginable is supposed to be the actual challenge of the game. The challenge certainly isn't from the bosses, those are either pathetically easy or laughably luck-based. I liked the easy ones more.\n\nThe final boss is just the worst, without spoiling things, I can only say that it has absolutely nothing done right about it. It's flat-out horrible in terms of story, gameplay, and, well... The music isn't that bad actually, the first few times. Unfortunately if you can't get the luck you need to beat him early, you may wind up listening to the same music for hours.\n\nThat's generally how the music in this game is, throughout the whole game. The game doesn't really have any bad music, but most of it is heard for too long, making it tedious, and it gets annoying after a while. If you want to simulate the experience without playing the game, look up one of the songs on YouTube or something, listen to it once. It's pretty good, right? Now listen to it again, for about an hour, and see if it's still good. One positive thing is that there are three different versions of music you can choose from, one from what I assume was the original version of the game, one from this modern version, and one from in between. I often found myself switching between the three because just listening to one was painful.","January 1, 2014","false","7.0"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

My first outing with Adol resulted in his death after two enemies because I didn't hit them at just the right angle and there was no indicator he was being damaged until he died... I wanted to know the adventures of Adol before those in "Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys" which is redone in 3D as "Ys: The Oath in Felghana", along with the events after "Ys: Origins" which could be called "Ys 0". Both are far superior in every way to this badly-aged, bitter nostalgia cash grab of a turd.

Then I bought and played Ys Origins and loved it immediately because of the close resembelance of the action RPG meganics that Ys online used. In the mean time I've bought the whole series aside from Ys seven (can grab it for my PSP) and all of them are action RPGs.\n\nYs I & II are not like the rest of the series at all. These two are more like the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs with a twist. First off, the battle system sucks balls. They prolly thought it was innovative for the time to use a 'bumb' system to attack. This also means that you probably won't be able to use ranged attack (I really can't see why XSEED didn't change the combat system in the 2009 version of the game - there are 2 versions of each game, the old one and the revised one).\n\nThen the story. Most of the old NES / RPG maker jRPGs it takes you about 10-15 minutes to get into the story and you can say if you like it or not. Ys I & II are different there and after half an hour and having spoken to every one in the village you wake up I still had no clue what I was to do, other than just leave town and see where it'll bring me. Truth be told, the main plot was explained, but from there on not the slightest hint of where to go or what to do.\n\nSomehow YS I & II just lack something for me that other NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs  had and I definately won't recommend this game to anyone, unless you've played them back in the days and want to play them again.\n\nBefore anyone starts ♥♥♥♥♥ing to me about not knowing NES / RPG maker alike jRPGs, I have played (most of them never completed, but that's normal for me) Final Fantasy 1 trhough 4, Star Ocean 1 and willing to play 2, Tales of Phantasia (still ongoing on the PSP, means when I'm traveling). I know jRPGs and Ys I & II just miss the clarity the other titles I named have.","June 24, 2015","false","3.5"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","6","16","2","1"

A game for ants??? You fight monsters by bumping into them. You interact with townspeople by bumping into them.  You pick up items by bumping into them. You solve puzzles (in the loosest sense of the word) by (you guessed it) bumping into them. They should have called this game 'Blunder Boy and the Uncredibly Bumpy Dungeon'.\n\nThe graphics are weak (even for 2001). The music isn't bad, but highly repetitive, even with the Complete Pack. Stat leveling is completely automatic (and one-dimensional). There are no powers, secondary abilities, or any sense of growth other than the number of times you have to bump into an enemy to kill them (typically 1 once you're high enough level). Quests are also automatic - you have no choice in their resolution or even to accept them or not. You just initiate them once you... bump into them.\n\n4/10 would not buy again.\n\nPS If you still want to buy the game, a controller is highly recommended. Played this with a kb and with a shield controller, and the controller massively improved the playability of the game (such as it is). If I had been stuck w the keyboard, I'd have ragequit in the first 10 minutes.\n\nEDIT: I've finally found the perfect adjective to describe the 'bump' combat system: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frotteurism\nEssentially, Adol is a pervert that gets off on rubbing himself against his enemies nonconsensually until he 'defeats' them.

As such an example, turning V-Sync off actually makes most of the game ridiculously harder as the game is very frame dependant on a few bosses. If your frames are low enough, you're guaranteed to get hit on one of the bosses, while if your frames are high enough another boss rarely allows you to hit him (and this is already a very RNG dependant boss). So why is this an option? Because more options are supposed to make it better, right?\n\nBeyond that, there's many things that have no reason not to be updated, but weren't. This is pretty much a remake four times over, and they've still left it so you need a guide. Lets also mention that some of that guide used to be an instruction booklet, something you're not /really/ going to have in the same sense with a digital game. I can't even begin to account how much of my time was wandering around aimlessly before I just opened a guide.\n\nHere's an example, to progress in the game, at one point you need to talk to an NPC who's outside, an NPC who's inside, leave the city, then talk to the outside NPC inside as well. No hint that you need to leave. A normal person would even think "Well, I've already checked on her, so there's nothing of use." Nope, you need to check on her twice, in two different area, to progress. No hint whatsoever. And lets not forget these things could be patched. Things like additional dialogue boxes to tell the player where to go, or what options break what difficulties don't take long to implement. There's more that could be complained about, but you should really get the gist.","April 20","false","12.7"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","7"

The third boss (I believe) will completely destroy you. Your attacks don't land correctly, and it turns out that you need a certain weapon. Unfortunately, getting that weapon is a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nYou know, there's nothing wrong with back-tracking in a game, but it's a serious problem here when people throw out hints about stuff that you need without providing you with any context for it.

I never played the originals but I remember reading about them in gaming magazines and had some brief experience with one of them on the Super Nintendo so long ago.  Ever since then I've always beeen curious to see what the Ys games are about.\n\nThe game is fast paced with a very simple interface.  The entire combat system is bump based.  Just run into badies and they die.  The challenge is that you cannot hit them directly on center or you will take damage.  It takes quite a bit of getting used to and you can quickly impale yourself on your enemies sword on Nightmare difficulty.  The music is just as energetic as the gameplay and keeps you moving along.  The xp system like all xp systems allows you to grind but you'll find no need to do so.  The character seems to level fast enough without the need to spend extra time smashing bad guys for no reason.  Which you'll probably do anyway because why not tackle everything in sight?!\n\nThe story is fairly short and seems oddly familiar like most games of its era.  For some this may be disapointing.  I honestly enjoyed playing through the game with it's clear story that stays on track.  So many JRPGs of late take steps way out into the realm of crazy and confusing.  This game keeps it simple.  By the end I was satisfied but don't expect to spend countless hours in this game because it has no side quests or objectives at all.\n\nFinal Verdict: Neutral\nBuy this game if you're a fan of Ys and like short games.

There's virtually no skill involved as all you do is literally bump into an enemy. If you bump them head on, you'll both be damaged. If you can manage to bump them off-center or from the back or side, you'll be fine and they'll be damaged. The problem is the enemies change directions almost constantly so it's nearly impossible to attack skillfully.\n\nAnother huge issue is that for a lot of people the "Use Item" key simply doesn't work. The only way to use an item is the "Use Item" key and there are several points, apparently, wher you must use an item manually in order to progress the story. I've seen various people saying that disabling Steam Cloud worked. Some people say simply canging the keybinding worked. The only thing that worked for me was changing the binding to the number "1".\n\nAlso, the game difficulty is very inconsistent. The very first boss fight, when I reached it, was impossible to defeat. It would have taken several dozens hits, but there are flamethrowers in the room making it exceptionally difficult to move around much. From that point however, leveling my character 1 level higher and upgrading my weapon one level brought the number hits required on the boss down to 3. So ten minutes of playtime brought that fight from impossible to win down to impossible to lose. That boss wasn't the only enemy like this, either.

Let me just give you a quick overview:\n\n+you fight your enemies by bumping into them at specific angles. Your weapons will auto-attack them, and if you attack at the right angles, they won't be able to counterattack. Takes time to master, but it's very rewarding. I think this is actually a viable replacement for traditional turn based combat, odd as that may seem. You just surge through the game's dungeons at a brisk pace. Difficulty can be adjusted, allowing you to breeze through if it's too hard, but giving you an alternative if it's too easy.\n+I'm very surprised how much I liked the story. It wasn't in-your-face like most story-heavy RPGs, and it knew when it to ease you into something big. I give it a nice plus because of it.\n+soundtrack is beautiful, and you get a nice choice between the chronicles version, complete version, and nostalgic version. I recommend all three\n+graphically the game is beautiful. It has a top notch sprite team, and it was very revolutionary back when it first came out. Even today it still holds up.\n-the only downside I would consider is that the game doesn't hold your hand, which is normally a good thing, but this game gets downright cryptic. You need to remember every single thing about your world, and remember all of your items and their various uses. You will be tested on how good your puzzle and memory skills are. Myst and Riven have nothing on this.\n\nThe bottom line? Get. This. Game. It put a tear in my eye, a smile on my mouth, and a very small dent in my wallet.

Let me just give you a quick overview:\n\n+you fight your enemies by bumping into them at specific angles. Your weapons will auto-attack them, and if you attack at the right angles, they won't be able to counterattack. Takes time to master, but it's very rewarding. I think this is actually a viable replacement for traditional turn based combat, odd as that may seem. You just surge through the game's dungeons at a brisk pace. Difficulty can be adjusted, allowing you to breeze through if it's too hard, but giving you an alternative if it's too easy.\n+I'm very surprised how much I liked the story. It wasn't in-your-face like most story-heavy RPGs, and it knew when it to ease you into something big. I give it a nice plus because of it.\n+soundtrack is beautiful, and you get a nice choice between the chronicles version, complete version, and nostalgic version. I recommend all three\n+graphically the game is beautiful. It has a top notch sprite team, and it was very revolutionary back when it first came out. Even today it still holds up.\n-the only downside I would consider is that the game doesn't hold your hand, which is normally a good thing, but this game gets downright cryptic. You need to remember every single thing about your world, and remember all of your items and their various uses. You will be tested on how good your puzzle and memory skills are. Myst and Riven have nothing on this.\n\nThe bottom line? Get. This. Game. It put a tear in my eye, a smile on my mouth, and a very small dent in my wallet. I truly fell in love with Ys because of this. So get a move on and give this game your time. Once you master the combat, I guarantee you won't regret it.

While it sounds like a fun/refreshing way to combat, it isn't really that much fun after you missed the enemy and gotten killed in return.

The bump system  is the games battle system (obviously) The way it works is you have a few options on attack your monsters. you can attack the side of the monster or the back of it. But never ever ! attack the front of the monster.  It actually makes for some good stadegy to involved with the game. you have to watch the monsters movement patterns to see what they do before you go in for the attack.\n\nSound\nObviously the ost will show some age but it really does sound amazing  some people like to mod the game to play the newer version of the soundtrack but play it with the older vesion of the sound track first .  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOWTW3FTKe8&list=PL4692B44D5F14124E&index=17  Heres the world map theme to get a hint of what to expect.\n\nover all i would check it out well worth the $14.  (some parts you may need to look up a map or two) I did find some areas a little confusing to navigate through as there is barely any hint to puzzles that you have to solve but other then that it is a decent game.","July 29, 2014","true","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While it sounds like a fun/refreshing way to combat, it isn't really that much fun after you missed the enemy and gotten killed in return.

However, the music, story, and characters are really nice and charming, allowing for a great experience even with this game's faults. That said, Ys II is something that justifies this bundle alone. Built upon Ys I, it fixes many of the problems, adds more dungeons and puts more life into the world. The characters are even better, with great music accompanying it.

I figured that since they had high ratings they were some sort of hipster rpg games that you've never heard about.\n\nBoy was I wrong. I played through the first one in one sitting on normal. The next day, I played it on easy to get missed achievements. Next day, started playing II. Next day (today) started the first one on Nightmare.\n\nThey're simple games. You bump, you gain exp, you do a few quests, and you die. On nightmare. You die a lot. On easy it's a breeze, don't stand in fire and all will fall before you. But they're so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ addictive! I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a game as much as these two. First time runners: unless you're looking for something to just kill some time start with *at least* normal. Skipped from normal to NM so can't tell how the game is with hard, but I doubt it's anything you can't overcome.\n\nAnd the best thing. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soundtrack. I've had my share of game OSTs but this went to the #1. Even now I'm listening to soundtrack on Youtube. It's just unbelievable. Well, some might disagree.\n\nWhy you should buy this game? Great arpg, simple but addicting combat, bosses are actually bosses (the bat doesn't exist) and the challenge is always there, but almost always it feels fair.\n\nWhy you shouldn't? If you're looking for a deep story, character customization and/or a long playthrough following a single campaign, this isn't propably your ideal game. But if you see it on sale like I did grab it and give it a shot! You just might find a new favourite franchise....","October 11, 2015","true","23.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Just as Oath in Felghana triggered a wave of nostalgia, this game manages to provide a truly classic gaming experience, with just enough modern flare to ease (pun?) over some of the rough edges sometimes associated with classic gaming.\n\nI found the antiquated 'bump' system quite addictive after a while.  The combat, at times, resembles what would occur if 'the legend of zelda' and 'geometry wars' had a baby.  It's hard to describe, but it's tremendously satisfying.\n\nWhat is truly outstanding about this game is the personality which pervades every corner.  The random townsfolk all seem to be part of a bigger picture, and have a myriad of dialogue options depending on how you interact with them.  They all seem to have a bit more individual personality than the common run of the mill NPC, and it's easy to grow attached to them.  Not only that, but under certain circumstances, even the enemies can be conversed with (in ys 2 at least).  Not just some of the monsters, but ALL of the monters have their own character and dialogue trees.  Even the steam achievements made me laugh out loud on more than one occasion.\n\nTruly this package lets you relive a bit of gaming history without it being some sort of archaeological exercise.  Great music.  Great gameplay.  They're just fun.  Good and fun.\n\nAbout 23 hours.\n\nP.S.

It's buttonless, and you attack by charging around the battlefield, with Adol (the protagonist) swinging his sword as he hits enemies. They will hit back unless you come at them from a corner or just off centre. Initially its a bit hard to get a hang of it, but once you do its a blast. There's very little grind after half way through the first game, meaning you can just rush through areas you've already gone through, trashing weak opponents quickly and cutting down backtracking time.\n\nThe bosses are the real highlight, most of them are very challenging and rewarding to fight (with one exception...) with the final boss being a strategic fight as much as an action-packed brawl.\n\nThere are also puzzles; some of them can be a bit obtuse, but I never had to use a guide until I was trying to get some of the more obscure achievements.\n\nIn terms of level design I found the mine dungeon confusing to get through but apart from that it was fairly reasonable.\n\nYS II\nThe combat gameplay is kept largely the same, with the introduction of new unique spells like the fireball, which gives a lot of variety, especially for most of the boss fights. The other spells are nice, especially this one that adds a stealth element shall we say (I'll say no more for fear of spoilers.)\n\nThere is another mine in this and it is just as confusing, as well as this temple thing near the end that sometimes feels like a maze (not as bad as either of the mines though).\n\nGraphics/Aesthetics\n\nYI+II\n\nNothing amazing, but I fins the combination of sprites for gameplay and portraits for talky-bits well-executed and with some retrocharm in there as well. The aesthetic design for the character portraits is very 90s -JRPG, so if anything animeish reduces your enjoyment of a game, you have been warned.\nIt won't blow your socks off though.\n\nSound\n\nYS I+II\n\nThis WILL blow your socks off. The music is this crazy good rock music that stands apart form the usual JRPG faire and suits the frenetic pace of the combat. The boss themes in particular are heartpounding. It sounds great and complements the gameplay perfectly so it knocks it out of the park as far as I'm concerned.\n\nStory\n\nYSI + II\n\nNothing spectacular. Held back by a silent protagonist and a rather simple world (which improves marvellously in the second game). However, it is well told and well paced, with some great supporting characters to keep it going. There are definitely some standout moments. Most importantly, it is well written (thanks be to XSEED, long may they localise) and never lets the talking get in the way of the action.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt's well worth the price; solid retro action and a decent story. The one thing I will say is that the challenge level is reasonably high, especially for a JRPG. This is particularly true of the final parts of the first game since grinding is not an option.\n\nI'll say this as well, its made me very interested in the sequels and Falcom's Legend of Heroes series.\n\nAt a guess it takes about 10-15 hours to beat both games.","May 9, 2015","true","23.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The origin of the awesome music that Ys is renowned for, and the intriguing story though simple and perhaps something you've seen alot in for instance certain anime, it is still one of the early RPGs and therefore also quite original for its time.\n\nThough some boss battles are easy and some quite difficult, the fighting mechanism is but running towards enemies in certain directions (no use of mouse or any attack key whatsoever). It's all about your dodging skills, reflexes and reaction. Also having the proper equipment for certain "dungeon adventures" and also boss battles is important to take notice of. But in the end with such an awesome music accompanying the game, it makes the gaming experience all the better. Though I finished the game on normal difficulty, for those "masochists" that dare take the challenge till the last boss fight on nightmare mode are welcomed to try this little sucker out. But be wary, though this game may seem short, it packs the deal for a good game even for an 80s game.\n\nAlso recommend not to play origin first if you want more of a "mystery" element to the story itself, and it also makes certain tasks in the game take alot more time, considering many elements, bosses, normal enemies and equipment are taken from this game in origin, but this is only if you've never played any Ys game ever.\n\nBest order to play it is Ys 1 and 2, and then do origin, and continue with the others.\n\nEither way highly recommend to those who enjoy JRPGs some difficult challanges, and like somewhat typtical animesque storylines.","January 14, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me just give you a quick overview:\n\n+you fight your enemies by bumping into them at specific angles. Your weapons will auto-attack them, and if you attack at the right angles, they won't be able to counterattack. Takes time to master, but it's very rewarding. I think this is actually a viable replacement for traditional turn based combat, odd as that may seem. You just surge through the game's dungeons at a brisk pace. Difficulty can be adjusted, allowing you to breeze through if it's too hard, but giving you an alternative if it's too easy.\n+I'm very surprised how much I liked the story. It wasn't in-your-face like most story-heavy RPGs, and it knew when it to ease you into something big. I give it a nice plus because of it.\n+soundtrack is beautiful, and you get a nice choice between the chronicles version, complete version, and nostalgic version. I recommend all three\n+graphically the game is beautiful. It has a top notch sprite team, and it was very revolutionary back when it first came out. Even today it still holds up.\n-the only downside I would consider is that the game doesn't hold your hand, which is normally a good thing, but this game gets downright cryptic. You need to remember every single thing about your world, and remember all of your items and their various uses. You will be tested on how good your puzzle and memory skills are. Myst and Riven have nothing on this.\n\nThe bottom line? Get. This. Game. It put a tear in my eye, a smile on my mouth, and a very small dent in my wallet. I truly fell in love with Ys because of this. So get a move on and give this game your time. Once you master the combat, I guarantee you won't regret it. I didn't, and this is coming from a guy who had no hope for RPGs/action games on steam.","January 9, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It suffers from the lack of tangible enemy ai that just wander around the area beyond the few that are sentient enough to know that Adol exists. Bosses are the big issue with this game since it's more RNG than skill based, if you mess up while attacking, you simply got a bad pattern if you're competent in using the awkward bumping system to attack. Despite it's shortcomings, it's oddly fun to redo fights over and over again because the save system is so flexible. You will however be unable to Save during boss fights... I can't recommend the first one because it is simply not worth playing if you're not looking to play the entire series. It's very short in length, and is very Vague at times as to what to do during your progression of the game.\n\n(Ys2) This is where it starts to actually get good beyond the soundtrack or updated graphics of this Remake. This time around you actually have a competent way with dealing with bosses and enemies using the magic system. Enemies also seem to have fair to competent ai, so you will be challenged in your ability to either use the bump system or magic to defeat them. The second game fixes most of the issues from the first, so if you plan to buy this game, make sure you're playing the first to lead into the second right away.","January 16","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Keep in mind that this is based on a game released in 1989, so some of the system's features are strictly bare-bones, but the remake has been upgraded in some aspects to make the game a much smoother experience than the '89 original. Boss encounters are a bit hit and miss, and usually rely on you being a certain level or having certain equipment to beat, but are enjoyable all in all. Not especially tough, but they can still be challenging enough for you to have to retry a few times before you understand the patterns. I played it on normal, but if you find the game too easy there is always the option to try a higher difficulty setting.\n\nThe music is great, also, as is usually the case with Falcom games. Also, there's an option available to switch to/from classic and remade tunes, which is always nice.\n\nThe minimalistic story is interesting and Adol Christin is a cool protagonist, but don't expect a convoluted epic; this is a standard tale of a dualistic nature, with good and evil, dark and light.\n\nProgression through the game is generally uncomplicated, and the areas you are supposed to visit are few and easy to find, but the game can, however, be a bit cryptic when it comes to what you're supposed to do next, so if you're a newcomer you should expect to get stuck a few times before you are able to proceed. That said, the game is pretty short, short enough to be suited for speedrunning and such, for sure.\n\nI mostly play it for nostalgic reasons nowadays, but, nostalgia aside, it is still a pretty good game and still holds up fairly well even today. Thoroughly recommended.\n\nYs I score\n7.5 / 10\n\nYs II\n\nYs II continues the adventure of Adol Christin and concludes the story of Ys I & II Chronicles.\n\nThe bump system is back, and not much has changed. Included, however, is the ability to use magic, which have a variety of uses ranging from an attack spell to spells useful to progress the game. Basically, if you liked the first game's system, there should be no reason for you to disike the one in Ys II, as they are pretty similar. Boss encounters are a bit more challenging than the ones in Ys I, but sometimes it comes down to just finding out cerrtain gimmicks in order to beat them.\n\nThe music is at least as good as in Ys I and has some of my favorite Ys tunes of all time. Definitely one of the highlights of the game, and the abiity to switch between classic and remade tunes is a plus. Top notch.\n\nThe story in general has a bit more depth than Ys I, and is less melancholic, but all in all it's still pretty simple. There are some surprises down the road to make it interesting though, so it is fairly well conceived, although I don't feel like the villains are as intimidating as the ones in Ys I. I liked the first one better, but it's all a matter of taste.\n\nProgression through the game is fairly linear, but there were a number of times where I got stuck and didn't know how to proceed. It usually boils down to not having the required items or paying close attention to your environments, though, so if you can't proceed there is probably something you've missed an area accessible to you at your current point in the adventure. The game is probably twice as long as Ys I, but can be completed fairly quickly if you know what to do and where to go.\n\nRecommended.\n\nYs II score\n8 / 10\n\nScore for both\n8 / 10","January 18","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The plots are pretty much excuses for you to explore dungeons full of enemies and take artifacts, but the gameplay itself is quite fun.\n\nWhile I enjoy the later ones more, and there are a few annoying elements that haven't aged terribly well, the games still remain fun, and these remakes tie in together with the remake of Origin (also available on Steam) very nicely.

As with most early Ys games on the PC Engine, Ys I & II has a "bump" mechanic for combat. The idea being that you chip the enemy sprite to maximize your damage. Honestly it's a love or hate kind of thing but I personally love it. Thankfully most of the Ys games are stand alone but I suggest playing I & II in order at least.","July 14, 2013","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ys I & II is actually a single game, divided in two parts (Ancient Ys Vanished Omen and Ancient Ys Vanished: The Final Chapter)\n\nSince it's a port from an old RPG, it may feel kinda short for the new players, but there is quite alot of story, and if you play the whole series, a very interesting one.\nBoss fights are always difficult at first, until you realise that you must grind some and get a level or two, and everything turn out really easy then. (yes, the levels are quite limited in number, but you'll notice that 3 points of attack can change from no damage, to some damage, to beatable, to breeze. same goes for defense)\n\nI've replayed this game many times, in different re-releases/ports, so i can guess a 5 out of 5 score is pretty much what it deserves :)","January 3","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still enjoy going back to one of the games in the series every now and then--the Turbo Duo is my favorite incarnation.\n\nThe Chronicles remake was very good and I'll likely play it again some years down the road. Definitely recommend.\n\nThe "bump system" in Chronicles is a little more difficult than in the old Master System and TG-16 versions--on those, once you got the hang of it, you could easily line up to always get your hits in without getting hit back, the Chronicles version balanced that out a bit, so that enemies react more quickly to your movements and they're better at adjusting to lne back up to hit you. Whether you consider this a plus or minus is up to you, I view it as both, was nice to have to work a little harder, but it also did make certain strategies that worked well in the older games almost completely fall apart in Chronicles (eh, really it was gaming the system anyway ;) ) .","January 3","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But if you haven't played Ys before, or haven't replayed them in a long time, Chronicles+ is definitely worth it, especially when on sale.\n\nIt retains the bump combat system, which is easy to learn.\n\nIf you're new to the series, I would almost recommend playing Ys II first if you don't mind a little interruption in the story, or even buy Ys Origin, a modern prequel to the series that is very very fun to play. Ys I can be a little frustrating on first playthrough, or even second. The story is great, but might not be enough to keep you playing if you dislike bump combat or wandering around for ages trying to work out why you can't open the door.

Keep in mind that this is based on a game released in 1989, so some of the system's features are strictly bare-bones, but the remake has been upgraded in some aspects to make the game a much smoother experience than the '89 original. Boss encounters are a bit hit and miss, and usually rely on you being a certain level or having certain equipment to beat, but are enjoyable all in all. Not especially tough, but they can still be challenging enough for you to have to retry a few times before you understand the patterns. I played it on normal, but if you find the game too easy there is always the option to try a higher difficulty setting.\n\nThe music is great, also, as is usually the case with Falcom games. Also, there's an option available to switch to/from classic and remade tunes, which is always nice.\n\nThe minimalistic story is interesting and Adol Christin is a cool protagonist, but don't expect a convoluted epic; this is a standard tale of a dualistic nature, with good and evil, dark and light.\n\nProgression through the game is generally uncomplicated, and the areas you are supposed to visit are few and easy to find, but the game can, however, be a bit cryptic when it comes to what you're supposed to do next, so if you're a newcomer you should expect to get stuck a few times before you are able to proceed. That said, the game is pretty short, short enough to be suited for speedrunning and such, for sure.\n\nI mostly play it for nostalgic reasons nowadays, but, nostalgia aside, it is still a pretty good game and still holds up fairly well even today. Thoroughly recommended.\n\nYs I score\n7.5 / 10\n\nYs II\n\nYs II continues the adventure of Adol Christin and concludes the story of Ys I & II Chronicles.\n\nThe bump system is back, and not much has changed. Included, however, is the ability to use magic, which have a variety of uses ranging from an attack spell to spells useful to progress the game. Basically, if you liked the first game's system, there should be no reason for you to disike the one in Ys II, as they are pretty similar. Boss encounters are a bit more challenging than the ones in Ys I, but sometimes it comes down to just finding out cerrtain gimmicks in order to beat them.\n\nThe music is at least as good as in Ys I and has some of my favorite Ys tunes of all time. Definitely one of the highlights of the game, and the abiity to switch between classic and remade tunes is a plus. Top notch.\n\nThe story in general has a bit more depth than Ys I, and is less melancholic, but all in all it's still pretty simple. There are some surprises down the road to make it interesting though, so it is fairly well conceived, although I don't feel like the villains are as intimidating as the ones in Ys I. I liked the first one better, but it's all a matter of taste.\n\nProgression through the game is fairly linear, but there were a number of times where I got stuck and didn't know how to proceed. It usually boils down to not having the required items or paying close attention to your environments, though, so if you can't proceed there is probably something you've missed an area accessible to you at your current point in the adventure. The game is probably twice as long as Ys I, but can be completed fairly quickly if you know what to do and where to go.\n\nRecommended.\n\nYs II score\n8 / 10\n\nScore for both\n8 / 10","January 18","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and videos all transcribed from their original version perfectly, and the quests are in full-fledged happiness. The only problem I ran into was attempting to find out where all the keys went.\nThe first time I played Y's: The Vanished Omen, I was 10. I had hand-drawn maps for all the various caves and towers to help find my way around, and small hints to remember to grab the wings or mirror this boss... It was a time before people sent cat pictures to each other and spent days arguing over who obtained the greatest HP in SWAG.\nAdol's questing also taught young me something else: that everyone in the village has a voice in the storyline, and even if people aren't the main character, sometimes the least important character offers the most information - and it's best to treat people equally.\nThankfully, the conversion process from Falcom kept 95% of the voices and music (oh man, the MUSIC...) in tact, and simply walking around the fields and various cities brought me back to a much simpler time in my own life, when rushing home off the bus and staring at a 13" color Quasar television on a rickety pile of Yellow Pages was the absolute highlight of the week.\nGames like Y's, Phantasy Star, Warhammer, and Final Fantasy may still have influential portions in titles today, but nothing like the shape in the designing of those of us who played them until mom flicked the power breaker in the kitchen.\nSave often. Silver swords, armor, and shields are useless against a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off mother at 2am.","February 7","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It suffers from the lack of tangible enemy ai that just wander around the area beyond the few that are sentient enough to know that Adol exists. Bosses are the big issue with this game since it's more RNG than skill based, if you mess up while attacking, you simply got a bad pattern if you're competent in using the awkward bumping system to attack. Despite it's shortcomings, it's oddly fun to redo fights over and over again because the save system is so flexible. You will however be unable to Save during boss fights... I can't recommend the first one because it is simply not worth playing if you're not looking to play the entire series. It's very short in length, and is very Vague at times as to what to do during your progression of the game.\n\n(Ys2) This is where it starts to actually get good beyond the soundtrack or updated graphics of this Remake. This time around you actually have a competent way with dealing with bosses and enemies using the magic system. Enemies also seem to have fair to competent ai, so you will be challenged in your ability to either use the bump system or magic to defeat them. The second game fixes most of the issues from the first, so if you plan to buy this game, make sure you're playing the first to lead into the second right away.","January 16","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ys I & II is actually a single game, divided in two parts (Ancient Ys Vanished Omen and Ancient Ys Vanished: The Final Chapter)\n\nSince it's a port from an old RPG, it may feel kinda short for the new players, but there is quite alot of story, and if you play the whole series, a very interesting one.\nBoss fights are always difficult at first, until you realise that you must grind some and get a level or two, and everything turn out really easy then. (yes, the levels are quite limited in number, but you'll notice that 3 points of attack can change from no damage, to some damage, to beatable, to breeze. same goes for defense)\n\nI've replayed this game many times, in different re-releases/ports, so i can guess a 5 out of 5 score is pretty much what it deserves :)","January 3","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Definitely recommend.\n\nThe "bump system" in Chronicles is a little more difficult than in the old Master System and TG-16 versions--on those, once you got the hang of it, you could easily line up to always get your hits in without getting hit back, the Chronicles version balanced that out a bit, so that enemies react more quickly to your movements and they're better at adjusting to lne back up to hit you. Whether you consider this a plus or minus is up to you, I view it as both, was nice to have to work a little harder, but it also did make certain strategies that worked well in the older games almost completely fall apart in Chronicles (eh, really it was gaming the system anyway ;) ) .","January 3","true","26.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
