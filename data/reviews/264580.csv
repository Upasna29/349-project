While on the short side (what HOG isn't), the few hours that you spend clicking around the screen is worth the story. And the fact that you do more than just find junk hidden throughout screens that'll make a hoarder blush makes it worth playing. I'd actually consider this title more of a hybrid of HOG and PnC adventure game because it has you solve puzzles in addition to randomly clicking on a cluttered screen. Any fan of hidden object games should feel right at home playing this one.","April 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","2"

If you can pick it up for around $0.50, then I'd say it might be worth it.  But still, it's just an easy little filler point-and-click and hidden object game.  Even though it says six hours on record, it probably took me less than an hour total to complete.  I am a homeschooler, so I often leave games up while I'm actually taking care of or teaching the kids, cooking, watching T.V., or playing Minecraft.","September 8, 2014","false","6.5"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","19","23","0","0"

This one isn’t far off the same old thing.\n\nThe story is interesting, although at one point I completely forgot what I was even supposed to be doing at the place I was at. HOG games have always had trouble giving rummaging around a pile of junk some sort of meaning or storyline, so in my opinion when the story lacks a little I don’t mind too much. That said they still have to be interesting enough so that I don’t get painfully bored. *cough* Amazing Adventures Around the World *cough*. This one was definitely no chore to finish.\n\nOne thing I did notice with this HOG was that you did a lot more putting-items-back-where-they-are-supposed-to-be then actually finding hidden objects. There was still some of the classic object finding, but it was broken down with this somewhat new approach. I kind of enjoyed there being something new to the mix.\n\nThe graphics on this game is something I noticed instantly. In terms of graphics HOGs usually lack pretty hard, they are always low resolutions and pretty crappy animations or graphics. This one however I was quite impressed with. It looks a lot nicer than your average HOG.\n\nMoving onto voice acting, it seemed that sometimes there was needless silences in the game. The characters speak most of the time, yet at random times I found myself reading what seemed like it was supposed to be spoken. Especially at the beginning, it went through a period of no voice acting at all. I just assumed the whole game was going to be like that until it randomly started reading out the same kind of thing I had to read myself.\nAnyway, I’m babbling. Of what voice acting there was, it was fairly decent. But it did seem a little on and off.\n\nIn terms of puzzles, there was nothing too challenging. Most the game was still a lot of fun. The Hidden object scenes were reasonable and well done.\n\nAll in all I liked this one, and think it definitely deserves a positive review. As far as HOGs go, this one I would recommend. If you are a fan of the genre, this will be a nice one for the collection.\n\n\nTL;DR : A nice HOG with good graphics and a decent story, with decent puzzles and hidden object scenes.\n","August 30, 2015","true","3.5"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

Most hidden object games can be quite dull, but this one feels like a hybrid between a hidden object game and a traditional point and clicker. Many of the puzzles in the game are well thought out and well executed. However, the voice acting (not that there was much) definitely could use some work. Also, the game was quite short, but  I think in games like this, shorter is sometimes better. Overall, Lost Civiilization is another winner for Phoenix Online. 7/10.","May 11, 2014","true","3.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

The protangonist is occasionally a ♥♥♥♥♥, the geography and depiction of real places is hazy at best and you are of course beset by a strange desire to rifle through dumpsters hunting random objects for no apparent reason - this is of course par for the course in any hidden object game though!\n\nThe good: The puzzles are quite fun, the addition of a sort of reverse hidden object game where you have a bunch of random objects and have to place them within the scene is quite nice and the vague attempt at a narrative is not nearly as bad as some I've encountered.\n\nThe bad: Hidden object games that have a tendancy to pop up behind you meaning you are forced to constantly backtrack over areas you thought were complete in order to find an object which the game has only just deemed you worthy of being allowed to find. Complete inability to hold onto my cursor despite running full screen meant it kept creeping into my other monitors and I'd find myself simultaneously clicking in and out of game at the same time.\n\nOverall: Probably not worth the price tag shown but as an amusing couple of hours distraction if you can pick it up cheap, it's not too bad.","June 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

It feels flimsy and empty, and the plot is rushed and vacant.  The art is nice enough, but it again feels empty.  The title was developed for multiple platforms including phones, and that may be why it feels so bland and unpopulated on PC.  Too many scenes have only one thing to do; characters appear simply to deliver a line or a plot point.  Might be good for kids.  This isn't a terrible game, but it didn't have enough going on to keep my interest.","August 17, 2014","false","5.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Not only is it the most "on-rails" adventure game I've ever played, every single puzzle is along the lines of "It's a cup, I think it needs some water." and "It's water, I think I can use it in a cup." You literally never have to think, and only one path is ever open even on "expert." The plot is a nearly invisible thread barely linking a bunch of disjointed, nonsensical puzzles together, and the hidden object scenes are weird and random. The bizarre minigame where you have to place objects with their pairs is neither executed well nor fun. Even the voice acting is random; only about 1/4 of the dialogue is acted. Overall this snoozer should have been a fan-made demo game, not an embarassing commercial release.\n\nProps for making the Guatemalan "wise man" look like a Navaho, though. Apparently there's no Internet wherever this game was made.\n\nIt's not often I say this, but it's actually much too long.

There are plenty of them which are much better than this. If the game wants to have a plot, then it needs to make sense. Otherwise, spare us the horrible cutscenes and nonsensical gameplay.\n\nI got this game because I live in Prague and I was excited to play a game that takes place here. The visuals are pretty accurate, for the most part, but the content is absurd. It's like someone made the images based on postcards and photos of Prague, without ever having actually gone there. I knew something was wrong when one of the most popular attractions in the city, Charles Bridge, was completely abandoned in the middle of the night, with a lone artist standing there telling you Prague is a dangerous city. Not even remotely close.\n\nBut most people will be more interested in gameplay than accuracy. Unfortunately, it leaves a lot to be desired. So far what I've played through has been frustrating. Lots of cutscenes. The hidden object puzzles are mostly standard, very easy, not very many objects to find, but now and then they throw in something absurdly difficult (like a hookah broken into two pieces, one of which is partially obscured - most people would never have recognized a dismantled hookah, and even I, someone who uses them occasionally, needed a hint to find the second piece).\n\nThe plot is pretty cringe-worthy. You, the English woman with an American accent, are looking for your boyfriend, the guy with the Polish name who lives in Prague. He doesn't answer his door, so your immediate action is to break into the neighboring apartment, smash all the windows, and then use a rope to swing into his window (by rappelling down to the floor below you, even though his apartment is next door). On the way you commandeer an artist's stall on an abandoned bridge in the mdidle of the night, apparently selling your paintings to thin air and receiving in return coins from every country *except* the Czech Republic, which are then used to open a machine and get... a letter opener? To pry a note out of a crack in a statue (another irritating bit of inaccurate nonsense - the statues on that bridge are very famous and very well cared-for). The note is from your boyfriend who tells you to meet him at his apartment, but to get inside you have to retrieve a key from a sewer grate with a fishing pole, because apparently he doesn't have a doorbell and AARGGHH I want to pull my hair out just thinking about the convoluted loops you have to go through. What on earth were they thinking when they made this game?\n\nAnd now and then on the way you suddenly need to do a hidden-object puzzle which has nothing to do with the terrible plot. Quick, you have to break into your boyfriend's apartment! But first, you need to reassemble a hookah, turn on a projector and locate the flag in the film, grab a blue butterfly off the wall, and... wait, what were we doing again? Anyway, off to break some windows...\n\nDon't buy it. If you want lovely pictures of Prague, there are loads of them elsewhere. If you want a game that won't make you facepalm yourself into a concussion, most any other hidden object game will do the job nicely.","June 4, 2014","false","0.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","1"

Not that the game isn’t trying, the hidden object parts even feature some variety– including reverse HO (putting items into the scene) – but none of them pose any real challenge even for a second.\n\nAs for the plot itself, it’s part Indiana Jones, part Broken Sword 2, part every other archaeologist adventure you have ever seen; but it’s a good and enjoyable mix.

The graphics look great and every scene is colorful and bright and cheerful. The voice acting is fine. You only hear the female lead in the game. The puzzles were mostly hidden object and match the object to something else. Like a dice would go with another dice inside the scene. The story if a bit lite and kind of dull was not terrible. I felt like at the end they kind of ran out of money and just went with a shorter version of what they really wanted to make. The hint system does work very well.\n\nThe things I didnt like. No voice overs for anyone else you meet just text. Again I think they were running out of money and just went with only the female lead voice. The story was very light. You have to do some backtracking and it feels odd in places. The overall length of the game is very short I finished it in 3hours total on easy.

So embrace yourselves, there will be many facepalm moments on your journey!\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's pretty average. Graphics are fine, everything is user friendly and there's a little twist in the original HOG puzzle too: sometimes you need to find the correct spot for the items in your list.

There is a lot of variety in the puzzles and I did not notice any bugs or major problems while playing.  Some of the hidden object scenes are a little jarring and make no sense to the game's story, but personally I feel that is a minor inconvenience.  A more wordy review follows below, but here is the tl;dr version of my opinion:\n\nGameplay: 8/10. Good variety in puzzles and very little sense of repetition aside from a few hidden object scenes that show up more than once.\n\nStory: 1/10. I give it one point for being interesting and coherent enough to follow. Unfortunately, it is completely stolen from an older game called NiBiRu: Age of Secrets.  Once I realized that (it took about half an hour at most), I lost a lot of the anticipation and enjoyment I might otherwise have gotten from the story because I always knew what was coming next.\n\nGraphics: 6/10. Perfectly acceptable but nothing spectacular, about what I would expect from a casual game like this. I  deducted an extra point because some (many) of the scenes are clearly stolen from NiBiRu and I cannot treat them as original ideas when they are not.\n\nSound: 6/10. The voice acting is not bad, with only one or two lines delivered poorly, but only 20-25% of the lines are voiced and there seems to be no consistency as to which lines are spoken and which are only shown on the screen.  Apart from that, the sound effects are decent, and the music is generally atmospheric without being overly repetitive or getting in the way.\n\nTotal: 21/40.\n\n\nFull review:\n\nLost Civilization is a pretty decent example of the casual hidden object genre. What I really like about it is that the standard hidden object scenes are broken up by a pretty wide variety of other types of puzzles. It is much closer to an old-school point and click adventure game than it is pure hidden object game.  That said, Lost Civilization still falls firmly into the casual game category.  At roughly three to four hours to play start to finish (and that is taking time to enjoy the journey, explore all the locations more than strictly necessary and read the in-game diary that updates with your progress), it is not nearly as long as it could have been.  Additionally, the puzzles were by and large pretty easy. If you are a veteran of standard adventure games like King's Quest, Day of the Tentacle, Monkey Island and/or The Longest Journey, you will not find much to challenge you here.  However, as I said before, the different puzzles are a very nice departure from pure hidden object gameplay with a story attached.\n\nWhich brings us to the story. The story is the biggest problem I have with this game.  Lost Civilization is essentially a remake of the game NiBiRu: Age of Secrets, published in 2005 by The Adventure Company. The plot points, some of the puzzles, and even a fair bit of the setting and art are shamelessly, blatantly stolen from NiBiRu.  This game should not have been marketed as an original game, and I am very disappointed in the developers for not coming up with their own story.  If it were marketed as a remake or an homage I would have less of a problem with this, but this is presented as an original game and it is absolutely not.\n\nAll in all, I suppose I would still recommend this game for hidden object fanatics looking for a bit of variety or people looking for an easy introduction to point-and-click style puzzles that won't make you think too hard.  At $5 it was an acceptable value for the money, but I cannot give this game a thumbs up because it is such a blatant copy of another game.","November 28, 2014","false","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And yet, here it is. Getting this as ballast in a bundle, I'd never bothered with checking out what this was about before playing it, but still, I had my hopes up after noticing the Phoenix logo...\n\nIt wasn't much of a surprise when it turned out it's a hidden object game. While hidden objact games are hardly anyone's favorite genre, usually limited and derivative, they can serve their purpose. This one proved to be a slightly above average and mildly more interesting example. Not much of a body in my opinion - it really shouldn't take you more than 3h to finish it, even on the "hardest difficulty setting". Graphically it's OK to good for the genre in general - some fine locations, musically too (not enthralled by the music, but it didn't grind on my nerves so a +). It should be commended (probably) for mixing things up a little within the genre, featuring 3-4 variations on the object finding theme (like adding stuff to the scene). The script is wafer thin, made even worse by the fact that this is a bit of a limited rehash of a P&C from 2006 - story-wise and especially graphics-wise (neither the first nor the last budget HO game which used graphics and the premise from a full blown adventure game). But, story-wise it's actually a mess. The characters are so one dimensional it's impossible to connect with them in any way, almost insultingly flat - and it boils down to shoddy writing. That's unfortunately almost a norm for the genre, but in this case, the game actually tries to toy with emotions, but fails miserably at conveying them, and you feel no reason for going on except for, the "going on" itself. And "going on" is crazily easy. You are never challenged and anything resembling a puzzle, from the first to the last one, is all too easy, just an illusion of challenge is formed by the limited interaction with the scenery and some pixel hunting...\n\nIn the end... well. Most of what I've liked or kinda liked seems to have originated in the original. Most that I didn't like is the game's own. It's an above average game for the style, but I do feel compelled to not recommend it anyway. Only for fans of the genre, and maybe, just maybe, fans of Nibiru.","April 28, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The hidden-object scenes are few and simple. The "puzzles" can barely be called that. I know these casual adventure games aren't supposed to require much thought, but this game doesn't even require a little bit of thought.\n\nThe story is very hackneyed and nonsensical, and the genre -- white people as the messiahs for native Mexican problems -- really needs to be put to rest. Also, I ended up really hating the protagonist: she lies at every opportunity to get what she wants.\n\nPlay this only if you've finished every other hidden-object game on Steam and really, really need one more. :)","April 2, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
