No problem, ingame Store allows you to buy it for Ingame Credits at any time.\n\nI do not recommend it to people who enjoyed the Deus Ex and Deus Ex:HR, Eidos Montreal should have taken their time to create a worthy Sequel/Prequel instead of throwing out a Mobile Game that cant keep up with its predecessors.","March 18, 2014","false","0.8"," 1,778 of 1,950 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","778","1","0","41"

I eat up news and announcements about the games like a rabid fanboy, and I was onboard with Human Revolution as soon as they announced it.\n\nWhat a shame, then, that The Fall (a port of a mobile game) is so terrible in just about every conceivable way. Broken game mechanics, stiff AI and level interaction and an equally lethargic and boring storyline combine to make this one of the worst games released in 2014, system be damned.\n\nTo talk about this game, we first need to discuss the expanded universe. When Human Revolution came out, there was a tie-in novel called Icarus Effect that was released too. That novel was a prequel/interquel that had the dual duty of setting up events from the original game and telling its own story within the framework of Human Revolution. A British SAS soldier-turned-mercenary named Ben Saxon allied with a Secret Service agent named Anna Kelso to attempt to stop the Tyrants (the antagonists of HR) and working to expose the Illuminati for their crimes.\n\nThe Fall is a pseudo-sequel to that book, and either retcons or reframes certain events so that they fit in line with this game's storyline. It does such a poor job with it that I wondered why they even bothered. The rationale for why Jaron Namir (the leader of the Tyrants) brought Saxon onboard in the book - that he was largely doing it as a way to acknowledge the guilt for all the crimes he's committed over the years - is largely ignored here. Anna Kelso, a level-headed and strong character in the books, becomes a woman who practically stays in the fetal position throughout the whole game. The death of Saxon's friend in the book becomes a retcon where he miraculously survived and became a new member of the Tyrants. Memorable events (like Saxon leaping out of a cargo plane and using his Icarus Landing System to survive a fatal drop into the ocean) are so buggy and half-finished that they become laughably bad.\n\nNearly every facet of the gameplay is counter to the franchise's design philosophy. Levels are disappointingly linear, with only the barest attention paid to the world-building and characterization that's so famous in other installments. Guns feel like pea-shooters, and the oft-mentioned zoom-in-while-aiming is incredibly frustrating. There's no sense of martialing the story with the gameplay - you can buy extra ammo and guns whenever you feel like it, trivializing the role inventory plays in these games.\n\nThe worst part is that this game sets up a sequel hook that will probably never be addressed, concerning characters we have no reason to care or be interested about.\n\nI remember when this game was first announced, and the scorn it reaped on the internet. Incredibly, the final product was even worse than I thought. I still feel like I was ripped off, even after buying the game at 75% off.\n\nDon't waste your time with this. Go back to the original game or Human Revolution for a far better experience.","August 6, 2015","false","1.2"," 259 of 281 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","259","281","11","0"

DON'T BUY IT\n\nEdit: For the people who are interested what kind of bugs or silly ideas are in the game, here are a few examples:\n\n-You can not JUMP. Remember the original Deus Ex or Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which offered you a lot of pathways and a real open-world feeling? Well guess what, they decided to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and changed it to a silly "Jump over object" animation, and even that is limited to some objects.\n\n-You have access to a credit-shop at ANYTIME in the game, not matter what happens. Need some ammo? Sure, you can buy it straight away. Remember the times in Deus Ex when you needed to find medkits to heal your 25/250 HP Torso? Don't worry! Now you simply can buy "Painkillers" at anytime, which obviously makes the entire game way too easy.\n\n-AI in the game is incredibly inpredictable. Sometimes when you are 1 meter in front of their face they don't see you, yet when you're behind a solid object they manage to see you. And no, they don't have "radars".\n\nThere are alot more of bugs or silly mistakes, but i'm too lazy to name them all.\n\nTL;DR: It's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port-over from the original IOS version.

If you own both games, buy Dishonored, which is basically Deus Ex, but with swords and magic.","October 8, 2014","false","4.5"," 135 of 145 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","135","145","6","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/258180/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Deus Ex: The Fall; let me first point out that I went into The Fall expecting it to be the absolutely worst game I have played, this was due to the media completely disregarding it straight away. I also want to point out that this is the first Deus Ex game I have played.\n\nSo lets get into it;\n\nThe gameplay in The Fall is your pretty standard first person shooter/stealthy type game. Sadly though they are not done brilliantly. The gun play is bad to say the least, you can shoot a guy in the head at point blank range with a shot gun five or six times and he still won't die, you can also be crouching right in front of an enemy and he won't notice you, like literally, you can be under his nose and he won't bat an eye lid.\n\nThe graphics are OK, that's all. It is in no way a pretty looking game, it looks as if it is straight off the PlayStation 1 (no disrespect to the games on that platform, it just looks very dated). It tries to make it self look better than it is by using plenty of lens flare though.\n\nThe voice acting is really bad, the main character, Ben Saxton, is British, and boy do they put that point across, it is the most generic British accent you will ever hear and at points made me cringe; games that have been out for ten years or so have better voice acting in than The Fall...\n\nLevel design is a very narrow sighted open world type setting, you can roam around the city, exploring, having meaningless conversations with civilians, and finding items. You will also run into a couple of side quests, five or six to be exact. Granted that's nothing really to brag about when you compare it to other games which have side quests, but this is certainly not a completely linear game and leaves room for the player to choose what to do and when.\n\nWith the gameplay elements not being exactly up to scratch, this can fluctuate the difficulty levels at time. I didn't feel as if it was a good enough stealth system for me to use the stealth approach, so I just went with the all guns-blazing tactic. I hardly ran into any difficult parts throughout my play-through. The most difficult aspect I encountered was the hacking system on doors and computers. You can either find out the password/pass-code by exploring the world for clues, or hack the system. The hacking system at times was infuriating and I had to resort to looking up codes on the wiki, or looking up the location of the clue.\n\nI finished Deus Ex: The Fall in just about four and a half hours, this was including doing the majority of the side quests and doing a fair amount of exploring for extra items and codes. If you want a Pound (£) to hour ratio, it's not bad on that front, the game does end on a cliff-hanger and I would of liked to have seen just a little bit more of what happens, looking at the chronology of Dues Ex, this is one of the first games in the story, and Human Revolution will reveal all I suppose.\n\nThere is a mire of technical issues with this game too; firstly the controls, you are not able to rebind any of the keys - this to me is an absolute must in ANY PC game. If I have a whole keyboard in front of me, let me use it damn it! Also, when navigating through the menus, your mouse clicks are sometimes not registered until you click four or five times, this made purchasing extra painkillers (the game's version of a health pack) and ammo become something of a chore. This problem also makes it into the actual game play too, as you can be standing behind an enemy, hit your stealthy take down key, but have to press it a number of times before the game recognizes it.  These little things made me annoyed, and they could of been fixed very easily if it was QA'ed properly.\n\nThe final verdict, do I recommend Deus Ex: The Fall? This is when I wish Steam would have a "maybe" option available; because I had to admit, I did have some fun while playing, I finished the game after all so it wasn't so bad I couldn't bring my self from seeing the ending. But it is a bad game, it doesn't do much right, the poor voice acting, the buggy interface and broken game play elements would of grown tiresome if the game's length was any longer than it already is. So as I have to give a straight yes or no answer, I will sadly have to go with a "Do Not Recommend" for Dues Ex: The Fall. Fans of the Deus Ex series will probably want to play it purely for the lore and story aspect, but nothing more.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Buckle up.\n\nNow, first things first. This game is $9.99. Do not pay $9.99. If it's 75% or more off, I totally recommend purchasing, and I'm going to really struggle to articulate exactly how I feel about this game, but here we go.\n\nThis is a port of a mobile game. It was not developed for PC in mind. That is a shame, and I really do wish they would've considered that route instead, but this is the route Eidos took, so we just have to keep that in mind. It's graphics are shoddy, physics are missing, models look bland, levels are downscaled, and certain gameplay mechanics are missing entirely.\n\nHowever... I had fun. I honestly did. The basic gameplay of stealthily manuevering throughout the shadows and picking off troops one by one is still there, and is still as fun as it was in Human Revolution. The level design is still well done, even if it is small, and features multiple paths to reach your objectives, just as Human Revolution did. The voice acting is very well done, with the exception of the tutorial lady, who should really be put on suicide watch. The story is incredibly well done, with the fantastic writing of Human Revolution manifesting itself in The Fall through dialogue, pocket secretaries, and emails. There are some sidequests that present some variety in options. There are interesting characters.\n\nOf course, things have also been simplified, and probably not to its advantage. Multiple saves don't exist, which wasn't really a problem for me, but I can see that unnerving certain people. The inventory system allows infinite of anything, and items are actually purchased through a tab rather than an individual. It's convenient, but rather odd and unusual.\n\nSo to conclude, yes, I do actually recommend Deus Ex: The Fall. There is love in this game that is evident, and I hate to see their effort wasted under a plethora of hatred and backlash. If you loved Deus Ex and Deius Ex: Human Revolution just as much as I did, you'll enjoy this adventure as well. Hell, I did everything you could possibly do in the game and managed to clock in at 8 hours, which isn't too shabby.","February 20, 2015","true","8.2"," 292 of 364 people (80%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","80","292","364","40","8"

No longer content to stand by and watch the Final Fantasy franchise drag it's crippled carcass to store shelves where it can be purchased by fans who are blind to how far downhill it has descended, Square Enix has set it's sights on humiliating the Deus Ex franchise. Taking it's subtitle quite literally, The Fall was originally brought to mobile devices where it was greeted with mixed reactions. Now, as if condemning the franchise to commit harikiri, the decision was made to release a quick and dirty port of The Fall on Steam, plunging a wakizashi deep into the semi-conductor filled belly of the franchise and slowly dragging the blade across it's abdomen without the dignity of providing a second.\n\nDeus Ex is an unusually complex title to adapt to primitive phones and tablets without completely changing the gameplay, making it hard to fault Eidos Montreal and N-Fusion interactive for a lack of ambition. Dialogue trees, a wide array of augmentations, a large arsenal of weapons, branching paths and side quests are all present. The problem is that most of these have been compromised in some way and many would find these compromises forgivable on a mobile device but with the PC port of The Fall, the sliced corners are exacerbated. While Human Revolution offered a number of cleverly concealed paths to traverse it's often sizable levels, The Fall has to operate on a more modest scale and as a result level design is rather bland with the exception of a late game hotel mission that challenges players to make it to a penthouse suite. Many of the more covert paths lie almost in plain sight since the ability to jump has been removed. Often times, bypassing the entryway to the next area will give players a vent or tunnel to crawl through allowing them to breeze past enemies, not that  taking them on is overly difficult. While the future setting of Deus Ex portrays humans augmenting themselves with robotic attachments, like some sort of Kurzweilian wet dream, it seems that your adversaries couldn't be bothered to enhance their mental condition beyond mouth breather status. Giving your adversaries the slip is as easy as finding a crawlspace to sit in and upon returning to an area after things have settled, it isn't out of the ordinary to see your former pursuers walking into walls. If being stupid wasn't enough, your foes are also severely myopic meaning that using a take down on enemy while one of his allies faces the action from 30 feet away is not likely to raise an alarm.\n\nFurther crippling the experience, The Fall allows players to make purchases anywhere, anytime so in the middle of a mission it's easy to pause and purchase additional ammunition and health items. A large arsenal of weapons is also available for purchase consisting of crossbows, shotguns, pistols, assault rifles, plasma rifles, RPGs and grenades. Silencers, armor piercing rounds and other attachments can also be purchased as well as upgrades for damage and ammo capacity. Praxis points can also be purchased in order to upgrade your augmentations. The list of augs is equally impressive and most of the abilities from Human Revolution are present here. While this is all impressive, it's entirely unnecessary since the game never conjures a scenario that would require juggling such a vast arsenal.\n\nThe Fall's narrative benefits from Deus Ex's rich cyberpunk world as you take control of Ben Saxon, a former member of a black ops group known as The Tyrants who is taking refuge in a safe house in Costa Rica with Anna Kelso. Since both have augmentations, they require Neuropozyne, a drug design to combat their body's inclination to reject their artificial upgrades and it just so happens there is a shortage of the drug. Saxon's quest to find a supply of Neuropozyne, leads him to discover the existence of a competing drug and a malicious corporate conspiracy to quickly and cheaply test it. Just as the intrigue builds and it seems like the plot might redeem a few of the game's shortcomings, a “to be continued screen” materializes. The Fall was planned to release in episodes though Square Enix has failed to provide any information on a followup.\n\nEmbracing Human Revolution's golden glow and featuring the same visual motifs, The Fall looks like a proper Deus Ex game at a quick glance but this port has not received any upgrades from the cell phone version aside from anti aliasing and higher resolution textures. The end result is appalling. It would appears that the citizens of Panama have been exposed to Agent Orange since NPCs appear deformed as a result of an extremely low poly count and textures that consist of a simple diffuse map with very little if any detail. Oddly enough, Saxon's model looks passable with a higher poly count and more thoughtful texturing, it's just a shame that the game is played in first person so players will rarely see it. Environments themselves also suffer from objects with simple color diffuse maps and a tremendous amount of repetition. Much of this is to be expected given the game's mobile device origins but a small amount of work would have gone a long way toward making this port acceptable. In addition to the lazy visual upgrade, The Fall doesn't feature remappable keys, the mouse control feels slippery and imprecise and recoil when firing a weapon is represented by an absurd zooming effect. The Fall has quick buck written all over it.\n\nIt's difficult to fathom why Square Enix though the complexities of Deus Ex would translate well to mobile devices and its even more baffling why they thought it would be a good idea to port a compromised product back over to the platform that made this franchise what it is in the first place. What is tolerable on a phone or tablet becomes unbearable and embarrassing on a PC, and by not making a few tweaks to the visuals and forgoing features like remappable keys,  Eidos Montreal and N-Fusion have earned the ire of fans. The Fall's few strong points are crushed a brutal counterpoints. It's impressive arsenal and upgrades are rendered useless by horrendous AI and it's intriguing narrative ends with a cliff hanger with no follow-up in sight.  These wounds are just too large for a few augments to mend.","April 16, 2014","false","7.8"," 95 of 107 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","95","107","0","7"

But if you must, I rated Deus Ex: HR a 8.75/10 and Missing Link a 6/10.\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall is a prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution and it takes place in 2027 following Deus Ex: Icarus Effect's ending. The protagonist is Anna Kelso and Ben Saxon and the antagonist is Jaron Namir. Namir is the leader of the Tyrants while Saxon used to work for them, but was betrayed by them. This game is a iOS port. Due to this, critics have hammered the game with very negative reviews.\n\nCampaign: The campaign is solid. As normal with Deus Ex, this game's storyline was solid and fits into the world of Deus Ex. The story starts off bland at the beginning but becomes increasingly enjoyable as the game progresses, however the game is subject to an anti-climactic ending, ruining the atmosphere. There is a DLC tab in the game, so it seems as if there was meant to be more missions, but stopped after the poor reviews. Regarding Saxon, as the player, you can invest into him as the story progresses due to uncovering mysteries. In saying that, the story and investment of Saxon doesn't hit high gear, rather it progresses slowly passing average territory. The game is relatively short clocking in at 4.5 hours playtime. There was only three main missions in the game and five side quests, so wasn't in-depth by any means.\n\nGameplay and Graphics: The technical aspect of this game was awful. I will state a few notable issues. The game looks zoomed in due to the port despite being 1920x1080 resolution. The graphics are pretty bad compared to Human Revolution, especially for a 2013 game. There are noticeable frequent FPS drops, but are relatively minor drops. Actions and movement tend to be delayed, for example, moving against the wall. The gameplay also feels limited with no sprint button, no jump button, and only one kill/knockout animation. There are speech issues with dialogue between characters. Basically, there are few good things about the gameplay and graphics, but are plagued by numerous issues, glitches, and bugs.\n\nPositives: Of course, the negatives outweigh the positives. However, the campaign and storyline was solid. I overly liked the revamped inventory system. Comparing to HR, now you can buy weapons, upgrade those weapons, buy grenades, etc. essentially you can use your credits more frequently. Despite liking it, buying weapons is unnecessary due to making the game easier. Another positive is the usefulness of hacking. In Human revolution, if you hacked a computer, there would be relevant information for the player that the game would not find useful. Whereas in The Fall, if you hacked a computer, it would contain very useful information to help in the game.\n\nOverall: The game had its moments in the campaign and through the few positives I just mentioned, but frankly, the game is a bad iOS port. I bought it for $2.49 on sale and I wouldn't recommend it, especially at full price. 3/10.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Ideally they'd have remade/reworked the entire game system to that of Human Revolution, but they didn't. That's reality, and to be fair they've marketed it as nothing less. So yes, most of the game systems are heavily simplified, and the interactive depth fails to touch Human Revolution. This is very much a port based on the idea that maybe you didn't play the original release for whatever reason (disliking iOS controls, not owning a decent mobile, etc), and so here's your chance. "Did you play The Fall? No? Well, here's a PC verison". Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nWhile actual design quality and expectation is subjective, what IS inexcusable is technical issues that are fundamentally game breaker. At time of writing, The Fall has issues where sound (music) overrides all other audio effects. This includes footsteps, dialogue, gunshots, and so on. When this issue occurs dialogue will bug out, conversations missing audio and ending in half a second, leading to lost chunks of story and inability to hear your surroundings (NPC chatter, enemy footsteps). Reducing music volume to zero is not a solution, you pretty much have to luck it out. Additionally, the game has weird lag-like stutter on aiming and movement with certain augs. It's seriously like playing a multiplayer game with high ping: jerky movement.\n\nAnd so, as it stands, Deus Ex: The Fall is a broken port. Maybe it's a game you want to play even though it's a mobile port. Maybe you expected a total revision and won't touch it because it's not. But end of the day, if the game does not work, if it's fundamentally broken, that is the biggest problem. And so The Fall is not worth a cent from anybody regardless of standing until these issues are fixed.","March 18, 2014","false","3.7"," 79 of 92 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","79","92","0","0"

It doesn't even deserve to be a PC or home-console game.\n\nTo quote Adam Jensen, "I never asked for this".\n\nOn the surface, the game looks promising. You play as Ben Saxon, a mercenary once affiliated with the Tyrants (the guys who attack Sarif Industries in Human Revolution), who defected from the Tyrants and is now pursuing his own investigation into the global conspiracy. Ben Saxon is basically a reskinned Adam Jensen - the HUD and augmentations from Human Revolution are all intact.\n\nSounds like it could be fun, right? Well, maybe, if the game were developed as proper Human Revolution DLC using that game's engine. Except it's not. It's a port of a mobile game. You think console ports are bad? I'd take a console port over a mobile port any day of the week.\n\nThe technical flaws due to "mobile-itis" are apparent from the very beginning. The controls are god awful, and at the time of release, could not be remapped. Movement feels stiff and it's easy to tell that the mouse is just simulating a finger drawing across a touch screen. Worse still, some compromises that were made for touch screens also crept into the PC port. For example, on the mobile version, to fire your weapon you need to hold down a button, which brings up the weapon sight. You aim the weapon and release the button to fire. On the PC, you hold down the left mouse, aim, and release the left mouse to fire. Yeah, what the F-word?! I don't know if this was patched as of 2015, but it sure wasn't working too well last year when I played this game.\n\nThe graphics may have won praise when viewed on a small phone or tablet screen. On a PC monitor, they're inexcusably bad. The models are low res, animations are choppy, and corpses just disappear into thin air due to game engine constraints. Even the Xbox 360 can do better than this, and that's a 10 year old console.\n\nNow all this could be forgiven if the gameplay were even half as amazing as Deus EX HR or the Missing Link DLC. Well, obviously it's not! Enemy AI is beyond ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Human Revolution's AI was often the butt of jokes, but those guys are Einsteins compared to the stooges you face in The Fall. I couldn't believe it when I was able to walk up to enemies HEAD ON and do stealth takedowns without raising alarms. They must be blind, deaf, and dead. It's almost like the devs turned on cheat codes for everyone.\n\nPart of the fun of Human Revolution was carefully rationing resources when upgrading augmentations and weapons. It was also necessary to visit specific locations to get upgrades, and this encouraged exploration (which opened side quests). In The Fall, you can simply buy augs and weapon upgrades and even ammo on-the-fly, and somehow it magically appears in your inventory. Finding money is also stupidly easy. That kills incentive for exploration, and it's far too easy to become The Terminator in a short time, which removes any challenge in the game (not helped by the dumb-as-dirt AI).\n\nTo add insult to injury, the game's SHORT. I finished it in five hours. It ends with a message telling me to wait for the next episode, just like a typical mobile game. So far, there has been no mention of that second episode.\n\nThis game should be ignored by everyone. Don't even pirate it. Send a message to Square Enix that we will not tolerate this sort of blasphemy.\n\nAt least Mankind Divided looks like it'll be a proper game...","October 5, 2015","false","5.3"," 51 of 53 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","51","53","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lethalfeline/recommended/258180/","lethalfeline","LethalFeline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lethalfeline/","384 products in account","This game is solid proof that mobile platforms are time machines. This game's quality is at least from 10 years before its release.  It's just not up to snuff compared to what I'd expect from Square Enix and its subsidiaries, especially after playing Deus Ex: Human Revolution.\n\nI hesistate to say this because I'll have to accept its existence, but I'm pretty sure Invisible War's character models look better at times than those in this game released for PC in 2014!  The best examples are the NPCs that pepper Panama. They have a polycount for a PSX game.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it is a toned-down version of that in Human Revolution.  For example of how the gameplay has been reduced, there is no jumping. You can fall off of things, climb latters, and vault over those designated as acceptable, but no free jumping.  The player also cannot pick up and move items, like boxes. That's not entirely true. There is an aug to move heavy objects, but it has been reduced to shoving scripted XNG crates from preset position A to preset position B. Aside from those examples, it's pretty much HR. One more thing and spoiler warning! There are no boss fights in this game. The closest thing you get is a single box guard and it's only a fight it if you are a terrible at stealth.\n\nThe level design is still complex at the very least. Lots of possibilities for the player to explore, mostly through man-sized vents. The designers did make more breakable walls, which I appreciate as well.\n\nThe voice acting is probably the most impressive feature of this game.  I really hope that the assets are reused because they are a waste on this game in its current form.\n\nThe writing is a mixed bag. I find the method Namir was planning to employ Ben Saxon to be ludicrious and the twist to be pants-on-head. Doesn't make a lick of sense. That said, I think Ben Saxon and Anna Kelso to have potential as good characters with some depth.\n\nIt should be apparent that I cannot recommend this game. It is not good enough for the consumer and not good enough for the franchise. The best thing the developer and publisher could do is drop this whole idea of putting this kind of game on a phone or tablet. Since The Fall is part of an episodic series, they would be wise to remake this installment with the existing Human Revolution tools and assets as well as the next installment. Then, stitch them together like DX: HR Director's Cut. As a consumer, I would advise you to wait for that to happen or, if you cannot hold back your curiosity, wait until this version of the game is very cheap. I bought it for 2USD and I did get my money's worth.","February 9, 2015","false","11.2"," 93 of 118 people (79%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","79","93","118","11","2"

(Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2)\n-Human Revolution=Referencing to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, the game you should currently be playing.\n\nPros:\n-Great game (will run flawlessly) for computers from the years 2000-Present Day. (And for only $10.00)\n-For hardcore Deus Ex fans. (Even though it WILL be disappointing)\n-It's on Mobile (iOS) Devices. (Which is better due to being only $5.00-$7.00 and having Micro-Transactions, which are useless, please read my Con of Micro-Transations)\n-Has Quick-Saves. (Binded to the F1-F12 Keys)\n-A little warm-up/minor backstory to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. (Which you should play first or you will hate the Deus Ex franchise)\n-The price is between $1.00-$3.00 on websites which you can save money on games.\n-Amazing backgrounds for the Day-One (Launch Title) PS2 graphics.\n-You can buy anything you want in the field (Unlike in Human Revolution or the original Deus Ex). (Can be considered a bad thing, but if you are new to the Franchise it can be helpful and is needed because there is no open-world)\n-A good cover system. (It is good because it is directly copied from Human Revolution)\n-Bundles in the "field" shop to save you some of your in-game cash.\n-Achievements (they don't even need to exist in this game, you aren't going to brag to your friends that you got an Achievement from this game unless playing this game was a dare, and is how it should be).\n-Augmentations come back from Human Revolution, only that is way more stripped down and not as cool.\n-The health and energy system is good. (Like the cover system, it was directly ported from Human Revolution)\nCons:\n-Level Size is Day-One (Launch Title) PS2 Size.\n-Graphics are Day-One (Launch Title) PS2 or Mid-Life graphics (2003).\n-The (small amount of) guns are the same from Deus Ex: Human Revolution.\n-Bad NPCs. (take forever to get from location to location)\n-Linear (Compared to Human Revolution or the original Deus Ex) with only a few extra rooms (Thankfully it has a few extra rooms or it would have been even worse). It does include an Open-World, but again, that is linear, but not as linear.\n-Micro-Transactions. They probably shouldn't exist in a Mobile game, especially one for Deus Ex, unless you are brand new to iOS games or FPS games.\n-You CANNOT jump what so ever. (Why?)\n-Annoying tutorial voice.\n-Ground textures are reused (and even for walls in the very beginning if you turn around). (Why? Again?)\n-Weird recoil from guns in first-person (Your FOV zooms out and then back in, thankfully not in any other Deus Ex game) (It has the biggest effect on the 10mm Pistol). (Thankfully the same doesn't happen when you are in cover/third-person)\n-Guns look 2D-ish. (They look SOOOO much better in Human Revolution, but the reason they are 2D-ish is because this is a Day-One (Launch Title) PS2 game and save your computer from 2001-Present Day some frames, which leads us to our next con)\n-Horrible Optimised for PC (There is no Graphics options besides a Resolution option and a slider to change the graphics quality, which there is little difference). (Probably one of the worst parts of this game, like the Graphics, Level Design, and the required in-game shop )\n-Horrible introduction to the Deus Ex series. (Start with Deus Ex: Human Revolution or the original Deus Ex or you will not like this series)\n-Not that important persuasion/chat option to change the story like in Deus Ex: Human Revolution, or even the original Deus Ex.\n-The enemy AI is mediocre, it uses cover and rushes your position, but not as good, once again, as the original Deus Ex or Human Revolution. Since it was a Mobile port, it makes it just a little more understandable, just a little.\n-Weird audio bugs were your gun will go silent and then randomly the sound will come back again when you shoot later. (The sound doesn't repeat if that's what you are thinking)\n-2.2 GBs wasted. It should be like 1.2.\n-The story/game is 2/3-8 hours. The other Deus Ex games (The original and Human Revolution) are at least 12 hours. (Usually 12-20 for main story, and about 20-40/50 for every mission, side missions and all) (Link: http://www.howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=12017)\n-Not too many (original) guns:\n3 Pistols: Pistol (2 other variants), 10mm Cartel, and 10mm Service Pistol.\nThe Original: Stun Gun.\n3 Rifles: Combat Rifle (2 other variants), Flechette Rifle, and S.C.R.

I'm serious.\nLink to Source: http://deusex.wikia.com/wiki/Deus_Ex:_The_Fall_weapons\n-Bodies disappear shortly after the NPC dies, not even when you leave the area and come back, which would have been understandable.\n\nOverall Rating (Non-Bias):\n2/10-2.5/10\nFor hardcore Deus Ex Fans:\n3/10-4/10 (4.5/10 if Deus Ex: Human Revolution is literally your favorite game of all time)\n\nPost-Beaten:\n\nWOW! Ok, people must really like this review. My god, but now I have beaten The Fall, I'll give you the post-beaten game. This is coming from someone who has finished NG+ on Deus Ex: Human Revolution.\n\nIT'S GREAT!... for an iOS game. My main problem is just that. It's an iOS game with barely any changes to the PC port, besides a Resolution, Fullscreen, V-Sync, and up to x8 AA.\nThere are only a few side quests and you can probably 100% this game in around 7 hours (According to howlongtobeat.com). Without 100%, this game may take you 3-4 hours, that is if you did a few side quests like me and explored for a bit. For those who "bumrush" the main story, this might take 2-3 hours.\n\nI got no more than 8300 credits on my first (and maybe only) playthrough. This game does feature NG+ if you need even more of a Deus Ex: Human Revolution fix like I did. Luckily, I think they did tone down the weird recoil thing, but until you get the less-recoil augment, you will have a little of it.\n\nThe map is small, so you will visit a few places. The only playable place in this game is Panama, the starting and only map. The main places that stood out to me was: The subway, the Nightclub, the LIMB clinic, the Drug Den, and the Police Station. Save this game to your SSD if you have one, there are plenty of loading screens between areas, which are smaller than Human Revolution's.\n\nThe graphics are the equivilent to a PS2's, and I won't change my previous judgement. If you lowered AA from x8 to x2, you should probably run this on a PS2 with 60fps. You can run this maxed out from a machine 2006 and newer and play it without AA (or x2 AA) on a machine from 2004 or newer.\n\nDoes it live up to Human Revolution? Of course not, but it offers a nice prequel story with a stupidly bad "To be continued," which I presume after a year after launch will not happen, even if they did release an update with rebindable keys and surround sound support.\n\nPick this game up on websites where you can save money on games.\n\nMy new/updated rating:\n4/10-Meh\nI'm pushing 4 here. PLEASE don't start here, start at Human Revolution or maybe the original Deus Ex.\nDeus Ex Fans:\n5.5/10-Slightly, Slightly Above Average\nFor those who needed their Deus Ex fix like me until Mankind Divided comes out, I would give it a shot and maybe beat it.

Now I just really wish I'd read one or two before this lacklustre and seriously flawed game.  The producers should be ashamed.  I imagine that the developers who ported it to the PC must spend a lot of time pretending they had nothing to do with it.  I doubt they could bear the embarrassment - better and more honest to admit to poor personal hygiene I would imagine.\n\nAs a seasoned gamer since 1981 and having recently finished the latest instalments of Bioshock, Thief, Tomb Raider, Dishonoured, Metro Redux (2033 and Last Light - both excellent games) and Deus Ex: Human Revolution (The Director's Cut), unwittingly I fell into the trap of thinking that this recently released game would bear some of the hallmarks of the above titles.  Unfortunately I couldn't have been more wrong - a view borne out by reading user reviews (sadly after buying the game) - all of which seemed to emphasise that a port from a  tablet or phone hasn't really worked in this case.  The keys can now be customised to (say) make "SPACE" = USE ITEM.  All fine except on-screen in the game, it says something like "Press 'F' to USE ITEM" - i.e. the customisations don't carry through into the on-screen dialogue or tutorial which does make it a bit confusing and liable to get you killed or stuck in one place as you frantically search your keyboard for the move forward command.  Graphically it's okay but reminiscent of a game 10+ years ago.  Most of the time, the movement is clunky and the keys fail to respond.  Even on the first level, the number of bugs was enough to make me just delete the game.  I'd delete it at four times the price; it's that bad.  Imagine opening a door in the game, the door opens, you turn around to go back and it asks you to open the visibly open door - and won't let you go through until you go through the pretence of "opening" the door.  The range of keys that can be used is ridiculous - at one point I was thinking of bringing my nose into play to perform the complicated manoeuvre of jumping over a low box.  First I had to "break cover" - very hard to do when you've got to press two keys and they're not the ones being stated on the screen that you must press.  The you have to press up to the low box and then finally press "Use" (or it may have been Inventory" or "Map" - no idea in the end.  There is no "JUMP" button unlike in Human Revolution which manages to get along with considerably less keys to press and confuse.  As for using my nose as an extra digit,  I have a cold and couldn't face the mess.\n\nI'd say that words fail me but actually they don't.  It's polite words that I'm having a degree of difficulty with.  Of all the games in all the bars, this one sucks the most.\n\nFrom this "Does it have the X-factor" judge, it's a big no.  This game has "FALL"en at the first hurdle (see what I did there?), leaving human kind to fend for itself - and it'll be glad it did!","September 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","46","54","2","0"

While it might work well on a tablet, on PC this game is a letdown. Terrible voice acting, wireframe script and plywood plot aside, the gameplay is just clunky and limiting. It is true there are multiple paths (in some places) but they're too obvious, the AI is too dumb and the shooting mechanics are frustratingly wonky at times. My primary complaint: too easy. I found myself waltzing invisibly past practically blind enemies right off the bat. The in-game buy system is overpowered, as you can at any time access 'the black market' to purchase whatever you may need, from praxis kits to grenades to protien bars. The dialogue options are horribly limited and yawn-worthy. Really the only challenge for me was to stay awake. The game lasts six hours, though the vast majority of it was spent jogging from one side of a map to another with little worthwile opposition. It was kinda neat to be able to visit venues I wasn't yet required to clear out and preemptively kill all the things inside so that it was a breeze when the storyline called. This led to silly amounts of experience for stealth when in reality I had gone rambo before I was supposed to. There is a lot of 'content', you could argue. after my first playthrough I only found about half the 'collectible' turntable figures. But really, that's just a gimick. This game is a gimick. While sparse fun can be dredged up occasionally, ultimately this game is not worth your time.","October 29, 2014","false","6.1"," 36 of 39 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","36","39","0","0"

The game isn't much of a graphics powerhouse and is based on an iOS/Android version of the game, it is plagued with low resolution textures, bad object geometry and terrible character models. The options are fairly limited and you only have the ability to change resolution and anti-aliasing and none of the various options you would expect to find in Deus Ex: Human Revolution. You only have 1 save slot and if you have auto saving on it is possible to ruin your game if you run into the many glitches this game has. One such example was I missed out on a side quest but was unable to load to an earlier state.\n\nBeing based on a mobile port leads to other issues in which I will go on with. The game has a store menu which has being lifted from mobile version without the real money transactions where you can buy Praxis kits, weapons, ammo and health any time you want as long has you have the credits. I don't like this system as I feel it's lazy and all this should of being available from NPC vendors within the game or found via the world of Deus Ex: The Fall.\n\nThere is no jump button in this game which creates frustration at times when wanting to go over simple obstacles. Another legacy of The Fall's humble mobile origins is disappearing bodies are in the PC version, whether you knock out or kill an enemy their body just disappears a few seconds later right before your eyes. Ignoring everything else negative I have mentioned about this game so far my biggest pet peeve is the terrible A.I. You can literally perform take downs on enemies from 100° angles and they easily give up on you after getting bored hunting you down and go back to their regular patrol routes as if nothing happened. What weapons I did use in the game had barely any recoil, bad animations and explosions from grenades and mines where terrible.\n\nAfter getting all the negatives out of the way Deus Ex: The Fall does have redeeming qualities as hard as it is to believe. It plays similar to Deus Ex: Human Revolution with hidden areas, hacking, the ability to take stealth or guns blazing approach to situations, the ability to upgrade your augmentations/weapons, it has a HUB area and even some side quests with a multi branching dialogue system. The story is actually interesting, Ben Saxon was a better protagonist than I was expecting, the level design is ok and the voice acting outside Anna was pretty decent. The game ends of a cliff-hanger so it’s unclear if we will ever actually get a conclusion to this story via an Episode 2. To 100% the game it will take players around 6 hours.\n\nIf you are thirsty for more Deus Ex go ahead and play it. As a mobile game it might be the best on the platform but as a PC title, it is hard to indorse.\n\n2.9 out of 5.","November 7, 2014","false","6.1"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","39","44","0","0"

However, once the game was officially released, I realize that this game probably should have stayed on the mobile platform.  So far, I've only played through the tutorial part of the story, and it is absolutely riddled with bugs.\n-Spoken dialog being skipped altogether\n-Spoken dialog being silent\n-Constant bugged sounds (no gunshot sound, no walking sound, no explosion, no takedown noises, etc)\n-Laggy video screen (my character kept jumping all around)\n-The tutorial popups, although I'm sure is easy to turn off, were extremely annoying and prohibitive during the tutorial\n-Outdated graphics for the time\n-Awful animations\n-Uneditable Controls\n\nThis game has the potential to be a decent game on the pc, they just reaaallllly need to work on all the bugs that are prevalent.\nHowever, my least favorite thing about this game is the item system. Unlike the item system in HR, one can purchase any weapon/ammo/grenade at any time.  There is also (seemingly) no limit on how many items that one can pick up.

This game is a poor iOS port that is littered with bugs, so be warned before you go out and buy it!\n\nDE:TF is a prequel to Human Revolution and follows the augmented soldier Ben Saxon who is on the run from the Tyrants (the very same ops unit that Adam Jensen faces throughout Human Revolution). The game has a suitable plot for its length, but the game is heavily padded by 5 side-missions which actually make up the bulk of content in DE:TF. Almost the entire game takes place in Panama city and the surrounding buildings, and will have you backtrack across previously cleared areas a few times when doing missions. The game also has a "New-Game Plus" feature (NG+) where you start the story again with all your previous augmentations & weapons. This sounds like a good idea, but honestly NG+ is far far far too easy and you can breeze through the second playthrough in just over an hour (I would know, I did it).\n\nThe game itself plays fairly similarly to Human Revolution, except that everything is more sluggish and awkward. As of the time of writing. the keys cannot be rebound which made gameplay irritating in places. I personally really dislike C to toggle crouch instead of L-Ctrl and rebind this in every game I play. The cover system can also be a glitchy (I fell through the map to my doom twice while trying to get into cover), but for the most part it is at least functional. While the gunplay is downright awful, playing the game as a non-lethal melee character is surprisingly rewarding and quite loyal to the same playstyle in Human Revolution. There are a few hidden paths scattered around that allow you to approach (or avoid) your enemies from various angles.\n\nThe graphics & audio of DE:TF are almost criminally bad. Even while staying loyal to the overall aesthetic of Human Revolution with the art-style, this game still manages to look terrible. There has not really been much of an attempt to make them suitable for a PC release, with the textures and character models in particular looking incredibly bland.\nThe audio is the real crime though. The sound effects and OST ripped straight from Human Revolution are decent enough, but the sound frequently cuts out. It makes following the narrative very difficult as the voice-overs are skipped. What makes this even worse is that when the audio skips, the subtitles do too, which is absolutely INFURIATING as it prevents you from at least reading the audio you are missing. As well as ruining the story, the absent audio also destroys the atmosphere of the game and often leaves you running about in total silence.\n\nI cannot recommend this until the audio is fixed. Until then, avoid DE:TF unless you are a die-hard fan of the franchise and really want to know a little back story behind Human Revolution","March 20, 2014","false","9.5"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","1"

It's a direct mobile port and it shows. The mouse sensitivity options are unreliable; sometimes it works, but most of the time it's like the sensitivity is set on 2/10. Because it's a mobile game, there is no jump button which heavily restricts movement. The menus are boring and often silent. In fact, sounds and conversations don't even load most of the time, resulting in really silent takedowns.\n\nThe voice acting is awful. The animation is stiff and facial expressions don't exist.\n\nIn the tutorial mission, you have to buy the Cloak aug to get past a narrow corridor with a laser shield. There's no way to bypass it other than cloaking. So much for playing the game your own way.\n\nThe only remotely good thing I can think of about the game is the music, which is recycled from Human Revolution so it doesn't even count.\n\nThis should never have been made.

So let me clarify, I would only recommend this game to people who have finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution and The Missing Link DLC (or DE:HR - The Director's Cut), and really want more. Having played through DE:HR multiple times a year or so ago, it was enjoyable to get more content in that world. Granted, it's extremely neutered and simplified content, but it scratched the itch I had to go back to DE:HR.\n\nThe other reviews seem almost unanimously negative and I really don't think Deus Ex: The Fall warrants that harsh of criticism. You definitely need to know and expect that you are playing a port of a mobile game, and it's not going to live up to complexity or visual fidelity of a full PC title. But that being said, I was really surprised that this was a mobile game first and I think I would have been pretty impressed if I saw it running on a tablet. It's certainly an extremely simplified version of DE:HR, but that doesn't mean there isn't anything to enjoy.\n\nThings it does well:\n-Borrows enough assets (visual and audio) that it's immediately recognizable as the world of DE:HR.\n-Has mandatory Deus Ex freedom of approach. You can burst through the front door on a murderous rampage or sneak through side tunnels reaching your objective with only the occasional thug knocked unconscious.\n-Very stable from my experience. I expected a mobile port to be much more buggy.\n-It's a good length and the pacing is decent. At 5-7 hours to complete it doesn't overstay it's welcome and I never felt like there was filler content for the sake of stretching out the game.\n\nThings it does poorly:\n-Graphic fidelity is low, both in 3D models and animations. But hey, it was a mobile game, so you shouldn't be expecting the Crysis engine.\n-It's easy. My playthrough was based on stealth and no-kills, and was completed without much difficulty.\n-All of the systems from DE:HR are VERY simplified. Some to the point of making them less interesting (ie: being able to buy any item from the inventory menu instead of having to find an arms dealer in game).\n-The voice acting is pretty sub-par. It's fully voiced, which is nice, but the acting is all pretty bland and npc voices seem disconnected.\n-The controls can be wonky in some situations. I can't imagine playing this on a touch screen as there are some problematic controls even with a k/m.\n-The interface buttons are really unresponsive. This is actually the thing that probably bothers me the most. Clicking a large button that your cursor easily fits inside almost always takes at least 2 clicks to get it to work.\n\nAs I said earlier, I'm recommending this ONLY for people who have played all of the other Deus Ex: Human Revolution content and want more. It is absolutely skippable if you don't feel the need for another story in the same world and should definitely be avoided if you haven't played DE:HR. It certainly pales in comparison to the game it's based on, but with a cheap price, I personally enjoyed jumping back into that world for a few hours (although I'd wait for a sale if you haven't bought it yet, there's seriously no rush).","October 20, 2014","true","8.1"," 57 of 82 people (70%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","70","57","82","6","8"

Perhaps the fact that I was expecting an unplayable mess let me enjoy it more than I should have. Or maybe my tolerance for crap has increased manifold since I last had it checked. Either way, The Fall felt like a stripped down, flatter version of Human Revolution - and having said that, it didn't feel unplayable at all.\n\nWhat the rest of the review talks about:\n\n+ visually faithful to the previous games\n+ good potential for exploration\n+ a short story in the Deus Ex universe\n\n+/- easier and (more) relaxing to play as sleuth\n+/- few familiar characters\n\n- poor UI adaptation and game mechanics\n- some obvious glitches\n- no real boss fights\n\nAdmitting that I am a huge fan of Deus Ex, I enjoyed doing all the stuff I did in the main game: hacking, sleuthing, taking down anything that moves on the map in the most Ghandi-esque manner possible. The main quest is supported by five side-quests, the map is structured in three large areas with several buildings accessible in each and the environments are all very familiar if you've played Human Revolution. It is absolutely a retread of the original and took me about six hours to complete, while eliminating all AI enemies.\n\nSo I can understand why someone who doesn't have the patience to go through this level of time-wrapping and wishes for something new and original in the Deus Ex universe will be disappointed. Although conceived like the Missing Link, this port is inferior in its execution and obvious bugs arise that smack of superficiality from the developers. Most if not all the ones I encountered were just glitches though and did not pose any software farts. Storywise, only a few familiar characters appear with minimal roles and there are no real boss fights to talk about. What compounds the bad word of mouth for any new player will be the irritating tutorial which introduces you to the world and the slightly altered game mechanics and controls, which are simplified compared to the original. Oh, and the messy interface too.\n\nBut these seemed mostly trivial obstacles to me, none of which were deal-breakers. The game, while quick and dirty in a sense, allowed me to roam across the map and do things at my own pace, with few restrictions controlling story elements. I feel I paid a fair (discounted) price for a minor entry in the Deus Ex universe and was able to enjoy the hours spent playing it. So I would go out on a limb and recommend it to fans of the series who have a sense of lenience and patience about themselves.","August 31, 2015","true","6.0"," 82 of 126 people (65%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","65","82","126","8","1"

Controls are clunky and graphics are worse than the original installement. Storyline and gameplay feel a bit like playing an OK/good clone, but a clone nonetheless. Might be better on mobile device. Relation to the original story: Damn near none.\n\nLong version.\nGraphics:  Graphics are worse, animations glitchy, and a lot of the effects in the UI that made you feel augmented are now replaced by a more vanilla-style HUD. Models are low-poly and repeat the same animations over and over :(\n\nGameplay: Gameplay and UI feels very clunky as if they took the Android version, scaled the resolution, remapped the keys and called it a day. Controls are somewhat unresponsive, can't be changed, and a lot of the gameplay has been dumbed up. For instance, we can no longer jump, and there is a not-so-natural quickmenu-system that replaces the old UI. Liked being able to have more than one save? Well, you can't.\n\nVoice acting and story are sub-par and there is a fair amount of hand-waving with illuminati and the tyrants being thrown around. Doesn't capture me the same way that HR did. A shame really, since HR was (and still is) really nice.","March 18, 2014","false","4.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","3"

At least it is cheap and has a few enjoyable missions.\n\nLong version:Deus Ex is like Zelda: the first game only received one sequel, and every subsequent entry builds backwards in time: The Fall is the prequel of Human Revolution, which in turn was the prequel of Deus Ex 1.\n\nWhile technically this game is supposed to be a direct sequel to the first and only Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect, it does a mighty poor job at that, because it only references events without any real context or background. We play as two agents on the run from one of the main antagonists of Human Revolution, Belltower PMC, but their tale just hangs in the air both in the beginning and at the conclusion: the game ends in a ‘to be continued’ screen, but Square Enix long ago abandoned all plans to make any sequel after this game flopped.\n\nSince The Fall was originally an iOS title, naturally a lot of sacrifices were made in game mechanics: there is only one city now – Panama, which feels like a bad attempt to merge the Detroit and Hengsha maps of Human Revolution – with a set of small missions and no role-playing whatsoever. The infinite inventory space, omnipresent shopping menu, lack of jumping, and the automatic vanishing of downed bodies all push the player towards a more aggressive play style opposed to the focus on stealth in other Deus Ex games.\n\nStill, frankly, I wouldn’t say The Fall is a bad game, because it is enjoyable as an almost indie quality (and indie price range). It’s just if you expect it to measure up to the Deus Ex name… then it cannot deliver.","March 25","true","10.7"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/recommended/258180/","keohookalani","keohookalani","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/","2712 products in account","Deus Ex: The Fall should be taken for what it is. A mobile entry into the Deus Ex Universe. Admittedly, I'm a fan of the universe and getting another chance to play in this world, is something I am always looking forward to. So there may be some bias.\n\nOne thing that must first be noted, is that this game is a direct port from Mobile. If you look at what the game offers from a mobile perspective, it's pretty amazing. I wouldn't actually want to play it on mobile, as I can't imagine pulling off some of the stuff I do with just gestures, but hey, more power to those who want to.\n\nAs a direct port, this game did not have graphical update, the controls can be unresponsive, and the options are limited.\n\nGraphics: for a mobile game this is excellent. As a PC port though, the graphics are okay. They aren't amazing, but they aren't completely terrible. I tried to remember where it was coming from. There are some glitches from time to time when you're climbing ladders, or performing takedowns where you will see through the scenery, which can be a little confusing the first time it happens. Yes, it will likely happen.... and more than once.\n\nSound: For a game that comes from mobile, the Sounds aren't bad at all. In fact, I was typically content with the music and the voice acting. It wasn't horrible, though one of the characters is a little over the top, but aren't villains always portrayed that way?\n\nStory:  The story is rather interesting, to me at least. I liked the characters, although some of the missions seem rather structured for a Deus Ex game. Unforutnately, as the story is short, the characters don't really get all the attention they deserve. If the game had more support, we likely would have seen more with further chapters and installments in the series. Unfortunately, it's unlikely this will occur, so you get what you get and until it's decided what to do with this particular piece of IP, we likely won't see anything more for awhile.\n\nControls: This is where the game really shows it's mobile origins. The developers could have spent a little time smoothing out the controls for PC but unfortunately this didn't occur. Sometimes when trying to accomplish certain tasks the game will get confused as to what you're trying to do and won't allow it. I.e. if you're taking cover and you press in a direction at a corner, the game won't allow you to move out of cover, because it will only accept you taking cover again. Another major issue is when you are trying to vault over small obstacles, sometimes you will be able to walk over to them and do this instantly, and others the game will not allow it unless you are taking cover and then you can repeatedly hit spacebar to vault over the object. It can be very frustrating. Another major issue is when you are trying to interact with certain objects you cannot because the hitbox for lack of a better term of other NPCs are in the way. You can clearly see the object, you are clearly pointing at it, but the game has decided that the object next to it takes priority even though that is not the option available when you press the E button to interact. This can be highly frustrating from time to time, but fortuntely doesn't occur as often as it could. There is still one computer I couldn't hack, because the receptionist was in the way, and when I decided I was angry and shot her in the head, I discovered she had invisible bio-organic titanium shielding protecting her that seemed to have infinite regenerative properties and no matter how much I made it bleed, it wouldn't allow me to destroy it and then kill her :P\n\nOverall: 5/10 - If you're a Deus Ex fan, go in with low expectations and you can still enjoy it. However, if you expect excellence, you will be disappointed. Take the game for what it is worth but NEVER buy it at full price. It's not polished enough for that, and it was much cheaper originally even on Android and Apple stores. I would recommend getting it for maybe $2 if you can and then in my opinion it's worth it. Base pricing of $10 is ridiculous and should never be considered.\n\nHonestly this is one of the few games where I wish I could choose a Neutral instead of Yes or No. But because I enjoy the universe and with the above caveats, I will still give it a thumbs up... so long as you remember, it's not gonna be great, and you don't spend much on it.","May 26","true","14.6"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","8"

Sneaking, evading guards, the Human Revolution hacking mini-game - at times Deus Ex: The Fall felt like the real thing - but honestly, as a PC title it's a joke.  The gameplay is Junior's first Deus Ex adventure, and user interface, textures, tiny maps, single save game slot, disappearing bodies, non-rebindable keys all remind you: this is not a port of a mobile game, this is a mobile game.\n\nAnd the bugs...  Configure your speakers in Windows to Stereo or voices won't play, with subtitles only appearing for a fraction of a second.  And there were severe mouse issues - sometimes I would try to open a door, but had to click the "hack" button several times before the game noticed.  Also choosing the correct NPC for dialogue was a mini-game itself - how do I position myself to speak with that one? - with the bonus hazard of a container or door sometimes conspiring to steal my selection.\n\nWouldn't be fair to comment on the shooty bits, since I always sneak around pacifist style in these games.  Maybe it's great, maybe it's garbage, but for Deus Ex, who cares?  If you are looking for FPS action, headshots, running around the map like Rambo, you bought the wrong game. :)\n\nSo I've scoured the map for side quests, rummaged through every bin, spoken to every NPC I could find.  Guess it's safe to move to the next hub.  So I get to the choppa, a cutscene plays, "TO BE CONTINUED" appears and I discover I've completed the entire game.  Oh, right, $10.\n\nIf you're a huge Deus Ex fan, and/or you have a good imagination maybe it's worth that price.  Otherwise I would call this a classic "wait for a 75% discount" situation.\n\np.s. For one fanboy mini-letdown I couldn't find the original Deus Ex main title playing anywhere. :(\n\nEdit: It's not the worst game I've played, only the worst Deus Ex game I've played. :)\n\nI had fun with parts of The Fall; wouldn't have finished the game if I didn't enjoy any of it.  But I enjoyed the feeling of being in the Deus Ex world more than the actual game I was playing - if that makes any sense.\n\nIf you loved the previous Deus Ex games and want more of that world, this is as close as you're going to get.  Stealthy gameplay in a science fiction near-future, shadowy government/corporate conspiracies, sounds great!  But none of that happens in Deus Ex: The Fall - it's just your imagination filling in the gaps in the barren in-game world.\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall feels like an outline, or a rough draft, the bare skeleton of a Deus Ex game.  You can crouch, sneak, read notes, crawl through the vents, knock out the guards.  But it's all so small.  There's no depth, no moral ambiguity, no double-cross, no surprise.  No huge map where you explore, scout out the opposition, make plans, maybe fail and try again from a different direction.  You see a guard, you see a vent, you crawl behind the guard, you knock him out.  Then his body disappears.  Repeat until you run out of guards.\n\nIf you've never played the original year-2000 Deus Ex, I recommend playing that game instead.  It's ancient by video game standards, and looks it, but it puts Deus Ex: The Fall to shame.  The last time I played was with a mod called "New Vision" which greatly improves the graphics but leaves the underlying game alone.  There may be other mods available by now, I haven't kept track so you will have to research that yourself. :)","March 22, 2014","false","16.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

This game gets a lot of flak from people who (for some reason) expected it to be up to par with Human Revolution.  But you must remember Human Revolution was one of the best games ever made; of course a cheaper, more simple, smaller-scale game that was originally developed for mobile devices isn't going to be on the same level as Human Revolution!\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall was going to be a “hamburger” from the inception of development to the very end.  I understand that there is a desire for more Deus Ex games of “steak” quality, and I share that desire.  But I don’t see why anyone should hate this game for not being something it was never supposed to be in the first place.\n\nI greatly enjoyed my playthrough of this game and I think if you can understand and accept the game for what it is, and get it for a price you feel comfortable with: you will enjoy it too— especially if you are a fan of the genre or the Deus Ex atmosphere.\n\nConsidering it is a mobile port, I personally thought the game ran great on my machine.  I liked the graphics; some scenes were nice to look at. There wasn't as much impressive lighting and effects as in Human Revolution, but I found some good shots here and there.  The controls were fine, and I experienced no bugs or crashing.\n\nIt was toned down, sure, but I could still feel the Deus Ex atmosphere as I played.  I liked the story.  It was simple, easy to follow.  The game is only 5-ish hours long to beat, (maybe a little longer if you 100% it, which can be done on one playthrough).  Also the game is easy.  Whether you are sneaky or Rambo, the combat scenarios are mostly small and easy; and the RPG elements are toned down as well, (i.e.: there are not that many abilities, and you can access the shop from anywhere in the game).\n\nAll together, the pieces fit nicely into a small package of a game.  There are some trivial decisions to be made, and a few alternate paths to choose from.  There's not that much to explore, but there's enough for the length of the game.  It can give you an enjoyable afternoon's worth of gameplay and a new, short, little story set in the Deus Ex universe... if you let it.\n\nGet it for a price you feel comfortable with, and let yourself enjoy the game.  Just don't expect it to be what it isn't and what it was never going to be.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","December 14, 2014","true","5.5"," 81 of 136 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","81","136","2","0"

Bodies disappear immediately after KO/kill, meaning that killing over silent takedowns is worthless as enemies cannot be woken up. Graphics are horrible, looking very much like a PS2 game; no graphic options other than resolution and AA, and all animations that aren't directly ripped from Human Revolution look stiff and janky. Levels are tiny and linear compared to the original Deus Ex, a game released 14 years ago. No way to rebind keys, period. UI and menus are clearly designed for tablets, are incredibly clunky, and don't make proper use of the many keys a keyboard has. The game babies you to the point of telling you how to walk before allowing you to do so.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ISATRUCK/recommended/258180/","ISATRUCK","HELLO I'M A TRUCK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ISATRUCK/","149 products in account","So you're thinking about buying Deus Ex: The Fall on Steam\n\nThis means one of two things:\n\n1) You've never played a Deus Ex game and you're looking for somewhere to start\n2) You're a fan of the Deus Ex series.\n\nI suppose it's also possible that you've played a Deus Ex game before and didn't like it, but then you either like being continuously disappointed or you do things you hate on purpose so you can complain about it on the internet. In either case, you probably shouldn't spend $10 on Deus Ex: The Fall and you probably shouldn't be using the internet.\n\nNow let's say you fall into the first category I have up there. I can say with some confindence that Deus Ex: The Fall isn't for you. If you're a typical hardcore gamer then the obvious start is with the first Deus Ex. I don't even know why you're here. Seriously, everyone knows that Deus Ex is one of the best games ever. Go play it. Go. Now if you're more of a casual gamer, looking for an easier, less "old-school" story telling experience, then go play Deus Ex: Human Revolution (director's cut or not, all they really did was make the game easier). That's not to say that Deus Ex: Human Revolution is at all a casual game. It's a wonderful stealth-shooter with really great voice acting, writing, level design, you name it. It's just that HR has things like quest markers and an active level map. Go play those games and come back when you fall into category 2.\n\nFor all you remaining, let me try to break the game up by parts starting with the one you're probably most concerned with:\n\nQuality of Port If you've been living under a Samsung Galaxy for the last few months, you may have been surprised to hear about a new Deus Ex game that appeared seemingly out of nowhere. That's because it's a port. Of an Ipad game. Yes, that's right. Eidos Montreal made the next Deus Ex game for the Ipad. I was almost as disappoint when they announced it as I was when the announced the Human Revolution - Director's Cut for the WiiU. But just like that, it's on Steam now, so everything it fixed right? Not really. The port isn't perfect. Sure it came with things like variable resolution, but keys are complete un-remappable. Also something was lost moving between touch controls and the mouse as I found myself having to click things several times and dance around like an idiot, waiting for the game to let me hack a panel without talking to the NPC next to it. The worst issue of all by far though, was the lag. Not input lag, but lag like I was playing a multiplayer game. Sometimes, I'd just pop back to where I was facing a second ago. When you combine that with the PS2 level graphics, it got to be incredibly disorienting. Overall, I'd give it a 4 out of Saints Row 2.\n\nStory Deus Ex: The Fall picks up after the events of a novel by James Swallow called Deus Ex: Icarus Effect. And much like any canonology's expanded universe, it references events you may have never heard of and doesn't explain anything. Playing Human Revolution is pretty much all you'll need, but references to things like NSF and Janus may leave some more casual fans scratching their heads. I never read Icarus Effect and maybe everything is a little bit more hashed out there, but The Fall is pretty hallow. You play as Ben Saxon, former SAS member turned Belltower operative, recruited by the bad guys from Human Revolution. One day he learns the dark truth and decides he doesn't want to kill people for no reason anymore. Why? I don't know. Ben Saxon is pretty much "a soldier." He can never be out of character because he doesn't have one. You have a side kick whose name is Anna or something. She has at most 5 minutes of screen time and is basically Pritchard 2.0 only she's nice to you and doesn't actually do anything. Together you try to get your perscription filled and save the world. At least I assume you save the world. This is only part 1 of a longer story, the second part to which, I hope comes out for Android. I'll give the story makes-sense out of read-the-expanded-universe.\n\nGameplay Despite its mouse and keyboardless origins, the gameplay is all right. You vault over cover instead of jumping, but other than that, it plays almost exactly like Human Revolution. There are actually certain elements that I thought were better than HR. For one, there are more than one type of every gun that you can purchase at anytime using Ben Saxon's 3D printer augment (that's not mentioned in the game, but I can only assume that's the explanation). There are different shotguns, different assault rifles, plasma rifles, even a gold plated pistol. Each weapon has it's own stats. It would be pretty sweet if the game gave you enough money to try them all out. Additionally, the British army is way better at picking augmentations than Sarif. All the useless augments are gone and some are broken up, so you can better pick the augmentations you want. Best of all, there's an augment that allows more than one dead power cell to fully recharge. I guess Ben cares more about his candy bar intake than Adam. Other than that, it's pretty much the same as Human Revolution. Open world, do some side quests, cover and shoot, hack computers. The usual. The one bad and frankly really frustrating change (which I assume was a simplification for the sake of the Ipad) was the change in the AI. When it comes to stealth games, there are two kinds of bad AI, the kind that will never see you and the kind that will attack you from miles away anytime you leave cover. The Fall is the latter. The grace period between a bad guy seeing you and attacking you is way shorter than in HR and when one guard becomes hostile, everyone does whether he shot at you or not. The game has a quick save feature (if you're a casual), but you only get one save at all, so you really have to sneak carefully. Overall, the gameplay gets a gold-plated-pistol out of 10.\n\nGraphics and Visuals I'm not going to linger on the graphics too long. It was an Ipad game afterall, and like I said, it was PS2 comparable. All the actors were incredibly stiff and some of the NPC's looked like burn victims, but that was pretty funny so I'll let it slide. As far as the visuals go, almost everything was cut and pasted from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Same robots, same posters, same Belltower guards. Even Ben Saxon's takedown animations were the same as Adam Jensen's. This of course leads to two conclusion:\n\n1) Adam Jensen and Ben Saxon studied at the same dojo\n2) Hidden arm-swords come standard issue with all augmentations.\n\nConsidering that Ben Saxon has only one augmented arm, it really leads you to wonder how effective a lot of Jensen's takedowns would be for Ben. There are a few new kinds of areas in the game which manage to be mostly original while still fitting in so that's a plus. I guess there isn't much to say really. If you like the way Human Revolution looked, you'll like the way The Fall looks. Except for all those burn victims. Ctrl-v out of 10.\n\nLevel Design It's, well, it's pretty good. Different ways to sneak through areas (except one or two loading zones which are unique entrances to areas) and while all the textures are similar to past games, none of the actual level layouts were too similar. Pretty cool. No sewer level out of 10.\n\nVoice Acting Oh my god JC a bomb out of 10.\n\nAll in all, the differences in gameplay and level design made The Fall a neat little 3-hour Deus Ex experience. Can't say it was great, but I had fun playing it. If you like the canon enough to drop $10 on a "neat little 3-hour Deus Ex experience" do it. Else wait for a sale.","March 29, 2014","true","9.3"," 71 of 122 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","71","122","0","2"

They think of smart storytelling that makes you want to keep playing. They think of all the unique situations that a play style gives. Well, don’t expect any of that here folks.\n\nComing off the heels of Human Revolution, you would probably think it would play and look the same, if not better in every regard, but come on, we all know it’s a port of a mobile/tablet game so we can’t be expecting miracles, but the effort made by the developers to improve on the build and make it more PC friendly is comical.\n\nLet us start with the visuals. The game itself does indeed lend its art style from Human Revolution, although heavily watered down. The models of everything, from cars, NPC’s, buildings, you name it, are horribly rough edged, and don’t look much better than the original Deus Ex… which was released in the year 2000!\n\nThe textures fair no better, sporting their low resolution sickness all over the place. It extends further though, as the UI, which again, is almost identical to HR, is poorly done, and is quite obviously up-scaled from a very low resolution, which results in that pixel edge look… nasty.\n\nOther SFX such as explosions and the sort have as much visual punch as a wet teabag. In fact, the only models in the game that even have a decent model and texture to them are some of the weapons. They’re obviously ripped directly from HR and watered down to match the rest of the game.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong! Visuals don’t make a game, I mean look at how well the original Deus Ex holds up, even today, but that has other features, such as great mechanics and story.\n\nThe sound is no better, with most voice actors doing horrible jobs, on what sounds like very low grade microphones. The ambient sounds and soundtrack are similar to HR, and probably sourced from that also, so at least we’re good on that front.\n\nPutting that all aside, we come to the meat and potatoes of any game, THE GAMEPLAY! So then… the shambles of this becomes apparent from the start. Yet again it ports over Human Revolutions animations and pastes them onto the dreadful models. So you can expect most of the same features, such as cover and rolling from it, sneaking but OH NO WAIT! You can’t jump. For some reason Panama doesn’t stock jumping augs, and apparently has super gravity as you can’t even jump an inch, or even sprint for that matter! I don’t need to explain how much of a game breaking issue that is to a Deus Ex game.\n\nWe do get practically every augmentation Jenson received, besides the aforementioned jumping augments, so you’ll be very familiar on this front at least. Oh, what’s that? No merchants in the hubs? No no no! Instead, we have a store that we can access on the go, at anywhere at any time. Obviously a remnant from the mobile version where players could dump their real money into the game to get items faster, and is extremely game breaking. You can just buy more painkillers mid fight and be fine, essentially making you invincible for all intents and purposes. Oh, and did I mention you don’t have an inventory screen and seem to able to carry everything?\n\nMaybe you’re like me. A man who was simply thirsty for a bit more Deus Ex and bought the game on sale in spite of all the bad tales I heard, because hey, it must have a story right aside from all the horrible gameplay? WRONG! The story is pathetically boring and simplistic that actually ends up with a “To be continued” screen, and guess what?! That will never come as the idea was obviously abandoned after its massive flop.\n\nIn short, I don’t think it’s worth it even for the most hardcore of Deus Ex fans. Do yourself a favour and replay the original or Human Revolution until we get that sequel to HR that is on the horizon. Unless of course, you like torture, then I’m afraid you did ask for this…","December 8, 2014","false","10.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

I played it so much that I literally mastered the game, (Got every ending, got every achievement). So when I saw that Deus Ex: The Fall was on steam, of course I was excited about buying it...But given the couple hours I've sat and played it, my excitefulness has changed to a much more negative feeling..\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall follows Ben Saxon, a Former British SAS Agent turned Aug, as well as Government Agent gone rogue Anna Kelso, as they hide from the Illuminati and their elite team of mercenaries known as the Tyrants. That's pretty much all I can really say in terms of a story, otherwise I'd be spoiling the game..\n\nMany previous Human Revolution players will find the same gameplay elements in The Fall, however this time around, there's much more problems. Above all, I noticed constant glitches or stutters during gameplay, many bugs such as getting stuck on cover, being unable to click out of a menu, trying to grab an item with an NPC standing nearby and the game thinks you're trying to talk to the NPC, little to no ammo for non-lethal weaponry, and an in-game market you can use to buy new guns, ammo, or various items with the in-game "Credits", however everything is overpriced making the system completely pointless. One thing I was very annoyed about, was the inability to sell weapons picked up from enemies back to the market for credits...\n\nDespite knowing it was previously a mobile game, Deus Ex: The Fall is just ugly, running the game on the highest settings, character models look dreadful, the world looks bland, and many graphical glitches occur at various times for no explained reason. Players who do not like the layout of the control system will find no way of reconfiguring the controls, which is problematic for some.\n\nAll in All, Deus Ex: The Fall is not worth the $10.00 asking price. The game is no longer than one and a half to two hours long (pending you do the sidequests), and doesn't offer much difficulty. Even on New Game Plus, where supposedly the difficulty is "increased", I never had a problem completing the game. If you really want to play it, at least wait for it to be on Sale for $3.00 or less...or if you want to experience the story without playing the game, then you should know that the game follows the exact same story as the book "Deus Ex: The Icarus Effect" by James Swallow.

I preordered this game knowing full well it was an iPad port. I didn't have super expectations giving the price of the game. I figured it would be ok for the story and expansion of the Deus Ex universe. Little did I know the full craptitude that would be unleashed onto my eyeballs and brain.\n\nFirst of all, there absolutely NO JUMPING! What gives?! I was hoping for multiple paths to complete missions and find extra goodies. You also can't just pickup boxes to throw at people. I got the strength mod only to find out it's to slide stuff around and not be like "HULK SMASH!" vending machine throw. The controls are really awkward and seem broken at times. Like I'll be hugging the wall crouched backing up, then my character gets kinda stuck and will still be in cover mode when I'm clearly in the middle of a doorway or edge of a box. Also, in menus and various prompts where you have to choose stuff, I've had to click a bunch of times to get the option to register. In the main menu for inventory and stuff like that, sometimes clicking works, others you have to highlight what you want, then hit enter.\n\nThe environment graphics are ok, but the random npc models are awful. Alot of them look like mutated elf people. Also, the lighting doesn't look right on alot of things, like some polygons on a models face will be shadowed even when the light source is right infront of them. In the nightclub at Panama, there was this npc dancing like a derp, I actually thought it was a dude until she spoke because I thought I saw a 5 o'clock shadow. It's pretty bad when a player can't tell what they're looking at because of super low polys and the crappy lighting ingame. Facial movements are wonky as well. I've noticed that parts of the face don't move properly when the main characters are talking, like the upper lip doesn't move. Ben's and Anna's eyes are WAY too big, almost animeish. Barret's and Namir's models really look like they don't belong in this game. You can tell their models weren't made for the facial rigging in this game.\n\nThe voice acting, oh dear lord, the voice acting is TERRIBLE. If you wanna hear Skwisgaar Skwigelf pretend to be Russian, or other borderline stereotype/horrendous accents, then this shouldn't bother you. The main characters are meh at best. I don't really have a problem for the characters you see in Human Revolution though, they're ok. I've also noticed some glitching with voices in cutscenes.\n\nThe writing is lackluster. I found myself already clicking though emails not giving a flip what's going on in the world. There are plotholes as big as galaxies, and listening to the news reports and voice messages gave me a brain aneurysm. For example, in one message Anna says she would've cried if they didn't already take her eyes. That doesn't make any sense because tears don't come from your eyeballs. This is just one of many things that will make ocd people like me super mad.\n\nThe help system is absolutely annoying. It's not like H.R. where you can just ignore it like a boss. It FORCES you to look at crap and doesn't go away till you click the stuff it wants you to.\n\nI feel Ben is just a bargain-bin version of Adam Jenson and this game is not worth the money. Overall I give the game a 2/10.","March 18, 2014","false","5.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

About the only thing forgivable about this game is that it is a port of a mobile game. So, its understandable that the quality is unlikely to match the heights that the game's big brother, Deus Ex: Human Revolution did.\n\nThe voice-acting was surprisingly horrendous, you'd think like DX:HR, they'd put some effort there but they didn't. The controls were alright but not exactly smooth. The audio cuts out during cutscenes and takedowns although it doesn't happen all the time. And certain aspects of gameplay like moving heavy boxes were simplified and there's no jumping even though I have to admit that was expected because again, this is a port from a mobile game.\n\nThe story wasn't bad but it still wasn't enough to salvage the game. There's plenty of potential but it falls flat in presentation, not helped by the surprisingly poor dialogue and bad VA. The characters weren't as interesting as Adam Jensen and company in the main Human Revolution game and despite some familliar characters appearing (the Tyrants), their appearance was quite lacking. About the only thing I liked about the game was hearing Bob Page's (main villain in the original Deus Ex) evil voice once again.\n\nOverall, this game is to Human Revolution what Invisible War was to the original Deus Ex. A massive let-down. This isn't my worst purchase as I got a copy of the original Deus Ex GOTY version (the greatest game of all time) with my preorder. If you're in anyway interested to play this game, wait for a Steam sale. Its already cheap at $10, but it would probably feel more worth it if you get it for cheaper.\n","March 19, 2014","false","7.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

I'm a huge fan of all three Deus Ex games (The Conspiracy, Human Revolution, and...yes, even Invisible War).  But seriously, Deus Ex: The Fall is just WEAK.  They did a crappy job porting it to PC -- you can't even re-map the keys for crying out loud!  I mean, really?!?  They ported it to PC, a platform where most of the players will be using a mouse and keyboard...and they didn't include the ability to re-map the keys?  Lame!  Not to mention that the game play is a severely dumbed down version (yes, I know it's a mobile port...but it's THAT bad) of Human Revolution's game mechanics.  The graphics look like it's a game from 1999.  Oh, and the game is buggy...\nIf the game was $2.50 I might be less annoyed, but $10?!?  Jeez!  Ok, well, you get the idea.\nP.S. Oh, and one more thing: From the part I've played so far, the game seems to be based on the novel "Deus Ex: The Icarus Effect" by James Swallow.  So if you're like me and enjoy the storylines of the Deus Ex games as much as the gameplay, then you can spend your $10 on a really good book instead of this crappy game.","March 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

(review available, scroll down.)\n\nAlright, in the hour or so that i have played the game there are already several problems with it. Namely with the controls and the somewhat buggy nature of the porting. Several of the games options are limited, some, like the Mouse Sensitivity. Seem to work in rather "spaztic" Patterns, being mostly unresponsive at times and then suddenly going all over the place. Keybindings cannot be modified, atleast not from the options menu, i need to take a look if there is an .INI-File that can be altered to improve some of these problems. FOV changes cannot be made in the options menu, which may cause some problems for people who are suffering from the seasickness like effect playing in too low FOV might cause.\n\nWith these observations, in the first hour, i really cannot recommend this game yet. I need to play it through to make a proper review. I hope this brings to light some of the problems this game suffers from.\n\nProper Review will follow...\n\nand now the review... (which is not really a review rather an extremely lengthy bug-report.)\n\n(which i had to redo, since Steam did not understand to open the screenshots in a different window.)\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall.\n\nArgh... This game.. While not a total pile of w*nk, it does not live to its name very well. This might be because of its shortness and buggy nature, which are the most notable things in the reviews on STEAM. While i did enjoy the game for what it was, a spinoff story add-on for DE:HR which ties in some of the characters from the first Deus Ex. It still felt.. Dissappointing. I know that that isn't the best of explanations, but let me try...\n\nAs said in the Preliminary Analysis, the game is buggy as all hell. Although i suspect this being mostly due to the bad porting to PC, to make a note, i haven't played the IOS-Version, so i cannot say if the bugs were there from the beginning. This review just covers what i know and have seen during the one playthrough i did for this review. But after that derail..\n\nThe bugs in this game are mostly centered around controls and graphics, both being equally noticable and annoying. Let's start with the graphical glitches.\n\nMultiple times i have seen the screen tear parts of the backround while the camera is in a certain angle, this being mostly prevelant during takedowns. Not being able to see stuff that falls onto the ground because they clip through and come invisible, i should recommend using the "Object Highlights"-Option to make it better for you, although annoying, it shows the stuff you can interact with (mostly). Few times after loading a level, i had half of the options menu show up, i cannot properly explain it so..\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=239725541\n\nControl issues, ironically enough. Are mostly centered at the "Full Mouse & Keyboard control scheme". One of the said "Pc Steamwork optimizations", yes. i hope that you are reading this in the ironic tone it deserves, since it is just... GARGH!\n\nMouse & Keyboard, (atleast by me) is not recommended. since the game has someform of dementia, when it comes to mouse sensitivity. It being unresponsive most of the time, but sometimes when you load in another level, it goes all over the place. Most notable bug that i had playing with the mouse, was that out of nowhere it would change the position of the character. Just like that, i ended up banging my head into walls more than i did when i tried on my granmas glasses when i was a kid.\nThe camera just goes spaztic, pointing randomly in totally different directions than you were facing and unless you have proper reaction-time to notice that, it will result in cheap deaths.\n\nThe game is somewhat playable with a 360-controller, i say somewhat since in doesn't work properly wth the hacking minigame, being extremely sensitive and going all over the place with the cursor. Oh and don't even ask how bad the hacking was with the mouse, it didn't even scroll the panel with it, nor the keyboard for that matter. The only way to scroll the oanel when hacking was to use the controller to pan the view and use the mouse press the buttons.... (I don't even...)\n\n"Adjusted Artificial intelligence".. Basically meaning that they are in the middle-ground between Deus Ex and Human Revolution, being mostly oblivious unless you stand in their cone of vision for more than two seconds. And when they do see you.. they dont even come to find you in numbers, only single soldiers will randomly charge at you, with no warning. They just slide of cover whip past you and empty a shotgun into your rear.\n\nThose are mostly the things i see that are faulty and/or buggy and need fixing.\nOh, and i did take a look at the installation folder. No settings files to speak of. Might be because the game runs in Unity-Engine, but people would like to have options for tweaking some of the controls.\n\n\nAnd above all those bugs & problems, the game is very short. My current playtime is about 7-Hours, but this is with one re-start, going non-lethal and exploring everything. Other people most likely will blast through it in about.. Hour and a half or less. And the thing that bugs me, is that its an episodic game. Which is explained nowhere on the store-page. EPISODIC, are you kidding ?\n\nI know that people are fans of TellTale the master if episodic content, but not everything needs to copy them... I'm now trying to remember any other good spinoff title that, although short felt rewarding at the end. I can only think of Duty Calls, the parody/demo-piece for Bulletstorm. And that is not the best of comparisons i know, but that is the only good one i can think of the top of my head.\n\nI would have been a lot happier with a full game and i'm sure that many other people would have been too.\n\nI think i have ranted enough, this is giving me a headache.\n\nThe Fall can just keep falling, catch it on your own risk. Just make sure you have appropriate painkillers and liqour available.\n\n\nOh i just remembered, the trading cards are taken from inside the game, The office one, is one of the screenshots in the store-page. So yeah.. LAZYNESS!!!","March 18, 2014","false","8.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/professorchimp/recommended/258180/","professorchimp","Professor Chimp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/professorchimp/","132 products in account","Deus Ex: The Fall is a PC port of the iOS mobile title and serves as a prequel to Deux Ex: Human Revolution. The game is itself a sequel to the Deux Ex: Icarus Effect prequel novel. This severely limits its chances to do its own thing, even if it does an admirable job at the dystopian cyberpunk the series is known for.\n\nYou play as Ben Saxon, a member of the Tyrants gone rogue, who is trying to unravel a conspiracy while keeping himself and former Secret Service agent Anna Kelso out of his erstwhile team's hands. Their backgrounds are briefly adressed in the game, but if you want the full story, read the book. This is not required to understand the game's narrative, largely because you'll care very little about the uninteresting Saxon and his quest. The story is hurt further by the unsatisfying 'to be continued' screen at the end, with no word on whether it actually will. You do get to interact a bit with the boss characters from DX:HR. This fleshes them out a bit and is one of the game's few saving graces.\n\nOk, so storywise, the game is nothing much. What about gameplay? Well, Ben Saxon is an expy of Adam Jensen, right down to the futuristic sunglasses. He has almost all the same abilities and augs. You can do takedowns, hack computers and keypads, crawl through vents, shoot from cover, .... Pretty much everything big bro Adam Jensen can, except jump. You'll use these skills to explore an urban hub, Panama City. You'll talk to npcs, some sidequests and work your way through enemy hideouts and complexes with combat and stealth, while upgrading your weapons and augs.\n\nThe extent to which developer nFusion translated DX:HRs gameplay to a tablet is pretty impressive. Unfortunately, this is also the game's downfall. The limitations of tablets really hurt the game's scope, with frequent loading times and a cramped design. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in the tutorial mission. You're faced with a locked door. You can hack the keypad or use a vent next to the door that deposits you right behind it. I'm not saying all Deux Ex entries are perfect, but when they gave you multiple solutions, you were at least got more progress than literally one meter.\n\nBodies dissolve after a few seconds, dead or alive. So why bother with slower pacifist stealthy when when a quick headsot is much faster. It makes little difference. No, not to conserve ammo. You can simply buy it from the ingame shop. This store is not an npc vendor, but a menu you can call up any time, including mid-combat. Need an EMP grenade? Buy one. Plenty of money lying around. Problem solved. It's an optional holdover from the microtransations of the tablet version, but it sucks out the challenge, planning and resource management.\n\nThe controls also suffer from the tablet origins. They're clunky and unresponsive. Combat from cover is a chore and often ineffective, as enemy bullets like curving around cover. Oh, and sometimes you'll clip through the world and die. Same for the UI, which has been barely converted from tablet-friendly to something suitable for PC.\n\nOK, the story is a wash and the gameplay a mere shadow of its bigger brothers. Maybe the production values can salvage it? Don't count on the graphics. They would look great on a tablet, helped by same aesthetics featured inDX:HR. Upon closer inspection though, the ingame models and textures wouldn't look out of place on a Playstation 2, except with some glossy visual effects. The game does better in the sound department, but not because of voice acting or sound fx. Michael McCann, the guy behind the exceptional soundtrack of DX:HR, returns for The Fall and delivers music that is the best part of the game. Oh, and Saxon kind of looks like Jean Reno. I like Jean Reno.\n\nDeux Ex: The Fall is a deeply flawed game, hampered heavily by its tablet origins. I can't recommend it to anyone except the most diehard fans starved for more Deux Ex. With a playtime of 4-6 hours, they'll a modestly sized, but unsatisfying serving. Everyone else: maybe, MAYBE, pick it up for a buck in a sale. Otherwise, skip it, buy any of the other games or wait for Mankind Divided.\n\nI rate Deus Ex: The Fall 1 banana out of 5.","June 2","false","4.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/recommended/258180/","gdnighthawk","Nighthawk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gdnighthawk/","206 products in account","Presentation\nDeus Ex: The Fall started as a mobile game back in 2013, exclusive to iOS, implementing touch screen controls and mechanics that fit a first person shooter well enough to be entertaining on a phone or tablet, but it was never meant to be played with a mouse and keyboard. The later Android version offered the same experience, and with a great success on the mobile market, it wasn't long before a PC version was announced, a version that comes with almost no improvements, which for a PC title end up close to a catastrophe. You play as Ben Saxon, ex-military at Belltower who ended up joining a secret squad known as the Tyrants, with the mission of keeping balance between organizations and eliminating possible threats. It won't be long until Saxon will realize that most of the things that the Tyrants told him were lies and soon enough his departure from the team will put him on the most wanted list, forcing him to go into hiding. The adventure begins when Saxon and his partner Anna run out of Neuropozyne, a drug used to prevent Neuroprosthesis, a build-up of scar tissue that blocks electrical signals between augmentation electrodes and human tissue, making any augmented human being unable to live without it. The whole plot rattles around Saxon's search for Neuropozyne, following gang leaders and completing different tasks for people who might be able to supply them with Neuropozyne in exchange. Even though all those details will be unravelled in the first five to ten minutes of the game, that pretty much sums up the entire story, as it is a short one to begin with, taking no more than three hours to complete, and even worse than that when it does get to a point where it seems like its action will change and the story will move on to the next plot point, it just ends, leaving you with a true sense of disappointment as if you accomplished nothing.\nRating: 4\n\nGameplay\nAs mentioned before, this was originally a mobile game, and in that environment it would play decently; on the big screen however, things change as almost no improvements have been made to adapt this title for a keyboard and mouse control scheme. The movement is pretty much limited to what a phone or tablet can offer, and there is even the lack of a jump button, even though this version clearly needed one. Navigating through the menus is a nightmare, as it was meant to work under swipe movements, now having to use the mouse in order to drag the menu items and get where you want, and even worse than that there are no shortcuts for important things you might want to access more frequently such as your Augmentations or your Inventory; instead the game uses the Esc key to open up an enormous menu and letting you choose what you want to do from there whether it's a simple Save command or upgrading one of your weapons, which proves to be difficult to do at times. This rushed port of touch screen mechanics makes your life even harder when it comes to things such as hacking, where you might not be able to move the screen to the point where you want it to be at all, making it challenging to solve the hack or just forcing you to spend your credits on an autohack just so you can move onward with the game. The cover mechanic is just as bad, refusing to work properly at times, making it hard to switch cover and make your way past some guards undetected, but since the AI is almost absent that is the least of your worries. On top of the terrible AI that allows you to take multiple enemies in a row down with a melee attack as long as you time it right, there is a long list of bugs and glitches that came with the port, starting with unreachable items and ending with the fact that I inexplicably fell through the map more than once by nothing apart from following the instructions.\nRating: 2.5\n\nGraphics\nThis is just an upscaled version of a mobile game, which makes it a terrible looking game on the big screen, as the graphics seem outdated by an entire generation. On top of that we have the horrible animations, almost non-existent lip sync and facial animations of such detail you'd think this game was released on the N64. The visual effects are basic and even though they don't stand out as horrible since everything around them looks just as bad, they are still part of the same engine that looks outdated by a decade.\nRating: 2.5\n\nAudio\nThe voice acting is a really bad joke, as it lacks basic concepts such pitch and tonality, and sometimes it will switch volume inexplicably, probably to wake you up because everything that comes out of a character's mouth is so boring and pointless. The dialogue is just as badly written, and for some reason subtitles kept disappearing from time to time, even though the character was still talking right in front of me.\nRating: 2\n\nExtras\nOne simple playthrough can be completed in roughly three to four hours, add two more if you're staying for all the side quests and achievements, and since there is a New Game+ mode you can replay the entire game without starting all over again if you've missed some achievements on your first playthrough, but even with that in mind, there's isn't much else to do around a second time.\nRating: 4.5\n\nVerdict\nDeus Ex: The Fall was a pretty bad game to begin with, but on the small screen of a phone or a tablet it somehow seemed bearable and the actually working touch screen mechanics made it fun to play despite all its other flaws, but on PC that simply isn't the case as those flaws are still there and on top of that, the gameplay mechanics are not optimized to work on a mouse and keyboard, and sometimes not even optimized to work at all.\nRating Overall: 3.1\n\nCheck out the full review and a lot more about Deus Ex: The Fall at http://gamedragons.net/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=332","April 12, 2015","false","7.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

This is like three orders of magnitude worse.\n\nAs a sidenote... blaming testers for the presence of bugs is often unfair. Bugs being found is absolutely not equal to them being fixed. Assigning resources to fixing bugs is a financial decision, and not at all as obvious to the suits as it might be to gamers.\n\nAs for the actual design of the game, the fact that someone looked at this and thought "yes, this is okay"... I have nothing to say in defence of that. Duh. It was passable as a mobile game (as it was initially intended), but bringing it to Steam was a bad idea, and at that price...","January 21","false","6.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Most of your clicks won't really register when firing a weapon or selecting something. That might get patched later on. There are also some clipping issues, and I have even fallen through the floor once.\n\nOther than that, the game looks really ugly for a PC game. The animations are really amateur at best. Worst of all are the characrer models. While Ben and some other major NPC models look okay, the citizen models somehow look even worse than the character models in the original Deus Ex, which was released 14 years ago. Their eyes are really wide open, and most of them don't really have lip-syncing, so their jaws just kinda move up and down. On the upside, the game runs at a pretty astounding framerate.\n\nKeys cannot be rebinded. Seriously, why do developers still think it is okay to not have rebindable keys?\nYou also cannot jump. You can only vault over objects when the game lets you. I'll admit, it actually is kind of a nice feature, but it doesn't justify not being able to jump.\n\nThe tutorial treats you like a complete idiot as well. Those looking for the typical Deus Ex experience are going to find it dumbed down to the point where inventory management is no issue, since you can buy stuff at any time for in-game money.\n\nThe story is still okay. It's a pretty much what you would expect. It works pretty much like in Human Revolution, where you could take side-quests along with the main objective. One part I sort of liked was a side-quest where a cop wants you to rat out a fellow doctor who was helping you out. You can go ahead and do that, or you can warn the doctor that the cops are after him. I don't think this has any sort of consequences yet, but it was a nice moment nonetheless.\n\nAs far as gameplay, the maps are really small with lots of loading segments. There is still some good level design, like using vents to get around enemies, so if you can get past everything else being rubbish, you might still squeeze out a little enjoyment. However, people who choose to kill rather than render unconcious are going to find themselves at an extreme disadvantage. Bodies sort of "evaporate" after being on the ground for a few seconds. Since KO-ing people gives more experience, and they will go away anyway, the only reason to use lethal takedowns is to see those cool looking armblades. Human Revolution had this problem as well, but it was less so of a problem since enemies could revive unconcious enemies.\n\nThe game is still going to be updated with more story, since it currently ends on a cliffhanger. Realize that if you buy it now, you'll still have to wait for the full game.\nOnly buy this if you really, really, really want more from the Deus Ex universe.","March 19, 2014","false","4.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","2"

It should have stayed as a mobile game, if it could not have been ported over to more playable game for the PC, for which in its current state is not.  I hope Square Enix fixes the glaring problems in this game for which would make it more enjoyable for a Community that loves this franchise.\n\nI have not completed this game yet, but these are the problems that I have discovered in this game that needs fixing NOW.  (1) Save system needs attention.  Basically make it like what Human Revolution had, a system for which you can Save in Steps, over just to "Continue" on from your last game play.  (2) The Keyboard/Mouse Option Needs Re-worked.  Currently you are stuck with what the developers made "for you".  Make it where the Keyboard and Mouse controls are configurable to a players needs.  Basically if a player does not like the W, A, S, D movement keys and prefers say a T, F, G, H config make the controls able to accomplish that.  And what I personally don't like is the mouse configuration.  There is absolutely NO Thumb Button support!  Make it that the mouse' thumb buttons can be configured to a command.  (3)  Many Sound Glitches (this has been addressed many times before me) where the voices or game sounds completely disappear, but does come back a little later.\n\nThose are the Three Basic Problems for this game in its current state, I know there are much more by the other comments I have read, but the 3 above would make the game more enjoyable for me to personally play.  But I have been playing and purchasing PC games since 1988 and in my own personal opinion the price of $9.99 is not that bad for this experience.  I have paid over $50 for games that had these same basic problems, but the developer fixed them and finally made them playable for the PC Community.

This is without a doubt due to it being originally only on iOS devices, but now that it is on PC, it is now exempt from such considerations and has to be judged on its own merits. Things don't look too good.\n\nCombat is almost a direct port of what was in Human Revolution, although much stiffer. There is no jump button, and no separate zoom button, you must now hold down the fire button to zoom in, letting go to fire off a shot. Selecting which grenade you want can be a bit of a hassle, where you are required to press in the mouse wheel and scroll down to whatever you want while still holding down the wheel. Not exactly comfortable.\n\nI made my way through the game without killing anyone, just using the stun gun and non-lethal takedowns. The only time I used any other primary weapon was when I bought a crossbow to use in the last room of the game. I bought this through a disembodied store which you can access at any time through the menu. There are no in-world merchants.\n\nThere are only a handful of character models in the game that look good, including the main character. The rest look like claymations, both in texture and movement. Most of the music is reused from Human Revolution, so it's still great, but there is nothing really new here.\n\nThe only real positive aspects of the game are it's environments, which look fantastic, and the story, which adds quite a bit to the lore of Deus Ex. That's it.\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall is short, took me 5 hours to complete it, including all of the side-quests. And the game ends on a cliffhanger with the promise of continuation through DLC. Only play this if you want to learn more of the world of Deus Ex, otherwise avoid it.","March 23, 2014","false","5.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","3"

I thought: Awesome! I love Deus Ex! but after playing I felt hugely let down.\n\nWhat’s wrong?While Deus Ex: Human Revolution ran in the unreal engine, Deus Ex: The Fall runs on the Unity engine.\nYou notice this straight away with the in game cinematic, models are lower resolution and that’s just the start of the problems I've noticed. You have a tutorial in game. but when I got my first aug upgrade kit I went straight away for cloaking. the next minute I came up to a laser detection gate. and it fired off a mandatory tutorial thingy. telling me to buy the cloak. Ok... I already bought it. and I don't have any more kits for it... how do I leave this tutorial BS or turn it off? answer: You can’t. and to ALT+F4 out to start a new game.\n\nanother run through, bought plenty of ammo, then at a point prior to the laser gates I encountered my first patrol bot. up came a tutorial on how to buy an EMP grenade. 1 grenade, 250 credits. I only had 100. couldn't buy the damn emp grenade. how did I get out of these stupid tutorials? Oh right ALT+F4.\n\nMore technical problemsOk so game play is ♥♥♥♥ when you can’t turn off the Tutorials. Mind you this isn't the first Deus Ex Game I've played and not much has changed apart from being able to buy equipment in mission. But here are the bugs in the game.\n\nSound: Half of the time the game assets aren't loaded. so the sound of a hostile screaming bloody fire and murder doesn't play. only indication that you've been detected is that little "detected" notice that pops up in the lower left of the screen. something where you aren't even focused on.\n\nLikewise weapon reports don't play. bug honking SMG firing. 30 grounds in the mag. Did a Mag dump to see when the game would pick up the slack. only heard gunshots for the last 5. Now you'd think that: "Ok It finally loaded the gun sound assets, now I should hear a gunshot on the first shot of the new mag" That’s a big fat "NO" again it wouldn't play the sound on the second mag dump except for the last 5.\n\nmovement: if you are familiar with Deus Ex, any Deus Ex then you just know how much you'll be using your leg wagon to cart your rear end around in the world. Deus Ex: The Fall is no different. But moving around is often jittery like you’re playing multiplayer and there is a tiny intermittent lag spike. Not enough to cause real problems but it’s annoying enough to get on your nerves. walking forward for a bit and then you jump a tiny bit ahead while moving as your connection to the server picks back up and the server says "No you aren't at Coordinate 214X663 you are at 218X663." Yep enough to be annoying, not enough to be a serious problem. Well actually it is a problem as I can’t begin the count the amount of times I move a little bit too far and out of cover just enough for NPC's to spot me while doing stealth. or that one mine you need to disarm.\n\nlook and feel:I was impressed with Deus Ex Human Revolution, how realistic it all looked and high detail. I had hoped that Deus Ex: The Fall would be up to par but even that you can’t expect from this game. I don't know why they choose to start using Unity instead of the faithful Unreal Engine. but the results are apparent. So far it looks to me that Deus Ex: The Fall plays like a 480P game instead of the 1080P experience we got from Human Revolution.\n\nRecommendation for others interested in buying this game:I love Deus Ex, any Deus Ex. And I bought it for that reason. But if I could get my 10 euro's back from steam I would have asked for that Refund. This game plays more like a playable Early access instead of a full game with all the problems it has.\n\nFinal Recommendation: Don't Buy It!\n","March 19, 2014","false","0.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Unfortunately, this game does not live up to the legacy of its forebears.\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall retains the stylized golden appearance of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I quite liked HR's art syle, which set it apart from the common browns and blacks of both the older Deus Ex games and so many others in the first person space. So, The Fall gets points for at least staying true to the style of HR. However, since this is a port to PC from an iOS/Android game, the graphics are severely lacking, even when compared with games several years old, such as HR.\n\nThe mechanics of The Fall are significantly different from HR. Egregiously, your character cannot jump. The game has only a single "save slot" which is overwritten by every quicksave or even when changing areas. Controls are awkward at best, given that they cannot be remapped and the "quickslot" system is anything but quick. These limitations make sense for a mobile game. However, it's quite jaring when compared to other PC games, or even ports to PC from console (such has HR).\n\nFurthermore, aiming is simply awkward. For example, aiming a weapon with a scope without firing seems to be impossible. A single button controls both. Press and hold to aim, release to fire. The non-scoped weapons are only slightly easier to use. Gone are the "iron sights" aiming of HR.\n\nOther than by-design limitations of the game, it is also unfortunate that The Fall also riddled with bugs. The most glaring is that any system with more than stereo speakers is completely broken. Music consistently plays, but all other sounds drop out at random, taking captions along for the ride! There is a work-around: in Window's Sound settings, change your speakers back to simple stereo (from 5.1, 7.1, etc).\n\nMore minor bugs abound, such as achievements that are listed as completed in-game but not in Steam. One must activate an ability, consume an item, or change areas in order to trigger the acheivement. While this is a minor annoyance, it illustrates the lack of effort put into the port. Since the game knows the achievement unlocked, it's inexcusable for the Steam unlock to be lagging.\n\nNot all is bad. The "spirit" of Deus Ex is present in that most missions can be completed in multiple ways. I suspect that shooting enthusiasts will be disappointed, but non-lethal stealth is quite possible. Oddly enough, bodies auto-disapear instead of sticking around to alert your enemies. This makes "stealth" almost trivial.","March 18, 2014","false","10.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

I decided to give this a slight "thumbs up" because, let's face it, this game's page is already plastered with thumbs downs, and there are a few things to like about this game.\n\ntl;dr version\n\n+ Comprehensible plot\n+ Well-detailed environments\n+ Lots of exploration and breaking into places\n+ Sidequests and nooks & crannies to explore\n+ Consistently goes on sale for cheap\n\n- Laggy, unresponsive controls and interface\n- Idiotic AI\n- Abrupt and unsatisfying ending\n- Little to no graphical upgrades\n- Slight confusion if you haven't read the tie-in novel first\n\nTime to expand on this a bit. I'll start with the stuff I didn't like, and the biggest thing had to be the game's pacing. There's not really a climax or falling action. You get about 3-6 hours of playtime depending on how much you obsessively-compulsively comb through the game's environments, but since this game is intended to be a multi-part experience, everything wraps up just as you start to become a badass. This is a pet peeve of mine. It is incredibly irritating to see developers interpreting "episodic" as "we can just phone in Part 1, because technically we're not done making the game!"\n\nThe other thing I disliked was the controls and the interface. They make it obvious that this was a straight port from touchscreen-based interfaces. I'm sure the big boxes and long-presses work perfectly for a buttonless interface, but now that we have a mouse, let alone a keyboard, there's no reason for the controls to be as ridiculously compact as they are. This compartmentalization isn't "bad," per se, but it feels unnecessary when you have a wider range of input to work with. There's also the fact that the UI is SO sluggish. Clicking on certain buttons in the menu will sometimes work, or they'll require 3 or 4 presses. In-game actions such as taking things becomes frustrating when it's bunched up next to two other interactable objects, as the game doesn't have crosshairs and just kind of "guesses" at which object you want to use. I also found takedowns in this game to be unresponsive as well. It's hardly ever worth it to long-press for a lethal takedown, because it's a dice toss as to whether or not it'll work, and even a simple key press for the non-lethal takedown may or may not work. It's very frustrating, but it personally didn't break the game for me. YMMV, however.\n\nThe rest of the items I listed above as negatives are subjective in that they may or may not break your experience. The enemies are low-poly Helen Kellers with a field of vision the size and length of cardboard tubes, but I was able to overlook it because it meant I could get away with some ridiculously funny shenanigans. The textures are blurry and the polygon counts are low, but I felt like the game made up for it with detailed environments (clutter, large spaces, that sort of thing). I do wish they could have at least improved the visuals, though. The only thing I didn't like about the visuals were the facial animations in dialogue scenes. The mouth movements are okay, and nothing comes across as too lazy or too uncanny valley, except for the eyes. They're not animated in the slightest, so characters have a dead stare if their heads aren't pointed in the right direction. If you've ever wanted to experience what it's like to talk to someone with Autism, this game is your answer.\n\nSo, let's talk about the positives. As mentioned before, this game gets pretty cheap during sales. I can't remember the price I bought it at, but I think that anywhere between $1 to $3 is the perfect asking price. Don't buy this game at $10 or you're robbing yourself.\n\nThe thing I like the most about this game is, well, the fact that it's Deus Ex. It's not "kinda" Deus Ex. It's not "stripped down" Deus Ex. You've got your air vents, your stealth options, your delicious cover system, your alternate routes, your goodies to read, your levelling up systems, and so on. Sure, you can't jump or throw stuff, there are some visual shortcuts scattered about, and bodies disintegrate after you lay down some augmented justice, but these never really get in the way of you enjoying the game.\n\nDeus Ex is about exploring a futuristic dystopia, going to places you shouldn't be and mopping the floor with bad guys in ways that feel emergent and satisfying. The fact that this game still manages to feel like Deus Ex despite being designed for vastly-underpowered and input-limited devices is an accolade in and of itself. And look at it this way--if for some reason you game on a netbook or a budget computer, this game is gonna run just fine.\n\nSo yes, this game has problems, and if they're a dealbreaker for you, then it's totally understandable. But if you can get this game for cheap enough and know what to expect from it, you'll have a good time. Here's to hoping they make a part 2 to this after Mankind Divided comes out.","September 2, 2015","true","11.7"," 28 of 50 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","28","50","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/riodragon/recommended/258180/","riodragon","RioDragon1989","http://steamcommunity.com/id/riodragon/","480 products in account","This game. This game before you right now. It is not worth money. Any amount. It is not worth any asking price at its current state. This is a horrible slapdash PC port of an iOS/Android game that took nearly a year to gestate, but it still came out completely malformed. The graphics aren't horrible, but a stickler for PC gaming standards would swear this off the moment they see the game in action, because it looks extremely old, like by Playstation 2 and original Xbox standards, but I'd be able to live with it. However, the problem with this game is the sheer lack of effort and Quality Control that went into the port. For the best gameplay experience, you would need to be willing to switch controls between the keyboard+mouse and an Xbox 360 controller on the fly, there's just so much wrong with this game's controls that it's hard to explain in a short amount of time.\n\nThe experience of playing with a keyboard and mouse makes me feel physically ill from the amount of visual whiplash involved in the simple act of turning when you walk. It's like the mouselook is locked at 45 degree angles, regardless of mouse sensitivity options, your view speed will be extremely sluggish and stopping your view anywhere between the preset angles will cause your view to snap to the nearest one. Strangely enough the xbox 360 controller does not have this problem, so I would suggest that for walking around and looking at things and maybe shooting. I say MAYBE shooting because you use the right trigger to shoot here and it's extremely unresponsive as well, in addition to the fact that guns, when fired, appear to snap your field of view back and forth to try and loosely simulate recoil. You cannot jump, and I cannot find a button on the controller that allows you to sprint or run. In hacking, the controller is overly-sensitive and uses a method for node capture that is liable to send your view of the hacking puzzle careening in whatever vague directions you were selecting with the left analog stick. You can browse menus using the controller mostly with ease EXCEPT, in order to scroll through the list of quests, you need to use the mousewheel, so in short, the best gameplay experience as far as controls is swapping between a controller and keyboard+mouse on the fly.\n\nStealth afficianados will notice that the only bits of stealth left in this are line of sight, silent takedowns, and cloaking. Enemies will not react to hearing you, only to seeing you, and it doesn't seem to matter anymore to care about where you take out an enemy, as their bodies dissolve into gold triangles as soon as you take them down, lethal or not. The levels are very short, shorter infact than Deus Ex: Invisible War's. There's also no shops, you carry a replicator in your pause menu now that makes you whatever item you want for an in-game currency fee (this was were microtransactions were in the iOS/Android releases). You can even buy praxis kits. The story, while it might have been well-written and thought out, is delivered very poorly with deadpan and comedically bad voice acting across the board and occasionally way too long dialogue that overstays its welcome long before it's finished.\n\nOn the positive side, it does look and feel like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, if it were to be put under by a mad doctor, had random guts taken out, and then lobotomized. The saddest thing about this game is really all the wasted potential. Square-Enix could have made this natively for PCs or Consoles rather than jumping headlong to the current Japanese game industry standard of 'everything is better mobile'. This game is proof positive that that is not the case, or at least that what works for one system does not work for another. The port job in and of itself, disregarding the original iOS release, is terrible and on the verge of unplayable to anyone besides the most patient or tolerant of gamers, and the controls all on their own should relegate this title to discussions where you would mention Superman 64 and E.T. for the Atari 2600 in the same breath.\n\nAt least, all this is the case unless they somehow pull the best patch ever out and fix everything, which I hope they do, because I really want to enjoy this game, but you know they won't. This PC Port is a sad case of wasted potential, and now this is technically the earliest entry in series canon, meaning Deus Ex, as of now, begins with The Fall, and ends with Invisible War. It's like a delicious gooey center that is Human Revolution and the Original game, sandwiched in rancid feces, and we certainly didn't ask for this.\n\n***Edit: After recording more footage for the game and getting excessively frustrated with playing the game, I looked for solutions on the mouselook issue since writing this review. Lo and behold, there is an almost-fix, turn on the vsync. I didn't have vsync on at all because I was trying to record footage and I found that usually when I use vsync during recording, it usually screws with a game's performance or the recording, but apparently without vsync on, the keyboard and mouse controls do not work properly at all.\n\nUsing this trick made the game far more enjoyable, to the point that I'm actually kinda getting into the story (now that it's finally also going somewhere), but that doesn't excuse the fact that I dunno what kind of failures of programmers or QA a development team would need to have to have the stsatus of the vsync, a GRAPHICAL option, effect the CONTROLS of the whole game, thus adversely effecting the gameplay. I could do a better job than whoever Squeenix or Eidos-Montreal or N-Fusion hired for this game, and I have no programming knowledge whatsoever outside of altering .ini files.***","March 21, 2014","false","15.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Rather than having in-depth gameplay like the other ones, this game dumbs it down, leaving you unsatisfied.\n\nSince I looks like the previous game's graphics and gameplay, you might be thinking "Like human revolution with guns 10/10" but you would be dead wrong. The game clocks in at around 3-4 hours. I know it's supposed to be episodic, but for a Deus Ex game, 4 hours really isn't enough to expand on anything. It's almost like a Deus Ex demo, because all other three games were so long and had so much stuff to do.\n\nLength shouldn't bother too many people, but everything else will. The game has been made insultingly easy. You have an in-game menu that allows you to buy anything you want. Seriously. It makes the game so easy because you can stop at any time to buy yourself a new gun or some ammo. There are not multiple paths through things anymore. There's usually one or two ways to approach something, no matter what it is. The graphics smell like mobile port, but that's because it IS a mobile port. Many models look very ugly. The voice acting for the main character is not great either.\n\nAll in all, there's really not much to enjoy. For 10 dollars, you could buy yourself the original Deus Ex, or even Invisible War, the second Deus Ex game which now looks like Jesus compared to the Fall.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMarkenson/recommended/258180/","MrMarkenson","SUPER KAWAII NIXON DESU NE","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMarkenson/","530 products in account","The quality of this game is abysmal in all regards, and even die-hard Deus Ex fans will not find it worth their time and money.\n\nTo get the superficial out of the way first,bear in mind that this is a port of a mobile game for iOS and Android, done in the Unity engine. As such, obviously there will be some shortcomings graphically; models and textures tend to be half-hearted and look like they came from the PS2 era. There isn't much polish, but the Human Revolution visual style is intact and still going strong, so I can't fault the game too much here. From a technical stand point, I expected much better, but graphics aren't everything.\n\nFirst big problem? No mouse support. Ok, yes, there is mouse input, but when you play this, you will quickly realize that almost nothing has been reprogrammed here; the game simply simulates the touch screen input, which leaves you with no real solid control, awkward angles, and it doesn't even properly simulate shooting, as it treats clicking the mouse as holding down on the screen. This makes the controls untenable.\n\nThe story is similarly neutered. Don't get the idea that this is a prequel to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, because that was already covered in the Deus Ex novel "The Icarus Effect", which covers all the stuff you would reasonably want story-wise. Not only that, but what the game does adapt from the novel is neutered to a laughable extent (particularly sad, because the novel had some fairly awesome scenes to borrow from). No fighting Gunther Hermann, no giving Barrett his scars. Just walking around, a single conversation, and then leaving.\n\nAnd the gameplay... The "recoil" is insane. In that the recoil is to simply zoom the screen in and out in the most visually-distracting manner possible, to the poitn where some "bigger" weapons almost clip with the models. The stealth technically works, as the cover system and AI are still somewhat intact, but I'm going to be frank; this isn't enough to justify this game. No movable objects, not much in the way of exploration, tiny, compact levels... Also, no rebinding controls at all, everything is entirely fixed to a (difficult to read) text screen. I can barely tell what is pointing where on it.\n\nLike I said. I will grant certain things. The small levels, for example. Limitation of mobile devices, kinda hard to fix. The graphics should have been overhauled, but again, superficial. But there has been no effort here to reasonably adapt this game to anything NEAR what we would expect from PC games. In the Unity engine, too. This game came out a year after the original mobile game, there was time to fix the controls. I have been a huge Deus Ex fan, but this does not do the series justice at all.\n\nIn short? Don't call Invisible War the worst Deus Ex game ever anymore; that title has been now claimed by Deus Ex: The Fall.","March 19, 2014","false","0.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I bought the original deus ex in a bargain store in 2003 or 2004, I first thought to myself: dis sux. Later I enjoyed it before it got ported to steam or whatever because it is a thinking man's shooter. You get to use your augmentations and your writable notepad (really, you could press I think an f key and it would pop up a functional wordpad to write down all the codes and what they said to put together what the hell was going on). Then Hummus Revolution came out and I found that to be a good modern interpretation of the original, pretty damn good. I think the first time I played through was like 15 hours which was pretty short but that's better than what we get these days.\nThen The Fall...\nOh gawd, non.\nI don't know if this game's title was supposed to be foreshadowing but this is like invisible war which was mediocre at best, but now it makes you sad in the light of your computer, all alone, expecting to stay up all night long to play this mobile version.\nFirst, let's get the engine out of the way: Hummus Revolution was a reworked Crystal Dynamics Engine that was used in Tomb Raider: Underworld. This one uses unity probably because it is better built for the mobile market, and probably this was a low budget so they didn't want to waste a lot of money. But without splitting any hairs, this looks like ♥♥♥♥. I swear this looks like 2005 quality. This may seem unfair because it was a moblie game at first, but you have the name Deus Ex on the box. After coming off Human Revolution, the shock was jarring. I was playing a beautiful well lighted game to OH GAWD.\nI was expecting the porting people to try to rework the UI to be more faithful to Human Revolution because it was a Unity game which is a very flexible engine, but no. There is no multiple saves like in any other good PC game, there isn't a smooth UI. Hell, not even the mouse works properly. It won't detect blatant clicks I started to click furiously and I might have cut the like of the damn thing in half. The difficulty of inventory management (which is a good thing, mind you) was cut completely, going for a teleport my rocket launcher from nowhere into my hands, kaboom. Going around people is the suggested idea in Deus Ex, not anymore. You can get a stun gun, and then stun your enemies, pick up the credits and keep buying the ammo and you won't run out of cash money. Hell, you can't even jump in this game, really. It is a port from iOS and it shows. The stealth detection is wonky, half the the time they will ignore you, the other time they are a god damn eagle. At least the level design is okay for the most part.\nPeople are probably going to ask me why I am so focused on Human than the ones before. That's because it has the same art style, the same year as Human Revo. (instead of the 25 year difference between the first two), and the same weapon designs and praxis system.\nYou might say that I haven't played enough to make an objective opinion. Well that's because the game has only one section, Panama City, and it's shorter than the shortest part of Hummus Revolution: part 2 of Hengsha. Half of that time is me going idle or killing random people and resetting the save. I feel awful for those that bought this at full price, because that is barely any content.

On the Humble Store page, it lists this as DRM-free with a Steam code so you know a sale is gonna happen eventually. Square's been porting some of their games to the PC with only few problems so I assumed this would either be as flawed or better because the game's relatively new. Nope. It's a mess. On the bright side, the achievement system is broken and easily manipulated in such a way that it actually feels like you're humiliating the game. As for everything else... eh. It's buggy, the map designs are boring, you can't jump, the quickslot controls are terrible and the story is basically just stretching the novel, "Icarus Effect," which is better imo.\n\nHere's another bad example: They left the touch-screen microtransaction buttons in there but took out the functionality. And you know it's a sign of more dangers to come. Seriously, it was bad news when they said they were making an iOS game for this series and when you see those microtransaction "buy now" buttons, you can't help but fear for Deus Ex Universe. Playing this game is a warning that, sadly, it's going to get much worse for Deus Ex. They did it with Hitman and Thief. This is next.\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall, if it worked and looked (oh god those models) perfectly, would be a solid $6.99 purchase. $10 for an unfinished port?

The voiceovers are lackluster and most of the accents are noticeably forced and fake. The writing is mediocre at best, the script is in dire need of an editor to add some narrative and not just exposition for its own sake.\n\nThe gameplay is par for par same mechanics as Human Revolution but the in-inventory purchasing reeks of laziness, not to mention it makes no practical sense. As usual the aesthetics are gorgeous if somewhat buggy here and there. Facial expressions are mostly emotionless and cutscenes models have that subtle sickening jerk to them like their limbs are taut rubberbands.\n\nDespite all this, it wouldn't be half bad but for the non customizable keybinds. What in the hell was the rush? All this time was taken to introduce these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t unskippable tutorial popup menus in some vapid attempt to not lose someone who may not be familiar with the series' mechanics and then you don't give them free range of keybinds in an ostensible action RPG?\n\nThis game reeks of the typical Square Enix approach to every game it regurgitates.

This is a mobile game. I wish I had realised this BEFORE I bought the game. I was excited and bought it since I love Deus Ex: Human Revolution and thought this would be similar.\n\nIt's not.\n\nGraphics suck and everything is poorly textured, the game and character handles very clumsily, and the even though it looks kinda like Human Revolution, it feels and handles like some game I used to play on PS1.\n\nAlso NPC textures and animations are very bland. almost non-existent. They kinda are there but they really aren't there. Although the screenshots and cinematics look nice, the actual enemies look like hastily made wax figures.\n\nCan't really say much more because I played this game for less than an hour and it was enough for me.

That is, it succeeded in bringing a very small, cut down, simplified version of the Deus Ex experience that lasts 5-6 hours and consists of a tutorial, a lengthy chat with your friend, and ONE hub area.\n\nVisually, I think the only upgrades provided for the port are MSAA and resolution selection. With the tablet-optimized graphics, you could set the resolution to 640x480 and fool yourself into thinking you're playing a PS2 game with some bloom and some Doom-3-on-Xbox-quality per-pixel lighting on Ben Saxon's face. It apparently runs on Unity as well.\n\nStory-wise, it's ok until the end. Not nearly on the level of even Invisible War, the previous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the series, but passable... until it just abruptly ends with a cliffhanger for a sequel/episode 2 that may or may not even happen, with no main-quest plot threads tied up whatsoever. Oh, and as an added bonus, nothing you do with your augmentations or weapons in the prologue carries over to the rest of the game, so save your credits!\n\nControl-wise, it's a mess. In porting, the developers decided not to bother with customization support, so you're stuck with the defaults. Admittedly, its defaults do line up with a lot of other games' default controls. Mouse sensitivity is the biggest offender here, as vertical and horizontal are not in sync with each other (with no separate control option) and mouse smoothing is most certainly in effect.\n\nHate in-app purchases? Guess what- they're still here! Near as I can tell they're in-game money only now, which is far less awful, but it's also the only way to acquire equipment that isn't laying around. Need credits? They're everywhere, and you can even get some just by offing civilians. Just don't expect to know how much a weapon upgrade costs unless you have enough money to afford it AND start the buying process, as it won't tell you otherwise.\n\nOverall, it's... ok. Something to pick up and rush through when it's on sale, but nothing great. Hell, for better value, you could instead just pick up The Missing Link DLC for Human Revolution or play Deus Ex: Nihilum, which give you more of a proper Deus Ex feel with a much better cost-value ratio.","May 10, 2014","true","5.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","1"

That's what makes Deus Ex: The Fall such an incredibly disappointing experience. Apparently this was originally released on the iPad, which explains a lot. The graphics are middling, and the controls rarely work. There's an emphasis on clicking a lot, and often the first, second, and possibly trhird time I click on something it doesn't actually recognize my click. The narrator for the tutorial sounds both bored and frustrated; although so was I so maybe that was actually clever. The storyline is incredibly weak. The first part of the game is a very long "conversation" where the main character narrates everything that's happened so far, while a bored bystander occasionally asks "Ooh, and then what happened?" The cool thing about games is you can unravel a story through gameplay, not exposition, but they missed that point entirely for this game.\n\nI managed to play through a couple hours of it before I decided to stop wasting my time.

I pushed through Invisible War and thoroughly enjoyed Human Revolution.  I knew The Fall was an iOS port and tried to take that into consideration, but that excuse can only stretch so far.\n\nThe tragedy of this game is that it's episodic--Steam makes no mention of this--and development has seemingly ceased on the next episode.  For an episodic game that original came out in July of 2013 to have no mention of when the next episode is due is unacceptable.  The developer's website for the game leads to a 404 and DeusEx.com has removed all mention of The Fall.  How Steam can sell a cancelled game is beyond me.\n\nThere's been no up-scaling of any of the 3D assets for the PC port at all.  The character models themselves, while angular, do not look terrible.  The buildings of Panama have a brutalist architecture vibe which fits well with the game's themes and low poly requirements.  The scenery pieces (e.g. rubbish bins, vending machines, fences) needed to be freshened up for a PC release.\n\nMusic and sound design in the game is perfect and takes many cues from Human Revolution.\n\nThe GUI is atrocious in it's overly large icons designed for a touch interface.   The worst aspect of it is your inventory; gone are the days of managing what you carry.  You can have every weapon and item in the game (though only assign a set amount to quick keys) magically appear in your hands just by clicking "buy" from the store.\n\nThere's an incredibly annoying glitch were being in cover while using a takedown will randomly result in your character being unable to move.  This happened about once an hour for me.  How this got past QA in what is a stealth title baffles me.","February 9","false","11.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I bought this for $2.49 only because I wanted to know the story.  All the negative reviews people are writing about this game are true! LOL  It's buggy as sh*t!\n\nThere are some serious bugs.  For example the sound cuts out during dialog, also during fights or during stealth moves which can cause you to get detected because you don't get the warning sounds, and so on basically the sounds can't be depended on.  Oh and there were some cut scenes where the dialog wasn't in text, and there was no audio so I had no clue what was said in that part of the story! Actually the dialog disappearing happened a lot so be prepared for a few huh?? moments! Whatever anyone else mentioned in the long list of negative reviews for bugs I'm sure they are well described by others who have played this game, so I won't repeat them.\n\nThere are things also lacking you don't have full controls like you do in Human Revolution, this is a very scalled back version of controls obviously for a mobile device.  No lifting crates, and little details like that, etc.  Also you CAN'T remap keys.  HOWEVER GlovePIE works very well with this game and allows you to use whatever keyboard configuration you are most comfortable with.  I am a keyboard and mouse user, so I won't speak for the gamepad controls... I attempted to use my Logitech gamepad but meh... much preferred using the keyboard and mouse with GlovePIE running.\n\nFor the one big positive that made it not a total loss .... I was enjoying the story line.  Kudos for the writing! I was getting into the story then BAM.. it ends! WTF?!?! It's only part 1, it doesn't say that in the overview anywhere I saw!?!?!  So you play through chapter 1 and then you get a stay tuned and the credits!  I was like WTF??!! I'm left wondering are they going to continue the story at all after the poor reviews and ratings this first part of the game had?  Would they continue the story line with a proper PC version and rebuild and repackage it like they did with DEHR Director's Cut?  Am I going to be forced to buy Part 2, Part 3 whatever and so on separately just to find out how the story ends?!?!  Hey will they just hand the addons to us poor suckers who bought this game in the first place?! LOL\n\nWell I'm left dangling at the edge of the unknown....\n\nBUY IT if you want a good story and will be satisfied without knowing how it ends! So I will recommend this game, because of the writing only... it's a good story line with interesting characters... and even though they cut the story off after the first chapter, leaving you hanging!\nDON'T BUY IT if you can't tolerate some obvious bugs and glitches...it wasn't designed for PC... so buy at your own discretion or not or just hold out for a whole new release designed for PC (if you believe in miracles).\n\nEDIT: Thought of this after I posted and thought it was worth noting.  There is a store in your inventory, they eliminated vendor people in this game!  Also Their is no limit of storage in your inventory!  Drawback to the inventory store is I couldn't find a way to sell items for quick cash, for items I needed.  Also I miss the fact that without vendors to interact with you are missing out on some flavour of additional characters, and the feature of people vendors had where you could sell them your excess crap to stock up on mods and supplies quickly.  So it's much harder to make money quickly and limited to what you find on the people you knock out, and that is stashed in corners, etc. With no limit in my inventory and all the extra crap I picked up I could have sold a tons of stuff to buy more of those energy bar things, or praxis.  Kind of a waste of a store without a sell feature.","June 29, 2014","true","7.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

My awnser: no and yes.\nI can agree on one fact, that bugs are present and compared gameplay-wise to Human Revolution it's simply a shell. But in all seriousness, it was enjoyable, it lacked the depth and some content that HR had, yet being perfectly honest what do people expect from a ios port. Personally I've never expected the graphics to be stellar, the only thing I've ever been interested in when it comes to with ports is optimization, and frankly this ticks the box, it runs flawlessly excluding a few bugs. Never experienced lag nor crashes whilst playing. As a game itself, I'd probably agree it's one of the poorer entries into the Deus Ex Franchise, but it's decent. Enough to warrant at least a single playthrough. Story is pretty bland but seeing as it's part one of, well nobody knows, and ends on a cliff hanger, which chances are we'll never see on PC thanks to the negativity, I don't really want to critique it there since it is incomplete. The graphics are not that great looking like they came from 2004, but as I said it's just a port from ios.\n\nIf your on the line about buying it heres my advice: If you're a die-hard fan, probably not for you, casual fans go for it. Perhaps not worth buying at full price, on sale it can go down to £1.59/$1.99, at that price would recommend buying.\n","August 7, 2015","true","10.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

Sure if you expect a whole new game with upto 30+ hours of gameplay you are going to be dissapointed. The game isn't perfect and it has it's share of good and bad issues. Which I shall go into.\n\nThe game runs smoothly at a pretty decent rate. (I have a plebtier PC) and there wasn't any framerates issues throughout the entire game. The game was smooth from start to finish.\n\nThe HUD is pretty clean. It's got a few obvious touch screen elements that shouldn't really be there. Drop down menu's and a rather unusual ingame store (using ingame money). Overall the HUD is better than I've seen from other ports.\n\nThe audio, the ingame music is pretty decent. Fairly similiar to Deus Ex:Human Revelution. It's very close to DXHR although it's not exactly the same. It's a very much welcome addition to somebody that enjoyed the soundtrack to Deus EX.\n\nThe voice acting is so-so. It seems to fluctuate between the characters, depending on how important or the screentime they have, The main protagonist I feel has a decent amount of quality. However the training mission instructor is absoluetly terrible. She's rather dull and boring. Speaking with one tone. Just readling lines off of a script with absolutely no emotion what so ever.\nHowever sometimes the audio in game skips and jumps. Sounds get repeated or the audio mutes itself for two seconds. I also personally found the ambient sounds to be annoying but that's just a niggle I have.\n\nThe background music was also louder than everything else. I guess they wanted to cover up the bad voice acting. Luckily you can change that in the menu settings. The setting aren't great either to be honest. It's got audio setting and reset your data but there isn't one for brightness and this game really needs that. I was bumbling along for a bit in some places.\n\nThe levels are split into short sections, this requires a lot of loading, luckily the loading only takes a few seconds but it all adds up. It could've been better but at least it's short.\n\nThe cutscenes are pausable which I haven't seen too often in games, so it's good that you are able to pause the game and it's slightly difficult to accidentally skip the cutscene if you want to resume the game. The orange glow used for items and 'hints' are still visible in the cutscenes which is really distracting and I personally find it annoying. You maybe able to overlook it though.\n\nUnless you turn the Autosave feature off. Due to the fact that there is only one save slot that both you and the autosave is supposed to use.\n\nTechnical problems.\n\nWhilst I was playing I found that the mouse would get stuck in the centre of the screen which then made it impossible to look or aim. Minimizing the game helped fix that issue.\nThe buttons in game for the menu aren't always responsive, sometimes you have to click on it more than once and some times upto 3 times.\n\nWhenever I performed a takedown the entire world would flicker and drop out (during the cutscene) this happened mostly in tight places but seemed to be entirely random.\n\nOnce you kill or knockout an enemy they just fizzle away into orange triangles and then vanish. Which makes stealthing this game so easy that it's a joke. If you are used to playing MGS on the hardest whilst going for a complete stealth run. This is going to be like 'Baby's first stealth game'\n\nThis isn't really an issue but it's pretty damn lazy, all of the animations have been recycled from DX:HR. The game also ends on a cliffhanging telling you that more is coming. Which I highly doubt by now.\n\nOveral, it's a nice little package. It's not great and it definetly has it's fair share of issues, However if you can get it cheap during a sale and you like Deus Ex, I'd suggest picking it up.","April 10, 2015","true","9.1"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","17","31","3","0"

The enemies move like stick puppets, and the character models look lifeless and "off". After being disappointed by the graphics, I thought it might be due to low quality settings, but no.\nThere are no graphics quality settings except for anti-aliasing.\n\nVoice-acting:\nBad. The voice actors deliver their lines without any passion. At times, it feels like the game is voiced by a text-to-speech engine like Siri (or Cortana), although I'm sure they would actually do a better job. The voiced-over tutorial is especially dreadful, but can fortunately be skipped.\n\nGameplay:\nLittle challenge. The game features an ingame menu which includes all augmentation upgrade options as well as weapon and item stores. Meaning you can pause the game and purchase upgrades, new weapons and ammo in the middle of a fight, which pretty much ruins any sense of immersion for me.\n\nQuality:\nBugged.

If you're not, you simply will not have the patience for its crap. So with that out of the way, the rest of the review....\n\nI snagged this game during an Amazon sale for significantly less than full price, and I have to say it's not nearly as bad as I expected.  Hardly stunning praise, but I'll freely admit to having some fun playing the game, in between dealing with its problems.  The biggest problem is of course the mangled interface, specifically the hard-coded keybindings and the mouse smoothing+acceleration combo that the game forces. Once I used AutoHotkey to fix the bindings though my biggest problem with the game went away. The mouse issues, while still present, aren't as bad because frankly the AI isn't tetchy enough for it to matter. They always give you ample room to aim at all their vulnerable bits.\n\nI'm not saying it's a great game. It's certainly nowhere near as detailed and complex as any of the previous Deus Ex titles, not by a long shot, but given the price I paid I'm willing to forgive that. It's also surprisingly easy, undoubtedly due to the straight mobile-to-PC port.  Any experienced Deus Ex player is only going to have trouble with this game if they insist on going for a perfect no-detection non-lethal run, especially with built-in health regen and items you can literally buy mid-battle. Despite that though, the game is still fun in the same way that DX:HR was fun, albeit not as well fleshed out and significantly shorter (you can breeze through the full campaign and all sidequests in a few hours). It's sort of like eating a frozen pizza: yeah, it's not as good as a restaurant-made pizza, but it's still a pizza, and if you like pizza sometimes that's enough.\n\nReally though, what drags this game down are the control issues. The rest of the issues with the game - low rez models, simplified level design, almost ridiculously dumb AI - can be given a pass because the game was ported from a mobile platform. The controls though... that's kind of a basic, required component of games, plus, this game is a Unity engine game. Someone with three weeks of programming classes could make remappable controls in Unity. Not making remappable controls in Unity engine is beyond lazy, it's downright negligent. And to add further insult to injury, this awful hackjob of a port costs more than the original mobile version, despite having nothing new to it.  Completely inexcusable.\n\nBottom line: if you can get past the control issues (or use a workaround like AutoHotkey), there's a fun game lurking under here, along with some interesting depth and backstory.  Unfortunately there's a lot to get past within that, and that coupled with the somewhat dumbed down game may make it too much for you to be willing to deal with.  If it's not though, the game is worth your time, but not the full asking price.","May 31, 2014","false","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you buy this game because of Deus Ex: Human Revolution, you will be really disappointed and I strongly advice you to NOT to buy this game. You WILL be disappointed. The movement felt clunky and several bugs were encountered, as for example I skipped frames whenever turned for more than 45°. Also the controls are not rebindable. Doesnt bother everyboy, but as they were imho just terrible compared to DX:HR, that DID bother me. But so much about the functionality.\n\nDesign-wise, this game is a HUGE let down compared to DX:HR. I really loved that game and that is the reason why I outright bought DX: The Fall when I heard of it. Do not be as foolish as I was. For instance: Corpses disappear and do no longer have any meaning. The intro/tutorial wasn't the best either, as it made one thing clear to me: I will be flooded with worthless achievements for clicking (a) button(s).\n\nThe only thing that would make the game appealing to me would be the lore, as everything else causes the opposite. Sadly, that is not enough for me to dig myself through this game.\n\nI'd give it 3/10 just for being a Deus Ex title. I do not recomment it.","March 26, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Stick to the original and give this cheap knock-off a wide berth!\n\nGraphics:\nBad. To me, the game looks like a cheap console port. The enemies move like stick puppets, and the character models look lifeless and "off". After being disappointed by the graphics, I thought it might be due to low quality settings, but no.\nThere are no graphics quality settings except for anti-aliasing.\n\nVoice-acting:\nBad. The voice actors deliver their lines without any passion. At times, it feels like the game is voiced by a text-to-speech engine like Siri (or Cortana), although I'm sure they would actually do a better job. The voiced-over tutorial is especially dreadful, but can fortunately be skipped.\n\nGameplay:\nLittle challenge. The game features an ingame menu which includes all augmentation upgrade options as well as weapon and item stores. Meaning you can pause the game and purchase upgrades, new weapons and ammo in the middle of a fight, which pretty much ruins any sense of immersion for me.\n\nQuality:\nBugged. In the first 3 chapters, I've reliably fallen through the floor (into death) at a certain point, had camera moves that move the viewpoint behind a wall and seen takedown animations that leave both me and the unconscious guard at another place than the takedown actually happened.\n\nSummary:\nDon't buy this if you like the Deus Ex series, you'll just end up disappointed.","June 27, 2014","false","13.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As such, it suffers from a few common issues; non-rebindable keys, relatively poor graphics and sometimes clunky controls. However, it is not a terrible game.\nThe Fall was clearly made to milk the franchise. There isn't much love or inspiration to be felt in its level design, weapons or story.\nThe levels are linear, but the developers clearly tried to copy the standard Deus Ex multiple-paths approach. It's clearly inferior to HR's (and the original's) excellently designed areas. Its hub, Panama, also doesn't feel very new or interesting, but it offers some variety in missions which I actually found fun.\nThe visuals are dated, which comes as no surprise given it's a mobile port, but they aren't horribly ugly and have that Human Revolution look. The soundtrack was ripped from HR in an attempt to bring back the atmosphere of the former (it does, to some degree, succeed in that).\nThe block-based Deus Ex inventory system was scrapped in favor of an unlimited all-in-one inventory-store, which works well considered this is a relatively entry to the series. Enemy AI is, at most, downright handicapped, so stealth is easier than it should be.\nHowever, I was able to look past all this and found a fun little Deus Ex fix. Why am I giving it a thumbs down, then? See, I expected the game to be short, five or six hours, ten at most. I got my 6 hours out of it, but I also expected an ending to the story, however uninteresting it may be. It ends with a cliffhanger. A ♥♥♥♥ing "To be continued..." that cuts you off without anything remotely similar to a conclusion. One moment, you're sitting tight, expecting an epic final mission, or at least a boss fight and explanations for some loose plotpoints, and the next you realize you get none of it and are basically screwed. And since this game was generally unfavorably received, it isn't likely Ben Saxon's story will continue, at least in its current form.\nSo there you go, Deus Ex: The Fall isn't as bad as some might make you believe. It doesn't live up to the high standards of Deus Ex, but is fun in its own right. Without Deus Ex slapped on it, and maybe if it was originally on PC, it would score a solid 7.5/10. It isn't, however, finished, so keep that in mind if you ever want to buy it.","November 6, 2015","false","6.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game ends with a TO BE CONTINUED before it even picks up.\nYou play as Ben Saxon, an ex-tyrant, who is off the grid. You are trying to find a supply of Neuropozyne so that your body doesn't reject your augmentations while you (GIRLFRIEND???) stays at home and suffers from Neuropozyne withrawl.\n\nGameplay You can tell it's an iOS port. It's bad, real bad.\nSometimes while shooting, your gun will stop.   It won't start shooting again untill you select another gun and then go back to the your original weapon.  There's so many loading screens. Go five feet to reach that loading screen over there to go another five feet and reach a loading screen and then come back and you've wasted 5 minutes of your life only to realize that you've just completed the most unrewarding sidequest you've ever done. The lack of a decent physics engine causes you not to be able to pick up boxes and move them out of your way or throw them at enemies, instead you press E and the box slides into a set position, sometimes from behind an airvent. To top it off, you get a crappy AI that throws grenades in the wrong direction and can't see you while you're in front of them.\n\nConclusion This is a bad stealth game. This is a bad FPS. This is a bad Deus Ex game. It's unfinished and probably never will be.\n\nSpend your money on any other Deus Ex game if you want a solid stealth fps.\n\nLemon-Lime/Orange (3/10)","September 13, 2015","false","6.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Compared to other games in series, The Fall is no good. But for something that was made for smarphones - yes, you can enjoy it. Everybody know it doesn't met with so many nowadays standards. That doesn't matter. Also, maybe I'm alone, but I think it's nice to see good smartphone games avaible also on PC, so even people with nomrla cellphones would be able to enjoy it.\n\nSo, that's probably everything I can say is positive in Deus Ex: The Fall. I'm not fan of mobile gaming, it's good for little games, less for something more "serious". It's well made SMARTPHONE game, which surprised me few times. While I played The Fall, it reminded me with not so good fps games from many years ago. Yup, it was almost same. It's not a bad thing, a little nostalgia while playing something not so old. Sometimes AI acted foolish, boss fight (if you can call something at the end like this) felt like a joke and same goes for ending. What I really enjoyed were making takedowns, maybe because it's a Human Revolution things. Graphics, music, UI and many others are fine - for a SMARTPHONE game. It's rather decent if you would want to compare it to some PC games, even those 10+ years older than Deus Ex: The Fall.\n\nIf you want it, get it on sale, or maybe on your phone (if you have a powerful one), so you will have your little Deus Ex universe in your pocket. I can't truly recommend it or not, so I guess it leaves me no other option as mark it negative. There is no harm in giving it a chance but you need to be rather prepared to be dissapointed with this one.","December 26, 2015","false","34.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That was and still is an amazing game! Later, Eidos Montreal revealed that they were working on another DE title. How excited I was! More Deus Ex! Bummer, Mobile platform only...\n\nOn Mobile, the game seemed to perform well and was decently rated, for a mobile game! Now that Eidos Montreal said they were going to bring this DE: The Fall to PC, that was good news! Or is it?\n\nIn this game, you play as Ben Saxon, a Merc that used to work for Belltower Mercenaries. After some incident, you're recruited by Namir, the antagonist of Human Revolution, and sent somewhere for assassination. Now, your guy, Ben, develops a conscience and decides to quit Namir's friends and pals, the Tyrants. And that's where I am at, in the game now. I'll update this review once I finish this digital-only game but still, here's a rundown of PROS and CONS that I'm experiencing currently.\n\nPROS:\n+Interested in more DE backstory? The Fall shall fill that craving! Many PDA to read infos, so you get to know some more.\n+Hacking minigame is the same as Human Revolution.\n+Music by same composer as HR. Really great... when it works!\n+Voice acting is okay, more or less! It's not HR quality, but serviceable for a "Mobile" game.\n+Deus Ex GOTY free with this purchase... well, at this point, if you still haven't got DE GOTY, you should get The Fall!\n\nCONS:\n-Straight Port from Mobile to PC. Nothing "extra" or noteworthy added in the PC version.\n-No rebindable keys for Keyboard AND EVEN Xbox 360 Gamepad (totally unnacceptable and hopefully patched later on)\n-Wonky controls. The sensitivity of the mouse feels way off. If you can't adjust your sensitivity "on-the-fly", you'll likely have issues with this game!\n-Lots of sound clipping and worse, sound crash at times. Best advice, active subtiles if you want to "hear" a nearby enemy!\n-Many annoying "help pop ups".\n-Unintuitive menus.\n-Poor AI.\n-Visuals/Graphics/Animations are all really bad. Low res textures, wonky/stiff animations.\n\nOVERALL:\nWell, kinda disappointed really. Sure this isn't a AAA full game but I still expected something decently done for the porting, alas, it wasn't. It's like this port feels rushed, no special love added in the PC version. Granted it was designed as a mobile game so no one should have expected a killer treatment but at least, a working game would've been greatly appreciated!\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nSo, since I haven't finished the game yet, I'll finish it off in the coming days, unsure when as I'm flooded with PlayStation 4 titles all of the sudden!\n\nSo do I recommend? Not really. Not at full price! And at least not right now... better wait until this game get's properly patched, especially for the audio issues and wonky controls! By that time, it may be in a Steam sale!\n\nRATING:\n5.0 / 10","March 20, 2014","false","1.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Shooting: in any good shooter you expect that when you shoot, your bullets would actually do something  right? well not in deus ex the fall, you can shoot a guy 3 times in the head and he wont go down, shoot a different guy in the leg with a full clip and he still doesnt go down? that shows theres something wrong right there\n\n3. Controls: being that i hadnt played a deus ex game in a few months i admit i was still a bit rusty at the controls, but heres the kicker, you cant remap them, i ended up having to dust off the controller to play this game effectively becasue the keyboard controls are terrible\n\n4. Price: its ten bucks, thats wa to high for as crappy a game as this, i got it when it was on sale for 2.50, but it still wasnt worth it, dont buy this, unless you want to waste money\n\nEDIT: I actually finished the game, holy ♥♥♥♥ was it bad, not only did it take me less than  hours, but this was supposed to be an episodic series, holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥, my verdict still stands DONT BUY THIS","September 18, 2014","false","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's filled with bugs and is a very poor port as well. The developers of this game must've hibernated from the moment they released this on mobiles last summer, until now. There are so many bugs that they certainly don't seem to have had any testers on it. Personally I experienced:\n\nSound holes: Often I wasn't able to hear dialogue, even in cut scenes. Weapon noises would disappear from time to time and the music would clip weirdly.\n\nCover mechanics: So very buggy. Often I'd shoot into the cover itself, even with my cross hairs well clear of the cover itself. I also managed to fall through the world one time, because I clipped through the cover somehow.\n\nThe game has an awful awful AWFUL mouse acceleration that makes you do weird twists and turns very often, disorienting you thoroughly.\n\nThe textures look OLD. Of course that's due to it being a mobile port, but they've had 9 months to do something about that. They could even have used some Deus Ex: Human Revolution material to make it easier for themselves.\n\nOver all it feels like a super lazy job by the devs. I guess they try to make us swallow this crap by giving us the original Deus Ex for free.","March 19, 2014","false","5.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

After Human Revolution, I was all set for a new Deus Ex game to play. And after playing The Fall, I guess that "new" game is Deus Ex GOTY (thanks preorder). The way I look at it now is I (over)paid 9.98 for Deus Ex GOTY, and a penny for this pile of garbage.  The voice for the tutorial is beyond aggravating, sounding robotic for most of the intro and then all of a sudden sounding normal.  There's no control mapping, which any PC game that doesn't have that is a joke.  Not only that, but hey, hope you remember what the controls are, because if you pause and go to "Controls" you sure aren't going to see the controller map to see what the buttons do. There are plenty of broken hacking sequences where you either really struggle to click the capture button because it's partially off screen, or there is one instance where you can't hack the door at all because one of the nodes you need to capture is completely off screen, even after a full zoom out.  The game feels sluggish, looks awful (npc characters especially), and is honestly a complete waste of time.

On iOS the game is an impressive achievement of bringing Human Revolution gameplay to mobile devices, on PC it's a playable yet curious mess. Not a whole lot has been done to ensure this is a quality PC release. Graphics have not been altered from mobile (including vanishing corpses with a distracting hologram-like effect) and the interface still feels like you're supposed to be using a touchscreen. Although the sensitvity can be adjusted the controls cannot even be rebinded, which is simply inexcusable in this day and age. Beyond everything the game succesfully provides a decent story and mirrors Human Revolution's gameplay.\n\nI WOULD and actually DID say "yes" because I don't think the game itself is nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be but the port at the time of writing is in a woefully subpar state.

Oh yeah, The Fail Fall isn't a complete game, it ends with a cliffhanger "To be Continued". This is first Deus Ex game to not be a complete story, and it's doubtful it will ever be completed because The Fail's Fall's a piece of ♥♥♥♥ing dog garbage.\n\nThe gameplay is just a dumbed down Human Revolution with terrible controls. The inventory has been completely removed, and now you can buy any items from anywhere in the game! Yeah, the stores from HR have been removed and instead you can just buy weapons, ammo, and items at anytime, anywhere. You can hold as many weapons as you want now, because you just equip weapons through this store menu. I'm sure the original mobile version of this game probably included microtransactions, too!\nThe levels are terrible and unmemorable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/258180/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","The Fall tells the story of Ben, a mercenary, who works with Namir's team then gets betrayed. Essentially, the story is his struggle against his former team members while at the same time he tries to uncover why there is a shortage of the so-called Neuropozyne which is a must medicine for all augmented people.\n\nNow, what should be noted about the game is that while it looks similar to Human Revolution it is a toned-down version of it. This was initially released for iOS mobile systems but later on was ported to the PC. Unfortunately, many limitations remained on the PC version so much so that this is amongst the worst PC ports.\n\nThe upside:\n\n- an interesting story that serves as a sort of prequel to Human Revolution; while it is not as complex or interesting as the "main" game it is nice to see Ben's story through and meeting some familiar faces during the missions\n- considering it was initially made for the iOS the game looks quite well - naturally, textures are of lower resolution and characters / objects consist of fewer polygons but the creators did their best to make a game that reminds us of Human Revolution\n- the story wraps up around 5 hours which is not bad for a game originally intended for mobile phone users; many achievements and a new game plus mode make sure we have a long-lasting experience\n\nThe downside:\n\n- Putting aside the toned-down graphics the game has some awful limitations: jumping and picking up objects is simply not possible this time. While the former I did not particularly mind the latter would have been good for distracting enemies. Also, the inventory we have now represents the shop itself: all items show up in our inventory, we just need to buy the missing ones - provided we have enough cash. They could have just put a vendor guy somewhere in the slum to make it a little harder to purchase stuff.\n- Pressing buttons does not always work. It's best to click twice when picking options during dialogues as the game finds it really hard to register our selections in menus. During gameplay this is not an issue. Oh yeah and the menu options are simply HUGE - they could have just created a different main menu with smaller font size.\n- While the 5-hour long story I appreciated I did not understand the "to be continued" message at the end. The "Pacifist" achievement that refers to the story calls it "Part 1" which makes me assume originally there were plans to release further episodes. I guess the game did not do well financially.\n\nDeus Ex The Fall is an interesting game whose shortcomings mainly stem from the fact that it is a port. While I do appreciate what N-Fusion has done with a little more effort the result could have been closer to offering a real PC experience.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Well, if you are not a die hard Deus Ex fan I do not. But if you are and you do not mind spending 2 euros when the game is discounted you may find this game an entertaining one. After Human Revolution and before Mankind Divided I enjoyed the ride - I just wish it'd been better.","September 5, 2015","true","5.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

There are some new and some returning characters to get to know. Costa Rica is an interesting location for a Deus Ex game; it's nice to have a slightly different flair to the city. This isn't a long game, but for the price, you get a decent amount of content. There are a couple new weapons/mods to use, which are fun.\n\nThe bad: This is a port from mobile platforms, and the controls were poorly done IMO. They just seem very finicky and timing for quick movements is difficult. The graphics are not up to the standard of Deus Ex Human Revolution, again due to the port. The game was intended to be the first in a series, but the others have not yet been made, so the ending leaves you hanging.\n\nGeneral info: The player character, Ben Saxon, was introduced to the Deus Ex universe in the companion novel The Icarus Effect, which takes place just prior to and during Human Revolution. If you enjoy the lore of Deus Ex, this is a nice little addition with some more info on one of the Tyrants. The game gets a lot of hate, but I think most of that is due to the poor PC port. If you know what to expect going in, I think it can be enjoyable for fans of the series.\n\nOverall: Would recommend it to those who are already Deus Ex fans; if you've never played a Deus Ex game before, start with the original Deus Ex or Human Revolution first.\n\nSystem Specs Used: Intel Core i7-3610QM, Nvidia GeForce GTX 670M / 3GB GDDR5, DDRIII 12GB RAM, Windows 7","November 25, 2015","true","11.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Unfortunately, actually playing the game seems to show that it’s the exact opposite; with a storyline that’s difficult to follow without losing interest along the way, as well as boring dialogue and rather uninteresting characters, you’ll honestly have a hard time following what’s going on. The conversations between NPCs, whether they be related to side missions or the main story, are drawn out quite a bit with some unnecessary information that could’ve been easily skipped. On top of that, the game seems to rely more on literally telling you everything it can about one particular moment in the game, instead of letting you find the information yourself along the way. This kind of breaks away from the norm people expect from the Deus Ex series, which takes away from digging up necessary information and replaces it with extended dialogue that could very well make the player lose interest in the game.\n\nIn terms of visual quality, this game is a bit mixed in terms of quality, but ultimately comes off as a bit sub-par for a PC title. Deus Ex: The Fall runs on the Unity engine, demanding very little to play on its highest quality and allowing players with a low-end system the ability to play this game without worry. The Fall also makes use of the assets from Deus Ex: Human Revolution, giving it a more fitting appearance for a Deus Ex title. However, this is about as far as the game goes in terms of positive remarks on its appearance; although the environments look good, the lack of shaders seen in the game tends to take away from them, leading to a somewhat dull appearance when comparing it to Human Revolution. Male and female NPCs are also very low quality and seem like something you’d expect from an older game, and are extremely limited in terms of variation; at most, you’ll see one or two models that look different from each other based on gender alone, while every other NPC will literally be using the same model and a maybe variations of the same textures. There’s also the matter of the weapon models having noticeable smoothing related issues that give them a lower quality appearance when compared to what you see in Human Revolution.\n\nThe sound quality isn’t exactly the best either, but there isn’t much to say about it since a majority of the sounds used in Human Revolution were re-used for The Fall. Although most of the ambient and weapon sounds seem to be taken directly from Human Revolution, some of the sounds you’ll come across sound really poor in quality when compared to others you hear throughout the game. The voice acting itself is also not that great either, with little to no emotion being present whenever someone is speaking and making it seem like the actors themselves weren’t even interested in their lines. There’s also no variation between voices used for generic NPCs like there was in Human Revolution. There’s also a couple of issues with the sound where certain audio clips seem generally out of sync, such as when you speak with NPCs and they end up doing a sort of puppet-style chatter movement. There’s also no pauses between lines in conversations, so everything seems like a rushed conversation whenever you talk to someone else.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this game is just a horrible mess of unbalanced combat, poor controls, and buggy AI. Not only were the controls for the PC and controller setups rather buggy and unpolished, you also don’t have the option to re-map your bindings to something more fitting to your own style of gameplay. The combat system was also rather clunky and unbearable at times. The AI used by enemy NPCs was also a bit lacking in terms of being intelligent, considering that you can literally walk right up to an enemy and shoot them a couple times before they or their allies even noticed you. The game’s difficulty is also heavily unbalanced, being a bit too easy in areas where the difficulty would need to be increased and being overly difficult in areas where it shouldn’t be difficult at all. The Fall makes very little use of the available weapon models from Human Revolution, only using a select few and re-purposing them with very minor tweaks to provide a larger “selection” of the exact same weapons with slightly different stats; considering that you can go through the entire game with two of the cheapest weapons available and not have to worry about running out of ammo, this system is highly unnecessary and rather pointless. There are also various points in the game where certain functions or prompts won’t appear where they are needed, such as when you are hacking a computer or door panel and need an auto-unlock device; the prompt simply doesn’t show for the item that’s needed, and you’re pretty much forced to either hack certain devices manually or find ways to slow down the security system when hacking. This can be very aggravating at times, especially when it involves important parts of the game. For example, you supposedly only need one AUD (Auto-Unlocking Device) to open a security panel or have access to a computer without having to manually hack a device; I ended up having to mod the game to create a debug mode just to give myself a bunch of AUDs, and I still couldn't use any of them until I completely restarted the game. The only positive thing I found in terms of the gameplay was that the inventory system was re-vamped, removing the need to play “inventory Tetris” and just buying or equipping whatever weapons/items you need at the time. While it does partially take away from the feel one would expect from the iconic inventory system that’s been used since the first Deus Ex, it does provide a bit more relief in terms of how much of a single item you can have stored away for later use.\n\nOverall, Deus Ex: The Fall was a rather shoddy port of an already sub-par mobile game. The visual quality is decent enough to still look good on a low-end system, but there’s a large amount of room for improvement on the PC version. The sound quality is also nothing special due to the re-used assets from Human Revolution, and also suffered from rather low quality more often than it should be. The gameplay itself is just atrocious, having more problems than it honestly should and just being a pain to work with without taking some time to calm down mid-play. In all honesty, this isn’t a game worth buying for the PC; if you’re really wanting to spend ten dollars on a game, it really would be in your best interest to spend it on something else.","July 29, 2014","false","12.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first, I didn't realize it was just the first episode. After about **6 hours**  playing (and I am one of those exploring every dark corner just to see what concept artists decided to put there) the game finished like this, abruptly.\n\n"Damn... - I though - wtf?!"\n\nWell, I think it should have been expressed more clearly for the player / payer (sic), that this is just a few bits more than a simple "demo of a prequel". And this is a bad negative point, expecially because I am not sure other episodes will be developed: what will be augmented in the next episodes, if you can augment your alter ego stats to the max in 5 hours?!\n\nI really loved Deus Ex  Humant Revolution: it was one of my favourite games ever. The story was great, the script was wonderful, the game runned flawless, with cool and funny gameplay: the whole world built up by the devs was really fascinating.\n\nThis new release is very different. It's SHORT, it lacks any improvement, and it really sounds as if somebody decided to squeeze some more pennies out of the Deus-Ex-Chicken franchise...\n\nA last note: I can't stand the main character... He looks exactly like the French actor Jean Réno. I like the actor, but I think it's not the right face for this kind of game (we are not in the 90s anymore).\n\n________________\n\nITA:\n\nNon ci siamo. Dapprima non ho realizzato che sarebbe stato solo "primo episodio". E dopo circa **6 ore** di gioco  (e sono uno di quelli che esplorano ogni angolino buio solo per vedere cosa ci hanno messo gli artisti e i grafici), il giorno è finito. Così, all'improvviso.\n\n" Ehi! - ho pensato - Ma che c...?!"\n\nBeh, penso che avrebbero dovuto spiegare più chiaramente al giocatore (pagante)  che questo non è altro che una "demo di un prequel" o pochi bit in più. E questo è un brutto punto  negativo, specialmente perché non sono sicuro che altri episodi verranno sviluppati...  cosa aumenteremo nei prossimi episodi, se possiamo maxare il  nostro alter ego in 5 ore?\n\nHo davvero amato Deus Ex Human Revolution: è stato uno dei miei titoli preferiti. La storia era grandiosa, lo script meraviglioso, e il gioco girava senza difetti, con un gameplay figo e divertente: gli sviluppatori avevano costruito un mondo davvero affascinante.\n\nQueta nuova release è molto diversa. E' BREVE, manca qualsiasi miglioramento, e suona davero stonata, come se qualcuno avesse deciso di spremere ancora qualche centesimo dalla serie di Deus Ex.\n\nUn'ultima nota: non sopporto il protagonista... E' identico all'attore francese Jean Réno. Mi piace l'attore, ma non mi pare sia la faccia più adatta a questo genere di gioco (non siamo negli anni 90).","June 3, 2014","false","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, if the lack of the ability to jump says anything about this, it seems like a MASSIVE technological step backwards from DE:HR. Using a controller, the hacking system is unusuable, due to the sensitivity for the controller jumping many magnitudes as soon as you enter into the hacking mode. On top of that, the combat system is messed up, and the stealth system makes very little sense. Some enemies can hear you from across the map, while others are nearly entirely deaf. Enemy bodies disappear, making the entire body-hiding mechanic null and void. Also, it's nearly, if not wholly, impossible to get a headshot in the game, which instantly makes it impossible to kill someone from a distance and not alert every enemy around, once again destroying the stealth mechanic. The cover is ridiculous as well, my head bobbing clearly above the edges of the cover, with oblivious enemies glaring intently at me without seeing a thing. It's really a twisted combination of irritating, confusing, and hilarious.\n\nOverall, I feel like this game was a waste of money. Perhaps some serious patching could fix the gameplay, but either way, the game is depressingly short, and the saving system is also pretty jacked, since there can only be one save at a time, and the game doesn't even save after completing a mission, only on a level change.\n\nThis was a sad waste of money in its current state, and has hurt my faith in Square Enix as a company.","March 21, 2014","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Story is boring, dialogues are a one big emotionless meh, model animations are awkward with lifeless artificial stare into the bottom of your soul, controls are sloppy and uncomfortable. And hey... Didn't you just loved the freedom of choise in Human Revolution? Well, forget about it... You will be walked from the beginning untill the end by the tutorial sistem, which will tell you "You know that praxis you have? Use them on that skill to get past the obstacle you are having infront of you. No, there is no other way. No, you can't lvl up whatever you want, do as I tell you".\n\nIt's pretty dissapointing. But if you overlook all these details and you really love "Deus Ex" series, you could buy it. You shouldn't, though, in my personal opinion. This game exhales MEH with every step you take, but the worst part is not even all that I mentioned before. The worst part is, this game is INCOMPLETE, it's just a FIRST EPISODE of saga that will never be continued because of the storm of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this game is. So, yeah... Enjoy that terrible abortion of a game if you can but I would not recommend it to anyone...

When compared to other games on the series, this one is without doubt, the weakest but being a spin-off and actually having a low launch price(10€ offers the first Deus Ex from 2000) kinda makes up for it in my opinion.\n\nLet's get down to business, the game is a straight mobile port, it has low polygon models, average textures anmd it is clear that it is a mobile port because, you can't jump, the control scheme is mobile friendly and there's some bugs on the GUI that are a consequence of the "touch" to mouse conversion done badly. With that said, it feels like a bare-bones Human Revolution experience, and a small one, but while it  might lack much replay value and there are some hard to ignore faults, the experience is fun and that's what counts in my opinion, it does leave you the feeling that it could be so much more.\n\nWhy do I recommend this game then? Because if you don't compare it to the other Deux Ex games, it's enjoyable, it's a side story in the Deux Ex universe, and I think it's worth at a 6€ or lower price gauging for the experience it provides versus the faults.\n\nMy final word? Get it at a sale, it's fun but given it's faults and length, not worth 10€.","April 1, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badsectoracula/recommended/258180/","badsectoracula","Bad Sector","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badsectoracula/","657 products in account","Before i begin, let me say that the game as it is right now has several issues, including a bug with vsync that makes the game unplayable with broken mouse controls and recoil. If you have seen TotalBiscuit's WTF is... video you'd know what i'm talking about (note that TB didn't notice that this is caused from vsync). The workaround is to enable vsync, but this introduces input lag. The developers should fix this ASAP. But in hopes that they do, i'm going to ignore that for now.\n\nNow about the game. AFAIK story-wise this is supposed to be the sequel of a book (Icarus Effect), which itself was a prequel to the story of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Sadly the game doesn't seem to make much of a introduction to this and for the first hour or so you will feel disconnected from the characters since it starts assuming that you already know them. Personally i had never read the book (i actually didn't knew about it, but now i will try and get it) so it took me a while to get any attachment with the characters. As the game began i didn't knew why i should care about the main character, especially considering his background. The fact that the game seems to ignore some parts of the book didn't help either (at least according to people who have read it). Fortunately after a while, once you start figuring out what the actual story of the game is all about (which happens about when you meet the crook doctor, a few moments after TB decided to stop playing the game, if you watched that video) both the characters and story start to pick up and become interesting.\n\nThe game's visuals are ok, they remind me of some early 2000s games. The environments are good to look at, although if you have a large monitor you'll certainly notice the low texture resolution and the bad tiling in a few of them doesn't help either. Still, as far as environments go, they are nice to look at and remind of lower fidelity version of HR's environments. The worse parts IMO are the character models: they look attrocious, especially the heads of the woman junkies which are all over the place. The lighting on them equeally bad, as if someone didn't knew about smoothing groups in 3ds max or whatever modelling program they used and there doesn't seem to be enough animations for all the character actions (f.e. at several points the enemies will try to strafe left and right but there isn't any animation for that so they just slide with their feet motionless). The only good model is the one of the pilot you'll meet near the end, but even that looks like a bad copy of Faridah Malik (and apparently in the Deus Ex:HR universe all pilots must have a mole :-P). But if you can ignore the bad character modelling, the game looks fine. Technically it is quite simple, but as a theme the visuals work fine.\n\nThe best part IMO is the sound - the guns sound good and the music is really good. At a couple of places i just stopped playing for a while to listen to the background music. Most of it sounds like a remixed version of HR's music (which i suppose it is) but i think there are a couple of original scores as well.\n\nSadly, following the bad modelling the game also has bad voice acting with hilariously awful accents. The only good audio come from the TV broadcaster Eliza, which i assume uses the same voice actor as HR. The writing doesn't help either since in many cases you'll be left wondering why the writers thought that a specific line was a good idea.\n\nThe gameplay is basically a simplified version of HR's gameplay. You still have the hacking, shooting, sneaking, etc as HR and the original game, but the RPG elements are mostly removed beyond a very simplistic upgrade system (which most of the time isn't needed, except in a couple of areas where you have to use a specific augmentation). Also you can upgrade guns, but i didn't notice that, never needed it and finally decided to try it out almost at the end of the game but even after upgrading a gun to the maximum settings it didn't made much of a difference. Also there is an in-game shop where you get to buy stuff with in-game currency that you gain by doing stuff. I suspect that on iOS this was tied to IAP because the shop is available at any point (not just to some vendor or whatever like in HR) and contains almost everything you may want, including even a kit that brings you back to life when you die. This makes the game much easier, although the most interesting items are expensive enough so that you don't get them instantly. Still, it removes the tension from small things like running out of bullets (since the price of the bullets is very low).\n\nThe level design is ok, but for the first few levels it is quite linear. The interesting levels begin at the slums, where you start getting alternative routes and more areas to explore (incintentally this is where TB stopped playing). Up to that point it was mostly linear and played more like a tutorial than the real game. I think the devs thought nobody would have played HR so they wanted to reintroduce the gameplay - and did it in the worst way possible, by destroying most first impressions and filling the first few moments with awful tutorial panels with one of the most obnoxious voices you'll hear in a tutorial. The game however becomes even more interesting in the later stages like in the hotel.\n\nWrapping it up (and because i got bored typing this :-P), i think that there is a good game in there that tries to come out and the story is interesting, but the way it is told and the presentation (as far as animation and character models  go at least) isn't up to the task. I don't recommend it for the full price, especially considering the bugs that the game has, but i would recommend it if the bugs were fixed and the price was halved. It does have some interesting moments and does provide some story to the Deus Ex universe that seems to fit in, so it has that going for it. Also the gameplay, even if simplistic, can be enjoyable - if you can overlook the first hour or so.\n\nI'm not generally recommending this game unless you are a fan of Deus Ex that is curious to see what this has to offer (and again, i'd recommend to wait for a price drop). If the bugs are  fixed and the price is dropped, i may change my recommendation to Yes, but even then be cautious about the other issues that the game has and mentioned above.","March 23, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I suspect that on iOS this was tied to IAP because the shop is available at any point (not just to some vendor or whatever like in HR) and contains almost everything you may want, including even a kit that brings you back to life when you die. This makes the game much easier, although the most interesting items are expensive enough so that you don't get them instantly. Still, it removes the tension from small things like running out of bullets (since the price of the bullets is very low).\n\nThe level design is ok, but for the first few levels it is quite linear. The interesting levels begin at the slums, where you start getting alternative routes and more areas to explore (incintentally this is where TB stopped playing). Up to that point it was mostly linear and played more like a tutorial than the real game. I think the devs thought nobody would have played HR so they wanted to reintroduce the gameplay - and did it in the worst way possible, by destroying most first impressions and filling the first few moments with awful tutorial panels with one of the most obnoxious voices you'll hear in a tutorial. The game however becomes even more interesting in the later stages like in the hotel.\n\nWrapping it up (and because i got bored typing this :-P), i think that there is a good game in there that tries to come out and the story is interesting, but the way it is told and the presentation (as far as animation and character models  go at least) isn't up to the task. I don't recommend it for the full price, especially considering the bugs that the game has, but i would recommend it if the bugs were fixed and the price was halved. It does have some interesting moments and does provide some story to the Deus Ex universe that seems to fit in, so it has that going for it. Also the gameplay, even if simplistic, can be enjoyable - if you can overlook the first hour or so.\n\nI'm not generally recommending this game unless you are a fan of Deus Ex that is curious to see what this has to offer (and again, i'd recommend to wait for a price drop). If the bugs are  fixed and the price is dropped, i may change my recommendation to Yes, but even then be cautious about the other issues that the game has and mentioned above.","March 23, 2014","false","5.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's not even worth your time if it was FREE.\n\nHere is what you get in Deus Ex: The Fall:\n-A story that should be interesting but absolutely isn't\n-Abysmal voice acting\n-N64 style FPS (you can't jump, plenty of tight corridors, when characters talk outside of cutscenes their mouths don't move, etc.)\n-You can't run. You can walk or walk slower.\n-Controls are clunky and buggy\n-INSANELY long audio logs scattered around. If you want story, prepare to stand still in a room for several minutes at a time. The voice acting in the audio logs are also awful.\n\nPlain and simple, this is a clunky half-♥♥♥♥♥ cash grab.\n\nIf you're absolutely hungry for more Deus Ex then don't make the mistake by playing this.

"mobile" being the very key word here with port leaving something to be desired around the control scheme. obviously its setting and much of the game mechanics is copied or adopted from deus ex: human revolution (dxhr). story is also closely related.\n\na playthrough will take 4-5 hours on average and around twice as much for a completionist/achievement hunter. for a deus ex fan or someone who liked dxhr, this game definitely contains a good amount of fun.\n\nlonger version:\nlet us start with the good - this is a faithful deus ex game. gameplay is close to dxhr with most of its good sides still very much present. several approaches to any situation (combat, hacking, sneaking, maybe talking), hacking minigame has remained practically the same, getting additional augmentations with praxis (either purchased kits or level ups from gained exp).\n\nsetting, graphics, writing, background is also same as dxhr, maybe visuals being even a bit more yellow this time. naturally, you will find several tie-ins to dxhr (and some to other deus ex games) in conversations, e-mails and logs.\n\nfortunately, dx: the fall has not gone the way of linear progression. with the exception of introduction/tutorial, the hub area with the linked locations can be freely roamed and pre-cleared if you wish. some areas get repopulated at quest triggers but there are only a couple that seemed to do that.\n\nstory is not bad in itself but considerably more shallow than expected. could have been used to give a bit more background to the tyrants but the overall theme remains with the daily struggles of fugitives and almost sidequest-level main questline. also, there are several references to part 1 and game ands with transition to what would seem to be another hub area so it is safe to say this was meant to be a first episode in an episodic game.\n\ngraphically, it looks like you would expect from a decent mobile game today - so in pc terms it looks only slightly better than the original deus ex from 2000. however, due to the setting still being excellent the visuals still work ok for a budged-priced game and naturally it works just fine with any remotely modern pc.\n\nunfortunately, its mobile roots do bring negative aspects to the game. i think a list is a good way for this so here goes - design decisions that are ok in a mobile game but are questionable or simply out of place for a pc game in 2014:\n- there is no jumping\n- levels are small and clearly compartmentalized so that low-powered hardware would not have trouble rendering the levels.\n- while dxhr ai was not groundbreaking, it was decent. the one in this game is not. most (of the limited few of) npc-s are completely static and the ones moving around are patrolling on limited trajectories. there are reactions to player actions (ex: hacking) but these are extremely limited in both range and function.\n- the world has no physics. an example: there is still an augmentation for lifting heavy things but these specific heavy crates are acting like glorified doors.\n- hacking does seem to be slightly modified, no hacking enemy-controlled nodes any more. this is annoying in some cases. available hacking layouts are very limited and will start very obviously repeating already about 25% into the game.\n\nthis leads us to the real problem with the game - who in the world thought such a lazy port would be a good idea? porting the control scheme from touchscreen to mouse and keyboard (or gamepad for that matter) has gone very awry somewhere along the line. i do not even know where to start so i will just make another list:\n- menu items and ingame  buttons have a horrible delay. basically, they  need a second after appearing to start functioning. there is an indication at the buttons for when they are pressed but the indications are slight and you will find yourself often clicking on the button and wondering if it did work or if you were too quick.\n- looking around with mouse is very choppy and not due to fps but due to something inherently wrong with the look controls.\n- using keys is often uncomfortable. couple examples - space does not make you stand up from crouch as in most games. if a container is being looted and there is nothing in there, the dialog can be closed only by pressing esc or moving mouse to ok button.\n- one savegame system is a crappy decision today but ok. but when saving from the menu while in game, the notification about game being saved is nowhere to be seen. it is logged in the game (that is covered by the menu) and a mild sound is played. that is it, and this is definitely not ok.\n- usable item highlighting is not reliable. in addition to some items not being highlighted (ex: drawers), highlighting simply does not work at some angles.\n- use prompt on screen can be a mess when there are several usable items. ex: person and computer next to each other both get use prompts highlighted and you can not be sure which one is activated when pressing e. it is probably due to prompts being separately clickable on touchscreen but leaving this in when porting is inexcusable.\n- minor, but annoying gripe - mousewheel scroll in logs, books and e-mails scrolls by 5-6 lines, which is a lot. keys and scrollbar do not work, dragging the text does. again, nobody cared to change the behaviour that was ok on touchscreen.","June 24, 2014","true","9.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I just thought I'd get that old chestnut out of the way but I guess every other review will have used it to death by now. Well actually, Deus Ex fans did. They asked for this game on PC and the result is a surprisingly good little Deus Ex 3 type game, hidden underneath an extremely crappy port.\n\nAfter finishing Deus Ex 3 a mere two days before the release of this game, I bought this a soon as it came onto the store. I now kind of wish I hadn't and waited for them to fix the most obvious issues.\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall is a cyberpunk First-Person Shooter / Role-Playing Game with stealth elements set both before and after the events of Deus Ex 3: Human Revolution. You play as Ben Saxon, a former British SAS solder. After being betrayed by the private military group known as The Tyrants, Ben sets off to uncover the truth behind a drug conspiracy that is threatening every augmented person on the planet.\n\nI'll start by saying that it's actually nice to hear a British character in a game that isn't either a) Another Borderlands 2 Sir Hammerlock who sounds like he lives on nothing but tea and crumpets or b) Another Psycho from Crysis, a cockney sounding geezer who says his 'th's as 'f's and goes around threatening to knock people's teeth out if they so much as look at them funny.\n\nBut I've avoided talking about the game for long enough, let's start off with the tutorial: It's abysmal.\n\nI like to think that there are three kinds of tutorials that can be presented to the player at the beginning of a game:\n\nType One is a tutorial that is entirely optional. The developers created a separate level for the player to either play through and learn the game or completely ignore and get on with enjoying the story (see also Thief Gold).\n\nType Two is a tutorial that is integrated into the main game in an unobtrusive way so the player can read or see what to do but is not forced into doing it in any way (see also Thief 2, Deus Ex 3).\n\nType Three is a tutorial that is integrated into the main game and completely rail-roads the player into following a set path, maybe doing things for them automatically and/or displaying pop-up after pop-up of text for the player to read that freezes the game and are not avoidable. And if the player even remotely tries to think outside the box and do something the developer didn't want them to do, they instantly fail and have the conditions reset for them to try again (see also Thief 3).\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall proudly picks the third option and also manages to treat the player like they just came out of a 20 year long coma. You are taught how to look around and move, you cannot move past and run ahead of characters, the game forces the player into ducking behind cover and crouching at key points, not allowing the player to make the slightest error and learning from their mistakes. The tutorial is impossible to fail.\n\nI might have enjoyed the tutorial a tiny bit more if I could've customized my keys. I dared to be born left-handed and it seems that I'm not welcome at the Deus Ex: Fall party. After the first part of the tutorial, I tried to get around the control problems by plugging in my controller and playing that way instead but half the buttons don't even work properly! I couldn't move or even fire my gun with the control pad!\n\nBut then it hit me, maybe the tutorial is making it impossible for me to fire until I meet an enemy? I was trying to out-think the tutorial at this point. It turns out I was wrong as clicking the mouse fired the gun. It's not just in game too, the controller only half works in the main menu and you'll need the mouse to navigate. Open a menu with one button, be stuck forever as no button may get you out of it again.\n\nAt this point, I was beginning to wonder why I was seeing dialogue subtitles for a split second only to watch them vanish, never hearing what was supposed to be said. Deus Ex: The Fall suffers from sound simply not working properly! You might end up missing vital plot points, dialogue and spoken tutorial information because the game engine seems like it cannot play more than 3 sound effects at the same time and anything else that tries to play is skipped completely. This can happen in nightclubs, where you'll be watching NPCs dance to no music because more than 2 characters around you are walking around creating footsteps. This is something that should have stopped the game from being shipped!\n\nOnce the abysmal tutorial had finished (and I had sadly gone back to mouse and keyboard controls), I was given a short bit of story and, after a short mag-rail ride, was free to explore Panama City.\n\nDo you remember Deus Ex 2's shoebox sized levels that meant you couldn't take more than 40 steps without having to load the next part of the area you were in? Well, they're back with a vengeance!. Due to the platform for which this game was initially made for, the levels are quite detailed but very very small. It's just as well that the loading times are relatively quick. Overall, it is not that big of a problem but slightly annoying if you're short on patience.\n\nAnother thing that seems to have been ported over from the portable version is the in-game shop. I think it was designed so the player could spend real money to get extra gear if they got stuck at any point but in the PC version, you can just spend credits you find to get anything you want instantly. Unless you choose not to use it, there is no hunting for resources needed, the tutorial even teaches you this, making a point of saying 'you can use this to completely break the balance of the game and remove all challenge' instead of simply putting the item I needed on a table in front of me (which the game will then later do in the next room!)\n\nOh and you only get one save slot too... not great.\n\nIf it wasn't for some of these glaring issues, this game would be nice to play and would be enjoyable. Believe me when I say that there is a good Deus Ex game in here. The stealth mechanics and game-play elements are pretty much like Deus Ex 3 and if you enjoyed them there, you'll enjoy them here as well. The Fall manages to copy the unique art-style and aesthetics that make Deus Ex 3 look so amazing.\n\nFor a game designed to be played on portable devices, they've done a heck of a good job in creating a core Deus Ex experience on a platform that maybe doesn't get these types of games very often and I'm all for introducing new players to a series on as many platforms as possible. However, they should have taken their time in creating at least half-decent PC port as this product should not have made it past Quality Assurance in the state that it is in at the time of writing this.\n\nIf you want more of Deus Ex 3 then you will find it in here, you just have to do a bit of work to find it. However, I cannot recommend this game to anyone until they fix the sound issues, at least. Once they fix that, I will change this review to reflect that but for now, please avoid purchasing this!","April 7, 2014","false","18.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/258180/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","I've heard some nasty things about Deus Ex: The Fall, so I booted it up cautiously. I'm a fan of Icarus Effect, the prequel novel to Human Revolution which this game pulls its characters and plot from, and I ventured into this game with the understanding that I may or may not get burned. What I found was a game that really wasn't all that bad, for being an iOS port job.\n\nThe most immediate thing you'll notice is the inferior graphics when compared to Human Revolution. This is natural for a straight port of a tablet/phone game, and doesn't really bother me. In fact, I consider it a plus, as the game actually runs very well with my integrated Intel setup. You'll then notice the widely varying quality of voicework, "eh" models, and stiff animations. The protagonist seems fidgety in conversation, but his entire upper body fidgets in a way that makes it seem as though his neck can't move, resulting in him turning his chest and head at the same time to look left and right and left and right and never at the person that he's talking to.\n\nThis is the sort of thing that you'll notice the game over. Everything's a little downgraded from Human Revolution, but not so downgraded as to ruin the game. There are certainly a number of faults, some of which I will be going over, but despite it all, the game is still fun to play. If you just want a little more Human Revolution and you've already played The Missing Link, then The Fall can do an alright enough job of filling that void for six or so hours.\n\nActually, on that note, let's just go ahead and address the length. I don't know what's going on with these people who complain that the game's so short because they beat it in two or four hours. You'd honestly have to be sprinting from objective to objective and ignoring all of the side quests for that to happen on your first playthrough. My first time through I explored the world, stealthed my way through everything, and did every sidequest available. Took me around nine hours. I'm not saying you'll definitely get nine, but expect at least six or seven if your goal is to enjoy the game, and not to reach the ending as quickly as possible.\n\nThe Fall is definitely easier than Human Revolution. Enemies don't spot you as easily, you can do takedowns and hack things while in cover and without poking your head out, and there aren't really enough consequences for being seen. If there are no enemies within the immediate vicinity, there's literally no reason to avoid being spotted by a camera. There aren't even any achievements for staying out of sight. Bodies disappear after a few seconds of being dead or unconscious. Other enemies can still see them for those few seconds, but once they fizzle out you're in the clear. Sneaking up on enemies and executing a takedown is still rewarding, it's just a little cheaper. And getting shot is certainly dangerous and something to be avoided. In fact, in close quarters, I've found that enemies can sometimes (and by sometimes I mean kind of embarrassingly often, in my case) shoot you for a one-hit kill.\n\nThere's no difficulty select in The Fall. You just start the game and go. Once you finish it, you can start again in new game+ with a tougher difficulty, but it turns out that that just means that the enemies have more health. The enemies are found in the same numbers, and they aren't any more aware of their surroundings. They just take a fat ton of shots to kill, which, if you're stealthing, should never even be a factor.\n\nYou can also go anywhere as soon as you get to the hub area. Anywhere at all that's accessible from that hub. There are no plot significant reasons keeping you from wandering into a place where you don't need to go yet, and murdering everything inside. In fact, the final minutes of the game can be made easier if you head through the area ahead of time and hack things and shut stuff down awhile.\n\nThere are visual glitches. The mouse tends to linger onscreen for a bit too long after closing anything that makes it appear, like ebooks and computer screens. Takedown animations have the worst of it, though. But as this doesn't really affect the gameplay and you'll be watching the same couple animations over and over again anyways, I find it more amusing than annoying.\n\nShooting is mostly from the hip-ish, which isn't as big of a problem as it sounds. You just have to get used to aiming better. Or, you know, forego guns and knock people out. Grenades aren't fun to aim, though. I usually save before throwing one because I know I'll probably miss once or twice.\n\nAlso, I don't entirely understand one major mechanic of hacking, which is that sometimes I can hack a node that's been taken over by the red node's creeping influence, but other times I can't. I wasn't able to figure out what decides this before I had enough praxis points in hacking that I never had to cross the problem again, anyways.\n\nApparently there were microtransactions in the iOS version, but those have thankfully been removed, here (unlike, say, Halo: Spartan Assault which hates you and wants you to know it). The persistent store still remains, and you can buy items at anytime with in-game currency, rather than finding a character in the hub to buy from. This can make things easier when you're low on snacks or booze (which I actually usually was, as I found it fun to drink ten bottles of beer and then pretend the audio was funky because I was having war flashbacks), but if you're smart you won't need to buy anything other than extra praxis kits because why be a human with a gun when you can be an invisible superhuman with the ability to shiskebab two low-paid hotel guards with families at the same time?\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall can be fun if you're not expecting another Human Revolution DLC. It's lower quality in most aspects, but it's still worth a play. There's less detail than you might hope, but there was honestly more than I had expected, considering its original platform. The levels don't feel empty, things proceed quickly and can be as actiony as you'd like them to be. Unlike, say, Halo: Spartan Assault, where everything is slow and boring and levels are like three minutes long with twelve enemies to kill. It has a few social battles, it has some variety in action locations, and the writing and plot aren't awful (though the voice acting sometimes is). I do personally think that the game might have been better suited to being mission-based, rather than having a Human Revolution-styled hub. It's neat, but if you're going to make this mobile, I'd just like to jump in and out of some stealth, you know?\n\nAlso, I feel like I should mention that this is not a complete story. It ends on a to be continued, which is a bit of a bummer as I doubt whether we'll ever actually see another installment (which would have taken us to Australia, where I've been wanting to go in one of these ever since first reading about the Australian War in Icarus Effect).\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall is decent enough. If you can find it for $2.50, or maybe even $5 if you're feeling adventurous, it'll work off its debt. And for the love of J.C. Denton, don't buy Halo: Spartan Assault.

Most of these were written by people who played Human Revolution and compared it to that-- or who dinged it for not being sufficiently complete.  Of course it's not going to be as good, or as complex, or as satisfying.  But for the price point, it gave me the opportunity to return to the Deus Ex world for a little augmented stealth fun while I wait for Mankind Divided.  It's basically a simplified, possibly even dumbed-down Deus Ex.  But it still the same world and *feels* like Deus Ex.\n\nSo if you're looking for an HR experience, note the following differences:\n- No jumping or lifting!  But oddly, you get used to it.  You stop wanting to jump on every crate or move it to access a secret area and get your explorer XP.\n- No vendors.  You basically can buy anything anywhere just by going to a particular screen.  Yes, I'm sure that shows its mobile in-app purchase roots.  What this also means is no *selling*, so having to run around picking up and selling every gun for extra credits.\n- Infinite inventory.  Packrats rejoice.  Coupled with "no vendors," you permanently have anything you pick up, unless you consume it.\n- Bodies disappear after a few seconds.  No having to drag them around the corner and hope they don't mysteriously switch to dead during your Pacifist play-through.\n- No boss fight!  Depending on what you thought of the boss fight (especially in the original DX:HR), you might consider this a good thing.\n\nSome of these changes may seem jarring.  It really is a dumbed down Deus Ex: HR, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.  As long as you go in knowing this, you can actually enjoy the game.  Because here are some things that *are* like DX:HR:\n- Play with stealth or with guns.\n- Lethal and non-lethal takedowns.\n- Hacking minigame almost the same\n- Rummaging through trash looking for credits or beer.  ;-)\n- Augs are a subset of DX:HR, but most are there.  Hacking, stealth, social enhancer, armor, cloak, aim stabilizer, etc.\n- Art style...graphics looked fine to me, not as good as DX:HR of course but still "credible."\n- Writing: main/side quests are in the same vein, as are NPC interactions and dialog trees.\n- Trading cards and achievements.  Easier to 100% than HR.\n\nSo give it a shot.  Then maybe replay DX:HR one last time (or even Solarix-- look it up) before Mankind Divided comes out.","January 28","true","30.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

For me, the story and gameplay are decent, but the combat and controls -mainly the responsiveness in the menus- leave a lot to be desired. Obviously most of this has do to with the fact that its a port, from mobile devices, and a very poor one at that. I also didn't like how atleast as far as i could tell you are unable to sell things you don't want/need anymore, and there is no jumping, though you don't really need it, as there is nothing to jump onto, you can do some slide move to get over some obstacles. The cover mechanic and the controls surrounding that are quite poor as well.\n\nTL:DR: Yes I reccommend this game, BUT only if its on sale or something, overall a short game and being a poor mobile port, not worth the $10 price tag. I believe i got it from the last humble bundle along with Deus Ex, Invisible War and HR, among others.","October 26, 2014","true","11.4"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","3"

I've also never written a review for a Steam game before but felt I had to re: this one. I don't remember what the original price was for this game but it must have been high because I can think of no other reason for the rabidly-bad reviews. Either that or it was heavily patched by the time I bought it. I actually put off buying this for a while due to these reviews which I shouldn't have.\n\nFrankly, the game isn't THAT bad...I actually like it, for what it is (a tablet port). And I think that's the problem...everyone bought it expecting Deus Ex: Human Revolution 2 (which, of course, there is no way a game like this could be...again, it's a TABLET PORT) and then got all ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off thinking they were cheated some how. For what it is and for what I purchased it at ($4.99), it's exactly what I was expecting and is a lot of fun, which is all I ask for in a game. I wouldn't buy it for $59.99 but I would have paid more than I did...say in the $15.00 range. The ONLY thing they definitely should have changed was the single save game...a bit risky and a strange design decision...but I haven't had an issue with it yet. But for $5.00, it's a steal.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cannonaire/recommended/258180/","Cannonaire","Dr. Cannonaire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cannonaire/","128 products in account","Deus Ex: The Fall is fun in the same way as the other Deus Ex games.\n\nAt least, it is for me. Deus Ex: The Fall is a short, but good, discrete portion of Deus Ex gameplay. If you have played any of the other Deus Ex games, this one is like an open-world segment of the other ones (e.g. Hong Kong in the original or Cairo in Invisible War.) The area is full of hidden things to find and side-quests to complete, and follows the Deus Ex tradition of allowing you to decide how to proceed from point A to point B. That said, if you are looking for a challenge, you will not find it in this game. Even though it was still very fun, it was ridiculously easy. I had no trouble finishing all of the achievements.\n\nI am likely not a great judge of story quality, but it seemed coherent and easy to follow. The quests made sense within the context. Some of the voice acting was great, specifically the roles reprised from other entries in the series. Much of the voice acting was not so great though - I would say about on par with the original game or Invisible War.\n\nThe pacing is much quicker than the other Deus Ex games, but this is to be expected due to the scope of the game. You can easily unlock almost everything you want in one playthrough, and you can start a new game+ and keep your augs and inventory. Speaking of which, the inventory system is a bit different. Instead of arranging your items on a grid or giving you a limited number of slots, you are simply able to carry everything at once. I never played the mobile version of the game, but I suspect this is influenced by micro-transactions. Thankfully, there are no microtransactions in the PC version. The game must also be applauded for allowing you to skip lengthy cutscenes after your first time.\n\nThe gameplay and action are very much like Human Revolution, but I found the controls to be much more responsive. There was no input lag that I could detect. I set my mouse sensitivity to the lowest in-game setting and it felt about right (my mouse is 1800 DPI), but it doesn't give you fine control, which may put off those who measure and use the exact same sensitivity in all FPS games. There is no 'jump' button in the game, which feels slightly unsettling, but you are able to hop over certain obstacles. To put it bluntly, it is difficult to perform this maneuver with any consistency. I also do not know of any way to disable the view-bob, but it is not nearly as bad as it was in HR. Aside from those two complaints, the movement was fantastic and the game just works.\n\nOh yeah... except that there is no way to remap any of the controls. I know this is a tablet/smart phone port, but for a PC game this is heinous. I was able to use a utility to change my keyboard key bindings and force my preferred controls, but such a step is fairly technical and should not be necessary in the first place.\n\nThe game looks rather good for a mobile port. The textures are fairly low-res, the geometry is simple, and the animations are a bit stiff, but everything looks consistent. There were no elements in the game world that stood out as far more or far less detailed than others, which importantly gave everything a cohesive look; it can hardly be overstated how much this improves the look of a game. The Fall supports MSAA, which is far better than the post-process AA you are stuck with for Deus Ex: Human Revolution. I was able to force 16x Anisotropic Filtering and 8x SGSSAA using nVidia Inspector with no glitches, and the game looked much better. I had no framerate issues at these settings on a GTX 460, which never dropped below 75FPS (VSync on).\n\nI had a lot of fun playing Deus Ex: The Fall. It was fun in the same way the other games were fun for me - it scratched that Deus Ex 'itch' I guess would be a good way to put it. I definitely got $9.99 of entertainment out of it and I was happy to have more Deus Ex. I highly recommend The Fall to Deus Ex fans.\n\nGood:\n- It feels and plays like Deus Ex\n- I experienced no bugs or crashes in over 17 hours of play\n- No microtransactions\n- MSAA support\n- Consistent graphics make the game look better than the sum of its parts\n\nBad:\n- It's short, with an unresolved story\n- Extremely easy\n- No control remapping\n- You only get one save file (though you can save as often as you want after the tutorial)\n- Much of the voice acting is mediocre\n\n*EDIT*\nI did run into a single interface bug in which two screens overlapped. I believe one was to enter a code for a lock and the other was for quickload, and I had to exit the code screen, which was underneath, before I could use the top window to reload. This only happened a single time for me though.","April 5, 2014","true","19.8"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

What is this? I pre-ordered (something I NEVER do) simply because I was excited to see any kind of expansion on the Deus Ex universe but what on earth is this? The voice acting sounds like it was done by a bunch of disinterested hobos on heroin chilling in an empty dumpster. It lags like old Call of Duty games over a wifi connection blocked by a wall of lead.\n\nThe forced tutorial: What?? It holds your hand like a parent of a developmentally disabled child being taught to walk on its own. It's ridiculous. I had to restart the game several times because it refuses to respond to my mouse clicks. "Click here", oh okay Deus Ex I'll play your little game (pun intended) and click the button to equip the silencer to the rifle. Wait you dont want me to click there? You won't let me? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME? And the graphics, it literally looks like they hired a blind 8 year old to make this game with MS paint. Beyond that the story is so vague and stupid that it doesnt even succesfully expand upon the universe.\n\nThere is literally nothing good about this game. It feels like they had a bunch of pieces of Human Revolution from the pre-alpha stage left over and stitched them together and decided to release it in the hope that they could trick people like me into buying it out of fandom. Congratulations Square Enix, you got me, you really did. You pulled a fast one on me and its my own fault for being so dumb as to pre-order a game. Complete waste of time and an insult to the series.

It looked very good on the screenshots, just like Human Revolution.\nIn full resolution however, this impression was quickly destroyed. The characters look stiff and aside from the high-res textures, like from a 1999 game. The animation is just as bad, enemies are sliding around instead of moving, and shooting them causes almost no reaction. Except that they fall over when they die, but this happens with a slight delay, so it's very hard to tell if you've actually scored a hit.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the voice acting is mediocre at best, and some of it is outright terrible.\nI was put off by the game so badly that I didn't even want to dive into the story.

It was not until I was about two minutes into the game that I realized that it was originally developed for mobile devices. Now with that tweak I would forgive certain faults, lower graphics, limited menu options, and a user interface that was a bit off for a PC game. All of these were faults the game contained but I can forgive. The reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the sloppy scripts and even worse voice acting. I have read that the game is supposed to have a good storyline. Maybe it does if you can get past the miserable delivery. The characters all sound like they are looking at a piece of paper and reading their scripts line by monotone line as if they were reading a book rather than trying to act. All of the depth that Human Revolution had seems to have been stripped away needlessly in the making of this game. I could go on and on, but I will leave it at this: I am sad to see another Deus Ex game go the way of Invisible War.","March 20, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MidnightFlash/recommended/258180/","MidnightFlash","Pergeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MidnightFlash/","282 products in account","I'm a newbie to the Deus Ex franchise, but I will say I love it. I started with Deus Ex: HR, and I'm planning on working my way through all the games.\n\nThat said, this is kind of a mixed bag of a game. I'll break it down:\n\nLength: 3/5.\nThis game is an iOS port, meaning it's shorter than the average game, but in its defense, longer than the average iOS game. I was rather surprised by the sudden ending/cliffhanger, so be forewarned. Overall meh for PC, but understandable.\n\nReplay Value: 2/5\nThere is something to be said about the replayability value of an old fashioned skill-tree. This game does a good job of that, and the lethal/nonlethal gameplay adds to it. The story leaves much lacking if you have any skill at this sort of thing because, honestly, it wasn't hard to get everything aced. Overall, for alternate playstyles it might be fun, but I wouldn't invest my time.\n\nStory: 4/5\nThis isn't up to the standards I hold for games, which are admittedly very high for a story-driven franchise like Deus Ex. However, this is a great "episode" style story that really gets the feel of whats going on in a condensed form. I like it, and I don't have the qualms with it I had about Deus Ex: HR. Over all, above average, and exceptional considering it was intended for iOS.\n\nControls: 1/5\nEver play Dark Souls with a keyboard? Absurd right? You'll beg for that when this game is done with you. My mouse would skip around (likely an issue with centering code...) so that I was often turning in massive skips and stutters. This wouldn't happen in menus, but in menus the mouse clicks were subject to motion cancel (in other words a click with a minor drag cancels the click) likely as a result of iOS tap vs swipe code. It seems like they gave the imput code to one intern over a month and took what he had and taped it on there. Its playable (which is why it doesn't get a 0) but be careful in a firefight or you might accidentally shoot a wall to your left instead of an enemy in front of you. That, and you might start bashing your keyboard into your monitor if you have a tendency to swipe your mouse while you click; trying to hack with that.... is frustrating.\n\nGameplay: 4/5\nDisregarding controls, the gameplay felt much like a simplified HR, something I can respect. The various shops are relatively cheap, and honestly you can get far more than enough credits by the end (I had all the guns I wanted, plenty of ammo/augs, and 20k+ credits, IIRC) likely as a leftover from the microtransactions system. Other than that minor qualm (that actually helps newer players, so I don't complain) I enjoyed it. The only issues with gameplay came from controls, and one annoying AI glitch; the robots tend to ignore enemies that are not directly in front of them. And I mean directly. It didn't hurt all that much, and I only encountered it once, so overall, I'd say a pretty good system.\n\nOverall: 3/5\nCrap controls and a short story combine to make this a frustrating to play (but enthralling none-the-less) addition to the Deus Ex franchise. I liked the story and the gameplay system, so I kept playing, but the controls and replayability, as well as the minor glitches and short storyline, punished me for liking it. All in all, worth $10, but barely.","March 30, 2014","false","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Visually the game sucks in comparison to what was seen in Deus Ex HR. Character animation is rightout cheap, it looks static and lifeless, models and textures of weapons and characters are low resolution and particle effects are crappy to non-existent. Menus work poorly or not at all, the worst part: controls cannot be remapped at all, gamepads don't work for most people, if not for everyone, even though the game explicitly says "full gamepad support".\n\nStory and general dialog are badly written and don't even come close to what one would have expected from a game bearing this title.\n\nThe gameplay feels more like a linear scripted shooter, with the option of using a very inconvenient and sadly obsolete active cover system. Enemies move around like sticks, guns don't show any recoil and feel very static (NPC guns included).\n\nThe only positive thing I can say about it so far is this: The soundtrack isn't too bad ... but that's pretty much it.\n\nSo, a rather disappointing experience, I heavily suggest not buying the game if you liked Human Revolution. This thing is something completely different and unworthy of your time.\n\nI will play it through once, but just because I've already paid for it. It would require some heavy patching to make this thing into anything even remotely "good".","April 1, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It looked very good on the screenshots, just like Human Revolution.\nIn full resolution however, this impression was quickly destroyed. The characters look stiff and aside from the high-res textures, like from a 1999 game. The animation is just as bad, enemies are sliding around instead of moving, and shooting them causes almost no reaction. Except that they fall over when they die, but this happens with a slight delay, so it's very hard to tell if you've actually scored a hit.\nIf that wasn't bad enough, the voice acting is mediocre at best, and some of it is outright terrible.\nI was put off by the game so badly that I didn't even want to dive into the story. Maybe I'll get back to it when I'm very bored, but as the game is now, it feels like I just wasted 10 bucks.","March 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was not until I was about two minutes into the game that I realized that it was originally developed for mobile devices. Now with that tweak I would forgive certain faults, lower graphics, limited menu options, and a user interface that was a bit off for a PC game. All of these were faults the game contained but I can forgive. The reason I cannot recommend this game is because of the sloppy scripts and even worse voice acting. I have read that the game is supposed to have a good storyline. Maybe it does if you can get past the miserable delivery. The characters all sound like they are looking at a piece of paper and reading their scripts line by monotone line as if they were reading a book rather than trying to act. All of the depth that Human Revolution had seems to have been stripped away needlessly in the making of this game. I could go on and on, but I will leave it at this: I am sad to see another Deus Ex game go the way of Invisible War.","March 20, 2014","false","1.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The controls are bad, the graphics are bad, the animations are bad, the interface is bad. N-Fusion seem to have done nothing to fit the game to the PC experience besides "make it run", which considering it's running on the Unity engine was pretty much a given.\n\nControls are locked down to developer specs, which includes jamming your entire non-weapon quickbar including active augmentations on the 'F' key.\n\nThe graphics are obviously still expecting you to be running this on a mobile device, with resolution and windowed/full-screen being the only graphic options. Do yourself a favour and run it in windowed at smallest resolution, because anything else just smears the texture pixels out more, it doesn't add any form of clarity.\n\nThe only animations that look right are the robots, because at least they're meant to look unliving (or is this commentary on the augmented state?), everyone else just sort of slides around the room making vague leg-stepping motions. Namir and his cohort are particularly glaring here, as his mesh is obviously blockily animated and low-poly (dat elbow bend), WHEN THEY ALREADY HAD ACCESS TO A HQ MESH OF HIM FROM DE:HR. Why not just reuse that?\n\nThe UI seems to be about brute forcing knowledge into your brain as bluntly as possible. Pop-ups indicating usable objects seeem to cover a quarter of the screen, usually obsuring the thing they're indicating. The tutorial is particularly bad for locking out other controls until you do whatever it is you're being instructed about now, even if those other controls are things like "walking" or "crouching to avoid being spotted".\n\nUltimately, it comes across as being a game made for PC or console, with the corners cut-off and ground down so it could fit on a mobile, which they then stretched out on a rack so it could fit on a PC again. If you want a Deus Ex play style, play Deus Ex: HR again, you won't find it here. If you want more story from the Deus Ex universe, go read the wiki.","March 23, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story has some tie-ins but overall is extremely poor. I mentioned the graphics before, they're not good and it's certainly not an "HD" port.

The sloppy nature of the port of the mobile game hampers the playability and enjoyability of this game.  The graphics are unbecoming of a modern PC's cability (or that of one five years ago).  The controls are rigid and unresponsive, and the gunplay is spetacularly poor.  Bullets seem to not register damage with half of the hits, and enemies unwittingly walk to you as easy fodder during battles.  That said, those dedicated to stealth only gameplay will find a variety of options to play through the game without needing to fire a single bullet.  I did find the exploration of the game world satisfying, and hacking enthusiasts will find plenty of opportunities to hone their skills.   The minimal interaction and dialogue options with NPC's ensure a relatively linear story without meaningful choices, and the ending is an abrupt cliffhanger.

I had fun with it though.\n\nThe good:\n- Look, feel, atmosphere of Deus Ex: Human Revolution. The yellowish tints, the music, and ambient sounds are all really good.\n- Stealth gameplay is competent\n- Hacking is lifted straight from Deus Ex: Human Revolution. It worked well there and it works well here.\n- The game didn't crash on me, not once.\n- Lighting effects are very good.\n- Though the levels are small, there are still multiple ways to complete the objective\n- Augmentations are back, and greatly varied\n- Once you arrive in Panama City (where most of the game occurs), the story really improves and develops a great sense of urgency. After you get to know him a little bit, Ben Saxon is less stoic and more relatable than Adam Jensen.\n\nThe bad:\n- Unfortunately, the game is too short to really explore Ben Saxon's character. If you skip side missions and non-essential hacking, you can complete the game in 4 hours or less.\n- Stealth works well, but if you like to shoot your way out of trouble, good luck. The shooting mechanics work for occasional use, but if you like extended gunplay, you'll be frustrated quickly.\n- Levels are small. Panama City has a number of places to explore, but be prepared for lots of loading screens.\n- Lighting effects may be good, but facial animations are just awful, some of the worst I've seen. We're talking levels of animation from 10 years ago (except for Saxon). Anna Kelso in-game does not even appear close to the way she is depicted on the game banner.\n- Textures are hit and miss. Overall, the game looks good, but if you get too close to anything, well, you won't be fooled.\n- My Biggest Gripe: THIS IS ONE-THIRD OF A GAME!!! The plan was to release the story in three parts. The Fall is Part One. This is not advertised on the store page, but should be. When you reach the end (cliffhanger), you'll expect the next level to start, but instead you'll get a "To Be Continued" message. At time of writing, there is no indication that a follow-up is forth-coming.\n\nFor what we have, is The Fall a bad game though? No, not at all. It definitely felt like it belongs in the Human Revolution universe. If you want more of the Human Revolution story (this is a prequel), Deus Ex: The Fall suffices. But it's only one-third of a game. Skip it for the list price of $10; skip it at 50% off; get it when it goes to 75% off ($2.50).","January 2, 2015","true","8.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

Bought every single weapon, which take about 8 playthroughts with constant side quests (5), and you can only have a max of 10k credits...overall, I would give the game a 4/10, the animation was worse then Invisble wars, (they talk but they never looked towards each other, on top of it, constant replay of looping animation for key dialogue made me want to skip all of it, (thankfully you can skip dialogue) Voice acting was very...ok. I wish this had better camera shots for these talking parts but none of them realy blinked, or turned there head in the correct way. way to stiff, its as if the animator hadn't animated them at all... or he was the only animator (judging by the fact I could not find a list of animators except senoir animator)\n\nI actually beat the game in a speed run in about an hour, thats with all 5 side quest, lets just say, you can easly run threw the whole game, the only thing stoping you is the tutorial. However, if you where to look around and try to find the paths on your own, would probly be worth 6 hours if you took your time.\n\nThe bugs from porting from mobile are the worse part of this, I could deal (somewhat) with invisble war and the fact it crashes to desktop every hour or so, or the fact that every time invisble war loads a new map I get a breif 5 sec view of my desktop, everytime. but this one takes the cake. first was the gamepad would not go to the menu (which is important) However, Ive found that i need to use the keyboard even if the game pad buttons dont work 10% of the time. another bug was the take down animation bug. (invisble takedown enimies, background turning black, or disappearing) they would register, however, enimies would not land where they get hit, Even whole walls disappear and reappear. I actually got a bug, where the intro cinema audio would not stop while i sped threw it to get to the tutorial. even enemies would disappear as i made my way threw the larger levels.\n\nThe game works in story as a introduction, but was not enough to say wow. If this was remade with the Idea of pushing boundries, I could see this part of the deus ex universe being rather good, with better camera working, better animation, pushing the levels to more interesting and combined designs, I would even rehire the actors to give them a second chance as i do think they fit each character.  I do hope this gets a honest to god, remake, not a Port as it has potential, just not as a mobile port.\n\nBinge playing deus ex for this whole Month.\nIn order:\nDeus ex 1 - great if you overcome the graphics.\nDeus ex invisble wars - small maps, very nostolgic of deus ex 1, but god the bugs.\nDeus ex the fall - I might of enjoied it a little bit as it has the feeling of DX:HR, but it really does need icurus effect as a backing for this game.\nnow to play DX:HR\n\n\n\n","August 27, 2015","false","15.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yes, that sounds god awful if you list it up like this, and it probably is, but if you are a fan of the Deus Ex universe and you want to have a few hours of trashy fun (that hopefully isn't destroyed by a game-breaking bug), you may as well pick this one up on a sale for a few bucks.

It feels like a very watered-down version of Human Revolution. The mechanics are actually decent for a mobile game port and the shooting mechanics feel alright. The stealth can get a bit wonky as the AI is not the best (and sometimes even below mediocre). The story is just okay; I was intrigued by the mysterious Tyrants and the backstory behind the main character, but only after about and hour of being exasperated by the at-first cheesy story. You can easily avoid microtransactions of any sort (by which I mean AT ALL) simply by picking up ammo and credits and not blowing all of your in-game money on things you don't need, so I'm not sure why people are complaining about this. Overall, a pretty solid title. It plays like a compact version of Human Revolution. If it goes on sale or you see it in a Humble Bundle, like I did, then I suggest you pick it up if you are interested. Avoid it as long as the price tag is above $5.00 USD though - that's the most I'd recommend spending on this game.","November 20, 2014","true","3.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Plus its real, real, real, short.  Any non-fans of Deus Ex Human revolution should avoid this game like the plague.  DO NOT BUY unless your a die hard Deus Ex HR fan, see the HR thats critical bcause people who are Deus Ex fans but hated HR would hate this too.\n\nAll that horrible stuff aside for Deus Ex HR fans its an interesting game.  Be warned the game in parts has real bad graphics with terrible textures.  Many things are PS2 era in the level of graphics, while other things are HD, so its a weird hybrid.  The atmosphere is done perfectly along with the music.  For a mobile port its pretty impressive, there is tons of dialog, and a train that moves, the city really captures that Deus Ex feeling well.  The story ties into Deus Ex, but the letdown is this is short, as in you go to one place in Panama city for missions and thats it, the game ends.  This game was supposed to be episodic but there are currently no plans to make more episodes.  Combat in the game is done only one way right and that is with stealth, the AI seems as bad as Deus EX HR, so if you were ok with that it should work here.  The takedowns are hilarious, you will sometimes not even appear near the person you takedown, for some reason they may warp across the room, showing you taking down a ghost while in the background you may see the enemy going down.  While the bugs are funny, the game does work, it doesnt crash, Deus Ex games were always pretty bad at combat its the story and atmosphere that drive them, this game pulled that part off, but with a cliff hanger at the end of the episode and nor more planned its enjoyable just to play through the golden glory of what is Deus Ex.\n\nONLY play this with a controller, DO NOT BUY even if you are a fan if you are going to use a mouse.  The k/m controls are broken, often the screen will spin in circles, certain augs will make you constantly rubber band, yet  oddly none of that exists with a controller.  The hacking is broken with a controller yet is flawless with a mouse so gotta use both.  Sound difficult?  Then get some augs to handle what it takes to ride the cyber punk express.\n\nRating for Deus EX HR Fans:  10/10  Value:  $2.50\nRating for NON Deus Ex Fans:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","July 3, 2014","true","16.8"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

Despite that, it's still a pretty solid game for the platform it was initially released on. I bought it at launch, for my iPod Touch 5. On a small screen, it didn't work very well. I obtained an iPad Mini, and Deus Ex: The Fall worked perfectly on it. Don't let my 29 minutes of playtime fool you; I beat it several times on iOS.\n\nFor tablets, and mobile phones if you're really bored, this is a great game. For other devices, it's merely 'meh'. They promised additional content, but never delivered. The last update was in early 2014, so it's unlikely that they will ever complete this game.\n\nNow, for people really dying for Deus Ex content, this is a pretty good game. For everybody else, it's a waste of time and money. If you do want to get it, don't get it for PC or Mac or whatever; get it for Android or iOS. It's cheaper, and feels a lot more natural.\n\nWhy do I recommend it? Because I spent at least fifty hours playing it on my iPad, and it really isn't a bad game. I even used the in-game store a few times.\n\nBut anyway, if you like the Deus Ex universe you should get it. If you do want to get it, wait until it's on sale or included in a cheap bundle. If you don't like the Deus Ex universe, or have never played a Deus Ex game, don't bother with it.

However, I think this game is still recomendable for those of us die-hard Deus Ex fans. Although a much shorter (and simpler) game, it's still, in my opinion, a good game.\n\nThe graphics are inferior to those of Human Revolution, but that should be obvious, considering that this game originated as a mobile game. Even then, they managed to capture the aesthetic of HR, with all its golden glory. As far as the environment goes, the city of Panama is an interesting location to explore, although it's much smaller in scale than the hubs of DEHR.\n\nThe gameplay is also simplified. You don't need to search around for people to buy guns and/or Praxis kits from; you can do it whenever you please from the pause menu, and you also can't sell your weapons (but it doesn't matter, as money and bought weapons carry over to new playthroughs). The AI feels a bit dumb, as they'll quickly lose interest in you if you stay under cover for a short time; add to that the fact that bodies dissappear, and it makes for a much more "casual" Deus Ex experience. Even then, it's enjoyable.\n\nFinally, the story, in my opinion, is worthy of a Deus Ex game. It already starts with the main character trying to uncover a conspiracy, only to find about an even bigger conspiracy, and getting involved in it. The only downside, though, is that it ends on a cliffhanger. It seems that they intended to make this game episodic, but they abandoned that idea (probably due to the bad reception it got).\n\nStill, it's worth a shot in my opinion, I recommend it.","December 20, 2014","true","13.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

What about yours? The possibilities experienced here translated from a mobile-phone/android size screen impressed me so...making it the worthy mobile companion for Deus ex-Human Revolution.

I can't care less about the gaming community and what people think I should say about what I play, so I can honestly tell you: I enjoyed this game.\n\nFirst of all, a disclaimer: all the negative reviews made me hesitant about whether or not getting the game in the first place (that's what a Negative rating does on Steam). But I had loved DXHR, enjoyed the first Deus Ex (I'm still missing Invisible Wars, another one people are supposed to bash by default, apparently), so when I found it on sale on Humble Bundle a few days ago, I decided to buy it nevertheless.\n\nThat said, absolutely DON'T buy the game at full price. But at 2/3€ or something like that, if you're a fan, definitely buy it. At the very least, you get some quality entertainment in a world you've learned to love.\n\nAnd from the experience point of view, I was pleasantly surprised. Apart from some quirky UI controls (e.g., how you're supposed to swipe scrollable text, which makes it obvious it is a mobile port) and a couple of bugs (I had to change the vsync setting to get hacking to work) I enjoyed the game. It looks and feels very much like DXHR, even though of course in a simplified way: the game is simpler, graphics do look a bit cheaper (enemies and NPCs are often recycled, less animations in general), but the sound effects and soundtracks are great, the UI is very similar, so are the minigames, and most of the game mechanics as well. I've read around that the game falls short anytime action takes place, but I've played all Deus Ex games with stealth in mind, so I never noticed anything particularly broken.\n\nOne of the greatest critics is it's short: it took me 6 hours and a half to complete it, trying to complete as many quests as possible, which is a reasonable length I believe, especially for the price. People saying it takes 2/3 hours are rushing it, which means they never got Deus Ex in the first place. The Missing Link DLC was around there as well in terms of length. It does end in an "episodic" way, and apparently we're never going to learn how it ends, but the game does end in a more or less satisfactory way anyway, with no cliffhangers or anything like that, so I can't complain.\n\nLong story short: if you find it on sale, give it a try despite the hate: you might be surprised.","May 8","true","6.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Human revolution it definatly isn't a lot of the graphic rendering is to a much lower standard, although the enviroment is much the same, as is the way the game plays some nice side quests to keep you interested.\nThe controls however (I'm playing this on a pc) are a sack of ♥♥♥♥, to say it's clunky would be an understatement. It feels very much like this was rushed out of the door to cash in on the sucess of HR, which is a crying shame, as the game has potential.\nI hope to see more of this, it will be a shame if all the bad reviews make the devs drop the fall altogether. It definatly needs to better developed, polished like HR was.\nIf you're a Deus Ex addict like me and you don't mind swearing at the lame controls once in a while, buy it, at the stupidly low price it is now, it's a nice way to fill  4or 5 hours and feed the addiction ;)\n\nEdit. like so many people have said already, why no jump button? ok so you can sail though the game without, but i got stuck more than once in places that the freaky vault function bugged out on me.

Sure if you expect a whole new game with upto 30+ hours of gameplay you are going to be dissapointed. The game isn't perfect and it has it's share of good and bad issues. Which I shall go into.\n\nThe game runs smoothly at a pretty decent rate. (I have a plebtier PC) and there wasn't any framerates issues throughout the entire game. The game was smooth from start to finish.\n\nThe HUD is pretty clean. It's got a few obvious touch screen elements that shouldn't really be there. Drop down menu's and a rather unusual ingame store (using ingame money). Overall the HUD is better than I've seen from other ports.\n\nThe audio, the ingame music is pretty decent. Fairly similiar to Deus Ex:Human Revelution. It's very close to DXHR although it's not exactly the same. It's a very much welcome addition to somebody that enjoyed the soundtrack to Deus EX.\n\nThe voice acting is so-so. It seems to fluctuate between the characters, depending on how important or the screentime they have, The main protagonist I feel has a decent amount of quality. However the training mission instructor is absoluetly terrible. She's rather dull and boring. Speaking with one tone. Just readling lines off of a script with absolutely no emotion what so ever.\nHowever sometimes the audio in game skips and jumps. Sounds get repeated or the audio mutes itself for two seconds. I also personally found the ambient sounds to be annoying but that's just a niggle I have.\n\nThe background music was also louder than everything else. I guess they wanted to cover up the bad voice acting. Luckily you can change that in the menu settings. The setting aren't great either to be honest. It's got audio setting and reset your data but there isn't one for brightness and this game really needs that. I was bumbling along for a bit in some places.\n\nThe levels are split into short sections, this requires a lot of loading, luckily the loading only takes a few seconds but it all adds up. It could've been better but at least it's short.\n\nThe cutscenes are pausable which I haven't seen too often in games, so it's good that you are able to pause the game and it's slightly difficult to accidentally skip the cutscene if you want to resume the game. The orange glow used for items and 'hints' are still visible in the cutscenes which is really distracting and I personally find it annoying. You maybe able to overlook it though.\n\nUnless you turn the Autosave feature off. Due to the fact that there is only one save slot that both you and the autosave is supposed to use.\n\nTechnical problems.\n\nWhilst I was playing I found that the mouse would get stuck in the centre of the screen which then made it impossible to look or aim. Minimizing the game helped fix that issue.\nThe buttons in game for the menu aren't always responsive, sometimes you have to click on it more than once and some times upto 3 times.\n\nWhenever I performed a takedown the entire world would flicker and drop out (during the cutscene) this happened mostly in tight places but seemed to be entirely random.\n\nOnce you kill or knockout an enemy they just fizzle away into orange triangles and then vanish. Which makes stealthing this game so easy that it's a joke. If you are used to playing MGS on the hardest whilst going for a complete stealth run. This is going to be like 'Baby's first stealth game'\n\nThis isn't really an issue but it's pretty damn lazy, all of the animations have been recycled from DX:HR. The game also ends on a cliffhanging telling you that more is coming. Which I highly doubt by now.\n\nOveral, it's a nice little package. It's not great and it definetly has it's fair share of issues, However if you can get it cheap during a sale and you like Deus Ex, I'd suggest picking it up.","April 10, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I know there is a few of you out there looking rather shifty right now. It may be a glitchy, broken mess of a game that doesn't live up to the standard that Human Revolution set a few years ago, but I still got some enjoyment out of it. I agree that it should've been better than what we got and that we didn't deserve it, but I actually like Deus Ex: The Fall. I like that it keeps the look of Human Revolution. I like the cover system, even though Eidos broke it then put it back together with their own ♥♥♥♥, its still one of the best parts of the game. I like soundtrack and the uhh main menu is nice too? I like the ♥♥♥♥ed up FOV glitch that happens when you shoot as well. Okay, this game is ♥♥♥♥. I mildly enjoyed The Fall. Do I recommend it? Well theres no "meh" button on steam so I kinda have to don't I? But if you're a fan of the franchies, gtfo before you rage at this mess. If you like bugs however, come enjoy The Fall.

I didnt realise autosave was on in the settings and it overwrote my quicksave.\n8) Gigantic consolitis style UI elements you cant change.\n\nYou MIGHT get some enjoyment from it if you can get past all that, as even a watered down Deus Ex HR type DLC is better than half the games out there, but the sound bug is a complete game stopper.","April 3, 2014","false","12.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First of all, I am NOT one of those haters who slam all other Deus Ex games but the first one just because they don't use the same game mechanics, plot depth or what so ever. So SquareEnix's "reboot" was, in my opinion a very well produced and orchestrated Blade Runnerish type of game with a solid story and some heated ammo-wasting moments. The only downfall was the constant loading between city districts which broke the pace.\n\nNow I do not know who or why or when this aweful piece of software was bred, but if there is ONE Deus Ex franchised game you should NOT play, it's THIS garbage. Be it the graphics which look like they were created 5 years ago and only "shine" because of a recent game engine, the stereotype dialogs, the horrid level design, the pestering bugs, the gameplay mechanics which were apparently made for alien hands... I could go on and on. This game should simply NOT exist. And you do not need to own it.

In theory, a bite-sized Deus Ex story mimicking the form of Human Revolution sounds great. In practice however, The Fall is deficient in too many areas to recommend. The production values are low in terms of visuals and controls feel clunky, although I played with a controller.\n\nThe story leaves much to be desired in that it is a prequel to Human Revolution. The villains are the same ones present in Human Revolution, robbing the game of any mystery because you already know what's going to happen and you aren't going to be able to pacify these same people that Adam Jensen takes care of in Human Revolution.

The original Deus Ex that came out in 2000. I remember how amazed I was with that game back then, it just blew me off right from the start. Even today I claim it's one of the best games ever made, seriously! Its sequel was a big disappointment, while Human Revolution was a nice surprise. Now, based on my experience with Human Revolution I really expected a lot from The Fall. What I didn't know up until recently is that The Fall was originally made for mobiles - I just don't really care for mobile games. If I did, I certainly wouldn't be so excited about the new Deus Ex game since most of the mobile conversions end up being a pile of crap. Unfortunately, I was right.\n\nDeus Ex: The Fall tells a story of Ben Saxon, a former mercenary who used to work for Tyrants (the bad guys from Human Revolution) and the problem with Neuropozyne shortage. Neuropozyne is a drug that all augmented humans use to fight the body's rejection of augmentations and without it bad things may happen. Long story short, Ben goes on a mission to find a replacement drug in Panama City.\n\nThe game itself weird right from the start. After the usual tutorial mission where you learn how to move, shoot etc... you learn that you cannot jump. No jumping in 2014? In a FPS game? Seriously? You cannot even reconfigure the controls in the game at all. At all. I personally never reconfigure the controls (unless they are reeeeally awkward, which is rare and most usually ends up in me giving up such a game whose controls problem is the least of the problems it has) but such an option should be mandatory. Even shooting the enemies can be a problem, I am not even sure if the available crosshair is accurate. It seems to work fine if you zoom in on the enemy, but nothing happens if you just fire at them! Not always, but a lot of time. If you do manage to hit someone and they die - prepare for a surprise: 5 seconds later their bodies evaporate. This is a perfect spot for a smiley with big, surprised eyes, isn't it?\n\nHowever, there is a way to actually enjoy this game. Sneaking. If you decide to go into stealth mode and avoid enemies, hack consoles and hide from cameras, you are in for a much better experience. It will even earn you an achievement if you complete the game without killing anyone. It is as if the game creators are aware of how much they screwed up with the combat so they are giving you a hint on how to have more fun with their game.\n\nThe graphics are simplified from Human Revolution, which is kind of expected from a mobile game port. If you think HR had too much yellow and amber - prepare for MUCH MORE. I had a feeling I was playing a game on my Hercules Monochrome monitor I used to have in 1992 (it was one of those weird monitors that had orange and black instead of white and black). NPC models are recycled versions of each other but it's not too bad, at least for me.\n\nThere's also a plenty of bugs all over the game. I saved a game before entering combat with 2 enemy soldiers, died and reloaded. They were gone. The controls are sometimes unresponsive, especially in game menus - you click on OK or BACK or whatever, but nothing happens until you try it again. A harder mouse button push might help, no matter how illogical it may sound. What else... Ah! Hacking. In case you didn't play Human Revolution - to hack a door you need to play a mini game (shown on a screenshot) to reach a certain module before the enemy anti-hack reaches you. However, sometimes you cannot zoom out enough to actually click on the next module. I haven't found a way to fix that and I even tried changing resolutions and using a window mode.\n\nOverall, The Fall is a big disappointment for any true Deus Ex fan. It just feels cheap and not worthy of Square Enix and the games we are used to get from these guys. I know it's a conversion, but with a little effort (and less amber!) it could have been an amazing game. This way... well, I told you, it is possible to enjoy it if you play it in a very specific game, but that's not it. You should be able to pick your way through, as what we are used from Deus Ex.\n\nOh, and there is only ONE save game slot. You are warned!","April 10, 2014","false","17.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It would be fine in the menus, but in-game it would be almost impossible to play. Not framerate issues: actual sensitivity.\nA minor but still very annoying part was that, having played Deus Ex: Human Revolution, I knew how to play the game.

Let me start by saying that this isnt a fully fledged Deus Ex game, the design solely considered use on tablets and phones. Why bother coding advanced features (as seen in HR) when iOS devices of 2013 cant run them? This port is just to expand the audience slightly. Its not the greatest port as there are still some slight control issues and not being able to jump feels wierd but given its orignal design intentions there is nothing too obtrusive, think of it as Deus Ex: Lite.\n\nThe art style is the same as HR but the graphics quality is rather poor. The world certainly has the same feel as HR but its not nearly as detailed. Combat is a wee bit clunky too. The story is standard Deus Ex affair (meaning good), it focuses on the aug mercenaries that made up the boss fights in HR. Its not a perfect story though as I sometimes felt the characters had no motive to do what they were doing and the game is actually only the first part of an episodic series (no word on future installments though). Voice acting and music is very much up to par (minus the robot woman in the tutorial.) .\n\nUltimately what Im saying is that you shouldnt be expecting a game of the same standards as HR. Its Deus Ex: Lite and that is also reflected in the price. I got it on sale and I dont regret it.","January 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

IMHO: no!\n\nThe price for this game is the price you would expect for a DLC, the same goes for the length of the game. It is still a pretty nice story in the Deus Ex universe. The fact that the game was designed for iCrap at first sure brings a lot of drawbacks. Mainly technical and graphically. There are some glitches and some downsides but the game still plays along nicely. Sure the cam goes outside of the level sometimes and takedown-movies don't match what actually happens (body end up somewhere else etc.) but usually these glitches are just a bit annoying at worst but don't destroy the game for me. Surely not for the few bucks it cost. They actually made the augmentation-tree better.\n\nFor me the biggest negative point is that the game ends in a Cliffhanger "to be continued" but they never continued it. I actually would like a sequel to this game very much, but corrected for the flaws in this version. (ie: not developed for mobile in the first place). I hope they still find a satisfying end to this story in DXMD which looks as awesome as DXHR was.","February 15","true","21.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Don't expect more than that. Although the game may be simpler it does not look that bad. It is a Deus Ex world game so I am not sure what the complaints are about. It is something to nibble on until the next main game comes out. Plus, why would we complain about an episodic game if we want the next part to come out which may not now since there are so many negative reviews. That just seems idiotic to me. Let us encourage the continuance of the Deus Ex genre. I wish they would redo the original game in the new engine or a new engine. I would definately buy it. That was such a great game. So let us support this game series and with tact and friendliness submit our complaints in a professional manner so as not to discourage the company to spend money to make another.

They really kept the open levels of HR, with very few loading screens, and I love the way that you can move the bodies around, in fact I love that they stay in place and don't just disappear. The game is so responsive: it does exactly what you tell it to, allowing for some complex jumping physics. The gunplay feels so great as well. The recoil is very realistic. The game also does a good job with rebindable keys and an FOV slider, as well as colourblind options, and it even has reasonable mouse sensitivity options. The tutorial blows my mind: it does a really good job of explaining what to do and never gets in the way of gameplay, and I love the way that it is possible to buy stuff during missions away from any shops: it really helps to keep me immersed in the game's interesting and fleshed-out world, with good-looking environments that are fully 3D rendered. A stunning return to form from Eidos Montreal and a real contender for the best Deus Ex game, in fact it may even be my favourite game of this year, thanks to the interesting combat system, good AI, and varied environments.\n\nIn all seriousness though, the game is broken.

Once I was finished, I noticed that, amidst various other unplayed games in my Steam library, there sat my copy of Deus Ex: The Fall which I realized I had not played. I quickly Googled the title and on the Wikipedia page, found a few choice comments from reviewers:\n\nDon’t be fooled by the black-andgold screenshots and the familiar interface: this is not the Deus Ex you know and love. It’s a bad cover version, and truly one of the worst PC ports I’ve played in some time, and I’ve played Deadly Premonition. I definitely didn’t ask for this. -Andy Kelly (PC Gamer)\nThe controls are another culprit here; they are clunky and unresponsive in ways that a keyboard and mouse never should be. Menu buttons routinely fail to respond to repeated mouse clicks. -Daniel Hindes (Gamespot)\n-----------------------------\nRead online at http://www.petersaysstuff.com/2015/06/why-everyone-is-wrong-about-deus-ex-the-fall/\n-----------------------------\nAfter reading the comments, I decided to play it. After completing the game (yes, I did search every nook and crany) I’m here to tell you one thing: all those negative reviews are wrong. While not Human Revolution quality, Deus Ex: The Fall was, for a game ported from mobile devices in a short time-span, very solid.\n\nPlot\nDeus Ex: The Fall tells the story of Ben Saxon, a British soldier who’s squad died in a sabotaged mission and who was recruited into the Tyrants (Jaron Namir‘s gang of baddies that you end up fighting in Human Revolution), and Anna Kelso, an enigmatic former US Secret Service agent who survives a massacre and, in searching for the killers, loses her job and is on the run from the Tyrants. Saxon and Kelso, on the run from the Tyrants, are hiding out in a safehouse when the effects of the 2027 neuropozyne (Nu-Poz) shortage become too much and Saxon must find more Nu-Poz for him and Kelso. Along the way, Saxon finds that there is an alternative to Nu-Poz: Riezene. Riezene appears to function just as well, but hasn’t been approved yet. During Saxon’s investigation, he is required to complete various quests from a doctor at a local LIMB clinic to find out how the Riezene is getting on the streets. Saxon finds out that the company developing Riezene, Zaaphire Biotech, is leaking the drug an the victims from overdoses and “street trials” are sold to Belltower. After witnessing the assassination of a WHO investigator by Saxon’s supposedly dead squadmate, Sam Duarte, he bugs out and meets up with rouge Belltower VTOL pilot Alex Vega. After clearing her takeoff, they leave Panama City and head to Zaaphire Biotech’s headquarters in Australia while Kelso hides and helps from afar.\n\nThe game ends with Duarte and Jaron Namir apologizing to Bob Page for failing to kill Saxon and Kelso. Duarte vows to kill the rogue Tyrant before he can cause any more trouble. The screen then cuts to a “To be continued” card, hinting at another game starring the couple. (x)\n\nPros and Cons\nI played the game for a solid 5 hours; not as much as some, but more than others. After my game play, I have compiled the following list of pros and cons…we’ll start with cons first.\n\nCons:\n\nSub-par combat mechanics — can’t aim down sights, limited weapon choice, when in cover can’t draw weapon without firing, etc.\nNot optimized for PC — terrible character models, can’t jump, taking cover is a pain, no difficulty setting, reload animations are laughable, etc.\nGlitches — falling through the floor into the abyss, takedowns place NPCs in walls where they can’t be accessed, etc.\nMost of the mechanics — hacking is terrible, AI is predictable, etc.\nPros:\n\nStory line parallels Human Revolution’s, story stays engaging, questions remain and compartmentalization of knowledge stays true to DX’s history, etc. (More on this later)\nCharacter development and interaction is nuanced and waiting to be fleshed out in a sequel\nAtmosphere\nI’m sure there are others, but I wanted to make a relatively short list because, let’s all agree, the mechanics are very sub-par and I won’t dispute that. I, however, want to focus on the mechanics being solid for a quick port as well as the engaging storyline.\nWhy I Can Deal With The Mechanics\nDeus Ex: The Fall was originally released for iOS and Android before making its way to the PC. This meant that the controls were programmed for the god-awful “console” that is the iPhone. After that, they were slightly tweaked for Android, but could largely remain unchanged. Following that, the game was rush-released for the PC giving very little time for extensive overhaul. How can I tell this? The iOS release was on 7/11/13. The Android release was 6 months later on 1/22/14…and the PC release was not even 2 months later when it became available on 3/18/14! The developers had half a year to optimize the game for Android and then less than 2 months to change everything for the PC release.\n\nThe timeframe alone doesn’t excuse the mechanics, but it does make me sympathetic and with the strong story, I am confident in saying that the quick port was solid for what it was. It was never meant to be a Human Revolution; most likely it was a side project by the developers that turned into a fun game.\n\nStory\nThis is where I think the game really excels and where I am willing to say that I want a sequel. The story leaves us with questions that need answers. Why is Zaaphire leaking the drug? What is Belltower doing with the victims? How did Sam survive the ambush? Was Sam a part of the Tyrants before the ambush? Why do the Tyrants report to Bob Page? How does the Nu-Poz shortage and Saxon’s rampage affect the canon of Human Revolution? What happens to Kelso? Where does Vega go? I could keep going, but I’m sure you get the idea.\n\nThe point is, The Fall is akin to the first Detroit visit in Human Revolution — the player is left with questions that are slowly answered in coming levels — the issue, however, is where Human Revolution continued, The Fall has died.\n\nI say, make a sequel to The Fall and release it between now and when Mankind Divided comes out! That will satisfy fans and keep the buzz alive. Remember, you #cantkillprogress!","June 28, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/recommended/258180/","thelolrusgamer","The Lolrus Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelolrusgamer/","176 products in account","Let me start with this. Ignore the majority of the unhelpful negative reviews!\n\nThis game seems like it was an incredible game for Mobile, and it is still a good game on PC.\n\nThe gameplay is so close to Deus Ex: Human Revolution that it felt like I was playing some kind of DLC or expansion to DX:HR(which is a good thing)! There was some changes to the gameplay, as you would expect as it was originally a mobile game, but overall the gameplay was entertaining. The most disappointing part, however, was the fact that bodies disappear, so you can not hide them to stop enemies finding them. Instead, guards have about 5 seconds to have a chance at noticing body and after that they are unable to.\n\nThe story was quite interesting and entertaining. I am however disappointed in the game as it ends with a "To be continued..." and yet it seems the devs thought, "Ah, you know what? Screw it!". Perhaps the game didn't take off very well (the ridiculous amount of over the top criticizing reviews seem to back that up), or/and the devs just cancelled it. Or, maybe we are going to have to wait a ridiculous amount of years to continue it (which is very unlikely. It has most likely been cancelled, which is a shame as it was great fun while it lasted).\n\nThe graphics are decent. If they were like this on mobile, then they did a fantastic job. The game seems to run incredibly well on high settings, so I thinks it safe to assume that most modern PC and perhaps even Laptops could run it (yet to try my old laptop yet, but I may).\n\nThe sound and voice acting is fairly good. The sounds are mostly recycled from DX:HR, any new ones aren't fantastic. However, the voice acting on the other hand, is fairly good. The majority of named characters are voiced at a good standard, however the un-named character are mostly voiced poorly. Ben Saxons voice actor sounds quite bad at the very beggining, however, he soon sounds better.\n\nOh, and there is only one save file... Yeah... Only one... That's pretty much the only negative thing I have to say about this though, and it's not that much of an issue.\n\nOverall, I give this a 7/10.\n\nPros:\nAlmost completely mirrors the gameplay of Human Revolution, and therefore feels like an expansion rather than a new game (which is a good thing!).\nAwesome main character (like every other Deus Ex game).\nInteresting story.\nDecent Graphics.\nMostly, good quality voice acting.\nStays true to the Deus Ex franchise.\n\nCons:\nNot much new. Now I know it was a mobile game, but they could have got some slightly new stuff.\nNew sounds are quite naff.\nUnfinished story/disappointing cliff hanger. And it doesn't look like it's going to continue anytime soon.\nOne save file. Now that is just annoying!!! D:< xD\n\nAnyway, like me, you should ignore all the bad reviews and give it a shot yourself! I bought the entire Deus Ex collection and this was the first one I played (I have of course played some of the other Deus Ex games in the past (DX1 and DX:HR)), because I wanted to try it for myself. Give it a shot! You, hopefully, won't regret it. (Although, I'd get it on sale if I were you, it's definitely not worth £8.00. Mainly because the story is unfinished.)","November 30, 2014","true","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

While I'm not graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, Icarus animation is a dissapointment and since you can't climblike in DX:HR, that skill is practically useless and you see it only in two cutscenes. Lame! Yes, this means level design also got hurt and is not nearly as good as in DX:HR.\n\n4. The game on me was 9 hours long - explored everything, killed nothing and left no stone unturned. No, it's not I'm complaining on the total playtime, for only 10€ it's okay. However, once you finish it, instead of THE END, it says: TO BE CONTINUED.

I find playing with a touch screen unbearable so I was happy to see this show up on Steam.  It's basically a stripped down HR originally made for portable devices and as such has some notable sacrifices compared to HR.  The AI is bad, the controls can be clunky and the visuals are below average.  That said, the visuals are very similar in art style to HR and IMO get the job done just fine.  The game includes a single hub roughly the size of one from HR.  If you enjoyed the hacking, stealth and story telling from HR then you may very well enjoy this too.  The combat is mediocre at best but I found the story surprisingly good.  The voice acting is adequate although not top tier by any stretch.  The game took me approximately 4.5 hours to play through which includes some but not all side quests.  My biggest complaints don't really have to deal with the core game itself and more its port to PC.  There's really no excuse for no key rebinding, regardless of being a mobile port.  The most annoying thing is the how unresponsive mouse clicks can be for the UI.  I'd be nice if you could adjust the FOV, but the default is resonable in 16:9.  Since I never played the mobile release I was happy just to see it available on PC.  Considering its origins, I think it's pretty decent.  I don't know what some people expected out of a $10 mobile port (that comes with a free $7 game).  If you're a DX fan and don't have ridiculous expectations you might have some fun with this.  For $10 I think it was easily worth it for 5 or so hours of game time.  I'd give it a 6/10 as a DX fan.","March 25, 2014","true","6.5"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

It has its faults certainly and I shall get the negative parts out of the way first before stating why I believe this game should be played. For starters it is clearly a port from a phone. The controls feel a bit off and it doesn't look any where near as good as a game relelased on PC in 2014 should look. There are jarring glitches such as when you do a melee takedown on someone whilst you are in cover and suddenly you are two metres from the corner to perform the cinematic takedown. The uncertainity of whether the AI will spot you, sometines you walk right in front without them noticing yet other times you are across the room with them facing in the other direction and they swing around shooting at you. There are optional micro transactions but they are certainly not required to play at all (I built my character exactly as I wanted to no problem) so I don't see them as an issue.\nNow to list the redeeming qualities: it feels like a Deus Ex game. What I mean is the story, setting and protaganist all certainly feel like they are part of that universe. It's dialogue and the story itself are well written, the characters are engaging. *Slight spoiler alert* I wanted to know what happens next when the game finished to see where the story went next as well as as the next location was being heavily hinted at being Australia, a place I haven't explored in video game form (even though it would be a futuristic one of course).\nAll in all I believe you should play this game if you enjoy the world of Deus Ex and want to explore another part of it.

I enjoyed that game. Going through this game. It felt very much the same. It has the same feel and the amount of places you can go and the stuff you can do. I really enjoyed the amount of work put into this. I highly recommend it if you enjoyed the Deus Ex series. It felt like a homage to the older games. It's a bit short but its one of the few games I really liked playing through. It was quite fun. There is definitely a lot of story in it as well. I'd buy more if they came out with the DLC to extend the story a bit. If they could make the game as long as the first portion of it is. I'd be very much happy. Anywho, that's all I can say. The controls take time getting used to but they don't really hinder the game that much. So all those reviews are from hardcore gamers who complain about all those really small things. I noticed some bugs but before you stop playing. Just wait and fiddle around with the controls and you'll eventually unstuck. That only happened to me during the prologue right before the laser beam thing that you gotta walk through. You have to set your ability to the quickslot via holding Right Bumper and setting it and then using it. (It took me time since it doesnt' mention how to slot it in quickslot). Great game, It was worth my money. Oh, the game overall took me roughly 8 hours (just by walking around and exploring amongst doing the missions and side quests). I might also add, only do one side quest at a time. I'm honestly certain if you take on a new mission. It cancels out the first side quest you've started.","November 17, 2014","true","15.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

When I wrote this I wholeheartedly meant every word, but the sad truth is.. I also hoped the developers wouldn't abandon it, but they did, and worse than just abandoning is the fact that they've categorically made a point of ignoring and avoiding any questions relating to Episode 2.\n\nI don't care who is to blame, the end result is; do not purchase this game. Do not. Neither the developers nor the publishers deserve a penny from this and I sure as hell won't trust them again in the future either.\n\n--------------------ADDENDUM-----------------\n\nPeople complaining that it "didn't perform well"; utter nonsense. It ran a flawless 60 with max AA on my 570 SLi and it only used ONE of them, never going over 60% usage -- if you want to see a terrible Unity game, go play Might & Magic X. The Fall was far from great, but for a Unity engine Android/iOS port? I've seen and played worse. The failings of this game were mostly engine and platform based, it came from mobile devices which are famous for having less complex and involved games *for the most part* (there are exceptions, to be sure) as well as being hamstrung by low specification hardware. Performance was perfect, as is to be expected, and the controls were absolutely fine with the exception of the missing jump command (really devs?) Vanishing bodies can easily be blamed on the low memory of mobile devices, so perhaps that should have been tweaked for the desktop version to keep bodies around.\n\nThe models were low quality, the animations were low quality and the overall feel of the game felt like it was low budget .. but they still managed to nail the DXHR atmosphere and the visuals, models/animations notwithstanding, were very impressive considering it's a mobile game. Plot was engaging and the game still managed to pack in all the DXHR standard gameplay elements. It was just too short and didn't offer any challenge whatsoever, being incredibly easy and forcing all the "aids" to be permanently enabled, the removal of the inventory and addition of a cash-shop (albeit using ingame credits and not foisting a real money cash shop as they do on the mobile game) does it no favours either. All in all, I'd say TB's video (and a lot of public opinion) has been overly critical and slightly unfair, but I do understand that this had a high pedigree to live up to and simply failed to do so. I really do hope the developers don't decide to give up on the game as I'm certainly wanting to finish the story with the follow up parts.\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, actually, though keep in mind that it's a hollow and substantial step down from the "big boy" original, so adjust your expectations accordingly. Good story, great atmosphere, just too easy and far too short - seeing as how it's episodic. Let's just hope the developers don't abandon the game.","April 2, 2014","false","8.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/recommended/258180/","DeltaBladeX","DeltaBladeX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeltaBladeX/","4044 products in account",""Not quite Deus Ex: The Fail, but still leaves a lot to be desired"\n\nThis game has received a lot of hate from fans of the Deus Ex series, as it was originally a game made only for mobile devices, and when it did finally get a PC port from the developers, it has not gotten much praise from the fans, for both the quality of the port and the core game. While I don't hate it, it still has a number of problems that make it the worst in the series.\n\nStory\nAs a follow up to the book, this could already lead to some confusion for players, but it can be played without reading that first. The game starts off with you on a mission as part of a Black Ops team sent to assassinate one of the people responsible for the deaths of your previous squad mates. Not long after though, you find the circumstances resulting in their deaths were not what you have been told, and result in you going into hiding. The rest of the game has you doing various missions in order to get medication to help deal with your augmentations. The story itself doesn't really hook the player unfortunately, and has little of interest other than showing characters you might recognize from previous games.\n\nPresentation\nGraphics could be better. While not awful, and almost certainly better than what would have been used for the smaller mobile device screens, textures still aren't great, and even the fact that it was a port isn't an excuse, after seeing how nice some of the HD ports for 3DS and Vita games can look. Going in to the characters themselves, while they don't look great, most are at least okay. But then you have a few which I'll call goblins with their poorly constructed bodies and hideous faces. It was quite surprising considering the rest were at least decent.\n\nAudio is alright. All of the music and sound effects seem to have been taken Human Revolution, so chances are you will notice familiar tunes. Voice acting is also of decent quality. Your ears won't be bleeding while you play through this game at least.\n\nControls\nThese have been considered a major flaw of the game. While the gamepad mapping is fine, anyone who has a problem with the default keyboard and mouse layout is out of luck, as there is no options for changing how it is set up. So if you are the kind of player who likes to set up custom layouts for your fancy keyboards, feel free to avoid this game. I played through the game on a gamepad, which uses an almost identical layout as the previous game, with only a couple of changes. However, even with a gamepad, things were not all perfect, as controls during the hacking minigame are fiddly, resulting in me moving to my mouse during those parts.\n\nGameplay\nNow onto the meat of the review, and where more of the flaws shall be revealed. At heart, this plays very much like Human Revolution. You can talk, sneak, shoot and hack just like you did while playing as Adam Jensen, but now that you are Ben Saxon, a few things had to change, some of them minor while others are major changes to how the game works. For one, Ben can't jump at all. This limits some of your options, and levels reflect this lack. You won't ever see a hard to reach vent that might just need a few stacked boxes, not in this game. Not that you have the option to stack boxes at all. Yeah, you have very few chances to manipulate the locations in this game. You can break down a few walls and move a few heavy crates out of the way but little else. No more being really inventive in your choices as a sneaky character. Not that it matters much. The locations are small in scope anyway, most of the game consisting of a single hub of maps. You can do a bit of exploration, but there just isn't that much do look around. Just a few vents to sneak through, a few locks to hack open and a few crates and walls standing in the way.\n\nThe next change is a big one, this being the inventory. In The Fall, there is no limit what so ever to what you can carry. You can carry more weapons than there are enemies in the area. No more having to make a hard choice about which weapon to take with you, just bring them all. Your inventory in this game also acts as an in game shop, allowing you to purchase whatever item you might need as long as you have the credits. While I get annoyed at being forced to leave behind loot in the older games, this ruins any need for planning out your gear to maximize your chances or ensure you can carry the best selling items out of a level. Anything you need is yours with the push of a button and is sitting in your pouch of holding when you need it. On the bright side, at least the PC port doesn't include the option to pay for in game currency to make this even easier. We really don't need micro transactions here.\n\nNow onto the AI and interaction with them. Yes, I have bad news here as well. Most NPCs are brain dead idiots who will mostly ignore you. Unless an NPC is marked as an enemy on your map, they will did very little other than panic if a fight happens near by, only to forget it seconds later. After how great the previous games were with their AI from friendly and neutral NPCs, this is what I'd consider the biggest failing of this game. It used to be that walking into the women's toilets would get them to yell for security. Here, they will calmly talk to you. Hostile AI will still react to you in a matter of ways, depending on your current actions and location, but this will never be the match of any other game in the series. Even the hostile AI are easy to deal with, and the fact that non combatants won't even warn them really tones down the difficulty.\n\nLifespan\nAfter all of the problems I dropped on you during the previous section of my review, I have one more to mention. This game is short as it is currently incomplete. It seems the mobile game was designed to have episodic content, and nothing beyond the opening mission and first city at this time. You will beat it in a matter of hours, and unless you want to do New Game Plus to further power up your character and earn any missing achievements. Not really much incentive to play a second time unfortunately.\n\nClosing\nSo there you have it. While it is most certainly a Deus Ex game, much of what made the series great just didn't make it to the game, resulting in a title with little challenge and little reward, though still playable in the end. My recommendation is to wait for a heavy discount, and perhaps some news on an (unlikely to happen) update to the campaign. It certainly doesn't offer enough to be worth your money at this point. I paid $3 and still feel it could have been better for what I've spent, given that Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director's Cut can be had on Steam for as low as $5 itself.\n\n6 / 10","June 25, 2014","true","13.5"," 22 of 51 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","22","51","0","1"

It’s a port of a mobile game that continues the story from the Deus Ex novel, Icarus Effect. I don’t say all that as an excuse for it’s flaws, merely as a reference point.\n\nThe question I really want to pose to everyone is this, what made Deus Ex great? Was it the top-of-the-line Graphics?  The innovative control scheme? The Stellar Voice-acting? No, One need only play the original again to conclude that none of that is the case. Then what was it?\n\nIn my humble opinion, it is the uniqueness of the well-built world and story, coupled with the brilliant level design that are at the core of what make Deus Ex legendary, and those principles are what this game delivers on, albeit in a shorter and abruptly (though not unfitting) ending chunk.\n\nBugs and glitches are an different matter and I’ll cede that point, though I never really had any problems on either of my play-throughs.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that they could have just forgotten about us PC gamers, they didn’t have to port this game (Which, sadly enough, I have heard people in the PC world advocating for). But they did, and I for one relished the opportunity for another foray into a grim and dark world that I just can’t seem to get enough of.","March 23, 2014","true","7.1"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

Last time a Deus-Ex game got dumbed down (e.g. Invisible War) people complained... and that's even if the story was half passable and had some memorable scenes. No really, fans of Deus Ex don't like the game to be dumbed down an inch. We liked Deus-Ex for it's complexity.\n\nThe problem is that The Fall goes one step further in the dumbing down department, and aside from making the controls all but unplayable for the mouse and keyboard PC players (thank you quick-and-dirty porting department), there are aspects of the gameplay that are no longer present. Bodies now disappear in a yellow triangular matrix (no need to hide them), and my character simply doesn't seem to be able to jump. Either that, or I haven't discovered how to jump yet (thanks to the aforementioned terrible controls). Also I can't seem to scroll the node map in the hacking subgame. Seriously... what the...?\n\nReally, it is that bad.\n\nIf you liked Deus Ex Human Revolution, prepare to relearn how to play the game again. If you're a fan you'll get this anyway, but you'll feel that the game is second rate even if the story fixes some of the character development that Human Revolution skipped in it's storytelling. The game is passable only because they aren't charging much for it, and thank goodness for that.

Returning to this world was nice and made me nostalgic for more of the full game, seeing skills like stealth takedowns and the stun gun brought it back to me and I found myself crouching in corners watching green triangles for the right moment to pop out again.\n\nIt is a port though, so it is short and designed for touch screens not KB/mouse. Auto aim is in full effect, if you miss with this one you are not trying at all and the 'click to use, hold to change' on the keys often had me wasting resources. A new game plus mode afterwards makes achievement hunting easy as you can easily max out on the second run through and literaly walk in and do takedowns on whole rooms of enemies.\n\nGo in expecting a chance to play the mobile game and get a short burst of Deus Ex gaming in, and we can only hope the release on PC isn't the sign that the 'to be continued...' is now just another gaming lie.","March 24, 2014","true","13.7"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","1"

If you come a little bit of distance to this product, you should not be disappointed . Beginning of the game along with the tutorial , does not encourage , but then in Panama is just better .\n\nThe game features gameplay mechanics almost identical to its older brother , or sneaking with guards , system hacking , punching through walls , etc. Levels can go just like the original in many ways including the fact that the entire game can be completed without killing even one person . The biggest differences in the game , it is primarily a mobile shop available everywhere and at any time , making it easier gameplay too much for my taste . General simplification.\n\nGraphics although poorer compared to his older brother is pleasing to the eye and keeps the climate. Overall I would recommend , especially to fans of the universe , provided that it will approach the game from a distance .\n\nThe price is to high for one episode, buy only on sales.\n\nKnown issues that occur with me :\n\n- Sometimes the screen does not display hacking the whole map and you have to toil hard to move the screen so that we can make a successful hack .\n- Problems with the mouse sensitivity\n- The game despite the fact that theoretically supports standard Xbox controllers , you can see on my computer did an exception and the controller does not work.\n- Only one episode , I feel unsatisfied .\n\n\nRating 6/10\n\n\n\nIn Polish:\n\nPo pierwsze zanim zakupisz tą grę, bądź świadom, że jest to port z urządzeń mobilnych, nie oczekuj więc  grafiki, modeli i animacji na poziomie Deus Ex: Bunt Ludzkości. Jak już to przetrawisz i podejdziesz trochę z dystansem do tego produktu, to nie powinieneś się zawieść. Początek gry wraz z samouczkiem, nie zachęca, ale potem w Panamie jest już tylko lepiej.\n\nGra posiada mechanikę rozgrywki niemal identyczną jak jej starszy brat, czyli skradanie z użyciem osłon,  system hackingu, przebijanie przez ściany itd. Poziomy można przejść podobnie jak w oryginale na wiele sposobów łącznie z tym, że całą grę da się ukończyć bez zabijania nawet jednej osoby. Największe różnice w rozgrywce, to przede wszystkim mobilny sklep dostępny wszędzie i w każdej chwili, co ułatwia rozgrywkę zbyt mocno jak na mój gust. Ogólne uproszczenia.\n\nGrafika pomimo, że uboższa w stosunku do swojego starszego brata jest przyjemna dla oka i trzyma klimat. Ogólnie polecam, zwłaszcza fanom tego uniwersum, pod warunkiem, że podejdą do gry z dystansem.\n\nZnane problemy które wystąpiły u mnie:\n\n- Czasami ekran hakowania nie wyświetla całej mapy i trzeba się mocno namęczyć, aby przesunąć ekran tak abyśmy mogli dokonać skutecznego hakowania.\n- Problemy z czułością myszy\n- Gra pomimo tego, że teoretycznie obsługuje kontrolery w standardzie Xbox, na moim komputerze widać zrobiła wyjątek i kontroler nie działa.\n- Tylko jeden epizod, czuję niedosyt.\n\nOcena 6/10","March 21, 2014","true","10.5"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","6","20","0","0"

Being a mobile port it's not as good as Human Revolution: It's reduced and simplified in a lot of areas. Inventory management is gone and replaced with a strange in-game shop-inventory hybrid and many gameplay mechanics have been altered to try and remove elements of physics from them: Dead bodies disappear instead of the player having to hide them; objects like crates can not be picked up, instead they slide out of the way when interacted with, behaving like doors (special doors that require the heavy lifting); jumping has been removed and replaced with a vaulting-over-cover-system (which in my experience was the most buggy feature of the game).\n\nThe interface and controls bear the mark of the mobile platform in many places but it has largely been converted to work fluidly with a keyboard and mouse. The F1-F4 keys still activate augmentations, the number keys can still be assigned to hotkey inventory items (and augs as well actually), G still quickthrows grenades, etc. All that is obviously missing is (as said already) the jump button and the ability to aim down the sites (which makes the process of firing a scoped weapon a strange one and stands out as the one big issue of the controls for me). Menus are easily navigated with the mouse and all "click and drag" elements from the mobile UI are easily navigated with the mousewheel. Even things like the ability to use keypads with the numpad and backspace key are intact in this game. The controls are unfortunately not rebindable though, which is a shame, though I don't think I would have changed any of them if I had the option.\n\nControls are not as fluid as Human Revolution though after half an hour I can safely say I stopped really noticing any initial clunkiness and found the game quite mechanically enjoyable. I played mostly stealth but the few firefights I engaged in were quite fun even if, again, a bit clumsier than Human Revolution in both player control and enemy AI.\n\nAs for the story: It provides more conspiracies and betrayals as you would expect from a Deus Ex game. It's fairly typical of the series though with some rather over-exposition-y dialogue in many parts. This is also intended to be an episodic title and so this is only part of a storyline (a storyline that actually started in the Icarus Effect novel) so don't expect a conclusion here. Quite the opposite: it ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nIn almost all instances this game is basically Human Revolution in miniature with reduced functionality. It's quite sort too: It basically has the content of one hub area from Human Revolution and a similar length. How long it takes you to get through it will depend hugely on your playstyle but if you go straight from objective to objective shooting your way through you could easily finish it in one sitting. It's intended to be an episode game so hopefully more levels will be forthcoming.","March 22, 2014","true","5.7"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","0"

The Fall is very ambitious for a phone game, boasting voice acting, decently sized areas and ok graphics on a phone. When ported the graphics didn't get upgraded much at all but to me this is fine as I've never been one to be a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥ and even consider most modern graphics more than we need these days in leu of putting the funding more towards gameplay and features. The area will of course feel small for a PC gamer but this reminds me a lot of Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker when it got ported from PSP to consoles, the areas are about equal in size. Voice acting at times gets very cheesy.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, its very solid Deus Ex HR gameplay which is a good 95% what saves this game. All Human Revolution features are there and it has a solid system that lets one play stealth or action. Hacking apparently got on some peoples nerves in HR because they added a new item called an auto hacker, also present in HR Director's Cut, this will automatically succeed on any hack you perform though you still need a high enough hack level to initiate the hack on any given terminal. While I didn't use them myself its nice to see more options for people who really didn't care hacking to still be allowed to have fun. Take downs still feel good in this game but now the bodies just disintegrate instead of being require to stash them, which for stealth fans like me is a little lame but not enough to really be up in arms about. Even in a tiny mobile title like this they attempted to have several nooks and crannies for one to explore giving that feeling of exploration that any DX game needs to be successful.\n\nNow onto some of the major problems which pretty much all come down to "porting woes". Many people have reported problems with the game most I have not personally experienced but I did run into one or two.  The Hacking UI scrolling and mouse sensitivity do not work unless one enables vsync, which for many doing so makes the game run very sluggish, I was one of the few that didn't have the entire game crap out on me doing this but even I noticed a performance hit once it was on and it would get worse over extended playing periods. I also had extended playing periods due to the fact I didn't want to have a currently existing save bug that occurs near the end of the game where it'll load you up into a non-interactible world every single time, and due to the game having a single save file (another flaw with the game) will force one to format and start the game over. My last complaint but one I should have foreseen was the fact the game ends on a "To be continued" making it episodic, I've always had things against episodic games, its splitting a game up needlessly in an attempt to make more money. Now The fall offers more gameplay at $9 than Missing Link did at its launch price of $15, most didn't get Missing until it went on sale, and that is exactly what I recommend with The Fall, its a fun game by all rights, but its problems do not warrant a full price purchase.","March 22, 2014","true","12.7"," 8 of 28 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","8","28","0","1"

Yes this is a port of a mobile game, so it's been stripped down a fair bit. Lower resolution textures, some awful character animations during conversations, simplified interface, etc. It does manage to stay true to the overall feel of the superb Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Every once in a while the artwork makes up for the lower resolutions though.  It's pretty short, again probably a concession to the fact that mobile devices have very limited system resources.  The levels are smaller and while every area has at least two routes through, it's not nearly the sandbox of the other game. If you've read the tie-in book, Deus Ex: Icarus Effect you'll recognize the main characters in this story. I recommend the book. Once you accept the technical limitations of a mobile port it's actually a decent continuation of the story that lets you explore the world of Deus Ex and all the conspiracies. Is it a great game? No. But it isn't nearly as bad as people are saying either. I would recommend waiting for the next price drop during a steam sale, just because the shortness doesn't really seem to justify spending a full $10 on it.","March 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 20 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","2","20","0","0"

Graphics are what you would expect from a mobile phone app turned PC port. If you go into the game expecting mind-numbingly good graphics, you'll be disappointed within the first few minutes of gameplay.  Combat is fine using mouse and keyboard, I had no issues whatsoever, aside from the occasional headshot not taking out an enemy.  About the bugs people have been experiencing...I didn't encounter any at all, so I can't really comment on them, though I almost wonder how many of those people who claimed to have extraordinairily bad bugs actually bought the game, or bought the game but used a NO CD exe so they can play without Steam.  Legitimately playing the game on your chosen platform usually will make your game play like mine did.  Smoothly with no bugs to speak of.\n\nMusic was fine for what it was, as well as the sound effects.  I rather thought that they re used some of the sound effects from DXHR, as I swear I could recognize a lot of the sounds from it.\n\nComparing this to DXHR and basing your opinion solely on that is dishonest and in my opinion, just plain wrong.  It is clear from most of the reviews that I read, that 90% of the reviews, compare the game to it's predecessor, most of their complaints centered around the graphical content, which in my opinion as stated above, are nice for what they are, not the best but still fine.\n\nThe ONLY gripe I had with the game as it is, was the fact that when in "invisible" mode, you could literally stand in front of an enemy and they would never know you were there.  Perhaps I am being a bit overexxagerated on this, but to be invisible and the enemy not hearing you breathing after running 50 yards in 3 seconds is just....meh.  Again, not really a complaint, I suppose it's by design that invisibility also masks your breathing *shrugs*\n\nOverall gameplay was decent, was rather surprised that the game is episodic based, and more episodes will be released in the future.  I personally thought that was a nice touch, as it keeps us wanting more and more, and wanting to know more about the characters themselves, what caused them to get in the situation they are in, etc.  I think more games should do this, release in episodes, with huge cliffhangers.  In my opinion that is where game designers can really flourish and make the story truly unique because you'll never know what happens next, until the next episode.  Also, the choices you make in game can affect end game scenarios as well.  All in all I say well done.  Looking forward to the next chapter!","March 20, 2014","true","4.8"," 5 of 27 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","5","27","0","0"

As such, it suffers from simplified gameplay, controls and mechanics, as well as voice acting and animations that cannot live up to the standards of the high-budget release that Human Revolution was.\n\nHowever, it is definitely not as bad as people make it out to be. I can understand their disappointment, but this was never going to be a fully overhauled experience, but a port of the mobile version - and as such, it works.\n\nFirstly, the game runs smoothly, and while the graphics options are limited to resolution, fullscreen/windowed mode and various degrees of Anti-Aliasing, lacking a Field of View setting, it does not look awful. Yes, you will recognize it for being a port, but it looks well enough.\n\nWhat it struggles with are animations - especially during the many early cutscenes and dialogues. Characters look rather static, almost more so than in the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Gestures are rare, and overall the lack of life in the character models underlines the, in my opinion, biggest issue with the game: The mediocre voice acting.\n\nDeus Ex: HR, outside of the main cast, ranged from acceptable to poor voice acting, but in The Fall, even the main characters have taken an obvious hit. Their lines are often delivered mechanically, or overdone, and don't match up with poses or expressions. What might not seem like a big issue on a smaller mobile screen quickly becomes disappointing on the bigger PC monitor and a proper sound system.\nDuring the first few areas, you will find a bunch of audiologs, which are actually reasonably well done, however. This makes it especially odd that the story-dialogue between Ben Saxon, Jaron Namir, Anna Kelso and co feels flat.\n\nMost sound effects I came across are directly copied from Human Revolution, so they are of reasonable quality. I have read about certain issues with sound effects or voices cutting out for some users, but have not experienced anything of the sort on my machine so far.\nAs for the music, I liked what I listened to up until now, with common themes from HR mixed with new tracks I might even prefer over the bigger title's soundtrack.\n\nNow for the Gameplay; It suffers from its touchscreen origins, and there is nothing to be said otherwise. There is no jumping in the game, only contextual vaulting. No merry hopping around in The Fall. However, you get used to it easily, and the rest of the mechanics are fairly similar, if not the same, as in Human Revolution. There have been a few changes to the interface, though, which may need some getting used to.\nThe augmentations are pretty much the same as in the other game, as you might expect. I think Praxis Point requirements have been adjusted slightly, and the trees trimmed.\nThe dialogue system is still in, including the analyzer-augment - which I didn't get to use just yet, since all conversations so far were linear. Again, this is about an hour in, past the prologue sections.\n\nThe biggest change to the game would be the inventory / market. You can buy weapons, ammo, items, etc from wherever you are, provided you have the funds. This means you can stock up on cash, and then just pick and choose gear for the situation you are currently facing - got no EMP grenades to disable a robot? Spend 200 credits and you're ready to throw!\nPersonally, I think the idea is alright, but I would have liked to see limits to this system, or at least have it be more expensive than merchants found in the game.\n\nFor all its simplifications in the gameplay department, however, the world still feels like Deus Ex. The environment design seems quite alright, despite middle of the road textures for props. The atmosphere of HR is captured nicely, and ebooks, datalogs and emails are still all there, adding more lore to locations, characters and technology.\n\nThe game does follow up on the Deus Ex: Icarus Effect novel, but does a good enough job introducing non-readers to the characters and their motivations - though for obvious reasons, reading the novel first is recommended.\n\nPlease also be aware that The Fall was released as part one of the story, but so far, there hasn't been any word on a continuation. As far as I heard, the ending might disappoint due to a cliffhanger. Considering Square Enix/Eidos's plans for the franchise, though, this should get addressed fairly soon, with a new PC game in the works already, and James Swallow writing more stories based in the universe.\nIt should also encourage that a screen accessible from the main menu also made it from Mobile to PC, proclaiming that a continuation is supposedly happening, and the Pacifist achievement refers to the game as "Part 1". I am hopeful for a continuation.\n\nShould you expect a big blockbuster like Human Revolution? No, not at all. This neither had the budget nor the time to become as impressive. For what it is, however, it is a fine Spin-off to the franchise, which fans should appreciate, once they lower their expectations and demands to a reasonable level, in accordance to the game's price and scope. It is a slice of Human Revolution, for a fifth of the launch price of said tripe A release. Considering that, I can't be too mad at the game.","March 18, 2014","true","2.8"," 66 of 181 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","66","181","0","4"

The gameplay (as in, combat and sneaking) is buggy as hell too - I really miss the tension of having to hide an unconscious body before an incoming guard could spot it.\n\nHowever, the lore found in PDAs, emails, ebooks and TV reports is fantastic - There's even space for strong references to characters such as Gunther Hermann and Bob Page, as well small mentions about the Sarif Industries attack and other events. Being part of the tyrants (albeit for a small part of the game) also makes for an interesting experience, and Namir remains a huge ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in this game.\n\nWorth a shot if you're a Deus Ex fan.

There is no manageable inventory.  Instead, you have a "Store" screen where you can purchase weapons, mods, ammo, and other items at any time.  Immersion breaking, yes, but it fits with the "merc style" storyline that the devs have gone with.  Having to find a "dropspot" for those items might have been more immersive, but would have upset some players who don't like "micromanagement"...\n\nA few of the downfalls of The Fall:\nThis is easily described as a "Lite" version of DX:HR.\nThe controls are pre-determined and cannot be changed.\nThere are some audio and graphical bugs. (My crosshair disappeared in a New Game+)\nThe buttons are "touchy". (They work on the first click about 60% of the time)\nConversation choices are "double tap". (Select first, then confirm.  Suffers from above)\nAI is predictable and almost oblivious.  (Some enemies seem to see you through cover, however.\n"Heavy" NPCs don't drop heavy weapons (yet).\nHacking is decent, but there is no feedback on detection chances.\n\nThe Augmentations are much the same as HR, but the system is much less open.  It's mostly a simplified HR scheme, but there are some real differences, mostly in what augs you start out with.\n\nThe inventory is EXTREMELY simplified.  You buy individual weapons (or find them in the world).  You then "Equip" them into quickslots, and you can use them in the world.  From what I've seen, this means that you are carrying the entire arsenal in your pocket at all times, as long as you have the weapon available (bought or found).  Bundles are decent, but not really worthwhile once you actually get the weapon in the pack.  Everything you buy is immediately available in game, so there is no "shipping delay".  Buy ammo as you need it, rather than stocking up.\n\nAnd now the highlights of The Fall:\nA "Behind the Scenes" glimpse of the mercs you fought in DX:HR. (Barret Achievement ;D)\nNice foreshadowing of both DX:HR and DX from in game texts. (One Tyrant wants a Skul-gun)\nThe UI and controls make using health and energy boosts much easier than in DX:HR, especially while in the middle of the action. (Try doing multiple takedowns while cloaked.)\nEnemies "evaporate", eliminating the need to hide evidence of your actions.\n\nThere is an interesting "Reset Story Progress" feature.  It resets you to the beginning of the game, except you keep anything unlocked in the store (supposedly).  Does delete the savegame, so turntable is reset, possibly achievements as well.  Use if you want to start from "Factory Zero".\n\nThere is a "New Game+" feature which unlocks at the end of the current content (Panama).  You keep all your Augs and Inventory, and the story starts over from the beginning.\n\nThis is a nice "easy access" DX title, especially if you are a DX lore lover.  The title boasts "The story will continue", so this could be a very interesting story if the devs keep on it.  It'd be really funny if this game is directly connected to DX:HR through Quinn. (Missing Link)\n\nTo summarize, buy this game if you are a DX fan and like the storylines.  The controls take a little getting used to, but overall it's a decent buy even at $10 USD.  A little polish by the dev team, as well as advancing the storyline, and this little gem will shine.","March 19, 2014","true","27.1"," 8 of 43 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","8","43","0","0"

Actually everything that can have bugs they all have them in this game. Sometimes... actually many times the sounds are missing, sometimes when you are doing takedowns close to walls the texture are disappearing and the controls are sometimes frustrating. With a controller my biggest concerne is the hacking, I find it way too difficult to lock on the nodes, which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ when you have to hurry. The mouse aiming sometimes forgets common sense and makes a whole circle or I don't even know what that actually was. As a mobile port the layout is "interesting" and they could have make it better.\n\nBut the story is recommended for any Deus Ex fans. It's a nice touch to see the world from a different perspective, to see what happened while Adam Jensen was fighting his war. Sometimes the plot fails to have any strict logic - specially at the end - but it is an enjoyable expansion. If you handle this game with a healthy expectation it can be a nice detour from the main game, but if you want a flawless experience, then place look elsewhere.","March 18, 2014","true","8.5"," 8 of 43 people (19%) found this review helpful","19","8","43","0","0"

It didn't make it unplayable, just a bit more getting used to, which brings me to the following\n\nThe downside of the game was that it was quite short.

Do The Fall escapes this fate ?\nWhile I choosed the "recommend" option, my judgement is more mitigated than that.\n\nFirst, the game is not as instable as it is commonly said. Yes, they are some bugs- rarely the sound of a dialogue is skipped, sometimes doing a takedown can send an enemy through the environment, or (and there it's unnerving) the games seem to go forward or backward in space without any reason every now and then. It's far from being technically ideal, but it's not unplayable.\nThat said, like everyone else, I would have appreciated the option of remapping the keys - when you do not have an american keyboard, it's really awkward, but I got over it.\n\nSo yeah, even if with the graphics it's quite okay, there's ground for resentment against the game. But the most important is : you still get the Deus Ex vibe. The story is not anything as compelling as Human Revolution's one, Ben Saxon, the ex-Tyrant you play as, is far from being as charismatic as Jensen, but you can have the feeling of this dysfunctional world, and the conspiracy atmosphere.\nOf course, it wouldn't be enough without the gameplay, and The Fall manages to keep the core of it : lethal, non-lethal or a mix of both, the pleasure to grow in power with the praxis points, the multiple possibilites to get through an area, the dialog options, the sidequests with several possible outcomes, etc.\nHonestly, of all it is a bit watered down. Well, that's what you get when you can purchase weapons, items and ammo anytime you want, and the bodies all disappear even if you took them down without killing them. The alternative paths are easier to find than in Human Revolution, and well...\n\nIt lacks challenge. Hacking still rules, and at one point I was sitting on 9 Praxis points ; even without buying you get too much ammo (I was hauling more than 70 shotgun cartridges), having no inventory limitation really ease up the whole thing.\nSo why recommend it ? Part of it is because I'm quite fed up with the reviews displaying less than an hour played and just a handful of lines bashing the game.\nNo, the Fall is far from being excellent. But considering it was on mobile platforms, it's doing an honest job and can deliver some fun. The port could be very, very worse, and the pricing is fair... Well, IF the continuation comes for free. The first part lasts roughly 4-5 hours and 10€ would be a tad bit excessive just for that.\n\nAs silly as it sounds, in the end, I'd be more in favor of a 'neutral' review. See those facts for yourself, if like me you were looking forward to some more human revolution-like experience, you might appreciate The Fall, with an open mind. I reckon some tolerance is in order to savor it. If you have Android or Ios, there's not much point buying it- but the same can be said about Plague Inc. Evolved or many other ports.","March 18, 2014","true","8.2"," 18 of 69 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","18","69","0","0"

Bodies also dissapear once killed or knocked uncouncious.\n\nThe one thing at the moment that is going for it is the story which is currently split into parts. The game is a prequal to HR as it involves the main group (The Tyrants) led by Jaron Namir. You start off as part of his terrorist organisation and then go freelance. The world is running out of Neuropozyne and a replacement is needed for your character and his accomplace.\n\nI'd say only get this game if it's on the cheap and you're interested in the HR prequal.","March 18, 2014","true","3.5"," 4 of 35 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","4","35","0","0"

I personally didn't have any issue adapting as it's largely WASD centric and the mouse implementation is good.\n\nThe "neverending help prompts" that some reviewers mention only last through the pre-credits tutorial mission; that may tell you how long they played before forming an opinion. I have not encountered any since that point, and I'm over 5 hours in now. Remember, DXHR also has a lengthy pre-title linear tutorial.\n\nActual gameplay is very similar to DXHR, and the game largely recaptures the atmosphere of its predecessor. There are some notable changes due to its mobile origin, namely the lack of a jump button and the fact that bodies disappear after a few moments. While obviously not ideal, I didn't find either of these significantly took away from the experience, at least so far.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for more Deus Ex.\n\nUpdate:\nI've now completed the game, and I stand by the review - it took about 7 hours to complete, and that was doing a pacifist run. I didn't experience any major technical glitches during that time, and again, the game really does feel like DXHR once it gets going.

It's also a pretty poor port for the most part, there's a lot of conventions that were obviously intended for its tablet-roots, for example the store being accessible any time from the menu, and likely originally driven by microtransactions, and bodies always fading out (even when unconcious as opposed to dead).\n\nBut the story? It picks up from after the novel the Icarus Effect, and, without spoiling too much, deals with the character's reliance on the drug Neuropozene, and essentially ensuring a supply. None of the previous characters from the previous Deus Ex games have needed this, being in some way special, and it adds an interesting new angle to the Deus Ex world.\n\nAs for that world, I'd say the it mixes combat and social/story moments as well as the best moments in HR. There's defnitely an emphasis on stealth over combat, as I found fighting moments a lot more clunky than stealth. So do keep that in mind.\n\nSo if you're willing to look past its shortcomings, the few bugs and the weird tablet vestiges, The Fall's a fun way to spend a few hours and learn a bit more about the Deus Ex world.","February 2, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/258180/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","I find myself in a bizarre situation. On the one hand, Deus Ex: The Fall isn't all too terrible. On the other hand, there is no mention anywhere of this being an episodic game. You simply play for a little bit and then reach a "To Be Continued..." screen. It feels a bit cheap.\n\nCheap is easily the best word to describe this. Don't bother wasting $5 on this. I got it for around $2 and feel a little cheated. Graphics don't make a game, but holy crap is this a bit of a mess. Character models barely animate, there is clipping abound and performing takedowns almost always results in the world disappearing around you before forming back. I also got stuck in a box very early into the game.\n\nAs for the actual mechanics, there are a bunch of differences compared to Human Revolution, but the iOS origin of the game makes that understandable. What isn't so forgivable is that none of your keybindings show up on the screen. Everything is left as if you were still playing on an iPad. At least the tutorial voice recognizes your keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe level design is also entirely forgettable. This is pretty much a greatest hits of what the Deus Ex series has to offer. Nothing new ever happens. You hack terminals and computers, you stealth takedown enemies or blast them away and you crawl through vents. There is even a requisite nightclub, as if the first game made a permanent blueprint that can't be escaped.\n\nI don't necessarily mind the chopped down areas, but there isn't much in the way of freedom. You definitely have choices in how you tackle the objectives at hand, but the AI is so shockingly stupid that you often wonder if stealth even matters. I often just ran straight at people and attacked them, barely taking a scratch.\n\nThe music is the standout feature here. The voice acting is hit and miss, but you can easily forget the characters are even talking when you hear the music. It may be a bit too short (the samples loop quite a bit), but it sounds far better than Human Revolutions did. It fits the tone of the game very well.\n\nI also have a love/hate relationship with the store system. Instead of having to go to a merchant or even terminal, you simply buy what you want at any given moment. This turns moments where you get outnumbered or cornered by a robot into trivial affairs. I suppose trying to aim sucks on iPad, but it's flawless on PC.\n\nSo I could take the bad if there were at least a complete game here. As it stands, I feel like I only got half an experience. It wasn't devoid of fun, but you could spend your money a lot better. Human Revolution routinely goes on sale for $5 and you could even get the first two Deus Ex games in a pack for $5. Doing either option would be a much better investment then dealing with this drek.\n\n3/10","December 30, 2014","false","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a very good game, but I still found enough fun to be worth my time. If you consider this a higher quality fan mod (which is about the level of quality to expect here, not that it is an actual fan mod), there is some fun to be had here. Obviously, expecting this to be comparable to Human Revolutions or even the original Deus Ex will only result in dissapointment.\n\nVOICE ACTING\nThe voice acting is pretty bad, but a lot better than I've seen from some fan mods that have tried to do voice acting.  The dialogue options are extremely limited, with very few opportunities for it to make a difference.\n\nSTORY\nIt's ok and it keeps the pace going.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nA lot of areas are streamlined, probably primarily to do it being originally a mobile game. No jumping, which I disliked, but I can see why one might cut that here. It gives the designers a lot more control over where a player can go in the game without having to design additional ways to block player movement to account for jumping. This also focuses the type of gameplay they are offering, allowing multiple ways through environments.\n\nSTEALTH\nI liked that full stealth options were available, as well as guns ablazing.\n\nHACKING\nMuch easier than in Human Revolutions, but plenty of things to hack and a few good opportunities to turn robots and turrets against your enemies.\n\nGOODS\nI noticed a ton of weapons available for purchase... though I never bought any. The store might be too easy to access, but it gave a lot more options than typically can be found. Everything is probably too plentiful in the game.\n\nLEVELING\nLeveling up was really quick, which was good since the game was short.\n\nONE SAVE + BUGS\nI hate single save options. Just make sure when you save, nothing screwy is happening, though I found only a couple bugs during my playthrough.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nIf anything, the game is too easy, but I still found it fun and I'm interested in seeing where things might go next, if they still planned on making another one. It's a nice diversion, as long as you don't expect much from it. Buy it on sale, if interested, and you should be good.","March 19, 2015","true","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A game that wasn't bad, but which was rushed, and which really didn't live up to the first game. The mechanics and storyline were just a little bit worse, is all.\n\nFast forward to Deus Ex: Human Revolution. A prequel to the original, and an absolutely FANTASTIC game. And now we have this game, The Fall. It really wasn't bad; I'm not going to give it a thumbs down by any means. Hell, I just played through it in a day. I could hardly put it down. But it just didn't live up to the standard set by Human Revolution. It felt extremely rushed (the game isn't even finished yet, more content has yet to be released for the second part), with very few mechanics changed and those that were seeming a bit clunky and off. Especially irritating was the lack of a jump (what is this, The Stanley Parable?). The plot was engaging, but the few choices the player had were essentially meaningless to the ending.\n\nIf you're a hardcore Deus Ex fan like myself, then you might as well get this game. If it's on sale, and you liked Human Revolution, you might as well get this game. If you haven't played any other Deus Ex games, don't get this game! It does not stand alone! If you're looking for something different from Human Revolution, don't get this game! If you are expecting a full-blown game, and not just a 3-hour mini-game to tide us over while the real next game in the Deus Ex series is being worked on, don't bother getting this game.\n\nHope this helps!","July 23, 2014","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed playing this almost as much as DE:HR.\n\nThe Fall brings a lot of the good gameplay aspects from Human Revolution, from incremental augments to weapon upgrades, stealth vs assault, lethal vs nonlethal. Weaponry and upgrades can now be purchased from the pause menu which is both useful if a little jarring. Side quests also appear, as does the free roam across the city.\n\nIF you're a person who requires a game to be 'well made' then this is a little less for you. While it's nice that this game was made for desktop and mobile at the same time it does show through - the animations aren't as good as its predecessor, I found a lot of the sounds didn't play, and some of the controls are a little problematic. I don't want to dwell too much on the downsides, but you might run into a little bit of difficulty in places if you don't have a controller.\n\nMy biggest complaint of all is the sudden ending, the game asks if you want to travel to Australia, a quick cutscene ensues and that's it. It's not a long game (think the original Portal in terms of length) but to be fair it is priced appropriately, get it on sale and it's worth a few hours entertainment.","July 26, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerocrescent/recommended/258180/","zerocrescent","Zero-Crescent","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerocrescent/","1198 products in account","I'm not opposed to the idea behind it, a mini-series that focuses on side-characters from the novel; a sort of microcosm of Deus Ex HR's gameplay in an episodic format. The execution of this idea in The Fall leaves much to be desired, partially due to problems with the game itself, but mostly due to the pains of being an obviously rushed port.\n\nTo the devs' credit, it does hit some HR beats. You have a hub location (Panama City Slums/Boardwalk/Downtown), with plenty of storage units and gates to hack, a few side-quests (though they are gated by story progress), buildings with hackable doors and safes, man-sized vent systems to serve as alternate paths, upgrade points and PRAXIS kits, stealth takedowns, tons of goodies lying around in or on trashcans/desks/safes, and the persuasion system returns at certain points (and thankfully, the CASIE mod is not an insta-win button this time, just a way to score some extra items/info).\n\nAnd that leads us to the rub. Imagine, for a moment, if there was a painting you enjoyed so much that you commissioned a different artist to make a painting with a similar style and feeling, with one stipulation: the artist can never look at the original painting, they can only use your written description. Even if the finished painting resembles the original painting's style from a distance, when placed upon closer inspection, several flaws will surface.\n\nThere are a variety of upgradable weapons, but the balance feels weird (e.g. headshots from the base pistol are not one-hit kills, which means that the silenced pistol isn't a useful stealth weapon until you apply a damage upgrade). You can still choose to go in stealthily or burst in guns blazing, but the small area sizes with few enemies makes the faster Rambo option much more viable (the Pacifist achievement is bugged, as it unlocks even if you kill people in the campaign). Plus, the AI is as dumb as a doorstop; civilians don't react if you takedown a guard right in front of them; in a firefight, guards will either stay in place or walk towards your position. There are computers to hack, but almost all of them are unlock codes for doors and safes; outside of two memorable e-mails (one being from a certain person in the novel, and another referencing FF27), it's a wasted opportunity for world-building.\n\nThe story starts off somewhat interesting (Ben's flashback to his last mission with the Tyrants), then it devolves into what's essentially busywork, as Ben Saxon puts the conspiracy-fighting on hold to go to Panama City and try to find a source of Neuropozyne for himself and Anna Kelso. Naturally, he stumbles onto a conspiracy (because conspiracies are as common as Starbucks in the world of Deus Ex). Things do get somewhat interesting again due to a twist. Unfortunately, the game doesn't go into much effort to build the characters of Ben/Anna/Janus, nor does it provide much of a look at the Tyrants, with the exception of Jaron Namir. It also doesn't give much background on these characters outside of a rough outline established by a few audio logs; leaving much of their origins in the novel.\n\nIf it were just those problems, I'd probably excuse it, but as I said before, a bevy of porting problems indicate that this was a rushed port. The UI is largely the same as the mobile version, and while I can see how it would have worked on a touchscreen, it's clunky and unintuitive with a mouse and keyboard. Switching items/grenades/weapons are mainly accomplished by holding their designated key and picking the desired item with the mouse. It pauses the game, but it feels like an unnecessary step. I guess you can use the number bar, but, unlike HR, there's no constant reminder of what each number activates. That's a problem throughout the whole UI: It doesn't generally show key or button prompts, just action prompts. You might end up checking the key bindings infographic quite often.\n\nThen there's the graphics, which weren't scaled up for the PC release, so you'll frequently notice blurry textures, simple geometry, and many low-res character models. The only character models that are detailed decently enough are the Belltower guards, the Riot Cops, and the characters that are important to the storyline (though Ben has a dead-eyed stare when his shades aren't on). Despite the low-res graphics, I still experienced some framerate drops at random times.\n\nThere are a few other notable problems with the port; a few bugs (there's a bundle of four barrels in the drug den with a Pocket Secretary on it, I'd fall through the floor and die if I took cover on it and grabbed the PS), only one save slot (saved at area changes and quick saves; I could feasibly see someone saving in an unwinnable position), the single-mouse-button shooting controls (on the crossbow, holding LMB will aim down the scope; on other weapons, it'll just fire multiple times). Perhaps the most annoying thing is when two objects are very close to each other (e.g. credits in a netphone slot); you have your crosshair on one object (the credits) and the game activates the other object (the netphone) when you hit the use key, until you find the correct position/angle to stand at.\n\nOh, and as for that buggered-up recoil that you've probably seen in gifs, they've fixed that problem. Now the recoil is just a slight screen shake; the difference is immediately obvious as soon as you fire a gun.\n\nIt's a sideways-thumb kind of game (leaning heavily towards thumbs down due to the rushed-port problems); not that good, but not so terrible that I'd want to actively warn people off of it. If you got into the Humble Bundle early (back when the BTA was $5-6), then it might be worth upgrading to check it out. Not so much at the current BTA price unless HB adds some big bonuses on Tuesday.","July 27, 2014","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Being a huge fan of the Deus Ex game series, especially Human Revolution, I was underwhelmed when I started and completed this game. Upon purchase I saw that the game had terrible reviews and scores however since it was on sale, I decided to buy it and play it without prejudice. With that said I was extremely disappointed and I will explain why.\n\nAt this stage of the game, patches have clearly fixed many of the problems that people have talked about. I had no issue with bugs in the short duration the game lasted. That if course is always a good thing.\n\nObviously coming from playing Human Revolution, I had high expectations for this game on many levels. Upon entering the start up screen, I immediately went into check graphics settings and control settings. The options were poor to say the least. I was able to change anistrophic filtering and that was about it. There really was no other say when it came to the graphics of the game. On that note, the graphics were not that big of an issue for me. I was pleased with them. Although not as good as Human Revolution, it was perfectly fine for its purposes.\n\nOnce starting the game I was interested by the story. I like were the story picked up from and how a good amount of the information could be found from in game play. Just like Human Revolution your Augs can greatly help you evaluate conversations. Unfortunately there were not many coversations to be had. Even for the short duration, there are only three or four side missions that you come across without trying extremely hard. The missions are easy and just simply involve a lot of travel between the few small levels of the small map.\n\nThat is my next issue. Travel in this game is boring! There are only five or six trully distinct locations that you must travel to in order to complete the game. An hour into the game, I felt like I was just going back and forth constantly and I was already bored enough to put the game down.\n\nThe duration of the game however is my ultimate issue. Not having read any of the comments for this game, i really was expecting another full on Deus Ex game. By the game description and the story that starts to unfold, you would expect so much more, rather than a To Be Continued. I love Deus Ex to the point where I search every single room, air duct and storage unit. Even thouroughly searching through the game, It only took me four hours to complete. i was just messing around looking around and only took that long!\n\nOverall the Deus Ex series is amazing but this game, at this point at least, is honestly not worth it. I was extremely disappointed that I bothered with it. The only real reason to have it is to say you at least own every game in the series. Thats all it's really good for. If you do choose to buy this game, do not get your hopes up and set any expectations you have extremely low.\n\nI really don't enjoy having to right a poor review for a game especially such as this series, but such a horrible game warrants such a review. Best of luck to anyone who does decide to play. At least you can play the game again with all your current augs and purchases but on an increased difficulty.","July 5, 2014","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The second version Invisible War was awful, Human Revolution took back the lost ground. Now we have The Fall and on the first run it's look easily as good as HR. However I am experiencing a bug that make the game unplayable. It starts out just fine, but if you Quit and Reload the Sound Effects disappear, as well as speech - so you NEED to have the captions show up or you won't know what's going on, then other times the caption window fly by so fast you can't read them, and if there is a character speaking when this happens their speech is cut off. While the music is playing you don't get any sound effects, they return after the music loop finishes, and disappear again when it restarts. You cannot turn the music off, you can only turn it all the way down. That means it is still looping and causing the sound effects to stop. There's obviously some channel overlap going on as my Sound Card is easily able to put out multiple channels over multiple devices - through Dolby 5.1 speakers as well as a Dolby 7.1 surround headphones at the same time.\nThat said there is a work around for the sound problem all you have to do is set your sound card to Stereo and the problem is solved. It doesn't look like Square Enix is interested in providing a fix. So if you can handle that, you can play the game just fine.","April 5, 2014","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Human Revolution had a great system when it comes to take downs in that where you took out your enemy made sense. In the fall I frecquntly find my self being launched 5 to 10 feet from where i initiated it and alerting other guards speaking of which.... 3. the AI and NPC: in human revolution mass panic took place the moment you took a guard in puplic in the fall these people Really could'nt give a ****. One NPC evwen said to me she was'nt paid enough for this crap. It really suspends the disbelief. 4. Disappering guards : I get this is supped to make thing easier guys but when I take a guard it seems really odd just having him vanish without a trace. In human reolution it make sense you had to hid ethe bodyies. ALso I had nurerous occurences of guards just going though walls  when I killed them. 5. Dialogue drops: at random points I have the voice acting just drop out, really odd but a simple bugs fix if they can find it. 6; infinite inventory and on hand store: i get these were mostly implemented to make things easier but I kinda of enjoyed managing my inventory in human revolution it felt real ansd seniblr that i couldnt cary 10 weapons at once. 7: minimizing of non leathals: I was saddened not to see the tranc rifle, gas crossbow ( the one they had was supernerfed), gas mines I loved those things. Also it semed that the stun gun range was nerfed by a about 5 ft as well for no good reason. 8: trckng aug removal: I loved that aug make stealing so much easier plus the ability to track invisble targets who would't miss it. 9: meh graphic. Now I may be crazy but I felt like the fall was a little less preety than human revolution. not enought to detract me but still it felt odd.\n\nLike I siad earlier this game is not worht the full price.

Deus Ex: The Fall isn’t a very good game. There are four games in the Deus Ex franchise (Deus Ex, Deus Ex: Invisible War, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and Deus Ex: The Fall), and while I wouldn’t say it’s as bad as invisible war, it’s definitely worse than Human Revolution. Multiple factors work against the game, let me cover a few. Since it was originally a mobile title, the devs were constrained to working with inferior hardware. The levels are much smaller than Deus Ex: Human Revolution, often requiring two or three loading points to get to a certain mission. The textures and graphics are a downgrade from its predecessor as well; you can see the constraints that were put on the game with worse hardware. You can clearly tell the interface was designed for a tablet, with mechanics as simple as a jumping being removed, the inability to change key bindings, or the remnants of in app purchases. To make matters worse, the port of the game is very poor. All sorts of issues arise if you don’t turn on vsync. The sound cuts out if you are using surround sound. Performance in general just isn’t that great.\n\nHowever, there are some redeeming qualities about this game; you just have to look for them. For the most part they are able to preserve what made Human Revolution so good. The combat, stealth, and hacking mechanics are all for the most part there. The environments and atmosphere are reminiscent of Human Revolution. Furthermore we get to see more of the Deus Ex universe, with the game being a sequel to the book Deus Ex: Icarus Effect.\n\nSo should you buy this game? Maybe. Despite its many flaws, I still had fun with it.  Whether you should buy this game really depend on what you thought of Human Revolution. If you really enjoyed it, I would try The Fall. It's not a terrible game, it's just below expectations.","July 2, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the Deus Ex series, especially Human Revolution, and I was under the impression this was a DLC-like small campaign that carried over the same gameplay and continued the story. I was mistaken. I'm sure this game is a blast on iOS, it probably looks great and plays well with a touchscreen - but after coming off of playing Human Revolution for the second time around in the Directors Cut version, it feels like a huge step back. A mouse and keyboard just do not transfer over well, the game feels clunky and unresponsive, and I quit not 10 minutes into the game. Not worth the sale price at $2.49 let alone the full price. Save your money and buy the original if you haven't played it already.","June 28, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
