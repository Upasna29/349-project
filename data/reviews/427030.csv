But in this review I will try to elaborate neutrally the pros and cons of this game alongside with things you might be interested  to know about.\n\nLanguages Supporting. You attention here please, this game only supports English, Japanese, Chinese, Traditonal Chinese with the corresponding UI, menu and subtitles. So feel free to play if you are English or Japanese players, but unluckily for players in other regions, whether waiting for mods( or official translations, donnot be expecting on that ) or choosing not to buy is at your discretion.\nThis game requires  free disk space of appropriate 15GB , made by U3D (have been optimized several times since its first release in Feb, 2015 in China ), this steam version gladly has been given huge optimizations. In fact, my gt650m notebook with 8GB ram could run it quite smoothly in 720P, the highest resolution supported is 1920*1080.\nTechnical notes here: should you have problems in failing to initail(black screen or whatever), try starting in win95 compatiable mode, hope it helps.Gate of Firmament and its gaming series. Gate of Firmament is the 12th work in a row of the prestigious Xuan-Yuan Sword RPG gaming series(better be compared to the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest gaming series in Japan, so you could get distinct understandings) with 25 years of history in China. As mentioned, there are twelve works from DOS to 2D to 2.5D to 3D with the first work released 25 years ago forming this Xuan-Yuan Sword game series. Each game have a separate story told so if you are a novice to play Gate of Fimament, there is no affecting your gameplay experience at all. (Somewhere through your play, there may be plots or concepts linked from previous works but believe me most are the surprise type for fans and have little to do with the gameplay).\nAbout the game itself.Now let's get down to our main business, how is the game?\nThe Gate of Firmament is a typical oriental rpg game or more specified, a Chinese martial arts rpg game in the sense that the game put great emphasis on the long moving story you gonna experience rather than the elements of a game, or put it in a another way, it is actually more like a movie than a game. The core spirits of this gaming series is its decent, impressive, beautifully written story.\nOn a scale of 0 to 10 I would like to rate as follows:\n1.Story   9.5 points, highly recommended if you are fond of Chinese culture and this loving story with the elements of divinity(of course Chinese myths). Must say again here, it's more like a movie, you have to get around villages, towns investing and talking to different people, if you previously had any Final Fantasy experience, it would be ez.\n2.Music   9 points, music and sound effects are composed by outstanding musicians, but mostly oriental style.\n3.System/Combat   7 points,actually turn based, you learn and upgrade your abilities, not much to talk about. One thing worth to point out is its Lian-Yao system(mainly you can capture the monsters after you defeat them as pets and combine different ones to a strong pet ) of this gaming series which may fascinates you. Also, there are mini-games included for instance you need to solve some puzzles to get treasures.\n4.Video  6.5 points, made by U3D engine, modeling of characters and scenes may seem a little rough sometimes but much better than those 2D or 2.5D babies. Modeling are oriental aesthetically.\nAt the very end, I would like to say if you are looking for extreme "play" experience such as RTS or acting , this is definitely no choice for you. But if you are a RPG lover or somehow just wondering what our  Chinese game is, this game is a perfect choice for you. It won't let you down for such a fair price.\nIf you have any questions during your game play, be free to leave a message, I would be glad to help.","February 25","true","128.0"," 154 of 160 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","154","160","6","7"

Since english subtitles+UI are available, why not!. Standouts are the beautiful cutscenes and soundtrack. Game itself seems decent but a little rough around the edges, examples being collision meshes missing and some npc pathing issues, Nothing gamebreaking. Translation wasn't a problem though you will find some humorous 'oops' moments. Initial gameplay was your typical jrpg affair, fetch questing around the village while learning the story of your existence.\n\nCompleting that, then sent to a nearby bamboo forest which introduced combat. No random encounters so far, needed to walk into enemies that roamed about. While I'm still learning the systems but any recent final fantasy player should feel at home. Talent trees were available for characters and equipment system looked deep. Will give it the thumbs up as it's a lovely game for the price.

Because with hindsight I would gladly have paid full price for it. (And I'm going to grab the 2$ DLC for the soundtrack, which is absolutely terrific anyway)\n\nNot everyone will be willing to pay 60$ for it and I don't blame anyone who doesn't share my view. This game is NOT for everyone. In many aspects it feels immature: clunky animations, long pauses between dialogues in cutscenes (technological limitation), rough translation, and outdated combat style (though if you like FF semi-turn-based you should find yourself at home) are just a few of the aspects that reveal the "indieness" of the game. And you bet it doesn't have AAA graphics, tons of gameplay features, or a massive open world to free roam in.\n\nHowever, playing this game after having gone through so many AAA titles made me realize how I've become apathetic towards mainstream games. Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed every hour of the Witcher 3 and GTA 5. But I now realized that enjoying is not the same as loving, having fun in a game does not mean that I'm emotionally invested in or attached to it.\n\nPerhaps a lot of my positive feelings towards this game are generated by the mere freshness it brings after playing decades or Western/western-influenced games. This game is oriental to the core, be it the story, the music or the aesthetic, all of which the game nailed perfectly. But I believe it is more than that. The devs, with an obviously limited budget, clearly put thoughts and efforts into carving the story and sculpting each and every one of the character. The models, despite the rough edges and visible pixels, are truly pleasing to look at, compared to the "perfect" CGI generated faces that all look the same; the simplicity of the facial features do not prevent the display of some of the most beautiful and rich facial expressions I've seen, to the point that every time Muyue frowns, I could almost see through her inner feelings and feel the same sorrows.\n\nThe story is where the game truly shines the brightest. Once again, it is NOT one that will be enjoyed by everyone. The long cutscenes, coupled with the aforementioned limited 3d technology, could really test the patience of those who are not particularly fond of the plot. The already overwhelming burden in the form of the sheer amount of information (unfamiliar Chinese names, lores and the setting) hasunfortunately been increased by a less-than-adequate translation, which may be responsible for the lack of interest in the first place. However, if you are genuinely intrigued by the plot, none of the above will matter. The cutscenes are actually the parts I enjoy the most from the game.\n\nThere is not too much to be said beyond this. Neither the combat nor the graphics should be the determining factor in making you buy the game, even at such a modest price. This is by all means not saying both are bad, is just that they aren't what the game does the best. The combat may feel outdated if you enjoy the fast paced combat of Dragon Age: Inquisition or real time action like TW3, but it can be just as exhilarating, flashy and challenging as Final Fantasy battles with character-switching, fast command executions, combos, and summoning. The graphics may only be compared to an unmodded Skyrim at best (though much more colorful if you like fruitiness), but the distinct Chinese sceneries: the flamboyance of the red peach blossoms, the serenity of the bamboo groves, and the solitude of the lofty mountains all convey an unique aesthetic that sets this game apart from any other game you played (in terms of the art style)\n\nSo before you decide to buy the game and then curse me for lying or thank me for showing you the light, ask yourself: do I rather sit through the typical straight forward plot in most Western games that I may enjoy but which will never stick with me since I don't really give a damn, or would you go through something completely fresh that might require far more work: your genuine interest in the story, your resolve to go through the story without skipping the cutscenes, and perhaps emotional investment in the characters themselves. At the end of the day, if you chose the latter and made the required investments, you will surely agree that it has more than paid off.","February 28","true","34.1"," 62 of 68 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","62","68","3","3"

Only one hour in so I haven't left the starting town, most time was invested in talking to townspeople to get the story of who you and your family are.\n\nGame looks nice, a bit like an unmodded Skyrim so don't expect 4K textures all around. The setting is truely Chinese which is a nice for a change. You get a few nice errors in the english translation but that isn't a problem. All voices are in Chinese but that makes the female characters even more cute than they already are.\n\nHard thing is to remember all the Chinese names being thrown around in the story and it's not easy to understand sometimes what they are trying to tell you in details but I do get the general picture.\n\nHaven't been in a singly fight so the 'action' still has to start but what I've seen so far and specially for this low price a true recommendation if you are into these kind of games. (If it's possible to edit this review later I'll try to give some updates)\n\nEdit1: Works perfectly with mouse+keyboard, PS3 controller (DS3 motion in joy) and PS4 controller (DS4Windows).","February 25","true","9.2"," 70 of 83 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","70","83","5","0"

And so far, I'm very pleasantly surprised. It's very good looking (especially for the price), and despite some rough edges (weak animations, rough translation), it's a shockingly well-made game, with a lot of nice presentation throughout (nice looking UI, full 3D model viwer for evey item/equipment/enemy in the game, great OST, etc). And it runs well too.\n\nJust in case the trailer didn't give enough info, this is a very by-the-numbers JRPG (or CRPG to be more accurate), with semi-turn-based battles with some combo/timing based inputs. Encounters aren't random though, and you can see all enemies in the world before hand and attack for preemptive strikes. Everything else is pretty typical RPG fare: decent amount of exploration, chests with loot (and you can actually dismantle the chests for more loot!), tons of battling, and I think even a sort of Pokemon-esque element later? Mostly what you'd expect, but with some nice twists as well. Definitely not regretting the purchase at all, and will probably buy future installments if they get English localizations (it seems like a small miracle, or at least an anomaly, that this one did).","February 25","true","9.0"," 48 of 51 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","48","51","5","0"

There’s nothing in the game that makes use of 3D, apart from giving the developers the ability to place the camera wherever they want.\n\nEvery detail from how you move, how environments are laid out, how the combat system works, how cutscenes and dialog scenes are paced feels like a 2D RPG. For example, you can’t jump, and the combat system is most optimally played if you only use the keyboard. This isn’t a negative, just a stylistic choice that shows the series origin as a long running traditional series.\n\nCompared to western RPGs the cutscene quality is on the level of Knights of the Old Republic. There’s long pauses after every spoken line where you wait for the character animation to stop playing before the next line is spoken. So it’s cheap, but good enough that it gets the point across of what the scene is trying to convey. But it’s a far way off from Mass Effect, Dragon Age or Witcher 3. Luckily you can click to skip to the next line of dialog, a feature that was patched in after release. This is big, because now and then you get cutscenes where the pacing is particularly slow and stilted. Being able to manually raise the pace by clicking is a huge improvement. Very appreciated that it didn’t take them long to patch that in.\n\nThere’s something likable about Gate of Firmament. It has the charm of an underdog trying their best to create an epic masterpiece, despite only having a fraction of the money or manpower to achieve that goal. It looks older than it is. But thanks to the vibrant colors it’s good enough. If you have the patience for it, this is an alright game. It might even be great once the story kicks off in proper. I liked the characters, and the humor had a nice off-beat quality to it. It’s very far from perfect, but I find myself returning to it again and again, giving it another 30-60 minutes here and there. It isn’t amazing, but it doesn’t matter. It’s enough to be likable.","March 1","true","4.6"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","45","50","4","6"

I would say that this game is worth for the money I paid for. Even though this game is not as good as those big titles, it does worth playing. This game remind me of Final Fantasy series and The Last Remnant, which is my all time favourite game, but this game is more toward ancient chinese story.\n\nStoryline 10/10This game has fantastic storyline, which is funny, touching and educate. I get touched several time by the story characters. This game is 40 hours+ long if you complete all side quest and kill all the area boss.\n\nBattle System 6/10The battle system isn't as good as I expected. The steam version have different battle interface than the original release from Chinese version. The control are somehow terrible and too easy because you only have to keep spamming the skill with one key and heal occasionally. The skills for each character are somehow terrible as you only rely on 1 or 2 skills, and the rest are useless even for boss fight. The AI for battle are terrible, you will realise the pots go down so quickly enough that you might not have enough for boss fight, so buy more.\n\nCharacter 8/10Character setup are quite good. As the game only focus on 4 main characters, so you don't have to make decision to choose who is going to be in the party like other games did.\n\nGraphics 7/10 Even though the game is in 3D, the graphics are still horrible for a year 2015+ game in my opinion. The facial expression for the character are driving me nut. Most of the NPC are terribly designed because developer only focus on main character facial expression. However, the scenery in the game are looking beautiful and attractive. Do note that the game is made in Unity3D.\n\nFeature 7/10The developer removed a few interesting features from the original release. You can no longer use LianYao (combine and merge any single monster into higher tier), you can't run from battle or maybe I don't know how because they is not a single button for that, HunTian skill system is removed, you can't control how AI works which is always finish up your pots in the beginning of the game.\n\nMap 5/10The game map for each area is insanely huge but empty. I did a lot of running through the map just the open one of the chest on another side of the map. Some of the quest make you run here and there which is actually quite annoying.\n\nQuest 7/10The quest system is somehow suprising me with the timeline implementation. You can't accept certain quest if the quest is past due the timeline. Some of the quest are good as they require some thinking and puzzle solving which I love it.\n\nMonster 5/10The enemy in each map are almost the same, just normal attacking with similar damage and no special skills. I find it boring to fight monster but to level up you have to do it. Boss fight are too easy for me, maybe because I did not play in hard mode. There are few map boss in certain area which are quite challenging but you can easily kill them when you know how your character work.\n\nOverall: 8/10Overall, I would recommend anyone to try this game if you liked final fantasy as the story of the game is good. I will not recommend this game if you are purely wanted a graphics intense game.\n","March 5","true","41.8"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","26","28","0","0"

I bought it out of pure curiosity, and so far I haven't regretted it at all. It's a JRPG, and from what I've been able to gather it seems to be from a very long running franchise, having its start back 20 years ago.\n\nAnyways, it features a pretty interesting fighting system, it's kind of real-timeish, making use of combos and magic under a "global" cooldown of a second or so, so you'll be chaining a lot of your moves together, and it all flows pretty nicely and looks great. Enemies can also be pretty challenging if you play on hard difficulty, which is a nice plus for me.\n\nThere are also a ton of cutscenes, so if you're not into "cinematic" experiences it might not be your thing. I do find the story pretty interesting right now, albeit a bit difficult to follow due to all the Chinese names, but I suppose that is to be expected. It's not due to the translation, as it's okay, and generally gets the point across with a few grammatical mistakes here and there.\n\nI also want to mention the music. I love the music so far, having this very distinct eastern style to it. Especially the battle theme, always gets me pumped.\n\nFrom a technological stand-point the game runs without hiccups on my end, and the only real thing I'd like to have the option to is borderless window, but I can do without it.\n\nI would like the be able to turn off the option to have my AI allies eat all of my consumables, which is a bit annoying.\n\nI'll probably update this once I beat it, as right now I just wanted to put my two cents down on it, but I would definitely recommend it if you are into JRPGs, or just want a pretty entertaining story in general.","February 27","true","5.9"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","23","29","3","0"

I started playing it with the intent to just try it out for an hour or two. A week later, I racked up 40 hours of playtime. I love JRPGs, and I believe this game compares very favorably to more well-known JRPGs. I don't know if it can really be called a JRPG though since it was made in Taiwan. It's also a bit unique since as far as I know, it's the only localized high-profile RPG to incorporate Chinese legends and culture in its plot.\n\nFirst, let's talk about the story and characters. They are very well-written. There's great character development as the story progresses, and you can't help but get attached to them as you watch them interact with each other and the world around them. There's also quite a bit of romance involved, so suckers for romance like me will be happy with that. As for the story, it already gets a thumbs up from me just for its faithful integration with Chinese culture. I've never seen that before, so this was a breath of fresh air for me. Is the story believable though? Most definitely. All of the characters have their own reasons for going on their shared adventure, and none of them are outrageous. Also, if you ever forget any part of the story, you can click on "Memory" on the title screen to revisit any old cutscene you've already played for a memory-refresher.\n\nThe presentation of the story might be a more divisive issue though. This game is VERY cutscene-heavy. Cutscenes are usually a few minutes in the first parts of the game, but once the first chapter ends, it's not unusual to see a sequence of cutscenes lasting ten or twenty minutes. This isn't much of an issue for me but for others, it may be discourage purchasing this game. There are also translation issues...a lot of translation issues. It's not bad enough to prevent you from understanding the story, but the translation was clearly not done by a dedicated team with previous experience. I find that the translation issues affect me the most during optional quests because it can be a little hard (not too hard though) to figure out what to do next when your instructions aren't translated properly. What I like about the localization, however, is that the original Mandarin voices are left in. I prefer reading subtitles than listening to dubbed voices.\n\nThe gameplay isn't bad. It could be better though. The original Taiwanese release had a much deeper battle system where you had a greater degree of control over all four characters. The Steam release dumbed down many aspects to suit console controllers (look for screenshots on Google or the Steam Community Hub Discussion forums for comparison). However, the battle system is still entertaining enough if you don't mind repetitive button combinations. I would love to see Softstar consider adding the Taiwanese control system back into the Western port though. It might give me more of an incentive to deploy the monsters you can capture or create in the game because right now, I very rarely use them. The AI-controlled characters will use up a lot of your HP- and MP-replenishing items, but this isn't much of a problem since it's easy to get money to buy a vast supply of replenishing items.\n\nBefore I finish up, I want to quickly talk about the soundtrack. It's obviously very Chinese-influenced, and it sounds amazing. It's also cheap. Very cheap. It's $1.39 but could easily go for $9.99.\n\nFinally, let's talk art and graphics. The art is obviously Chinese-influenced. Characters will be dressed in Chinese-style clothing and environments will feature Chinese architecture. The graphics are a bit outdated for a 2015/2016 game. They're more similar to a game that came out in 2007-2010. I have no problem with this though, the game still looks great. However, the optimization leaves much to be desired. I currently have a GTX 670, and I can run all the normal settings like texture and shadows at their highest level. However, all the post-processing effects like anti-aliasing bloom, depth of field, and SSAO led to significant frame rate drops. Even with all post-processing effects off, I can only get 40-45 FPS. I'm only playing with anti-aliasing on, and I can only maintain 28-35 FPS. Unfortunately, you can't do any downsampling in this game. Interestingly, in the menu, map, and title screen, I can get well over a hundred FPS. There are also rare occasions where the game suddenly stabilizes to a smooth 60+ FPS, but I don't know what causes this.\n\nI think any fan of RPGs will be happy with purchasing this game unless you absolutely can't stand long cutscenes or mediocre optimization. The price is also very reasonable, probably because it's been out for a year in Taiwan already. If you have any interest, please consider purchasing this game! I'd love to see it get more success on Steam so that Softstar might be convinced to localize other games in the series to the West.","March 26","true","88.7"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","17","19","3","0"

Now I have to say I am really proud that one of our game pieces can have a chance to go published on Steam. A lot of my friends, both on steam and in real life, know that I am a huge fan of RPGs derived from mythic and ancient tales. My favorite games in steam library, TW3 and Skyrim, both originate from tales of Legendia where you participate as part of them. (Check my reviews for them  here	)\nAnd that fanatic enthusiasm derives from the few RPGs I got access while I was a kid. XuanYuan Sword is definitely one of them. First off, this series offer some huge cultural and sensational elements with deep and rich stories for you to explore. I was so impressed by the stories and characters in this game that I can spend two nights without rest to complete the main storyline.  In addition to the story, the graphical designs are, although less than awesome, realistic reflections of the ancient tribes and cities. Every new area comes with multiple small quests and various monsters. Each individual character, as the main story progresses, also brings about their own side stories that deeply reflects their values and perception of the world. Some of the wits they said during the game, even affects my actions in real life.\nThe combat and gameplay in XuanYuan Sword and other domestic productions are something that always receive criticisms back in China and if you ever tried out some famous 3A RPGs, you will definitely find out why. The tactic used in Gate of Firmament is called a “turn-based combat” as we played in Final Fantasies. Restricted to the production costs and times, the combat in this series has never gotten rid of turn-based mode combats. Nor does Gate of Firmament. Thrifty and pitiful as it sounds, the combat does actually grow gradually interesting as the story proceeds. You have four branches to choose when you level up. Depending on your preferences, the character at hand can be performed as warriors, mages and supports. During combat, you are allowed to choose whoever you want to play and you can easily switch between characters when you think the AI on characters are not doing what you want. EZ and SIMPLE. Now, limited to the investment on the game, you won’t find the combat as immersive as you do in Skyrim, but the multifarious choices on how you want to level up your character abilities, the improved mechanisms do help you realize that SoftStar is trying to use up their every resources count.\nThe game has three language versions. As I have already played in Chinese versions, my English journey on XuanYuan Sword seems a bit off. I am not trying to say that the scripts are not understandable.  It’s just a bit too “Chinglish”. The original script and poems in this game series are so very-well written but the translation back to another language definitely ♥♥♥♥ed it up and diverged me off the trail. “SiKong, you were influenced by FengYu, why have you gotten so mean” in the thumbnail just laughed me off my chair. A professional English adaptor is still required!\nTechnically, this is a pretty sound game and given the relatively “cheap” investment on the game, I would give a 7/10. Does the verdict somehow contain my patriotic views on it? Yes. However, from the progression SoftStar has made, from 2d to 3d graphics, from domestic to Steam platform,  from PC to PlayStations, I can tell that SoftStar is ambitiously trying to show some of their improvements from time to time, propagating themselves to the world. The whole gameplay is smooth as ♥♥♥♥ and I have never received a game crash until now. The CG animations on critical plot timers are absolutely amazing. For friends who have never heard of XuanYuan Sword, definitely give Gate of Firmament a try. It is by far an awesome reflection of Chinese culture and sentimentally one of the most successful domestic games in my heart.","February 25","true","2.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","1"

Cutscenes tend to run long because while you can pause and skip dialog, you can't button through it. Considering the voice acting is not English (there are eng. subtitles), I was reading the dialog long before the voice actor finished speaking the line. I kept a Chrome tab open and quickly peaked down to read the subtitle in between browsing twitter to keep my ADD infested brain satisfied.\n\nCombat has you managing cool downs in real time, with party members intelligently attacking alongside you, but without any movement. There are no random battles as the enemies appear on the field and you can attack or avoid at your leisure. The music is amazing, oddly enough inspiring me to want to go back to Jade Empire, and the graphics aren't the sharpest but there are plenty of great looking environments.\n\nFor $15, this is an excellent game for those who want a different flavor of RPG than the usual Japanese or Western RPG.","February 28","true","2.2"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Everything is done well, but not well enough. I believe if Softstar have more resources and time, the game could've been so much better and so much more. Anyway, the story is good and that's what count the most in a traditional JRPG (yes, I know it's set in China).\n\nPros\n- Good Story. I didn't like it in the beginning as the characters are dull, but I started to like them progressing through the game. Well, at least 2 of them. The story gets better too, especially in the last quarter of the game.\n- Music. The music is good, though not as memorable as some of their past entries. Also, there are 3 theme songs to my surprise.\n- Great concept arts. Whether it be the characters, enemies, or stages, the concept arts are really good.\n- Many secret bosses.\n- Hidden endings.\n\nMixed\n- Battle system is fast paced and I like changing boost stats during battles. However, there is no way to change AI strategies, and they'll use up all your items. Also, you can blast through the game by using mainly 2 strategies; spaming ice magic, or have all 3 characters use physical attack and 沐月 using heal all. There were only 2 bosses that's strong enough that I have to change my strategy a bit to beat, and I never level grind.\n- CGs are really good, but the FPS is terrible. It's a shame CGs weren't recorded well.\n- Graphic is solid in general. Main characters look good, but not the rest of the cast. Also, character animation is really limited. The environment is a hit or miss. I dislike the levels with over saturated pink and red, but some stages look gorgeous. I especially like the final stage.\n- Gamdpad support. The gamepad works fine but hints are for keyboard and mouse. Also, puzzles can only be solved using a mouse.\n\nCons\n- LONG dialogues. The dialgues drag on for too long. It should be shortened and there should be an option to view the next line. It really messed up the pace of the game. And who talk like the in game characters in real life? Also, 2 main male casts need to man up. It's almost like I have a party of 4 female protagonists.\n- Tons of bugs. Just to name a few; I fell in underground once, battles ended a few times when I press pause, some achievements not working, get stuck in map (especially at XiaYi), black polygons showing on the skin of characters during a few cutscenes...etc. However, thank to auto save system, it saves me a ton of time when encounter what could've been game breaking bugs.\n\nDue to many short comings, I almost give up playing it, but I am glad I stick to it and finished the game. Ultimately, it's a good experience. Hopefully Softstar will bring more of their games on Steam. I also look forward to Xuan-Yuan Sword 8, built with a better game engine of course.","March 6","true","52.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

Unfortunately the translation is not that good. There are lots of errors and weird sentences, and in a couple of cases the spelling of important plot elements changes in different scenes, so you can get confused over what the characters are talking about. The story isn't interactive at all, either. You can't select any dialogue, you just watch the cutscenes.\n\nThat being said, I thought the story was pretty good and the characters were excellent. The translation was annyoing to read in some parts, but I did manage to understand what was going on. It helps that the story is a bit long-winded so things get repeated several times at various points.\n\nGraphical design in this game is awesome, even if the actual engine seems to be pretty dated. The backgrounds often literally look like paintings, color is used brilliantly in a way from which many western game designers could learn a thing or two. Why make a brown sewer level when you could make a gorgeous peach forest instead?\n\nThe music is also excellent, there are many quite memorable tracks in this game.\n\nUnfortunately the fighting system isn’t that good. You can only control one character at a time, and you can beat most battles by just pressing the attack button. The AI seems to be otherwise competent, but it wastes all your items. That will be changed in a patch soon, but the fighting in this game will not be very interesting after that either. Strangely enough, people in the forums have said the original version of the game had a better battle system. The version which was released on Steam and translated into English is apparently also going to come out for consoles, so they simplified the system. If you are fluent in Chinese, you may want the original version instead.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game if you want a long and audiovisually nice Chinese fantasy story. If you are looking for top notch RPG gameplay, then this doesn’t quite have that. What it does offer is a great sense of adventure and beautiful sights and sounds.","March 12","true","45.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

In my opinion those people simply cant get along with the chinese mythology theme or simple dont know what rpg means.\n\nSo before you start consider buying this game i can hint some things that might not be of your taste:\n\n1. The battles in this game are in fact very simple and i can agree, they could have been more strategic so far. You chose one of the four main characters (available at a certain progress), the others will be controlled by AI. There is not a huge skilltree. However you can catch monsters you face and use them for your own purpose in battles.\n\n2. The single maps are not very big (yet i still like it more like those very long corridors like in FF13 if you know what i mean)\n\n3. Graphics are out of date as you can see from many of the screenshots. You can get an impression if you have played the online mmorpg Swordsman (which was released by Perfect World and paired up with Softstar). However this does not mean the game doesnt look pretty. The chars are designed very detailed but some of the minor charakters sadly are not so detailed. The environments are quite beautiful.\n\n4. Maybe the worst aspect of the game is the English translation. I am aware that translations usually are a big challange especially for small indie developers, especially if you need a suiting professional voicecast, it simply is very expensive to translate with a lot of script and as my Chinese is sadly not very advanced i depend on a propper translation. I dont mind there is no English voicecast but the subs really need some polishment. Mostly you will understand the plot at the current state but it still can be quite annoying to see all the typos or bad grammar ( English is not my native language so i aswell have to apologize for any mistakes in my review)\n\n5. As i already said, its a classic RPG. If long cutscenes annoy you, if you dont like long scripts or deep stories this is really not your choice and you should probably avoid this game.\n\nThis beeing said i like the story so far.\n\nThe music adds a lot to the storys background and i do really enjoy the chinese voicecast. They speak very clearly and sometimes i do not even need the subs. The voices really suit the charakters well.\n\nThe interface is very very simple.\nThere are plenty of weapons, acessories, armors etc. Also there is a wiki for your gear and the monsters.\nThe maps show locations of treasures, events and restore points. Also the quest log is very useful and shows available quests/ active quests and finished quests.\nYou can freely switch between the main charakters once they have joined your party.\n\n\nOnce i have completed the game, i will edit this review to add more details.\n\nI really recommend this game to rpg fans who are curious about the chinese mythology theme. It is a really relaxing, beautiful game even if kept a little simple. If you study the Chinese language you might get something to practise with aswell.","March 6","true","49.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","9","10","3","1"

Heard Steam version has change quite a lot of things, but I'm not sure when will I play it again in Steam.\n\nTBH, this is not the title in Xuan-Yuan Sword series I love most. And IMO, this is also not the strongest title in the series. BUT, it is still a decent game, and consider the Steam version's price, I think I can say it is worth every penny.\n\nCurrently there are 12 titles in Xuan-Yuan Sword series, all single player story mode Chinese RPG, except upcoming 13th (mark as 7) is an online game, like FF11 and FF14 in FF series. Each story is not so related, just under the same worldview, which is a combination of some modified world history, several mythology literatures and its own fantasy elements.\n\nSome titles mark with numbers, as a way to show it uses new technology or game mode, different than previous title. Some titles do not have numbers but has sub-title, are prequel or sequal to corresponding different titles with numbers, and have improved system with same technology.\n\nLike this one, is the prequel of Xuan-Yuan Sword 6, both using Unity, and this one is improve so much in every way. But as I said before, the story is not so related, each can be played standalone. Maybe some characters will be cross-over, maybe some previous story will be mentioned, just consider that as easter eggs.\n\nChinese RPG, CRPG, is much like JRPG. As for this game, the story is mostly lineal, some might say event cutscenes are too long, but for me, long story is why I love CRPG/JRPG; the combat system is kinda like ATB; forging equipment; collecting and merging monsters to create powerful guardian; talks to NPC before and after events, etc.\n\nI'm more concern about the translation. There are many Chinese words are hard to translate into English, and the game didn't provide appendix, player has to memorize transliteration words, hard to know what they actually meant. But after reading several reviews here, maybe I'm overthinking.\n\nFinally, thank you for your patient if you read through this bad English grammer review. But still I shamelessly wrote in English, for my first review in Steam, just to hope I can help it spread worldwide.\n\nP.S. My profile picture is actually come from one of the title in Xuan-Yuan Sword series, which I love the most.","February 28","true","0.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","8","10","2","0"

The feeling of battle is a little weak, though. If the game performed under the hard level, you would found more challengable during the battle.\n\nThe comments of beautiful scenery are everywhere. That's true. The scenery is pretty good. With improvement of game engine U3D and technical skills of SOFTSTAR staff, the scene looks amazing and object models are more realistic. Believe me, this game can implement every scene with different style that you may not imagine. You can even do nothing except for staying and looking around by pressing Q and E. Most importantly, you may spend  just 12 dollars or nearly 10 pounds on all the beautiful scenery with Chinese style.\n\nI love Qingmei and Muyue both. Qingmei is a quite tender girl with beautiful voice. She is adorable and sticks to her faith from Sikong Yu, however, even stubborn. Compared with Qingmei, Muyue seems to be elegant and speechless. She is belonging to the Kingdom of HUAXU, which is a sort of human race made by diamond or jade in China. It's an acient fairy tale. Muyue has no emotion at first and no friendship in the world. I anticpate her relationship with her friends.\n\nYou know, some behaviors in the GoF (Gate of Firmament) are a bit strange in different culture, even with excellent translation, such as civil law in acient China, which serves for the emperor of Shang dynasty. If you have a question or want to implement a friendly discussion, the Chinese guy can provide any help to explain the civil system in acient China. Good luck. To ken what you want to ken.\n\nEquality is a  hot topic of GoF. I would explain to you why Fengyu has 60 wives. In the contemporary world, we're all Joke Tamson's baird. We are equal no matter race, ethnic or gender. In acient China, things are not things as it looks like. You may believe male has his power as well as more rights while female has no power and little right. That's right. However, NOT IN KINGDOM OF HUAXU. human race in HUAXU is totally different. Woman has power and they can have right to hold their family name. is that interesting? Muyue is from that place. BTW, Mu is not Muyue's family name. Her family name is FENG, the meaning of which is wind.\n\nIn the group of main characters, Fengyu and Ziqiao are real people in Shang dynasty. You can get through very deeply about Chinese acient history as game peforms to find out who they are.\n\nOverall, this game has great implementation with lower price. And I believe it will bring me a lot of joy!\n","February 26","true","8.3"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","8","11","3","1"

Cutscenes are beautifully polished with excellent voice-acting if not for the shadow problem. Background music feels like a world-class collection set for the immersive touch.\n\nStory & Lore: (under review)\n\nCombat is fast, not to easy and fun with easy handling. Although I wish the developer tuned the battles to be longer with less grind-y frequency. It would be better to fight each enemy types only once instead of a few times. The top voice acting could be a great addition in the battle as the fight becomes more meaningful.\n\nThe fun combat inspired me to imagine a better combat system with body parts targeting instead of simply using skills on an enemy. The rich martial arts lore of the far east could be very grand archives to architect each fights with, and to give a stronger impression for the characters.\n\nOverall: I think this game could be a Game of the Year contender if properly patched and maybe with some more animation frames and programming polishing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Travakh/recommended/427030/","Travakh","Travakh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Travakh/","405 products in account","As a JRPG, this game is mediocre. The graphics are middling to bad in terms of texture and model quality (PS2 era at its worst). The gameplay is grindy and devolves into Musou style button mashing the majority of the time. A mechanically complex battlefield control system gets stunted by the fact that your other party members are more or less uncontrollable and will drain away your health and mana potions if you let them. The pacing is horrific - you get 10-15 minutes of dungeon crawling between 20+ minute in-engine cutscenes where you don't touch the keyboard or mouse at all.\n\nBut this isn't a JRPG - mostly because it's made by Chinese people in Taiwan. What this is, is a video game version of a Chinese TV Wuxia drama, and in that it's absolutely fantastic. If you've watched many CN Wuxia Dramas, it's pretty bog standard - Shang dynasty history + mythology, characters are more or less the same, the storyline is pretty good but not amazing. That by no means makes the game bad - there are at least a hundred hours of voiced lines by the characters, the story is mostly historically accurate (well, at least faithful to CN mythology), the soundtrack is outstanding. So by the standards of an interactive Wuxia show in video game form, this is top notch.\n\nI'd rather play this than a modern Final Fantasy, that's for sure. If you want standard JRPG, Nep Nep is around the corner.","March 7","true","7.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","7","11","3","0"

For it's asking price it is extremely value for money. The graphics in this game is just average. I do not expect much in the graphics department for Chinese games. However the soundtrack in the game is amazing. The only complain I have is the inconsistency in the character models and their acting. It is obvious they spend a lot of time on the main lead characters but very little effort on every other things. Not only the models are obvious. Even during their voice acting, the animation is obvious too. But nonetheless I still appreciate the game is fully voice acted. Yes I do understand Chinese. But even for those of you out there who do not understand, you are good to go with the English translation too. Not the best translation but it does get the job done. Maybe it help you learn some Chinese too...\n\nWhile the game is pretty linear, It does have some exploration like running around new areas looking for chest. Combat system is pretty generic. A hybrid between action and turn based. Nothing to brag about here. There are also crafting system in the game which honestly I have not explore much so I cannot give much comment about them. Skill system is pretty simple and straight forward too. The most important thing that make this game stand out is th story. The story telling in the game is amazing. This is something that is hard to find these days in many other RPGs out there. It may start slow, but really does get interesting as you play deeper. It gets funny at times, emotional too. If you love great story in games, really recommend to get this game.\n\nAlso do support hte OST. It is rather cheap for it's asking price. As said in the review, the soundtrack in this game is really amazing.

At this point I have roughly 3.5 hours played and I'll wager I've only actually "played" maybe 45mins to an hour tops. The rest has just been watching long, awkwardly directed and horribly translated cutscenes.\n\nI really, really want to play this game. I can forgive the dated graphics. I don't care that there's no English dub. I don't mind the simplistic combat... (I do hate the fact that you have to manually rotate the camera to stay behind you.)\n\nThe one thing I can't abide though, is a poor translation. If you're going to release your game in an English speaking region (or Russian speaking, or French speaking... whatever), make sure it's TRANSLATED PROPERLY INTO THAT LANGUAGE! If you're going to make me sit through hours of cutscenes, at least MAKE THE SUBTITLES SUCH THAT THEY MAKE SENSE! From a lot of the reviews I've read, this game has a great, deep story. How do they expect me to grasp it if their translation is crap?","April 12","false","3.5"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

(I was unwilling to write a not-recommended review of those games which were made in China.)\n_____________________________\n\nTo be honest, the game has a little bit advancement than its last edition. But, far from being enough.\n\n1.The CG and the video graphic have not been optimized. So there were some moments that get a lot frame drop, gets me angry when I playing this game. These problems make this game a feeling of slack and stumble.\n\n2.Movements of characters are also stiff. I can not even move my character accurately with clicking my left mouse button. OK, since it is not accurate when using the mouse, I used my keyboard, but wait!!! The damn frame drop makes it feel so unsmooth when I was changing the view. What an antinomy!!!\n\n3.Let me ask a question: Why the models and the graphics look like some "scraps of paper" in almost all of domestic games??? I could not feel them like entities. Don't the game designers feel weird???\n_____________________________\n\nI want to give some support to domestic game companies indeed. But as a consumer I am not satisfied with the quality of their productions.\n\nWhy can not you create a splendid RPG game like THE WITCHER or THE ELDER SCROLLS??? It is time for you to make some changes.","May 27","false","0.6"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","2","7","2","0"

This is more movie then game, its like gameplayX10min = cutscene.\nThe story itself is bit confusing, full of cliches, super predictable progression and even if you win the boss fight you are intended to lose you lose. Many times during the dialogue (specially before and after bandit boss) I facepalmed, laughed and raged at the same time and the "combat" is pretty much just button mashing.\n\nI can't really recommend this game to anyone, unless you are in serious need of Chinese mythology fix..and even then proceed with caution.","March 4","false","3.1"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","6","21","0","0"
