"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/recommended/291390/","charkie","Charkie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charkie/","1425 products in account","This just isn't a good game.\n\nThree Dead Zed is a puzzle-platformer game where you can switch between three different forms at will; a default form that can climb ladders and interact with objects, a heavy form that can deal extra damage and break certain blocks, and a light form that is agile and can walljump, but can't attack. The puzzles are very light; it's almost all about finding the right switch or destroying the right generator to unlock the path forward.\n\nThe problem with the game is the controls just don't feel right. Since the heavy form can't traverse anything and the normal form is still relatively slow with poor jumping abilities, you'll mostly be platforming as the nimble light form. But the platforming just doesn't feel good. Jumping and landing accurately feels like it's much harder than it should be, and there are some absolutely ridiculous spikes in difficulty that just seem unfair. At one point I had to quit the game to do something else, but I was in the middle of a level and thought "I better just finish this first because there is no way I ever want to play this level again." That is a bad sign for a game, period.\n\nThe main game took 90 minutes to beat, but it unlocked a challenge mode. But really, when the story mode was just a complete slog to get through, there's no way I'm going to want to play a more frustrating version of that. Don't buy this game.","July 7, 2014","false","1.5"," 42 of 64 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","42","64","0","2"

For me however, this game had too many frustrating deaths and not enough puzzles that really challenge the player's problem solving skills. I enjoyed my time with Three Dead Zed and was very satisfied after completing the main story levels but am in no way committed enough to push through the challenge rooms that remain. Three Dead Zed is a good indie title and has earned 6.5 out of 10 from me.\n\nSTORY\nThree Dead Zed tells the story of Subject Zed, a scientifically engineered zombie that must escape the confines of the lab in which it was created, by rescuing cats in tinfoil hats. The player is guided through each level by a mysterious telepathic entity, that has lost touch with its cat infiltration team. As Subject Zed you must use your ability to change forms to traverse extremely dangerous and increasingly difficult areas with the overall goal being, to remove the tinfoil hat of the cat trapped there. I enjoyed the story on the whole, and had a good chuckle at the office warning posters and the very funny line delivery of the science lab PA announcer.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nControls in Three Dead Zed are extremely basic and easy to get the hang of, but are a real challenge to master under pressure. The three different forms of Subject Zed have their own purpose in each level, and it's in this high paced, form swapping the game really gets difficult. The classic form is able to attack with low damage, jump small distance, flick switches and climb ladders. The sprinter form moves extremely quickly, can jump higher and further but is unable to attack or interact with in level items. The final form, the brute, is able to soak up damage well and deal large damage but is unable to interact with in level items or jump. Changing between the three forms is quick and easy, but  with everything in the levels designed to kill you, it isn't always straight forward picking the right zombie for the job.\n\nThe level design as a whole is good, with the game being based more around the challenge of high speed and accurate platforming than it is around the solving of puzzles. There are enemies dotted throughout the levels to keep things interesting and a few box stacking, and switch flicking challenges, but for the most part, the way you'll die is through movement mistakes like miss-jumps. This game can be brutal in some sections where the player has to repeat a series of difficult jumps and climbs, which can causing frustration very quickly. I got stuck in some sections and ended up repeating it 20 plus times before getting to the next check point, and I am not too proud to admit that I took advantage of the rage quit option this game offers on several occasions.\n\nEven with the rage quit incidents, I still completed the main story line within a couple of hours, but for the price this is a decent length and does not detract from the experience. After completing the main story the player is able to take on challenge rooms, which are far more difficult than those found in the story mode. I am happy that the developer included the challenge room as an option after the main story missions but due to this game being based more around the platforming than the puzzles I was not motivated enough to push through these levels.\n\nVISUALS & MUSIC\nThe art style and sound featured in Three Dead Zed are a real strength of the game. I never grew tired of the orange blood splatters throughout the levels that showed my errors from previous attempts. The levels and characters have a beautiful hand drawn look, and the transformation and movement animations are great fun to watch. The sound can get repetitive in some of the more trying levels, but on the whole fits well with the rooms and changes pace accordingly in difficult locations.\n\nFor my full review and heaps of other delicious content see Glitch[glitchnews.com.au]","October 15, 2014","true","3.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The Heavy is a slow and ultimately un-maneuverable class which deals increased damage and has great health; its jump ability should be removed, i have a large monitor, and it barely moved half an inch on it. The Classic's abilities are being able to climb ladders and to activate switches -with normal health and attack capabilities; The Classic can jump -though not very far compared to The Sprinter. The Sprinter is extremely fast and can jump far -sometimes too far, for a compromise: it cannot attack and has little health.\n\nOverall i think that it has potential to be a really good game if the devs put a little more work into the physics and controls -the controls feel different and strange, you move way to far for a tap and jumping needs a serious patch. The keyboard mapping is ridiculous -thank God the controls are near each other.\n\nI would recommend buying this game in a sale, it is good value for sale money and if you have a lot of time to kill.","May 19, 2015","true","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

As you progress in the story, it keeps getting more and more challenging. With time, you'll have to think at least 15 minutes at only one puzzle to understand how to solve it, which is why I don't recommend this game to people that are impatient or to those few who would set their house on fire only because they've died a few times in Flappy Bird.\nThree Dead Zed was meant to be a challange to gamers, so expect to die a lot, at least till you've finally understood the mechanics.\nThe concept of the game has a very interesting idea at the base of it. I saw some games with zombies, but I never saw a single-player game in which you could actually control the zombie in it. And not only that, but you have the chance to solve puzzles with 3 different forms of zombies at will. The default form that can climb ladders and interact with objects, a heavy form that can deal extra damage and break certain blocks, and a light form that is agile and can walljump, but doesn't attack.\nWhat could be more fun than this? Trust me, if you're a zombie lover like me, you'll like this game!\n\nPros- If the single-player wasn't enough for you, you'll still have to complete the challenges that will unlock after you finish the game.\n- An friendly and adorable artwork that catches your eyes from the very first time you check it's store page.\n- An humorous story with cats included in it.\n- Support for Achievements and Trading Cards.\n- Support for Steam Cloud which will save your ♥♥♥ if something happens to your Windows.\n- If you have a bad day, you'll have the chance to kill people in this game while they are trying to live their pathetic and meaningless life.\n- The music is similar to 8-bit gaming, which makes it compatible to people from the nostalgic era.\n- The puzzles are very light, almost all levels are about finding the right switch or destroying the right generator to unlock the path forward.\n\nCons- It's almost practically impossible to finish the game with less than 30 deaths, at least for me, which makes the achievements harder than it sounds for achievement hunters.\n- A lot of rage quitting is included with the purchase of the game.\n- Controls feel a little unnatural.\n\nConclusionWhile the game may get at your nerves sometimes, it's a thoroughly enjoyable puzzle platformer with a humorous story that will keep you pumped the entire game, cats that will make you smile and challenges that will make your brain's life hard. If you care for your neurons, buy this game and give it a chance. I'm giving it an 3.5 out of 5 for all the hard work the developers put in making this game.\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified's Community Reviews program and the credit goes to both Steamified and Gentleman Squid Studio for providing the key for review purposes.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

My favorite of all time is Super Mario 2. It gave you the option to pick one of four characters, each of whom had different abilities.  If you chose the correct one, you got through the level a lot easier than if you chose poorly.  In Three Dead Zed, you not only get to swap characters, you get to do it mid-level!  It becomes not only necessary to choose the right Zombie, but it also becomes a skill one must master in order to proceed further into the game.  Not only is this ingenious, it’s a hell of a lot of fun!\n\nThe puzzles increase in complexity and difficulty as you progress (Which is what you would expect), and it keeps you entertained.  I especially love how a nice splatter of your former self remains after you die and are reborn to try the level again.\n\nThe Controls are great if you have a controller.  Xbox360 recommended, but if you are familiar with playing FPS games on a keyboard, you won’t find any difficulty here.  The controls are mapped out in a good way and you can change them if you like.  I switched it to Minecraft controls and found it was easier to go with the defaults so I switched back.\n\nThe Artwork is amazing!  I love the zombies and the detail that went into the animations of the game.  The background animations and static images are well placed and look great.  I don’t know much about the difficulty in lighting games, but the shadows and lighting seemed to be really well done.  This helped to provide a really enjoyable and differing environment throughout my gameplay.\n\nThe sound effects are well suited for the game and can be quite funny at times.  The music is similar to 8-bit gaming, which rings my nostalgia bell so I enjoyed that as well.\n\n3DZ is a lot of fun and adds something new to both the platformer and zombie genre… which in this day and age, is something to admire.  Three types of zombies means three times the fun!  If you are a fan of zombie stuff, get the game!  If you are a fan of platformers, get the game!  And if you are a fan of both, why haven’t you already gotten the game?\n","July 8, 2014","true","2.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"
