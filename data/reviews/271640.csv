The uncomfortable controlling and moving (+shooting) delay also bothers me a lot. Moreover, weapons system, action of enemies and main character's ability are too monotonous to provide players enjoyment.\n\nAs a simple 2D action-adventure game, Humanity Asset lacks the refinded interface, operation fluency and complexity (playabilityl) compared with most of similar games I played before. This is totally not a 9.99$ game should be like.\n\nSorry for the negative rating, but I'd really like to see how this game could be improved in the future.","March 13, 2014","false","7.3"," 83 of 97 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","83","97","0","0"

None of it was built around any of the mechanics it presented. Wave after wave of non-unique enemies, controls that the game was clearly not built around, dialogue not worth the time taken to type it out, and an overall feel of terrible unpolishedness. This isn't a metroidvania and I really recommend withdrawing that tag for the sake of the genre. It has nothing in common with the genre as this specific genre is built around movement and gradual character building. This game is running forward, shooting, and dying.

How about the ghetto N64 and PSX games that most people forget, like Chameleon Twist or Quest 64 or Blast Chamber? The stuff that didn't make it into the history books. The stuff that had iffy graphics, slowdown, bugs and difficulty spikes. It wasn't really focus tested or target-marketed. Most people would call it "bad."\n\nIf you're anything like me, though, those games stayed with you despite the flaws. They had charm and a sense of discovery, and their problems were only capital-P Problems if you wanted to see them that way. For you, maybe they were just weird quirks to work around. Maybe you found out later that critics really attacked those quirks in their reviews. After that, maybe you became too quick to dismiss a game for those same reasons.\n\nPlaying Humanity Asset takes me back to the old days, before all the critics. Graphically it looks like the 2.5D sidescrollers from the N64/PSX period: stuff like Goemon's Great Adventure and Tomba. Those are not popular reference points for games these days--nostalgia junkies prefer the 16-bit look, for some reason--but that doesn't make them bad ones. Its gameplay also brings to mind games of that period, but mixed in with Mega Man and Metroid influences (it is not a Metroidvania, though).\n\nIs there brutal slowdown? Yes. Is it a "polished masterpiece" like Mass Effect 2? No. But I uninstalled Mass Effect 2 after 2.8 hours because it bored me. It had no soul. Humanity Asset was made by the Thai one-man-team Browny Application, and you can feel the passion the creator put into it. The levels are interesting and (insanely) varied--you never feel like you're crawling through the same old corridor over and over. There are lots of charming little touches, like the way that every enemy has a name. The list goes on: incredible boss fights, tons of secrets, great music, weapons with vastly different attacks. The game doesn't hold your hand at all (unlike the sanitized "retro" games people make now), but it's easy enough to figure out your goals if you pay attention to the well-designed minimap.\n\nAs a translation from Thai by a no-budget developer, Humanity Asset's script is in broken English, like many now-classic Japanese games from the 80s and 90s. Still, the writing has charm, and you can figure out what people are saying when you pay attention. That, by the way, is a big reason for the negativity in this game's user reviews: gamers aren't willing to pay attention anymore. They're trained to be guided by the hand around beautiful, sterilized environments. If you can't play a game without a direction arrow, or without cutscenes, then stay away from Humanity Asset. Its magic will escape you.\n\nFor everyone else, I'd recommend it. If it'd been released on the N64, it would sit on the sleeper-classic shelf right next to stuff like Mischief Makers. It's priced a bit high at $10, so grab it on sale--or get it for free, like I did. Once you have it, brace yourself for a messy experience... but a fantastic one, and one that, if you let it, might stick with you for a very long time.","June 11, 2015","true","10.0"," 57 of 92 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","57","92","7","0"

But...I do like Metroidvania games, perhaps it's better than it looks! Can't hurt to check it out, right?\n\nWrong! There are no redeeming features to this game, it's really not worth your time.\n\nIt's hard to explain how it manages to be as bad and as bland is it does, and it rather mystifies me. It's like someone took a few ideas from various games, copied them, threw uninspired graphics on top of them, lumped in a bunch of extremely broken English and nonsensical 'plot,' and then finished by forgetting to put the fun in. The 'crafting' system seems extremely limited and beyond useless. The gameplay itself? It's extremely bland and unfulfilling. Again, it's a mystery how, exactly, it manages this.\n\nEach aspect of the game alone sounds like it could be fun, but as a whole it somehow manages to be far less than the sum of its parts.\n\nIt's not even so bad it's funny.

No worries, because you're still going to have one if you stop playing this game for a while. It has super cool graphics that is better than even the latest Call of Duty. . .what was it again? I don't know, they release many Call of Duty titles lately. And even the 2D graphics are so polished and the HUD is so clean, it will make Team Fortress 2 HUD mods nothing compared to it!!!

What everyone has been saying is true. Some of worst graphics I have ever seen. Nonexistant story. Every gun shot looks the exact same and trouble telling the difference. The crafting/weapon part swapping system doesn't work and is worthless and confusing. The levels are boring and uninspired and the worst part of the game. You run around these giant levels with 20 different branching paths with no direction trying to find keys to run back to a prior part open a gate. Some sort of direction or information would prevent the backtracking and getting lost. The open-ness doesn't actually help and something more linear and less backtracking/confusing would be good. Also the enemies are pretty uninteresting. 4/10","December 20, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","1"

THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT]\n\nHumanity Asset\n\nA game where you can fully explore a vast 2-D landscape as an Orange Alien trying to take over Earth. Now I don't really want to get too into the game since there would be alot of spoilers. You have a  vast arsenal of weapons: Miniguns, Lasers, Shotguns, Machineguns, and even a little cute A.I. that follows you around. With great A.I. and the graphics that are astounding(For a 10$ game of course!), its a good, even great attempt at a\nmetroid-vania game!\n\nPros\n-Gameplay: Astounding. Shooting polygons felt so right as the massive weaponry I could use made it one of my all time favourite game. Even a classic!\n\n-Soundtrack: So good that it's even my ringtone!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrkSFwvQSOE\n\n-Mechanics: Sliding and jumping are great, but could use a little polishing as I sometimes find that im slipping off edges that I shouldn't be sliding off of, but it's still good\n\n-Graphics: Phenominal. Static backgrounds are great for those computers that can't run crysis on thier computers, so the developers did think of the low-end PC gamers with computers not as good as mine. Even if my computer is great, I love seeing the classic tree background, or just plain dirt. And boy do I love seeing dirt.\n\nCons\nAre you stupid? There are no Cons. Other reviews are wrong\n\nConclusion\n\nBUY THIS GAME\n\nIts worth the 10 bucks. When its on sale, then its even better! You cannot compare this to any other high-market games such as CallOfDuty, MetalGearSolid, LeagueOfLegends, Zelda, or even Heartstone! This game is great with a powerful backstory of taking over the earth and how a lone alien does it all,\n\n10/10 Where is my sequel?","July 6, 2014","true","12.7"," 16 of 51 people (31%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","31","16","51","7","4"

It's obviously inspired by older metroid games. In geeral nothing special really but it's something you can still play. There are 15 stages and not 16 as the steam description says. There are lots of weapons which dont have description of what type is and it's functionality, damage etc, you pick it up and test it your self on a go. Interaction with npcs is limited, they are there to make the game somewhat alive, no direct interaction just random lines that repeat every time you're near them. Sometimes the enemy and allies look the same, which is quite confusing. The performance of the game is terrible, it states that it needs a dualcore PC while on last gen quadcore the fps is all over the place. Going from 100+ dropping down to 30-20 fps and round it goes.\nAnother downside is the price, currently it's 10 euros and that is too much for this type of game. It should be only 1-2 euros. No replay value, unless you don't have anything else to play which I doubt. That's basically all.\n\n+ not that bad platformer inspired by old Metroid games, some things could be better\n- the price is too high for what it is and the performance is terrible","August 23, 2015","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
