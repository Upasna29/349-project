The game can get very frustrating and you will be stuck here and there which can drag out the game quite a bit. So be sure you can handle a bit of anger or rage :P\n\nThe looks are great- they fit the game pretty nice and it runs smooth.\n\nAll in all the game is definitly worth a try, especially for indie fans.\nIt will kill one or another hour ;)","March 31","true","2.6"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

Because of the game being fairly short, this review won't be as detailed as some of the other reviews I have done in the past.\n\nGameplayThis game seems to be a give or take from want the other reviews have been saying. The game itself is a very simple and fun farming simulator. Although the game has some simplistic mechanics that most farming games all posses, the game can be rather challenging at times for those gamers who aren't so advanced to this type of gameplay. Something rather unique about this game is that is has small puzzles which you have to get through and figure out how to complete. Luckily, there are checkpoints that are planted through the game making it easy to reset and get straight back into the game. The game does seem to have a diverse range of different levels that you play through during the course of the game, For example level 2 is a stealth mission, and level 3 is endless runner. The endless runner is rather difficult and rage-enducing, you will either give up in rage or be able t hold yourself together and make it through the level and continue on.\n\nThe graphics of this game are ok I guess. I mean the it's all rather like the same colour throughout the land. The grass is all the same shade of green, and although your character is in 3D, the game doesn't bother to add grass and just keep it all one colour. This does seem to me that the developer was lazy, and that this game was rushed.\n\nAs for the music, I found it rather boring and repetitve for the most part and decided to turn it off because it was just off putting me from playing through the rest of the game. The sounds are okay, their not as crisp as they could be and sometimes the games audio seems to be lower than needed.\n\nResult / Final thoughtsFor the current state that this game is in, with the boring and repetitve nature of this game would not recommened playing this game. The levels are too diverse for my liking, the game may seem like a simple farming simulator when it comes to the actual gameplay the game varies from the types of levels.\n\nRating: 4.6/10","April 21","false","4.0"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

It's much more fun than a simple farm simulator. The game is also quite challenging for not so advanced gamers. There are also small puzzles which you have to manage and I really like the way how the checkpoints are set.\nAll in all, it's a nice game to kill time and it has replay potential.","April 3","true","1.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I liked this portion of the game the best, but I completely forgot what happens afterwards and was surprised. The levels began somewhat easy then got more difficult and longer as they continued. Along with a chase scene in between. I feel as if the chase idea was somewhat stolen from other games (such as Temple Run, Subway Surfer, etc.) I viewed it as 3 different game types mashed into one short game. The stealth portion of the game got stressful due to the fact that I messed up at certain parts, but certain checkpoints help you continue back to where you left off.\n\nI am mainly upset at the fact majority of the screenshots displayed a farming game, but in reality that part lasted me maybe 5 minutes. It was most likely easy to guess it wouldn't last long due to the fact of how small the starting map was. If you explore it the only things you find is your farm and a small stand for the seeds. I wished the developers would of included more screenshots of the stealth portion than to have screenshots of (most likely) the shortest portion of the game.\n\nThe graphics are okay, not horrible but not the best. The coloring of the world is simple, no different shades really. As for the music, as soon as I launched the game I noticed I had to turn it on myself and it was not enabled already. I am unsure if it is like this for anyone else, but I played through the game without any sound. I went back and enabled it to help me write this review. The main soundtrack though, seems quite annoying. The main beat is repeated and does not change at all (I would recommend muting it to keep one's sanity.) Sound effects are not bad, better than the music. I just think it's a tiny bit weird I can hear the river across the map as clear as I can next to it. Could be better.\n\nThoughts\nNot really worth it. After I finished my save deleted. I wasn't even allowed to go back to my farm (;-;) which was kinda disappointing. The puzzles were a bit annoying along with the fact since I played it all in one sitting it didn't save my settings (example: windowed, resolution, etc.) which could maybe be annoying for people who might want to play it again for the achievements. The game shouldn't be worth $3.99 and more so the price I bought it ($0.99)","May 25","false","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not sure what the name is supposed to tell us, but the game is, for me, somewhat of a mess.\n\nGraphically the game is OK. It's better than some of the modern "pixel art" games that look like C64 rejects. This one looks like it came from an N64 demo.\n\nSound wise, I never listen to game music, I've always found it off putting, so I won't comment on that. The rest of the audio seemed fine. There was nothing outstanding about it, but also nothing bad about it either.\n\nGame play.... This is where I just went: WTF ?\nInitially the game starts as a farming simulator. You have one chicken, one plot of land with 6 spaces to farm an item, and very little money.  You harvest your crop, pick up a chicken egg, buy seeds, plant seeds, sleep, and repeat that process until for some magical reason the army turns up.\n\nI had to plant & harvest at least a dozen times before the army showed up.  There was no reason for it, they just show up one morning.  You then run for your life to escape, which puts you into the next level....\n\nLevel 2 is a stealth mission which sees you sneaking past army men.  One wrong turn and you're all the way back to the beginning.  Repeat this half a dozen times for "reasons" (i.e. random occurrences that  cause the army men to turn around and see you) and you will escape the army camp.\n\nLevel 3 is an endless runner, where you can change lanes, duck and jump over obstacles.  Every time you die you start back at the beginning of the level.  It's easy to make mistakes, and you'll be repeating this level until one of two things happen. You finish the level or you quit in disgust and then idle the game for the cards.\n\nI chose option two. I quit the game at that point and will idle the cards, remove the game and never bother with it again in the next few days.\n\nThe game seems to want to try to be a mixture of everything, but fails at most of them. The farming is tedious and repetitive with an artificially imposed limit on what you can buy at the shop (most of the shop items are ghosted out for "reasons"). The stealth section(s?) are frustrating and the endless runner is as well.\n\nIn the end: don't bother. If the game doesn't know what it wants to be, then you shouldn't be parting with money to help the developers confused state.\n\nUpdate: 25th Apr 2016 - I made it to level 4 and it's another stealth level. After a bunch of tries to clear it, I've given up again. The game just isn't fun to play.","April 21","false","2.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This game is a waste of money and time, for the first 5 minutes you farm, and by the way the farming mechanics arn\'t great, all you do is buy crops and animals place them down and go to your house then in the morning you wake up harvest your crops and do it again, anyway 5 mins into the game, the game makes it so army people come in and you have to do boring, annoying,ragy,and just overall bad puzzles that just taker sooooooo long and then after u just farm again!!!!!
