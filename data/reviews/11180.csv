This is because the game is nothing but a horrid mutant sibling that the family kept locked in the basement out of the eyes of the world. For $10, you'd expect it to be at least similar to the other Sherlock Holmes games. Wrong.\n\nThe game was designed to be a casual take on the Sherlock Holmes games. Given the price and tedious gameplay, this game wouldn't even suit mobile phones. It feels more like a forgetable flash game that you found on the internet but with a price tag. It is nothing but a shallow attempt to emulate the classic Sherlock Holmes stories. The story is simple. A painter was found dead and wrapped up in an expensive Persian Carpet and the Holmes/Watson duo must solve the mystery. The story is however minimal.  At the beginning of each level, Holmes explains to a mostly silent Watson that they need to look around somewhere to get closer to solving the case. Watson, we need to check the theatre. Watson, we need to look at the garden again. That's it. The story is told through the witness testimonies and clues you find across the game. But you don't get to take a second look at most of the clues and if you try to critically think about the crime, you'll soon enough forget it due to the incredibly frustrating gameplay. Don't worry. There is no bad ending. The final puzzle will explain it all.\n\nThe gameplay of The Persian Carpet is made up of two parts. The first is the puzzles which are fairly challenging and enjoyable. There are unfortunately a few frustrating ones that you can use your limited "Skip Puzzle" tokens to get through. One such puzzle was stroking water over a picture and then sponge it to reveal the image. The cursor doesn't read well and you have to spend minutes having to stroke every square until the game decides "Good enough" and finishes it for you. The second part is the most infuriating element of the game. You're sent to a room where you have to play I Spy for clues. But I Spy is fun. Many clues are either camoflagued with the environment or almost the size of a grain of sand. Even in my years of experience with all kinds of adventure games, this game has the most infuriating pixel hunts I've ever seen. I spent 30 minutes in a room trying to find this door plate that turned out to be the same color as the floor and that I came across by rapid clicking.\n\nThe game is thankfully short, only 1-2 hours in length. It doesn't help that the entry price was $10, the same price as most of the Sherlock Holmes games on Steam. Just after finishing the game, I went on to  Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silver Earring (thankfully a much better game). But I soon discovered that some of the scenes were used for the Persian Carpet game. It turns out that Mystery of the Persian Carpet is not only shallow but lazy, stitched together with images from other games like a braindead Frankenstein monstrosity.\n\nIt's very disappointing to see The Mystery of Persian Carpet worth the same price as the Case of the Silver Earring. The Case of the Silver Earring has great voice acting, great graphics, less pixel hunt frustration and a much more interesting story. The Case of the Silver Earring came out in 2004. The Mystery of the Persian Carpet came out in 2008. The opening cutscene of The Case of the Silver Earring alone is much better than the entire Persian Carpet game. How did this mess happen? Perhaps I should send a letter to 221b Baker Street to have them investigate how such a terrible game was made and sold at equal price among its superior siblings.","June 14, 2014","false","3.2"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","15","19","6","0"

A "casual" game should have been enjoyable:  moderately challenging without being impossible.  Unfortunately, two major issues prevent me from recommending this game.  The first, and most frustrating one, is that many of the items we're supposed to find are extremely difficult to find.  Some are difficult because they're so small; others blend into the background.  I had to use most of my limited, non-renewable hints to find those items.  The other deal breaker for me is the difficulty of the puzzles and the deduction board.  Instructions are unclear and incomplete, so I often had a hard time figuring out just what I was supposed to be doing.\n\nIf there were a way to replenish hints, the game might have been more enjoyable.

On the other hand, the locations are brilliantly illustrated. The main problem is: even after solving the murder, it is only when Holmes is explaining the course of events that you understand what's going on, or at least you don't need to understand anything to complete the game, since there are not enough intermediate check-up or summaries like in the following games of the series.\n","February 22, 2014","false","6.9"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/recommended/11180/","shiaakuma","shiaakuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/","696 products in account","Skip to the bottom for TL;DR summary.\n\nI took a chance on this game despite the mostly negative ratings, since many of those ratings seemed based on the fact that it's a Hidden Object style game instead of the usual Point-and-Click style Holmes games that Frogwares puts out.  Since I like the hidden object genre as much as I like P&C games, I grabbed it (on sale, just in case).\n\nIn short, it's terrible.  Not because the game is in a different style that the other Holmes games, but because it has made every error that a developer could possibly make for the HO genre.\n\nThe most egregious of these is the setup of the hidden objects; they are tiny, sometimes blend in perfectly with the backdrop, and many (if not all) require a great deal of pixel-hunting to find.  While it's great for a scene to have difficult-to-find objects, there's a difference between "cunningly hidden" and "so ridiculously hidden that no normal person could find it without using a hint" where these games are concerned.  I love a challenge; I don't love having my time wasted with nonsense.\n\nOn the topic of hints, there is a limit (seven hints per "level" with no way to acquire more).  This means that while you're desperately trying to find the miniscule-and-seemingly-invisible objects, you also have to try to budget hints.  I found this both baffling and irritating.  The combination of limited hints and impossible objects made the game complete torture to finish.  I had to find a walkthrough for when I ran out of hints, and I generally pride myself on not using hints at ALL in these types of games.  You are also limited on skips for minigames (only seven per the entire game) so if they're not your favorite thing, be careful where you use your skips.\n\nBy the time I got to the end, I didn't even care who commited the crime anymore.  There was very little dialogue in this game (and none whatsoever was voice acted), which took away from the plot.  There was very little tying the player into the game and drawing interest.  It was just "find this stuff for some reason, not sure why."\n\nThe deduction board that is familiar from the other Holmes games is present and does help tie things together, but it is handled so badly and is so tedious that I simply couldn't bring myself to care once I finally solved the case.  There is more dialogue at the end, summarizing your findings and tying the ends together, than in the entire rest of the game.\n\nAlso at full price of $9.99 it's WAY WAY too expensive for 2 hours of gameplay.  I'd be full-on angry had I not gotten it in a good sale with a lot of GOOD games.\n\nIf you like the HO genre, go look up The Hound of the Baskervilles on Steam, which is much much better.  If you're looking for point-and-click, just grab the other Frogwares Holmes games; the ones I've played are quite good.\n\nTL;DR:  It's horrible, don't do it.  Not because it's a hidden object game but because it's the worse possible example of a badly made hidden object game.  Expensive and tedious.  Spare yourself.","February 21","false","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Of course everything is in Sherlock Holmes style, so there will be riddles here and there that will keep you busy, suspect to examine, and almost every item or clue you find in places or on suspects will be analyzable on Sherlock's desk, then you'll have to find links between suspects, clues, places and victim, and at the very end you'll find out who's guilty. Everything is in function of the story, the murder of an artist whose corpse was found enrolled into a Persian Carpet (hence, the title).\nFor those who are not new to the saga the soundtrack will feature the classic usual tunes from the previous titles, and various ambients and props are made of older models or sections reused and rendered here. There won't be any animated cutscene, Holmes and Watson will "speak" through captons only.\nIt was a relatively short adventure but I guess it's just me, as I'm not used to this genre.\nAll in all I appreciated the game though, The Sherlock atmosphere with classic tunes and purpose (investigate a crime), and the game presented some interesting puzzles, some tough puzzles and an interesting suspect-clue-victim linking system.\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY.

I don't think I've ever been this disappointed in game, mostly beacuse the others in this series have been so good (minus Mystery of the Mummy, but that was the first, so it gets some leeway). I tried to check if this was extremly old compared to the other games in the series, but no; it came out after the quality game Nemesis (vs Arsene Lupin). There is no voice acting, the locations are still-images ripped from the earlier game 'Silver Earring', the hidden objects are some times rediculously tiny and iirc there is no hotspot other than for items you have to use on other items (find item: Male hair, in this detailed carpet).\n\nThere's no voice acting, the use of 'analysing table' is extremly boring; 90% is -use scalpel - use tweezers - done. The game also annoyingly has a blinking alert in the top of the screen whenever you discover a new suspect/location and does not go away until you clicked in every room of the new location/looked at suspect back at the police station, which gives you the choice of leaving in the middle of the location you are at or have the incessant blinking up there until you are done. So if yu're like me and can't stand having stuff blink, you're going to have a bad time. Luckily (heh) the game is short.\n\nI have mixed feelings about the 'deduction board' where you match items from one scene/person to another to find evidence to build your case. The idea is good, but 'no, this pink fabric is not identical to this other pink fabric' and 'this weapon is not a weapon' and small things with it annoyed me.\n\nThe puzzles were pretty meh, mostly because most have been ripped from earlier games. It did have a couple new interesting ones, but not enough to pull it into positive.\n\nI admit I didn't read all the story as it didn't interest me at all in the end, and I couldn't care less who murdered who and why.\n\nPLAY ON EASY MODE unless you're masochistic. It gives you more hints; 7 per scene, and let's you skip all puzzles. There are no achievement and really no reason to play another mode, as nothing else changes and you don't have to use the hints you are given if you're feeling particularily tryhard. Use up all your hints (per scene) and there is no way to get any more.\n\nThat full price is ridiculous. Do not buy. Should only be in your library if part of the Sherlock bundle.\n\nTL;DR: Play Hound of the Baskervilles instead if you want a Sherlock Holmes HO game.

Unlike the adventure games of the rest of the series, this title is a casual hidden object hunt. The environments and music are 100% recycled from The Secret of the Silver Earring, which came out years earlier. The pixel hunting is so extreme that you might as well be finding a needle in a haystack--from outer space. Seriously. The scenes are all zoomed out views of an entire room and the clues are things like "strand of hair" and "fingernail." I wish I was exaggerating. There's only one case and it's short and boring. The only somewhat interesting feature is the deduction board, where Holmes makes connections between different pieces of evidence, but it's so clunky and poorly formed that it loses all value. In fact, when I solved the mystery I actually thought I was stuck in a glitch until I randomly clicked the right thing to trigger the ending.

Though there are some good points in this game, there are numerous bad ones.\n\nI would like to be able to comment on the storyline in the game, but I was too distracted by the terrible gameplay to even notice what was happening. The storyline isn't even crucial to complete the game. The deduction board is where you put clues together, but the story has nothing to do with this, you are merely connecting one object to another.\n\nThere are three different modes that you can play in, first being, 'causal mode', this mode is a perfect fit for the game, it's annoying and cruisy. The second mode is 'detective mode', this being almost as bad, but instead the puzzles are slightly harder and more pretentious. And last, but certainly not least, 'adventure mode', this is the only tolerable mode in the entire game! It doesn't make the game great, but it makes it bearable. Adventure mode gives you more freedom to go to places, even if you have no business there, and it lets you replay the puzzles, if you have enjoyed at least one of them. In both causal mode and detective mode you cannot revisit any places that you have finished up with, just mentioning that.\n\nThe dialogue between the characters of Watson and Holmes is almost cringeworthy, when at 221b Baker Street you see them talking, when one character talks an image is shown of that character, these images look terrible in quality and ruin the mood of the converstation. There is no voice acting, that has never been a decider for the quality of story, but it would have aided the dialogue to have some sort of voice speaking over the drowning, looped music. There was an absurd method of leveling, that I can still not determine what it really does. When ever you would level up, a text box would appear on screen and provide you with the information that you have just leveled up, and also provide you with an extra thing to click on. This infamous box also would appear whenever you had investigated all of an area, with the patronising text of Watson apparently speaking to you beyond the grave, or wherever he's at, with him spewing out annoying compliments.\n\nWhile progressing through the game, you realise that this game is a hidden objects game. There's nothing wrong with hidden objects games, but this game went about it all wrong. Instead of having the pleasure to observe the environment carefully and make clever deductions, based not only on object, but thought, and thus incorporating the thought into the gameplay, you click on objects and move on.\n\nThere were some good things about this game, everything has positive and negative points to it. When you were made to inspect people with a magnifying glass, you had to collect data from very miniscule things, such as fingernails, paint and hair. This making the game feel a bit more thought provoking than clicking on objects with a cursor. This game made heavy reference to cigar or cigarette ash, this was very pleasing, in that the old Sherlock Holmes books mentioned a few times that Sherlock could tell the diffrence between diffrent types of cigarette and cigar ash. Though some of the puzzles in this game were either childish, or impossibly difficult, having little to none puzzles that were enjoyable. There were a few puzzles that challenged me without making me feel a fool, or a child.\n\nThe deduction board had much potential. At first glance it looked quite fun, but turned out to be a massive hassle. It is purely based on looking at two objects that look alike, or look connected and putting one line to another. It turned out to be so simple Watson could do it! In the end you don't need to complete the whole deduction board, just connect all the lines for the murderer, this manner of completion is nothing in the spirit of the original Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stories, where Sherlock would hardly care for who did it, but rather, all the little observations that are entwined within the case. And I can safely say, there are no interesting, little observations entwined with this game, it is more causal based than it is thought provoking, or in the slightest bit interesting.\n\nThese are the main things that are distinct in the game. I am not saying that you shouldn't buy this game, I am just not recommending that you buy it. Some people like games that are easy and mindless to play. If you enjoy hidden objects games, or causal games, you would love this game, for it repersents every bit of that. But if you prefer something much more intriguing and pleasurable, I suggest that you go and play the other Sherlock Holmes games, Jack The Ripper, The Awakened, Nemesis or The Testament Of Sherlock Holmes.","May 6, 2014","false","4.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

This game was released as a casual game after Sherlock Holmes versus Arséne Lupin. And this game is just disappointing. Even though this game is made by Frogware they did not use the voice acting which was common for the previous games had. Sherlock Holmes: Mystery of the Mummy HAD voice acting. And that game is almost unplayable. This game makes that game look good. Even though the focus of the game is to be a Sherlock Holmes Mystery game with Hidden Object instead of Point and Click Adventure the combination would have been fantastic but unfortunatly it falls flat on its face. All of the objects and scenery are just reused by previous installments. Although strangely missing the Mystery of the Mummy which I would have loved to have seen gone back to. I found myself bored with the story and deductions. I litterally finished the game without really caring to read all the text because I was too bored and frustrated with the puzzles. The story is really generic and not at all intresting. The characters are all just one still frame which is disappointing. If they just had a few different poses and some voice acting, the game might have been salvaged.\n\nJust to be clear, all of the puzzles can be done without a walkthrough. I managed to beat the hardest puzzle without any help. But I did use a walkthrough to find the dark objects on a dark background. If I have to click around randomly to find the last objects while saving my limited number of hints to finish the deduction at the end, the game failed to be fun. Do not feel bad for me for playing such a poor game, I got this game dirt cheap in a bundle with the other better Sherlock Holmes games so I considered this game to be a free additon which was disappointing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.\n\nI hope Sherlock Holmes and the Hound of the Baskervilles game will be better.","October 10, 2014","false","2.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

What little there is. The puzzles are mostly rehashed fare from their "major" adventure game titles as well... if you play the game after those two, it will just be too easy, and, for the experienced adventure gamer, even without that. Well, apart from the one thing that it probably inherited from the first game of the series - the stupidly frustrating pixel hunting, even for the genre - some hidden objects are very, very well hidden, and tiny. Not a game for the visually even slightly impaired really. The story is an afterthought really, uninspiring and dull... making even the "for kids" aspect irrelevant in my opinion - as I'll introduce my kids to the subject with more competent titles. There is a strange clues & suspects scheme ("deduction tree"), which is partly trial & error, raising the amount of useless clicking in the game to an even higher level.\n\nEven though you get all the puzzles in one place, to replay after you're done with them should you wish so, the game has 0 replay value in my opinion, and none of them is intriguing enough to warrant a visit again. Visually dated now, uninspired & uninspiring, I can't recommend it as there are so many much better takes on the genre nowadays (including The Hound of The Baskervilles from the same series) . But, chances are that you'll just get it in a bundle, like me... then just don't bother with it unless you've run out of other games to play, or if you have played all the other games in the series, and really want to play this one too.","July 14, 2014","false","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Seriously flawed HOG sections, but reasonable minigames. Not really worth it, particularly at the current 9.99€ asking price.\n\nStory You play as Sherlock Holmes trying to solve a murder of an artist. The story is the strongest point of the game, a reasonably nice investigation, though that’s not to say it’s spectacular. Moreover, there is no voice acting to bring the story alive, leaving it a bit stale.\n\nPuzzles The mini-games are fine or even good I would say (except the very first which is awful). The object finding sections are ridiculous however. While I appreciate that you are actually looking for objects that would be of interest in a crime investigation (hair, blood, foot prints etc.), the objects are tiny and blend into the background. This would be fine if there was some way to zoom in, but there is not (some exceptions), thus forcing you to use hints. This is coupled with a rather bland deduction system that seems to have do very little to actually progress the story (almost all of the matches you make are to match people to places that you already know they were at… like their office or dressing room).\n\nLength and Misc Took me about 4.8 hours on the highest difficulty, trying to avoid using hints as much as possible.","March 8","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
