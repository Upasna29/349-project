No, I am not talking about who wins what, but more, all the wars are scripted (at least, I have yet to see a non-scripted war). For example, East and West Germany could be in an arms race for so long, with tons of British and USA troops in the West, and Soviets in the East. But what happens? Nothing. They are extremely hostile but nope, no war. It may seem logical, but it gets very boring. Especially knowing the AI will never intervene, and there cannot be a WW3. It makes the spheres system useless.\n\nAlso, a WW3 is nearly IMPOSSIBLE, or maybe it is impossible. One worry about the Korean and Vietnam wars in real life was that the wars would drag the Warsaw Pact into all out war with NATO. However, when the Korean war starts, the USA says "lel ♥♥♥♥ you guys" and sits and watches South Korea get steamrolled. Ouch. And then there is Vietnam. The North starts by making large gains on French Indochina, but the French AI sends units by the hundreds over to Vietnam from Europe, and starts steamrolling through the Northern rebels. Now with its ideological enemy creeping towards its borders, China does.... nothing. Units can engage without being at war, and China usually has access through North Vietnam, but they do nothing. In fact, they don't even supply the Vietnamese with weapons, fuel... ANYTHING! They just sit and watch the Capitalists win.\n\nAnd however the AI in this game is likely the best out of any Supreme Ruler hands down, it just doesn't work properly. For example, say you're USA, and you're trying to get Spain to join NATO. Well, they may have super friendly relations, but they're not even under your influence at ALL. In real life, the USA would supply countries with weaponry, and offer protection, and same with the USSR, but in this game you must keep pouring billions into the AI's treasury before they'll begin accepting deals. And once they do start accepting deals as simple as free trade, you need to offer them ALL the diplomatic treaties before they even start to like you. Then, once you are allied with them, only then do they start to slowly go into your sphere. (Unless you are the AI, with their diplomatic voodoo) But this makes no sense, right? I mean, playing as the USA, you end up allied to 40 different nations just because you wanted them in your influence, meanwhile, the rest of NATO aren't allied with eachother at all. Same thing goes for the Warsaw Pact. It is simply just nonsense.\n\nAnd then there is the economy... oh god. The ways to make money in this game are the most gamey and unrealistic ways to make money ever. And the only nations that don't need ultra gamey and exploitive actions to make money are : USA, USSR, China, UK, India, and I think that is it. It is quite dumb that these nations always have their pockets filled with money whilst other nations fill up with uncontrollable amounts of debt. Making money shouldn't rely on being one of few lucky nations who never run out of money or mass producing one resource. In Victoria 2, if you focus all your production, on, let's say, machine parts, it may end very poorly. The massive amounts of machine parts you produce may cause them to become nearly worthless, and your factories may hardly scrape by, or a massive economic collapse in the British Empire may lose one of the biggest buyers of your machine parts and your factories will go bankrupt and close. It really immerses you in the economics of the game. In this game, you feel completely disconnected with the economics as all you need to do is spam produce one resource and you're set with tons of cash. It's really dissapointing and boring.\n\nPROS\n-Decent interface\n-Very nice cold war map\n-Nations being released worldwide\n-Wars are fun\n-Nuclear wars are more fun\n-Small border clashes may sometimes occur between hostile nations\n\nCONS\n-No feeling of competiton between the USSR and USA\n-AI does not intervene in wars such as Korea or Vietnam, making them extremely predictable and boring\n-Sphere system does nothing but make nations hate eachother\n-"Flashpoint tension" system doesn't do anything, as the AI seems incapable of declaring a non-scripted war\n-Economy is extremely gamey, uninteresting, and unrealistic\n-Diplomacy AI is horrendous\n-Advisors that will start making changes to your nation that you don't want and may not realize\n-World War 3 is impossible in the first place, which takes most of the fun out of the game (if it is not, correct me)\n-After everything, this is still a game about world conquest, which is not why I bought this\n-Same 3 minute soundtrack, looping over, and over, and over, and over and over.....\n\n\nIf I had to score this, I would give it a 6/10. It is a kinda fun game, but many of the issues in it make the game dull and uninteresting at times. I really did expect more from a game with Paradox Interactive as the publisher, and knowing their policy of publishing a game, it really seems like Paradox swept this one under the rug. At this price of $11 it is alright to buy, but if you haven't already, buy Victoria 2 instead.","April 2, 2015","false","34.9"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","57","63","3","4"

The graphics are still somewhat primitive but improved greatly and it almost has a charm to it. The diplomatic elements are still some of the best in strategy games but still lacks some features that could make it the best. Military wise its fun and easy to figure out and the new Merchant marine makes it ten times easier to move troops globally and invade island nations. The economic part of the game is time consuming but makes you think about what you need to make it work well.\nThe interface for managing everything is organised but can be confusing with some elements hidden behind too many other interfaces making it a maze to figure something simple out.\nThe Cold War campaign is well organised with the Atomic and Space races and the many conflicts and problems are there that were present in the 1950s,60s,70s and 80s.\nThe Sandbox mode is also still fun to play and a healthy mod scene makes it enjoyable to try different modes and scenarios.\n\nOverall this game is definatly worth your time and money if you into this genre.","December 6, 2013","true","24.1"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","50","58","4","5"

I do agree that the wars are fun and awesome, but I wish there was a way for the wars to matter except for resources.\n\nPolitics: 3/10 - The only form of politics available is choosing whether you're Liberal, Neutral or Conservative, which barely matters in game (that I've noticed). In my opinion and experience, this is all the politics the game provides, yes you debate the economy and build stuff, but that is pointless if you cannot change how they work or emphasise your opinion on it.\n\nDiplomacy: 5/10 - There is a obvious diplomacy in the game where you can negotiate treaties with other countries (alliances, free trade etc.) or buy units, designs, technology or resources from them. However it feels bland and near pointless to negotiate an alliance with other nations if they aren't going to help you (yes an unjustified war should not be supported)\n\nEconomy: 7/10 - The money side of the economy is decent, trading resources, collecting taxes, DONE. But the building structures side of the economy (mines, labs etc.) makes your country feel too socialist for many players to accept. It would be a nice feature if your citizens (depending on the economy and other issues) would setup their own businesses, buildings etc. like mines or power plants which have a small toll onto the nations economy compared to state construction. I am not debating the rights and wrongs of a pure socialist society, but there needs to be an acceptance for capitalists or businesses to setup like in many countries today, and would give a reason for corporate taxes to accept.\n\nAudio: 8/10 - Good music and sounds which fit each need.\n\nStory: 2/10 - Basic, generic World War 3 scenario where the worlds resources start becoming few and country paranoia and xenophobia start turning into armed conflicts across the globe. But it is still very basic and generic, yet acceptable for a strategy-simulation.\n\nMultiplayer: N/A - Never tried the multiplayer as no one will play it with me :'(. So I cannot comment on its performance, capaibilities or how well it does.\n\nUI: 7/10 - Blocky and ugly for such an advanced and modern game, yet it provides the necessaries for it to work.\n\nPlease Note:\n\nGood Conflict simulator - Not a political simulator\n\nGeneric story which is worth no looking at\n\nVery indepth view of a socialist paradise","December 17, 2014","true","3.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

During this period, you will manage foreign affairs, local production and construction, research, finances and budget and military spending and deployment. Its no easy task and it will keep you busy.\n\nWhile this is going on, you will also be in a struggle both diplomatically and technologically to stay ahead of the USSR, who of course are spearheading the Communist movement throughout Central Asia. Keep in mind that you are not an absolute leader, but subject to the effects of the approval ratings of your own citizens, and the approval of foreign nations, so it is a game of leveraging your ability to create positive improvement domestically and abroad. The space race is also going on at this time with a roadmap to be the first nation on the moon. The most pressure comes from the fact that amidst all of this, the nuclear arms race has just started.\n\nThe pacing is long so don`t expect a short game. You`ll likely play one game over numerous play sessions.\n\nThe scope of it is sometimes overwhelming but very enjoyable. Not for those who want a short battle heavy RTS. This is definitely for those who enjoy delving into all aspect of macro management and whom like seeing the effects of their leadership on economic indicators as much and if not more than they do by the destruction they can cause on a battlefield though it does have tactical battle. You don`t have to play it like that kind of confrontation but in this one, a good strategic and armed forces helps as part of your strategic deterrent against the real enemy: war though even in this one you`ll find yourself plunged into many conflicts as the world powers and empires of the middle, renaissance and industrial ages change and indepence wars and revolutions are popping up everywhere.\n\nRecommended for the history or strategic buffs. If you`ve ever watched the "Drunken History" and felt like debating it, chances are this one is for you though you don't need to drink to enjoy it. Just make sure you stop and eat every once in a while.\n\nRecommended for detail oriented strategy buffs.","December 25, 2014","true","5.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","1"

Overall, The time frame for the game is good however I cannot grasp the game and my gametime shows it. Its not like the other Paradox games at all.

I expected much better from something with the Paradox name on it but what can you do.\nI give it a ヽ(´ー｀)ノ/10\n\nAlso, the description made me think that this was some super autistic game with such depth and complexity that there were AI advisors that made decisions for you since you couldn't possibly manage everything on your own. In reality the AI advisors are needed because the UI is so awful that you can't possibly find and react to what you want to do in time.","September 21, 2014","false","1.1"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

These paradox games are so appealing to me because they double as a history lesson; if you aren't playing them with another window open to wikipedia - and youtube, you're doing it wrong ! :P\n\nThere are some menus and info that is impossible or difficult to discern and so far I have spent most of my time learning the game rather than playing it, also I've mostly confined myself to sanbox mode so cannot comment on the 'missions' it might have, but I do look forward to playing them out in the future too.\n\nAll in all this game is captivating if you enjoy other paradox titles, it is an excellent game to run, for example, after playing Hearts of Iron III. It's not perfect, but it's good. I got this on sale for less than $5 and I feel like I ripped the publisher off. Thanks steam !!! ;D\n\n(( people who enjoy these but feel combat is weak can suppliment with playing WoWs or WoWp or Company of Heros, etc to get themselves onto the front lines and take a break from the overlording, long-term aspects of the period ;))\n\nTake the time to learn about other nations history, pay attention to your economy (or hand it off to a minister and hold onto your butts) ! This sheeit is closer to edu-tainment, if you dig\n\n8.75/10","October 13, 2015","true","154.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
