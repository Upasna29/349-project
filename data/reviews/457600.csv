"http://steamcommunity.com/id/luckz/recommended/457600/","luckz","luckz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/luckz/","4748 products in account","Emerge: CotA is a fun mix of turn-based strategy and realtime defense combat. You aim to capture a certain amount of sectors on the map (and perhaps complete some additional objectives) before the roaming zombie horde becomes too strong to hold off.\n\nEach turn, if a pack of zombies moves into a sector controlled by you, you will be shown how any automated defenses you may have had fared at fending them off, and should there be undead survivors, you can attempt to prevail in realtime combat. Using the mouse cursor, you aim and shoot your weapon, while the keyboard serves to expend combat consumables like grenades or limited-ammunition turrets. Up to four AI-controlled companions can lend their aid in these encounters, while there's also the option to delegate the main character's gunfire to the very same AI logic and solely utilize items yourself. Combat lasts until the player's barricade is destroyed, in which case there's a chance for characters to die fleeing, or until all attackers have been fended off.\n\nAll characters partaking in combat gain experience points based on how they perform, and this is also the only regular source of experience points, somewhat necessitating use of the realtime combat to grow in strength (while stronger enemies appear after a certain amount of turns, giving the game a bit of a 'race against the clock' vibe). On levelup, characters can be given another point in one of their traits, which for example enable the use of higher-level weapons or give resource bonuses for the turn-based side of things. Manual actions by the user there, such as attempting to conquer or scout a neighbouring sector, cost action points, which replenish each turn. As far as resources go, there are production points used for the construction of defenses (for the simulated combat phase) and research points that let you progress along a Civ-style tech tree, as well as economy points that give you an influx of credits every turn, and two monetary resources — credits and crystals.\n\nAs far as content goes, there are ample unlocks, although the vast bulk of weapons are already available from the get-go. As the game progresses, you gain many more character classes to use, get starting bonuses or new scenarios, bigger maps, and a lot of different enemies to encounter. Unfortunately there is no character persistence between campaign levels ("areas"), and thus you start anew in the next one, only able to bring one of your items. I typically carry with me one that boosts research per turn, to get a faster start the next time. Gameplay fundamentals are virtually unchanged throughout the campaign stages, and this is a title that prides itself on replayability much more than on diversified visual design.\n\n\nThe game definitely aims at a more old-school audience who embrace a lack of hand-holding, who relish having to find out how to unlock things on their own instead of being spoon-fed the unlock conditions. In that spirit, your power grows at a slow Dark Souls pace, and the power difference between a level 1 and a level 2 weapon feels truly minuscule.\nWeapons are divided into 'hitscan' ones that only hit when your recoil-affected cursor is on the enemy's model, while projectile weapons fly towards opponents. Of the former type, I only somewhat enjoyed the sniper rifle, while the bullet-fed automatic weapons were too inaccurate for my tastes. I ended up strongly preferring weapons capable of harming multiple opponents per shot, namely the jolly crossbow and the grenade launcher. One character trait increases the amount of targets a crossbow bolt can penetrate and immediately became my favourite.\nThe music fits the scenario's mood very well and reminded me strongly of an older videogame gem I only recently discovered.\n\n\nBug reports and feature requests I churned out while playing were responded to quickly and diligently, and from what I could observe, this game is definitely a labour of love crafted over the course of several years by the solo developer.\n\n\nDue to technical limitations, it only runs at 1024x768 or 1280x720, fullscreen or windowed, and thus might not be very fun on a 4K screen. On my 1080p screen, I played the game in a 720p window and had no engine-related issues. Pressing F4 will make the windowed game stretch to fill the screen, but everything — including text — becomes notably more pixelated in the process.\nAs far as Steam Achievements go, this isn't a quick 100% — and it doesn't want to be. Dozens of hours are needed to see all Emerge has to offer, and the cheevos mirror this.\n\nA review copy of this game was provided by the developer. I'm also mentioned in the game's credits for feedback given & testing.","April 27","true","21.7"," 57 of 70 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","57","70","0","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/recommended/457600/","commissarbro","CommissarBRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commissarbro/","1034 products in account","An interesting game that takes parts of the old flash game, The Last Stand, and elements of the Rebuild series and combines them into a zombie game which features a continuous campaign where you fight map to map against the hordes of the undead with a character who can level up, gain skills on a 4x styled map. You gain resources that allow you to build turrets, buy weapons, and unlock new members who can help you defend your towns against the hordes of the undead. You can even fight battles both attacking and defensive in a barricade style like you would've seen in the Last Stand. It's all pretty badass. It's clearly been made by an amateur developer but there is a clearly a lot of effort with a very specific idea in mind and it combines to make one of the more unique zombie games I've played in a while. In summation, I highly recommend this game for the low price tag.\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8T9NcrKFdE","April 29","true","12.8"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/azigungarunga/recommended/457600/","azigungarunga","MyMy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/azigungarunga/","711 products in account","It's a simple game of territory control and resource management and there wouldn't be anything wrong with it, if it wasn't advertised as 4X and the price tag was 2-3 times lower.\n\nGood things: combines two genres, one of them is survival game and it's not enough of those in the market.\n\nBad things: looks like an old browser game, not many abilities on the map, weapons progression is not interesting, combat is ok but repetitive and '4X' part is way too shallow.\n\nDeal breaker, but it's very personal: campaign doesn't make any sense, you only take a few items into the next mission, and it's quite hard and slow paced game, so it doesn't feel right to play everything all over again. Even research is not taken into the next mission. Let alone the soldiers and their abilities you cared about. I'd play a few days if the metagame was progressive. But as of now I can't imagine people to recommend it to.\n\nIf you like survivor management games, I suggest playing Deadsville 3 - if you want something of a 'board game grade' simplicity. Or Dead State if you want a complex survivor base management with combination of something more meaningful (TBS).","May 2","false","7.3"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

Each time you have your map and you aim to capture a necessary amount of sectors. The campaign gives you each time a new mission, all of them i played so far are very interesting and give you a different goal each time.\n\nEach turn you have 10 points to spent, you can scout a new sector, you can capture a sector, you can recruit a new member, you can sell your crystals for money and you can "go exploring" each of those uses a different amount of points and you have to chose wisely how to spend them. Exploring is a way to either get a positive or negative outcome that will change your game.\n\nAs the game continue you unlock very usefull stuff from the tech tree which helps you unlock or upgrade your stuff but each tech needs a different amount of turns in order to complete. Each sector you capture you can add to it a different amount of improvements, those are things that you have unlocked from the tech tree and they give you more credits/turn, or reasearch points/turn, or production points and later on more stuff. You need as many credits/turn in order to buy and upgrade your stuff, you need the reasearch points/turn in order to make the techs that you research, take less amount of turns to complete and you need the production points in order to have more turrets to help you with the enemie hords.\n\nAfter you are done with a turn, the enemy come closer to you until they attack and you can defend either with your turrets, and/or with your characters. In combat you can use some consumables in order to help your caracters defending the barricades and you can either control one chatacter and leave the rest of them for the AI, or leave all of them for the AI and you can watch/use your comsumables in order to help. Your barricades have a certant amount of hp, if you fail to defend them then you lose that sector. Each turn the enemy is stronger and stronger, and there are 18 (i think) different types of enemies each one with a different behavior, hp, attack points etc.\n\nI didn't cover all the aspects of the game in order to make it readable, but i think if you read it i gave you a good feeling about the game. Its the first turn-base game i ever enjoyed, the game has more depth that you realise from the video/screenshots because there a lot of things behind the besics that you expect that make it unique and well made. One of the reason that make it so is that each time you start a new map the experience is different from the last time. Your characters abilities, the techs that you unlock from the tech tree, the unlocks you can choose, the items you find each, the objective that you have to complete and the RNG from the exploring and from the enemies attacks is going to give you a different experience. So far i have 15hours in it and i'm hooked, i definetly recommend it if you like the concept of it.\n\nCons: 1) The tutorial is taking some time in order to complete it and because my english aren't the best it took me more time than expected but i definetly recommend you not to avoid it because its very helpfull in order to understand what you have to do. 2) The game is difficult for the first couple of hours until you learn all the things you have to do the enemies will give you a hard time, but after you learn it as i said its very enjoyable.\n\nA copy of the game provided from the developer of this game for testing purposes. I'm in the credits of this game for the feedback i gave him and also during my 15hours so far in game i didn't find any bugs. I gave it a positive review because the game deserves it, not because i was told to.","April 27","true","16.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/recommended/457600/","aurumlamina","Aurumlamina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/","1108 products in account","A nice surprise from the Indie market, Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is an entertaining strategic zombie survival game.  You won't be scavenging for supplies, directly rescuing survivors, or securing a clean source of water, though it has its own style of gameplay that I have found to be unique and fun in its own right.\n\nEach scenario that you play involves you taking control over a small colony with the goal of expanding and securing the city around you.  You'll be facing off against an ever increasing horde of zombies with new varieties arriving as time goes on.  To achieve this goal, and often other scenario-specific goals, you'll be researching technologies on three separate trees to assist you.  These tech trees will improve your resource collection (cash, crystals, production, and science) and will make your colony more effective at fighting off the encroaching ranks of the dead.\n\nThough much of the game is spent looking down at the city from a bird's eye view, there will be times when you take a more direct approach in defending your colony.  Your character, selected from one of three varying classes, will face off against the zombies in what feels like an improved Oregon Trail hunting mini-game.  A variety of weapon types and skills that can be upgraded when your character and their compatriots level also adds a level of strategy to this as weapons and abilities add a considerable amount of options to develop your own style of play.\n\nAll in all, Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is an enjoyable game that I certainly don't regret spending my money on.  I would give a forewarning to those who might be on the fence, it does feel like a well designed mobile game.  However, when compared to said mobile games or the flash games that might do something very similar, Emerge does just enough to make those others obsolete on a purely gameplay basis.\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of zombie apocalypse games and is wanting to play one that isn't survival in its strictest term as gamers have come to know it.  It is an enjoyable strategy-lite that I can definitely see myself putting more hours into in the future.","April 30","true","2.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It's constantly fun to find loot, get experience for your companions and slaughter tons of zombies.\n\nThe game plays like a duck hunt simulator with strong tactical elements to it. Most of the time you'll be out in the city map deciding your priorities with a well-functioning action point system. It flows with the ease of a "just one more turn" sensations that is oh so important for a game like this, and I often find myself playing it both when I have just an hour to kill, or eight!\n\nGraphics are on the money, the board game'esque aestetics is pleasant to the eye and the atmosphere of it all captures the zombie apocalypse times we're all going thru' in the game world just now.","May 21","true","74.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I’d never thought I would get so much fun from this game, because of the bad trailer that I watched on the store page and also I never thought the best part of a game is the sound, until now.\nWhen you start a new level you're forced to choose from three different classes: Engineer, Scientist and Bounty Hunter. Each class has different abilities and weapons. The game has random events where you can choose which of the actions you will make.\n\nEach time when you end your turn, the zombies will move forward. That's why it's necessary to scout the surrounding sectors so you can prepare, if they are attacking your sector. If you want to capture some sectors,  you need to have a specific number of the infrastructure. When you have captured a sector on the map, you can find some items, like crystals, money, weapons and grenades. The items are pretty useful to sell, wear or use. You can find also some survivors of the disease. If you want to have a companion when the zombies are attacking the sector of yours, you will need a survivor and an amnount of crystals and money to buy a perk (you can have max 4 in your team, you included). When the zombies are attacking the territory of yours, you can use the items which you have found or bought from the merchants of the game.\n\nThe Pros and Cons of the game.\n\nPros:\n- The game is fun and amazing\n- The game has well-made sound-effects\n- There are a lots of variety in items\n- Every minute you spent on this game is definitely worth it\n- Has trading cards\n\nCons:\n- The graphics of the game sucks, looks like a game which is made in the early 90's\n- The game needs easy, normal and a hardcore mode\n\n\nThe game is amazing and is definitely worth all the money. I'd say give it a shot.","May 22","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stvier/recommended/457600/","stvier","StVier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stvier/","279 products in account","What kind of game is it?\nEmerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is relatively casual hybrid game of with light elements of zombie tower defense, resource management, RPG. The recurring goal of the game is to secure different cities by reclaiming sectors within the city. Each reclaimed sectors allows for limited construction of resource-generating buildings, either providing much needed production for different types of automated defenses, research points for advanced technology, economy for purchases, or crystals for miscellaneous purposes including recruiting NPC survivors.\n\nGameplay is sort of turn-based, whereby you spend limited Action Points to do things like scouting or taking over sectors. You may also spend APs to trigger random events, or activate one of several strategic options unlocked via research. At the end of your turn, zombies will move around and may incur upon your territory. When your automated defenses (if you choose ot build any) fail to fully eliminate the invading zombie, you and up to 4 recruited NPC teammates will be tasked to do the dirty work in some defense shooting action. Armed with one of several types of weapons, direct your reticule to approaching zombie hordes to gun them down before the barricade gets torn down and you get overrun. Kill enough zombies and you level up to gain a precious skill point to be put into either combat related skills or non-combat related skills such as increasing chances of finding survivors, or increasing resource production among other skills.\n\nWhat's good?\n-  It's a fun, casual game that tests your decision making ability and how one adapts to the random situations.\n\nWhat's bad?\n- Other than the moving zombie hordes during combat, everything else is pretty much static.\n\n- The AI of your comrades during combat is rather dubious, especially when it comes them them moving their aiming reticule, which isn't going to as fast as the player zipping their mouse around.\n\n- The random events will eventually loses it's novelty when you have read most of them, and all you are concerned is whether it's a positive or negative events.\n\n- Unless you are used to replaying to unlock perks and such, its get repetitive pretty fast.\n\nMillion dollar question (or whatever price the game is), is it worth buying?\nThe basic premise of the game doesn’t quite change and you are tasked with doing the same thing over and over again with additional challenging conditions, which might lead to gradual waning of interest if you decide to grind maps upon maps in one session. When played in moderated sessions, such as during coffee breaks or an hour or so before bedtime, it provides a satisfying amount of entertainment without causing addictive indulgence. Do remember that Emerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is what I consider a casual game, and while I often have no qualms about buying an indie game and supporting its developer, watching some Let's Play videos convinced me that this was worth a purchase for its price, and it is.","May 3","true","33.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The graphics are ok, the map is isometric 2D.\n\nI didn't finished the game yet;so I will add later more aspects.","April 27","true","0.1"," 12 of 30 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","12","30","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198268282387/recommended/457600/","76561198268282387","jtrev23","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198268282387/","4 products in account","I originally reviewed this game on my indie game review site: www.jtrev23reviews.com and below is a copy of my review.\nBut in case TL:DR - Great game that combines a Strategy game and Top-Down Shooter into one epic game. Music volume is inconsistent but other than that I had no problems with this game and I would say that it is well worth the price.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nEmerge: Cities of the Apocalypse is a new game on Steam that combines a turn based strategy game and a top-down shooter game in one lite horror game. I’ll say despite my few annoyances I experienced with the game, I would recommend it to other people to try out and would say that it is well worth the $7+ it is currently priced at on Steam. For the record, I have spent 8+ hours with this game according to Steam and I have still yet to complete the entire campaign.\n\n-INITIAL THOUGHTS-\n\n\n\nI like how Emerge manages to combine multiple genres in one cohesive game. Not only do you have the ability to choose your class and weapons, but you also have the building phase of the game where you are trying to expand your city reach like a RTS game, and you have to stop zombies from tearing down your barricades in the battle phase much like a Tower Defense game. Not only does this manage to combine all of these aspects of gameplay, but it combines them effectively so that it feels natural to the player. If you’ve played strategy games and real time tower defense games, then you will be able to pick this game up pretty quickly once you understand how all the classes work and what things you should research for certain effects.\n\nOne thing that bothers me tough is that although the tutorial goes over a lot, yet I still have been unable to figure out how to use modules as intended. While it might be an oversight in the tutorial, the only way I’ve found to access your storage is through either the recruit menu or the merchant menu, neither of which seemed to have had an option for me to use the modules from what I saw. Thankfully though, the tutorial does go over how get recruits, set their AI, and even about upgrading stats and weapons, so the modules are probably just an oversight. Other than that, I say that the game is pretty solid in design, application, and explanation.\n\n\n\n-PRESENTATION-\n\n\n\nThis game functions somewhat as a horror game and it has a very dark atmosphere around it. Visually, I like the use of a pseudo 3D environment to capture sectors of the city and being able to customize the UI was also a huge bonus for me. The UI in general, I found to be nice and user friendly.  The music, in my opinion, was the best and worst part of the presentation. The music and sound effects really helps to setup the dark atmosphere for the game but the BGM doesn’t stay at one consistent volume which kind of ruins it for me. I found myself messing around with the audio several times because it was either too quiet or way too loud and 10 mins or so later I would have to readjust it again. Other than that though, I had no other problems with Emerge’s presentation and I felt that it does a great job overall for depicting a zombie apocalyptic atmosphere.\n\n\n\n-ENGAGEMENT/GAMEPLAY-\n\n\n\nThis game will be engaging for those who are used to playing long Strategy games, for others I feel that interest and wanting to complete a map would be the most engaging factors. Don’t get me wrong, the gameplay is fun and well thought out but on average it took me about an hour and a half, if not longer, just to complete 1 map (and I’m still only on the “small” maps). Of course the time it takes to complete a map will vary on your setup (class, weapon, research, etc.) but for me it was very time consuming. Thankfully, at any time in the game you can exit the game and it will save your progress until you try that map again.\n\n\nAs for gameplay, it essentially comes down into 2 parts. The building phase and the battle phase as I call them. In the building phase, the player has to use action points to scout areas, take over sectors of the city, buy/sell weapons, and other things commonly found in Strategy games. In the battle phase the game becomes more like a Top-Down Shooter/Tower Defense game where you actually have to shoot invading zombies as they try to break down your border and take over your city. This is where your choice of class and weapon are most important in my opinion. While your class does affect things in the building phase, your actual survival rests upon your chosen weapon and skills like any other Shooter game out there. I also like the difficulty increase in the game. As you go through the campaign mode you constantly unlock more and more enemies and encounter different aspects of gameplay you hadn’t experienced before. In short, if you’ve been looking for a game that takes both skill and strategy in order to complete, then this is the game for you.\n\n\n\n-OVERALL-\n\nI only had minor issues with the game thus far and I have really enjoyed playing this game. I say if you like Strategy games, Top-Down Shooter games, Tower Defense games, or if you are just a fan of Zombie games in general, then this you should definitely check this game out. I really like it and I hope to spend even more hours playing it.\n\n\n\n\nThanks for reading, and Happy Game Making!!\n\n\n","April 27","true","9.8"," 5 of 16 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","5","16","0","3"
