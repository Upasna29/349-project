Instantly addicting.  I've never played a snow plow game and at first I was confused how they would make such a small game board into a plowing game but sure enough, it's perfect.  Don't change a thing.\n\nYou are given a tiny world with cars going from one side to the next, and they need to drive on the roads to get there.  It snows endlessly creating roadblocks which you have to clear.  The longer you play the crazier it gets until you eventually crash into a car and lose.  I haven't lost by any other means in that time period but I'm assuming they would also fire you from your job if the people got too upset.  As you play through and get 10 points (10 cars made it through) you unlock the medium sized board, with the exact same rules but on a much bigger surface there is so much more going on.  It took me a good dozen times to get that 10 points in one run.\n\nThe controls are really weird, but it has some great controller support and after awhile you get the hang of it.  Basically you press left if you want your truck to make a 90 degree turn, press left twice if you want to do a 180, and you can cancel a turn at any time by pressing the opposite direction.  The first 10 minutes will be confusing to you but it's smooth sailing afterwards.  Or actually smooth plowing.  Hopefully.  Anyways, I really enjoyed the game and I will be putting it on my favorites list, definitely.  Kudos.","January 4","true","4.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","2"

I know now what I´ll be playing this winter, when I´m supposed to plow snow for real outside! :D\n\nWhat makes the game interesting is, that the steering is everything but precise. Sounds weird? Yes. But when you start to master the controls and the plow truck goes where you want it to go, then you feel like Mr. Plow himself!\n...until you crash into the next car and get fired.\n\nFor anything about the graphics or the sound: Just watch the trailer and you know what there is to know.","November 3, 2015","true","0.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

It is not really a game that I would play for hours at a time but it is a game that works well in 15-20 minute increments.\n\nThe one thing that people might have some issues with are the controls. The controls aren't the most precise but this appears to have been done on purpose to help simulate driving on slippery roads. I usually hate imprecise controls but they work in Dawn of the Plow since the whole game is centered around slipping and sliding around. If the driving controls were really precise the game would just be boring since it would be too easy.\n\nHow much play time you get out of the game depends on how much you like chasing high scores. If you are the type of gamer that just wants to beat a game and then move on you aren't going to get a lot out of Dawn of the Plow since you can "beat" the whole game in less than an hour. If you like trying to beat your own high scores though I think you could get a lot of time out of the game.\n\nWhile its' not perfect, I think Dawn of the Plow is a pretty good game. If the concept interests you I think you will enjoy the game.\n\nNote: I received a free review copy from the developer but received no other compensation.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]\n","November 4, 2015","true","1.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It satisfies a primal urge that we, as humans, have to move large mounds of things.  If you find yourself lying awake at night wondering what it all means, this game is for you!\n\nAt first I was having a lot of trouble controlling my plow (I've never driven a plow before), but once I started driving on the roads instead of through the snow I had a much easier time.  I think I'll apply this lesson to my real life driving techniques as well.\n\nLove the music too!  Good variety of tracks to keep your ears happy.  The humming of your beastly plow motor can be a bit harsh at times, but not so much that it ruins the experience.\n\n10/10 would plow again... wait, that's not how I meant it... I- ...  I will play this game.\n\n","November 11, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
