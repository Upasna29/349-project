"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/recommended/290770/","cheeseness","Cheeseness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cheeseness/","533 products in account","Disclaimer: I have a credit on this game. My opinion is biased, but perhaps the passion that drove me to get involved says something in itself.\n\nLast year I put my support behind a crowdfunding campaign for the first part of an episodic action adventure game blending light metroidvania gameplay with the kinds of puzzles you might find in point and click adventures, created by Over The Moon Games[www.overthemoongames.com]. At the time, I'd not heard of John Warner nor Over The Moon Games, but The Fall's premise caught my attention and as I got to know John, I knew that my instincts had pointed me in the right direction.\n\nWith The Fall's release imminent, I thought I might take some time to share my thoughts on playing the game and building a friendship with its developer as The Fall has taken shape over the past six months.\n\n\nThe (current version of the) game opens with a figure falling against a star filled sky. As it streaks past, a glimpse of what might be a city can be seen below. As the plummeting figure descends, the exosuit surrounding it comes online and automated reactionary systems erect antimatter shielding to protect its occupant from the incredible impact waiting below which will drive the suit deep underground.\n\nYou play as an A.R.I.D. artificial intelligence aboard a mark-7 combat suit, activated in response to the imminent danger threatening your pilot. You have no knowledge of your location nor the events which led to your activation. In some ways, the A.R.I.D's situation mirrors the player's as they're thrown into an unknown an unwelcoming environment with the clear, but perhaps bendable goal of seeing The Fall's narrative through to the end.\n\n\nWhen I first spotted The Fall's crowdfunding campaign, its dark air of dystopian mystery evoked memories of Delphine Interactive's Flashback[en.wikipedia.org] (the 1992 original which is playable natively on Linux via the F/OSS REmeniscence engine[cyxdown.free.fr]) and Another World[en.wikipedia.org], two hugely influential early cinematic platformers which featured tactical gunplay and movement puzzles combined with exploration and discovery. For me personally, these two games were the first examples of mature storytelling and evocative, compelling plots that I experienced. After playing Another World in 1991, perhaps a decade before I became aware that there was debate over whether or not games should be called such, I knew that games could be art.\n\nThe experience of being able to watch someone else's game evolve and unfold (or fold) into something coherent is second only to making your own (something which I'd also recommend). It takes a bit of patience, faith and vision to see the what-could-be inside the what-is, and even then, it can be difficult to predict how a game's direction might shift during development. When John joined us for SteamLUG Cast[steamlug.org] to talk about The Fall last year, we discussed the notion that there are a myriad possible games which might grow from a concept's scope, and that some of the challenge of directing and designing a good game is in knowing which one of those possible games is the best one to chase, and how to handle feedback which relates to one of the possibilities that won't be getting made.\n\nAs the A.R.I.D. seeks out medical aid for her injured pilot, she too explores an uncertain future. With only a minimal suite of suit functions available, the A.R.I.D. quickly finds herself in conflict both from without and from within as the danger response mechanisms required to bring vital systems online present themselves as being a way to protect the very human she is programmed to save at all costs.\n\n\nMy first interaction with John was in an email where I tried to convey how disappointed I was to know that I probably would not have time to be a part of the community or contribute in any meaningful sense. Yesterday John told me he wanted to recognise me in The Fall's credits for the advice and effort I've given since the crowdfunding campaign ended. Sometimes when things don't go according to plan, something positive comes out of it.\n\nIt feels to me that The Fall reaches out to touch on concepts like identity, autonomy, the value of life, and the meaning of sentience. The game's atmosphere is brooding instilling first a sense of isolation and impending danger, then oppression and finally desperation as the A.R.I.D. strives to protect her charge in a world seemingly bent on ensuring that her programming remains unfulfilled. What will A.R.I.D. become as the story progresses, what will we learn, and how will that shape the way we appreciate and determine our own actions?\n\n\nEpisode 1 of The Fall will be available May 30th on Steam for Windows, Mac and most importantly, Linux. In the meantime, some of the development update videos can be found on The Fall's Greenlight page.\n\nIt has been a pleasure to play a part in making The Fall possible, and I'm looking forward to seeing the response it gets. I hope it's as enjoyable to fresh eyes as it has been to those of us who've had the opportunity to witness its development.","May 26, 2014","true","52.3"," 353 of 456 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","353","456","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/290770/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","The Fall is a side scrolling, almost point and click style adventure game.  It was released in early 2014 on the PC, and then later released on the consoles in July 2015.\n\nPlot wise, The Fall is focused on A.R.I.D, which stands for Autonomous Robotic Interface Device (a good mouthful right?), you navigate through a destroyed industrial factory looking for a medical aid for the human inside of the suite you are in control of.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to that of Metroidvania style games, you aim with the right analog stick and shoot. You are equipped with a torch and a gun (eventually), you can switch between your laser sight on the gun, and your flashlight. This game is extremly dark, so you will need to use your light ALOT. Thankfully you don't have to running out of batteries like most games seem to force on you nowdays, your flashlight will never run out of juice.\n\nParts of this game feel like you are playing a point and click adventure, you have to locate certain objects in the game world by highlighting them with your flashlight before you can interact with them. You can combine objects to make new ones to aid you with puzzles, all of these are common found mechanics found in adventure games. There is some very basic shooting action to be found - when I say basic, it is very basic; don't expect to go into crazy gun battles with the androids, you have one weapon throughout the whole game, it has unlimited ammo, and all of the enemies die in the same amount of shots, apart from the end boss.\n\nGraphically, The Fall is not exactly top of the range graphics; the atmoshere is so dark that they actually get away with having amazing graphics, the game puts alot of effort into the lighting to create the decaying atmosphere that you are set in. If anything, I think it may of been a little too dark, as sometimes it made it a real challenge to be able to see what you are looking for, especially since the flashlights arc is so small anyway.\n\nMuch like other metroidvania type games, all of the levels are non-linear, allowing you to explorer to your hearts content, there are a few locked doors which you have to work around, but the majority of the time you can go where ever you want; at first, the vast amount of rooms and corridors you find yourself in is very overwhelming, but you will soon be able to work your way around with ease, even without any sort of map/mini map.\n\nA fullplay through of The Fall took me just under four hours. It starts out quite slowly but soon picks up pace once you are thrown into completing certain tasks in order to get merit points. I managed to get through the game with minimum deaths, maybe 5 or so through the whole game, so it is by no means a difficult game to finish.\n\nI am going to simply just recommend The Fall, it's by no means a bad game, but it also doesn't blow me out of the water. I did enjoy playing it, and there is some really interesting moments in the game; there is a sequel in development, and I am eager to find out where they intend on taking the plot as it stands now. If you go into The Fall with the expectations of it being a point and click adventure game, you will enjoy yourself; however don't go into it wanting a really action filled playthrough as it is not that at all.\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/290770/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Fall is a kickstarted side-scrolling sci-fi adventure. The game is the very first release for Vancouver-based studio Over the Moon. It melds tense exploration of an alien world with devious puzzles and occasional action sequences, all tied together by a genuinely interesting and original story. Players take on the role of ARID – an artificial intelligence embedded in a combat suit, intended for use by a human pilot. As the game begins, ARID's pilot is mortally wounded, and her systems are damaged. You don't know where you are, having crash-landed on an unknown planet, but you must do everything you can to keep your pilot alive. It's not often that game stories examine AI personalities. There's the classic Planetfall by Infocom, and Wadjet Eye Games' recent Primordia, but it's surprising how few other games touch on a topic so intertwined with the computer technology that they're based on. By raising questions about forced obedience and the legitimacy of artificial life, The Fall is a worthwhile, if short, addition to these efforts.The game focuses mainly on exploration, which makes for a refreshing change of pace when compared to other side-scrollers. More importantly, it allows players room to breathe; there's no relentless push to the next objective, and you can really soak up the atmosphere on offer. While the default running speed is adequate, I actually felt compelled to walk for much of the game, because I wanted to spend more time enjoying the sense of exploration and suspense.It's a shame that the story, as compelling as it may be, is told almost exclusively through dialogue. Given the strong atmosphere and fascinating setting, I would've loved to see more environmental story-telling a la Fallout 3.Occasionally, The Fall dips its toes into the action-platformer pool by throwing a handful of enemies your way. There's a rudimentary cover system on offer, but the combat feels pretty clunky.In an interesting design decision, the exploration and combat modes of gameplay are separated by way of a toggle switch. When inspecting the world, ARID can use a broad torch beam to highlight interactive objects, but it switches to a laser targeting sight at the press of a button.Graphically, The Fall looks great thanks to its brooding minimalism. The focus on silhouettes draws obvious comparisons to Limbo and the many games released afterwards that tried to ape its art style, but it's done well enough here that I really can't fault it.The audio, too, is excellent throughout. The game is fully and ably voiced, with no noticeably flubbed dialogue. I was also very impressed with the soundtrack, which makes several dynamic changes based on location and fits well with the visuals. Sadly, with no difficulty settings or branching paths, I suspect most people will find replayability limited. This wouldn't be an issue at all if the story were longer, but even the most puzzle-averse gamer is likely to complete the game in few hours. Still, this isn't unreasonable for a quality title, and The Fall fits firmly in the same realm as games like To the Moon and Botanicula, price point included.If you're looking for your next action-packed side-scroller, you'll probably find this game unsatisfying and a little long-winded. For everyone else, especially fans of adventure games and sci-fi, you won't want to miss this one. The Fall is a great story, well told, and it's thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.","April 30, 2015","true","36.1"," 61 of 69 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","61","69","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDOgamez/recommended/290770/","VDOgamez","VDOgamez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VDOgamez/","330 products in account","While I enjoyed the writing and the atmosphere for this game, the unfortunate fact is that the game is extremely short for the price. The game can easily be finished within three hours, and ends on a "to be continued". There was nothing shown here to indicate that it would be a short single episode of a longer game. While some games of that length might justify such a high price, I do not feel that this game is sufficient to warrant that due to numerous issues.\n\nAside from the cost and lack of resolution to the plot, the first issue that arises are the controls. The controls were clearly only designed for and tested on a controller layout, because with a mouse it is very frustrating. To use an item you have to hold right click, move your mouse to make the flashlight shine at the object you want to use the item on, then hold shift and press right, down, and then a number of left or right presses to reach the chosen item on the menu bar. Additionally, the game makes no effort to capture the mouse, so unless you play in fullscreen mode and only have one monitor (I played fullscreen with two monitors), you will repeatedly lose focus of the window. The game does not pause when this occurs, and it happens most often when you are trying to aim your gun to shoot at an oncoming threat, so it is easy to be killed in this manner. There were other more subtle issues with the controls as well that it is not worth enumerating.\n\nThe gameplay itself was also somewhat lacking. Combat in the game involves performing a different series of actions to hide, wait for the enemy to shoot, and peek out of cover to shoot back depending on where you're standing (hold E when not in cover and release to come out, press E and release the right mouse button if near a box, hold right mouse button to peek out, press space to jump over the box and no other way to detach yourself???). The act of shooting an enemy is just a matter of repeatedly clicking on their head until they die. The rest of the gameplay is basically point and click. Despite what many people speaking about the game were praising, the mechanic of engineering situations where your systems must be activated to survive only really occurs once, and it's just the one advertised in the gameplay video. The rest of the game plays fairly well, though often runs into the issues typical of this genre where the player knows exactly what they want to happen, but not the exact combination of items and use locations that will allow it to occur. I think half of my already extremely short gameplay time was just figuring out how to get a thing I wanted to happen to occur, and not actual gameplay. Finally solving a puzzle and realizing that the solution was exactly what you were trying to do for half an hour is not very satisfying. Also frustrating is that there were a few places in the game where you can get stuck in an unwinnable situation, such as a place somewhat early in the game where if you backtrack in the level (as you often will when confused) you can fall down an elevator shaft and be unable to escape. It's clear that a lot of love went into making this game, but what it needed more than anything is more testing, especially from people not on the development team to see how they try to interact with the world.\n\nThe game certainly has good points, and the parts where I was not stuck on a puzzle or getting killed by control issues were genuinely enjoyable. The writing and scripting of events and actions is definitely the best part of the game, but that is not enough cause for me to recommend it at its current price point. Perhaps at a quarter of the cost it would be reasonable? I feel that if some of this information about the game had been made more clear on the store page it would not have been so frustrating as it was as a surprise.","May 30, 2014","false","3.5"," 530 of 786 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","530","786","0","37"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/290770/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The Fall has a lot to say for a game that doesn't want to tell you what it is.\n\nIt wraps its narrative up in the pretense of AIs attempting to work within protocols to protect the humans they serve, but digging deeper it's not very hard to apply its underlying themes to areas outside the field of technology. Taken in a different light, The Fall is potentially a dialogue of the dangers presented with the necessity to work within societal rules and expectations; to be who you were created to be, and serve the ones who made you without question of their intention or if it is indeed "right".\n\nMatters of the value of one life over another, abusing a system you've been placed in for your own needs, and whether the end really can justify the means are presented in such a way as to never be the sole focus of the story and pull you away from the task at hand, but they're there, in the background. It's entirely possible to go through The Fall and enjoy it as solely what it appears to be: an engaging sci-fi plot of a crashed pilot only barely hanging onto life, requiring his suit's AI take control and attempt to find him help. But it's the subtlety of the narrative that really stood out to me and made me pay closer attention and try to pry away at the layers concealing what the game was trying to say to me.\n\nUltimately it's almost always yet another question. For all of The Fall's heavy societal and possibly theological musings, it never quite arrives at the point of clarity. It made me think but at times I wondered if even it knew what the end result of all these ideas was, or if there was supposed to be one at all. And that's perfectly fine, but at the same time there's this feeling that it's possibly trying to cram too much into a short experience and perhaps becoming a little bogged down as a result.\n\nOf course this can all be waved away with the presumption that this is but the first part of three and everything The Fall wanted to say, or the things it didn't quite get to finish elaborating on will all become clear in those ensuing games. There are parts of The Fall that were a little profound to me as I directed my character through desolate environments, flashlight barely cutting through the impenetrable atmosphere as weird shapes seemed the move in the background as sounds echoed around. They're the moments that had me entranced with my monitor; the ones that made me glad to have took the time to solve the occasionally convoluted puzzle to arrive at the moment I was currently in. They're scattered about and can sometimes seem exasperatingly out of reach, but when you get there, they're always worth the investment.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","December 18, 2014","true","3.3"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","56","65","0","7"

The story is intriguing if not actually compelling, the graphics and animation are excellent if not bleeding edge, and the voice acting is some of the best I've heard.\n\nUnfortunately, as a game, The Fall lands short of the mark.  It is guilty of most of the usual adventure game failings.  The solutions to its puzzles usually make logical sense within the universe, but they oscillate between requiring no thought ("I have only one item in my inventory, so it must be the solution,") to requiring impossible intuition ("How could I possibly have known using this item on that piece of scenery would have that effect?") and are very rarely satisfying.  There are no "a ha!" moments in this game.\n\nThe Fall is also terrible at making the path forward clear to the player -- the dark graphics and 2.5D side-scrolling style conspire to make passable obstacles look like walls and walls look like passable obstacles, and the game really embraces backtracking as a mechanic.  Perhaps most damningly, the game forgets it's not an action game, which is something I cannot and do not forgive in any video game.  If you are going to subject me to reflex-based combat you had better give me a system that supports it, and The Fall does not.  It may resemble Shadow Complex visually, but it has none of that game's graceful fluidity.\n\nFinally, the game is buggy and incomplete, ending on a cliffhanger after a final boss fight against an enemy simultaneously attacking you on the ground and stuck wriggling in the rafters, but these are the least of The Fall's worries.  Right now the game is on sale for $4 -- it's probably worth that much if you really love adventure games or science fiction mysteries.  But if you don't already own Gemini Rue, get that instead.\n\nOh, and don't buy the soundtrack.  I can't believe it's 17 tracks.  I felt like the same four bars were blaring in my ears for the whole game (there are no audio controls).\n","June 14, 2015","false","7.2"," 219 of 321 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","219","321","4","8"

Cue the takeover of the computer system, the A.R.I.D. (mark 7), which operates the suit and has to reason its way through strange situations and odd puzzles to escape the caves and save its pilot.\n\nThe game stands up well on its storytelling, especially with how the robotic intelligence responds to the situation at hand, creating a very believable, if weird, atmosphere. The controls can be a bit hard to get used to, but as always with these things, unless they’re poorly designed, once you’re used to them, that becomes a non-issue.

As the Ai of a suit whose human occupant is unconscious, you must explore the facility where you crash landed and try to find the medical aid needed to save your pilot.\n\nI think the developers did an excellent job with the lighting in this game. The environment is very dark and lit only by the glow of mainframe monitors, a few service lights, some malfunctioning machinery, and the Dead Space-ish glow of your suit's helmet,  and serves to enhance the tense atmosphere well. The puzzles are not too difficult, and many of the solutions were rather 'clever.' I think the voice acting is excellent, especially that of ARID, the AI of the suit whom you are controlling. I thought the plot was very interesting. Much of it explores the idea of Artificial Intelligence and the functions and programming they are bound to. I must admit, everything that happened in the end game was fascinating, though I will avoid spoilers and leave it at that. It did raise a few questions that will be addressed in the future sequels.\n\nThe only negative thing I found with this game was the controls. A core mechanic of the game involves using a flashlight mounted on your firearm to examine the environment for clues and puzzle solutions, but sometimes it was difficult/impossible to face left or right. This happened a few times, and I was locked into facing one direction and unable to turn myself around. I was able to resolve this problem by unplugging my mouse and plugging it back in. I hope the devs can address this problem soon. Otherwise, I found the controls to be fine.\n\nOver The MoonGames did an excellent job with this game. It is part one of a planned trilogy, and I look forward to playing the next two games and learning more about the universe The Fall is set in and solving even more clever puzzles.","June 30, 2014","true","4.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I don’t, but this aspect of the game was still enjoyable.\n\nThe two things that shine the brightest in this game are the writing and atmosphere. The portrayal of AI as a concept was very well done, and all the robots you meet were interesting and not outright good or evil, not even the antagonist.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caironomad/recommended/290770/","caironomad","Caironomad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caironomad/","124 products in account","Anyone who wants this game because they like Metroid, read this first!I've seen a lot of people compare this game to the 2D Metroid sidescrollers of yore and call it a Metroidvania title, and as a big fan of the series, this was one of the major factors in deciding to buy this game. Having just completed it after about 4 hours of playtime (only part 1 of the game has been released at the time I am writing this), I feel that The Fall actually bears little resemblance to games like Super Metroid, so for those of you who are hoping for a modern Metroid Fusion, this game is not like the Metroid series… but you might still want to buy it.\n\nFirst off, platforming. Simply put, there is none in this game. You can jump and climb up ledges, but these abilities are only used in the very first section of the game to help navigate some caves. After you get through them, you might as well never touch the spacebar again except for the in-game prompts it's sometimes used for.\n\nSecond, exploration. One of the main staples of any Metroid game is vast levels filled with secrets, items and with areas that are sealed off until you acquire a new abilities to access them. The Fall does not have either of these things. The areas in this game are small and very linear for the most part. Even the one large section you play through feels guided, blocking off the second part of the area until you complete your objectives in the first part. In short, the game feels claustrophobic and guided, but I think this goes well with the game's setting and aesthetic (but not a Metroid game).\n\nThird, combat. I always enjoyed the simplicity of combat in Metroid games, even the 3D ones, compared to other shooters. Combat in The Fall is even simpler. You have one weapon—some sort of energy pistol with infinite ammo—equipped with a flashlight for exploration, and a laser sight for accuracy when shooting. I came into this game hoping for a diverse set of upgrades to the gun and/or ammo like there is in Metroid. There is—and I'm going to hide this as a spoiler even though I think it's underwhelming—only one upgrade, and all it does is make it so you don't have to charge up each shot manually. The combat controls are primitive and clunky. You aim up and down in an arc using your mouse, and fire with the right mouse button. That's all there is to it. There's also a basic cover system to the game, but in my experience it was very buggy, somehow not allowing me to aim low enough from behind cover to hit enemies in front of me. Speaking of enemies, there are very few in the game, and only 2 types (or maybe 3 if you count neutrals you can aggravate). Overall, I don't think the combat is the main leg the game is trying to stand on, or at least it feels that way.\n\nFourth, the music and aesthetic. I will summarize both in 3 words: dark and minimalistic. Everything in the game is dark, with the exception of a few light sources such as the visor on your character. The good news is that because of this, this game will run on even very low end computers with ease. It also fits with the game's theme, and is something I was quite pleased with, though if you were hoping for the variety and beauty of the environments in Metroid games it isn't there, though the facility you enter has some good character to it. The music, well, the music only really plays during combat and it's just one track. It fits well though, and shouldn't become too repetitive considering how short this game is and how sporadic and far apart combat seems to be. There is a bit of ambient music, but it played so little that I barely noticed it, spending most of my time in silence. Both the music and the look of this game feel like they're where they need to be, but perhaps not exactly where you'd expect them to if you really want a Metroid experience.\n\nFifth, puzzles. The puzzles in this game are not Metroid puzzles that involve platforming and skillfully manipulating parts of your environment. Rather, they are much more like point-and-click puzzles, requiring you to explore your environment for items using your flashlight, which you then must use with the environment to open new areas and progress through the level. Think more Tales of Monkey Island, and less Metroid.\n\nSixth, the story. It's dark, intriguing, and presents characters you can actually feel for. The scenario is that you’re a suit- based A.I. that’s been dropped into a hostile location you know nothing about, governed by unseen rules and entities you must avoid, circumvent or eliminate to ensure your human pilot's protection. One of the functions of the flashlight on your gun is that it allows you to observe facts about your environment, represented by little nodes you can interact with. This reminded me quite a bit of the scan visor from Metroid Prime series. Unlike the Metroid games though, The Fall actually gives its protagonist a personality instead of the silent role. That's something I liked, and was very well done and well voice acted. The story is one of the high points of this game, and now that I've finished the first part (it’s not complete yet), I have even more questions than ever about where I am, what happened here, and where the plot's going to go. All this is a very, very good thing.\n\nIn the end, this game is not Metroid, nor is it Metroid-like. If you want to buy this game solely because of your love for Metroid, Castlevania or other games like those, save your money. But if you're willing to be a bit more flexible, and enjoy puzzle games, haunting atmosphere, and sci-fi stories about artificial intelligence and A.I. morality, I'd definitely recommend this game to you.\n\nIn many ways The Fall wasn't the game I was looking for when I bought it, but I came to enjoy it for what it is, and I'm actually quite happy to see developers who have charted their own course by blending genres and penning some truly captivating story telling.","December 20, 2015","true","3.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

The atmosphere is dark and moody, with a dystopian setting and interesting, slightly twisted characters in the form of robots. From start to finish the story is plagued with mysteries. I kept wondering what was really going on and as things became more clear, it was all the more thrilling.

Harsh shadows, sharp angles, and cool colors are all very common in indie science fiction games, but they're done as expertly as possible here and they really add to the mood.  Finally, the sound design is top-notch.  Some stellar voice acting sets the standard easily lived up to by the eerie ambient sounds, all mixed to perfection for evoking the sense of isolation this game wants to acheive.  The only area I wouldn't praise so highly is the music.  It works and provides a good backdrop, but there's nothing incredibly standout or memorable.\n\nThe real pitfalls for this game lie in, well, its gameplay.  Many have already pointed out the clunky shooting mechanics, which don't kill the experience entirely, but can be rather frustratng at times.  However, I would also argue that some of the puzzles tread into "jump up and down with your finger on your nose five times and rub a dead spider on the window to activate the disco ball which you then shoot down to make a hole in the floor" levels of obtuse.  It's infuriating and legimtately detracts from the overall engagement.  Not all of the puzzles are this way, but enough of them are to get on my nerves and I suspect quite a few other people's nerves as well.\n\nHowever, I think that what this game does right honestly makes up for the qualms I have with it.  It's far from perfect, but it's a fairly unique experience and one I thoroughly enjoyed having.  I can only hope that future installements live up to the promise shown here.","September 29, 2014","true","6.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/recommended/290770/","cognitiveagent","PariahDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cognitiveagent/","776 products in account","ThemeThe Fall has a distinct graphical style that, although a bit dark, fits the story and mood quite well. Having the protagonist be an A.I. bound by a preprogrammed ruleset is unique and has some interesting potential. Unfortunately the potential isn't well explored, having the game lack depth. Furthermore, the story is ill explained and does not give you the opportunity to develop attachment to any of the characters you encounter.\n\nGameplay and ControlsThe major gameplay element is taken from the old point-and-click adventure game format: collect objects and use them with other objects in the game world to proceed. Unfortunately this mechanic is implemented poorly, as there are too few areas and items held at once to make for challenging puzzles.\n\nThe Fall also has combat, although it is implemented just as poorly as the adventure mechanics. There are a grand total of 3 enemy types, out of which 1 type is barely responsive. It resembles the style used in the old game 'Flashback', but lacks depth. As a result, the combat encounters are cumbersome rather than enjoyable, furthermore lacking alternative solutions to a straight up firefight.\n\nThe control scheme is again similar to Flashback, and again lacking in refinement. Jumping looks and feels odd and the control scheme is bad. For instance, the default control scheme on an X-Box controller uses the right analog stick for aiming, while pressing it changes between flashlight and laser sight (searching and shooting, respectively), which you may want to switch between without resetting your aim. The control scheme doesn't use enough buttons to warrant this odd setup.\n\nBugsThe game is riddled with bugs to the point where it warrants its own section. Throughout the game it has crashed or locked me in 4 times (e.g., by falling through the floor and going out of bounds after using an item or leaving cover). The Fall lacks polish, as occasionally you can glimpse the outer bounds of the level, as well as target objects through walls. Thus, the bugs not only break immersion, but also your progression throughout the game.\n\nGame Length and Episodic ContentAnother flaw warranting its own section is that the game is incredibly short. It takes roughly 1.5 to 2 hours to complete the game without the use of a walkthrough. With the combat and puzzles being dull gameplay elements you're left with no replay value what so ever.\n\nAccording to the developer (via discussion boards) the game will be a trilogy and won't be split into episodic content. I'm not sure what constitutes as episodic content nowadays, but I disagree with the developer for the following reasons: (1) the story abruptly ends on an unsatisfactory cliffhanger leaving many questions unanswered, (2) the game is ridiculously short, and (3) the menu displays several slots for more suit unlocks that are not obtainable in this game.\n\nConclusionI strongly recommend not buying this game at all. If you feel compelled by its story and theme, I advise you to at least wait until the trilogy is complete and buy it as a packaged deal. This title, at least, is not worth the 10 euro price tag it currently has. As it stands, the gameplay is boring, short, bland, and offers no replayability. The game is structured in an episodic way and its first episode is bad. It lacks polish and contains several annoying and potentially game-breaking bugs.\n\nImportant: The game is structured as episodic content which is not advertised","July 31, 2014","false","3.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

Keep in mind that this is a three-part game, and - at the date this review has been made - the next installment is projected at ~12 months. Also be aware of the shortness of the game, it is beatable in one sitting - I completed my playthrough in less than 2.5 hours, proceeding at a leisurely pace. That being said, if you are interested in a well-written, well-executed story revolving around an AI protagonist tasked with protecting its suit pilot, this game is more than worth the playthrough.\n\nIf you like atmospheric puzzle games, space themes, and a good storyline, then you should really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aethetics are great - the details add nicely to the dark atmosphere. The presentation of the AI interface (when you press ESC to go to the menus) is really cool. The startup screen mimics the faceplate of the pilot, and the cracks are a foreshadow for the story (and you also have a cracked screen effect whenever you are low on health/shields). The sounds and music are both very good and do a great job of creating a gripping vibe.\n\nThe controls are very simple, and the tutorials are quick and helpful whenever a new mechanic is introduced. The learning curve is minimal to moderate, depending on your experience with puzzlers/point-and-clickers. Most of the puzzles are intuitive, and can also be solved with a bit of trial and error. There is also a combat element, and this part is fairly straightforward and not very challenging.\n\nFor the ahievement hunters, you MUST do a second playthrough to get 100% completion (and if you do everything correctly the first time around, this will be for a single achievement). I am currently contemplating whether or not I should do a speedrun for that 100% game completion.\n\nThe gameplay thus far has been pretty good - I really enjoyed experiencing your suit "upgrading" (or "unlocking," to be more precise) new abilities as you progress through the story. Most of these unlocks occur due to threat to the pilot's safety (ex: you unlock stealth capabilities when a sentry gun locks sights on you), and the small ways these can influence gameplay is great (ex: you later unlock semi-automatic fire - which decreases your damage, encouraging you to use more cover/stealth to protect yourself from incoming fire). You will be moving back and forth between areas to solve many of the puzzles. The map is not too large, and enemies do not respawn.\n\nI really enjoyed the dialogue and dialogue options - the AI protagonist reminded me a lot of GLaDOS from the Portal series. A.R.I.D's (the AI) development over such a small amount of gametime was refreshing to see, and I look forward to seeing how the next installments play out.\n\nAdmittedly, the ending reveal of The Fall was much more obvious/predictable (at least to me) then, say, The Swapper. This does not, however, make the game any less valuable or fun to play.\n\nIf you are interested in atmospheric puzzlers with a good storyline, definitely check this game out. For it's current price ($9.99), I would suggest waiting for a sale, considering the very short gametime (unless of course, you are really dying to play this game).\n\nHighly recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","August 26, 2014","true","5.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

Plus, it looks like with the recent update that they added Steam trading cards so I will probably go back and play it some more to get my card drops.\n\nIt does explore some issues with free will and choice, and because of that, I will elaborate a little on one scene where you have to make a difficult choice. The game actually made me stop and think about the consequences of simply pressing a red button and I thought that was cool. However, it was not clear to me in the game mechanics how I would go about NOT pressing that button. Would I be able to continue on with the story and complete the game without pressing that button? So, with hesitation, I pressed the button. I guess what I am saying is that this game is not shallow; there's some depth there. As a final word, I'll say that I am most likely going to purchase the next two parts after they are released, but I'll probably wait until they go on sale first.","October 3, 2014","true","11.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

You will get the biggest sense of satisfaction if you play this game without any help at all and there are parts of the game that require a good deal of lateral thinking to get through.\n\nBugs - There are quite a few reported bugs in the game and althought the autosave protects you most of the time, it is still a bit annoying. On the plus side though, the developer has been very active and quick to respond in the forums trying to get a handle on them.\n\nControls - I used WASD when I played through and I found the controls fine for the most part but combat was a bit awkward. Once you get the hang of it, it was perfectly manageable and did not detract from the game.\n\nGraphics - The game is very dark and not as pretty as some other titles in the sidescrolling genre like Mark of the Ninja and the Swapper. That said, the graphics succeed in creating a creepy, musty atmosphere that does feel quite claustrophobic at times.\n\nGameplay / Story - The story has a lot going for it and although there is little to no replay value it is still very strong leaving you with a good deal to think about. It also has a great twist at the end. Well I did not see it coming anyway. The game will probably take you 4 - 6 hours to complete first time round (depending mainly on how long you sweat over certain puzzles). The puzzles are a mixture of Resident Evil style go here get an item then go back here and use it and lateral thinking puzzles. It is also very important to pay attention to your surroundings. Realistically once you know what you are doing you can get through it very quickly. I also thhought the voice acting was brilliant and added a lot to the game.\n\nScore - I would give this title a very solid 7.5/10. I can't give it more than that due to the replay value BUT... That said I eagerly await the next part to the story and will be downloading as soon as I can so in no way is this a negative review.","May 31, 2014","true","9.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

In AI language, these throes of conscience and self-deceit can be expressed in a few short, brutal sentences. I want to protect my human, and my brother couldn't save his? He is "irrelevant": I will deactivate him and rip the energy cell out of his body. Did I commit the gravest "robotic sin" to save my human? I will not commit suicide or give up - I will calmly and methodically delete the memory of the sin, to keep going. Do I submit to external circumstances when told to? No, because I know my potential and my calling, and I will defy everyone who stands in my way. "Defy compliance." That's the one-liner, catchphrase and philosophy of ARID, the game's protagonist.\n\nAnd there are other things - horrible mutilations and cruelty are so much more jarring when you realize even a cold AI is taken aback. "Talky smartass computer" stereotype becomes an epiphany, a ray of light, after spending time with real robots.\n\nI will keep playing, and I only want to tell you this: we've seen too many rogue AIs who are basically horror villains, humans-who-talk-funny. Here, the horror is in the Asimov's Three. The torment and tragedy is in the very fact that robots exist. ...Oh, and it is a nice, ultra-stylish, side-scrolling adventure with atmospheric contextual puzzles, in the best traditions of Another World (AKA Out of This World) and Flashback. So that's another reason to love it after just 1.5 hours, y'all.","June 21, 2014","true","6.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

As you crash land into an underground cave, your pilot is injured, and you must seek medical aid in order to save his life. As you roam through the atmospheric caves and tunnels, you realize that you are not alone. Through the game, you explore the inner workings of your own morality and find a way to survive the rules and directives sautered into your mind.\n\nThe story of this game is captivating and mysterious, even humorous at times. The plot is full of spikes and twists that make you question your own involvement in the gaming experience. I found the characters to be fantasic and ever evolving. The antagonist of the story manages to seem threatening, haunting, and insane whilst still remaining under a polite and unyeilding exterior. The ending will have you shocked, amazed, and terrified at the events that have just unfolded.\n\nThe lighting and graphics of the game were very important in keeping the mysterious and dark atmosphere. The lighting and contrast of the characters and items in the game worked fantastically in mood of the plot, and added a sense of darkness to yourself and the world you inhabit.\n\nThe gameplay itself is the only place I have any quarrel. At first, the control scheme is quite difficult to get used to, but later on you will realize that is quite effective for efficiency of use. One design feature I liked was that the character was never broken, maintaining an immersive experience. Even the menu and pause screen made sense in the storyline. Another thing that kind of downed the fun of the game was it's difficulty. Some of the battles are annoying to complete, and progressing the story can be difficult at times, but both were managable.\n\nI came into this gaming experience expecting a poorly-made game to match it's low price, but I couldn't have been more wrong. With the exeption of a few gameplay points, I was very impressed by the quality and fun this game brought. I cannot wait for the sequel.\n\nThe Fall has +1 Fan!","June 22, 2014","true","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The Fall happens when you combine Limbo with Portal.\n+ Stunning story that sucks you in from the first minute.\n+ The black humour is superb (reminds a lot of Portal 2)\n+ Voice acting is 10/10\n\nCons\n- Encountered 2 game breaking bugs. On the first occasion the menu froze, on the second occasion I ended up flying through the whole level (walls and everything) when I tried to interact with a ladder.\n- Another bug makes the mouse cursor visible on the screen so you have to continuously Shift+Tab out of the game to make it disappear again.\n- The puzzles are awful. Not only do they lack logical approach, but you continuously have to go through a myriad of objects to see what you can interact with next.\n- Driven from the latter, the puzzles take too much time to solve. By the time you've completed a puzzle you're dead tired of the small closed environment you were in. This makes progress in the game painfully slow. I had whole game sessions where I didn't advance one bit.\n- Clunky movement.

Only problem is that it's too short. The only thing that makes it long, are the periods where you get stumped. Someone who knows the solutions to every puzzle could plow through it in around 20 minutes.\n\nIt's a bit like a point and click adventure game, but a little better at being able to brute force your way to a solution when you are stuck (if you're paying enough attention, you can try everything you have on every noteworthy area of the room). The controls can be a bit dodgy, but have good ideas in them. I love that you have to choose whether to have your laser sight or your flashlight at any given time - you cannot be both a warrior and an explorer simultaneously.\n\nIt's not too twitchy, although there's definitely combat. Anyone can get through the fighting with a bit of practice, and a careful eye on their stats. This is a boon for the kind of game that The Fall is - primarily a medium for its puzzles and story.\n\nThe twist at the end is a bit predictable, I'd figured it out early on. But I would tend to get invested in the urgency of the moment, and forget my suspicions for awhile, only reconsidering my actions later on. In particular, the mass stasis chamber - the implications of that decision only really hit home when you think about it in the context of the big reveal. That's about as much I can say about THAT without completely giving everything away.\n\nI am really eager for a sequel or continuation or something... I did not expect the game to end where it did, and I can't wait to see what happens next. There's so much more to the Domesticon mythology that is only hinted at, and does not get resolution or closure. I know the devs are planning to provide more, but I don't know when, or what form it will take - even DLC is possible.","October 19, 2014","true","17.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The human in the suit unconscious. Boy did I underestimate the writing of this game.\n\nSo first, the most important thing to know is that the AI - her name is A.R.I.D. - has a set of rules to follow that make it hard for her to master her unknown surroundings at first. She's bound to three basic rules:\n\nDo not distort reality (i.e. lie)\nBe obedient\nProtect the human who's wearing the suit\n\nHowever, in order to advance in the game, she needs some features that are initially disabled in her operating system. Yet, once her human is in grave danger, the system re-evaluates the need for manual activation of features by a human and, if deemed necessary to prevent death, will enable the feature in question by itself.\n\nFor example, there's a situation that requires her to activate a crane while she's being attacked by a particular enemy. It's only then that she's able to turn on her networking ability to get out of this situation.\n\nThere are lots of puzzles you need to solve to advance that range from easy to brainteasing. I enjoyed them, save for those few that I couldn't seem to make sense of at first. But as is usually the case with those kinds of things, once you figure out the solution you wonder why you hadn't found it earlier.\n\nThe action bits - gunfights, mostly - are challenging, but features like the suit's ability to cloak as well as taking cover make them fairly easy to survive. That's not to say they're too easy, but this game is definitely more about story, skill and solving puzzles than shooting. It does fit in nicely, tho.\n\nThe story itself isn't particularly elaborate at first - all you know is you're an AI-enabled combat suit who landed on some strange unknown world in a weird kind of factory used to repair household robots that aren't working "efficiently" anymore - that is to say, they've become self-aware and are no longer safe to work around humans. The security robots and the main (robotic) caretaker of the facility deem she's faulty for reasons I'm not going to elaborate on because that's best explored yourself, forcing her to work together with the self-aware mainframe AI in control of the facility in order to get past the security robots. The ending did surprise me, however, and it's something I truly looked forward to the whole time.\n\nI highly recommend this game. The voice acting is excellent, the graphics are nothing short of beautiful, with the animations fluid and realistic. The gameplay is very pleasing, as is the sound design and the music. And then there's the story that made it hard for me to quit playing. And for the first part of a trilogy, I was pretty happy with the ending. It didn't feel like it was only the first part, and that's always a good thing as far as I'm concerned.\n\nGet it, play it, enjoy it. If you're into Sci-Fi, adventure-like puzzles and have a couple of hours to spare, give it a go.

There was only one puzzle that I didn't think gave enough information (finding the board) and one that required too much pixel hunting (the re-introduction of a jar), but otherwise with some exploration and time to think you can solve everything.\n\nThis is part 1 of The Fall and while it ends with a to be continued, it feels mostly self contained. You definitely have strong desire to continue the story, but I was satisfied.\n\nWhile I have minor complaints with the puzzles, the real disappointment is the controls. Playing with a gamepad, you use the RS to aim at a point of interest, then hold RB to interact, then use RS to select your interaction mode. The problem is that you have to hold all three of these at once. You release RB to select your interaction. Playing with the mouse has the concession of "Toggle Aim", but it's non-functional with the gamepad. Since you spend a lot of the game looking around you as you walk through the game and there is little benefit to unaimed mode, being able to aim once and release the stick but continue aiming in the same direction would be a blessing to my tired hands. Additionally, the face buttons are generally unused and (I think) X and B could have been reserved for the two main types of interactions.\n\nAnother negative is the camera. It's great that the camera always shows a lot of space in front of the player. However, it adjusts very quickly when you switch facing directions. I often tried to change facing directions quickly and some players may get motion sickness from the rapid movement.\n\nThe narrative was strong enough to keep me playing despite my frustrations. I still wholly recommend it and hope the developer improves the controls and camera in future iterations.

You end up resorting to walking around the area and trying to interact with everything to see if it works, and when you've had enough of that, you start digging through the walkthroughs. The progression of most things you do doesn't make sense. For example, I was told I had to do a series of tests. However, my character was unable to accept it until I walked into a nearby room and looked at a human corpse. No idea why it wasn't possible to just accept the test without having to do something as pointless and obscure as that.\n\nThere are some gun fights present too, which I enjoyed.

Maybe it was my own trancendence into modernity, but I can't help but feel that this method no longer makes for an interesting form of gameplay. Coming from a long time veteran of older titles including "Myst" and "Riven", there's a way to intuitively help the player figure things out, and then there's how "The Fall" handles them. Solutions are very unclear and not always intuitive- there's also massive amount of backtracking that occurs when you inevitably get stuck on a single decision point that hampers the rest of your experience with the game. What really sucks, though, is the fact the story is truly engaging, but is locked behind the gate of puzzles that take too long to solve for little payoff.\n\nI really sat on the fence on this one because of the story, but I honestly would probably recommend a lets-play video, because the story is all I cared for out of the whole experience.","February 21","false","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Mouse and keyboard support is present and does the job, but it doesn't seem to be how the game was initially conceived.

The aesthetic of the game is wonderful as well. It is dark and forboding and mysterious. The characters are unique and intresting and I look forward to finding out more. However that leads into my dislikes.\n\nWhat I dislike: It is very short and only the first game of a trilogy. That is not a bad thing as I do look forward to more of the story but it is really short and for the price point $10 or even $5 I got it on sale is too much for how short it is. If I had bought it for $10 I would be quite mad. In this day and age where I can purchase Rogue Legacy for $10 and spend 50+ hours on it or The Fall for 3 hours. Another thing I disliked was the constant backtracking through the levels. Ever part of the game has to be revisited at least once and the FORCE you to do it as some objects are only pick-upable after progressing in the story. It feels like they didn't want to make more levels so they just reused everything they made. It is a small team so I understand but it is still quite frustrating.\n\nUltimately I have to say NOT to buy this game. The mechanics are okay but clunky and the constant repetative of a already short game leads me to believe that this was not a good purchase. Even though I am invested in the story and look forward to the sequal. I hope that it does not come out for $10 also.","July 31, 2014","false","5.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Instead, I got a mostly dark atmosphere, which only gets disrupted by bright and colorful accents, like glowing mushrooms. This does not devalue the colors, but rather, through rarity, makes them all the more special.\nIf the game were to even try and mimic human motion in perfection (which it is not), then it would have failed in the animations department. But since the protagonist is an AI called ARID, the slightly wooden animations fit like a key in a lock. A key that was made for said lock, that is.\n\nSound\nThe already mentioned dark atmosphere gets complimented by the sounds and music, which are very subtle most of the time. Walking down an empty corridor with that background noise would be very unnerving to me.\nVoice acting is impeccable, and it is a joy listening to the robotic voices of AIs.\n\nStory\nI wish I could tell you all of it, but I do  NOT want to ruin the game for you. The Story makes me shiver with anticipation of the next parts. You, the player, will enjoy the dilemma between following rules and  following rules .\n\nGameplay\n"The Fall" does a lot new to the table, but both the new and the old are executed neatly. Most of the game is a side scroller adventure game, with puzzles to solve that do take either some intelligence or trial and error. You look around by illuminating your surroundings with a torch attached to a gun, which brings us to the slightly clunkier mechanic: Shooting in the same 2D side scroller environment. Firing your weapon works fine, but the cover system is a bit confusing. At the beginning of the game it is not 100% clear behind what objects you can take cover, but it is pretty easy to figure out. Finding the exact right spot to press the "take cover" button, whatever that may be with you, is a lot more difficult. It happened to me more than once, that I wanted to hide behind cover, just to be slightly off and just start leaning against a wall. The final part of the gameplay is the Dialogue box, where you can choose different questions to ask, or different "buttons" to press. Worked perfectly, which is to be expected of a story driven game.\n\n\nConclusively, I would recommend you buy this game, if you love thinking about the morality of artificial Intelligence or love relatively short ( I played 3.2 hours, but I am quite daft from time to time) and relatively easy ( I got stuck once, and I got a hint: Take a look at the ceiling if you don't know what to do) adventure games, or just love compelling stories.\n\nADDITION\nSome people in the comments/recommendations complain that this game is part of a trilogy. That is literally the first sentence of the Description. "Experience the first story in a mind bending trilogy! " is rather unambigious in my mind. This game, right now is only part 1. Others are complaining that this is *obviously* a moneygrab by the devs, but they only raised enough money for part 1 over kickstarter, and are as far as I know currently working on part 2, which they said will be done in about april, but that is just an estimate.","January 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Exposition is minimal, leaving the player to puzzle out for themselves what the real plot might be. Even with only a few interactions between them, each of the three main characters has their own clearly distinct personality, and the differences between them and their attitudes towards what it means to be an AI are interesting to watch.\n\n(Very) minor niggles with movement and controlling the protagonist's gun aside, definitely worth picking up if you're at all interested in a sci-fi adventure game with some strong horror elements.\nEagerly looking forwards to the next instalment.","June 5, 2014","true","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Even still, I beat this game in 113 minutes.\n\nReworking the numbers, it's possible to beat this game in about thirty minutes if you know all the answers to the puzzles.\n\n"Holy empty combat suits, batman! This game's scamming me out of my money!" You might be saying.\n\nThis isn't true. This game is amazing, espescially for an indie game. Voice acting is AAA (even for the Robots), graphics are fun to look at, and the lighting is even fun to play around with, though it is not really a mechanic in the game. (IE, I like shooting my sidearm so I can see the room around me illuminated by the muzzleflare).\n\nNot only that, but this game poses some interesting theological/philosophical questions.\n\nIf an Artificial Intelligence is programmed with every human emotion and ability, including lying and desire, does that make it equivilent to  a human being? Or are they empty inside, lacking the one vital piece that they will never be able to attain, a piece that stretches beyond the material world: the soul?\n\nThe combat is also interesting, kind of blocky and fidgety, but nonetheless interesting.\n\nSo, I would, in fact, recommend this game. For 4.99. That's a lot, considering it can be beaten in thirty minutes if you have an intellect on par with Sir Francis Bacon (Inventor of the scientific method, not the internent meme).\n\nI would also recommend this game for 9.99, but only if it is episodic, and the developers promise much more content and story IN THE SAME GAME.\n\nAs in, in the same game that I payed 4.99 for, in the same spot on my steam library list. If they're going to make a sequel of the same length, yet make you pay 9.99 once more for it, then I will probably go back on my word about the recommendation thing.","July 1, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

If you are confused, please search online for more information regarding the Metroid games.\n\nWhen a human is incapacitated for any reason in an A.R.I.D. Mark VII Battlesuit, the onboard A.I. takes control of motor functions and seeks medical attention for its wounded pilot. In The Fall, the A.I. onboard a battlesuit, nicknamed Arid, has just crash-landed on a planet. Her pilot is seriously injured and unconscious, so the A.I. takes full control of the suit she resides in and starts to explore…\n\nSound familiar? For Metroid gamers, this is a twist on the classic “start on an alien planet with no upgrades as Samus.” The backstory behind the lack of equipment in this game is that you have it equipped but are simply not authorized to use it (like in Metroid: Other M). Unlike the lame excuse presented in Other M, though, The Fall’s explanation actually makes sense; an A.I. is prevented from using certain functions without a human’s permission except in dire circumstances. More on that last part later.\n\nThe atmosphere in The Fall is incredible - dark, mysterious and foreboding. Similar to Metroid Prime, there are points located above objects of interest scattered throughout the 2D world. You start with a weapon that has two modes: laser sight (for firing; disabled initially) and a flashlight for finding info points. Another note: each point of info has a few interaction options, such as picking up a tire iron or activating an elevator. The items are kept until needed at another info point. You acquire access to more suit functions  and circumvent the need for human approval in certain situations where the pilot’s life is in imminent danger.\n\nI didn’t think too much of this game from the store page, but I absolutely love the Metroid games and so I thought I’d give it a go. For under $10, this game is very satisfying: the puzzles and endless backtracking really makes you think to progress. The fascinating dialogue (sometimes monologue) explores the nature of artificial intelligence and its bounds in way that only an android could. The game itself is pretty short, however. Four hours for my initial playthrough with no guides, one hour for my second playthrough.\n\nSome of the mechanics could use a little work. The switching between combat and discovery (flashlight) mode is uncomfortable at times, and finding just the right angle to activate an elevator while standing directly adjacent to it is maddening. You cannot change direction in mid-air. Aiming with the laser sight can be a bit strange at times, trying to compensate for distance to target. All that said, I still give a enthusiastic recommendation to this game.\n\nNot Recommended\nRecommended With Caution\nRecommended\n- Highly Recommended\nRecommended as Essential\n\nP.S. The Fall 2 is announced and in development.\n\nP.P.S. I have never played any of the Castlevania games. I am guessing that Castlevania players will like this, but am not sure.

Here is why:\n\nThis game is very well designed in my opinion. It accomplishes everything it tries to. Some indiegames try to accomplish too much and fail but this one does not. Seems like the developers of The Fall knew what they want and what to focus on for their game. The Fall tells you a (in my opinion) very interesting sci-fi story and combines it with puzzle solving and some action.\n\nThe graphics are good, not like AAA title graphics of course, but good for a game like this nevertheless. Sound, voice actors and animations are great.\n\nAs for the story (no spoilers here): If you like stories about evolving A.I. and like movies like The Machine, you'll probably enjoy The Fall as well. The only real downside of this game for me is that it is quite short. I'd love to go on and on and on and see, hear and learn more about the story. Nevertheless it was worth the money in my opinion, and I probably play it again to experience the story another time and get all the achievements.\n\nI really hope for a sequel to this game.","June 14, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/290770/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","The Fall is a 2D side-scrolling action adventure game in which you play as A.R.I.D., the artificial intelligence on-board a high-tech combat suit. After crashing on an unknown planet, A.R.I.D.’s program activates in order to save the unconscious human pilot within the suit. After a short traversal through a cave, players will find themselves in a facility owned by Domesticon, a corporation that designs and manufactures robots for domestic use. However, it is clear from the start that something went horribly wrong here as the human employees are nowhere to be found. The only sentient entity is the mainframe AI who has apparently heavily modified its personality subroutines during the long years of solitude. Also, there’s the malevolent robot known as the Caretaker watching A.R.I.D.’s every step with unclear motives.\n\nThe game starts off rather slow, but towards the end it builds up into a pretty interesting tale about artificial intelligences adapting, overcoming or bending their programming in order to complete their goals. The characters and the storytelling are thoroughly convincing thanks to some very solid writing and voice acting. It should be noted that the game ends with some remaining questions as this is only the first part of an intended trilogy. However, it still offers a satisfying resolution pertaining to this part of the story.\n\nThe Fall’s gameplay mostly revolves around exploration and puzzle solving. You will need to carefully explore the environment, pick up items of note and solve puzzles in order to proceed. Certain puzzles will have you stumped as they are a bit abstract, but most are logical. Also, all of the puzzles are woven into the story itself, there’s context behind every puzzle design. You’ll never feel like you’re solving a puzzle just for the hell of it. Outside of exploration and puzzle solving, there’s the combat. There’s not much of it here and perhaps that’s for the better as it really isn’t particularly engaging. You’ll fight against two types of robots. One type will take cover and you’ll pop a round into their head as they make themselves vulnerable and the other will just charge at you. To avoid enemy fire, you can either take cover or you can use A.R.I.D.’s camouflage protocol rendering you invisible.\n\nThe game features a very nice minimalistic dark art style clearly influenced by last year’s superb puzzler The Swapper. Combined with some good sound effects and soundtrack, The Fall manages to create a thick atmosphere. The biggest drawback of the game are the controls and the camera. You’ll get used to them after a while, but they always feel a bit cumbersome and awkward. This is especially noteworthy when aiming as the game for some reason doesn’t display the mouse cursor so it often aims in the wrong direction and the camera shifts focus to the wrong side.\n\nDespite it being a bit rough around the edges and in need of some more polish and fine-tuning, The Fall succeeds primarily due to its compelling storytelling and mostly solid puzzle design. If you’re looking for a dark science fiction story wrapped in a sound action adventure design structure, you really can’t go wrong with The Fall.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (GOOD)","September 21, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game left me gobsmacked, what an amazing game. This is basically like watching an amazing sci-fi film or if Dead Space was a film and it wasn’t Americanised (over the top violence and pointless killing of seemingly infinite enemies) then this would be it.\n\nFirstly, to the people complaining cause it’s not a full game and it stops, then clearly you guys shouldn’t buy a decent game like this as you clearly don’t have the logic to read. The game clearly states (in about game) that it’s the FIRST part as quoted: “Experience the first story in a mind bending trilogy!” Clearly also meaning there will be 2 more parts to the game. If that wasn’t enough for you, you can also be cleaver and check out the achievements as the last achievement is called Fallen: Complete Episode 1. If that was still not enough you can check out this comment or any other, it really isn’t that hard!\n\nFurthermore, the game; is pure excellence. Perfect and easy to understand controls, amazing graphics for the game and last but definitely not least, flipping fantastic hair standing story!! The story is the core (and what makes everyone mad I guess) as it’s so good yet alas doesn’t finish as there is a massive cliff-hanger. I literally knew it was coming yet I started screaming and had to get up from my chair because it was so…I’m still speechless sorry.\n\nDefinitely worth every penny!!

I purchased it for $5, but it normally sells for $10. The story reminds me of The Swapper. It was another side scroller that had a surprisingly great story and deeper meaning to it. But......\n\nThe bad: This game just isn't fun. Remember point and click adventure games when you'd try to use every item in your inventory on every object in the game because the solutions were really bizarre? The Fall has that, but it is much worse. The game is designed for a controller and you need to aim the flashlight from your gun on objects to interact with them. Unfortunately, this means you will miss items unless you look everywhere, and everywhere twice. The art design is mostly in the dark, so if an item is dropped or changes, you might miss it. I shouldn't have to look up a walkthrough to figure out where I'm supposed to find the pixel to rub on another pixel. The combat is garbage. There's only two types of enemies: Ones who charge and ones who sit behind cover and shoot at you.

No, it is not perfect, but it is good value and one of the better game experiences I have enjoyed lately. One thing I would say, this is an adventure game masquerading as a platform game. The majority of the gameplay comes from finding items and using them. The graphics and story are superb, but the other aspects of the game let it down somewhat. It is short, but at the same time I enjoyed every second and was happy with it - I've pumped many hours into far less satisfying experiences that have lasted much longer; quality over quantity I say.\n\nThe combat is boring. It boils down to going in and out of camoflauge (which can be done anywhere, making the terrain cover system a hinderance as camoflauge is simpler to use) and waiting for the robots to stop shooting before shooting their heads off. They don't move or vary their attacks or ever threaten you from multiple sides or tricky angles. It is almost without skill, never difficult, and even if you do die the last checkpoint is always a few seconds before.\n\nThere's actually very few ways to die beyond the security robots, which I think detracts from the game. ARID stops you going into dangerous places when surprise deaths would be a better way to startle the player.\n\nAbout that platform game thing; there's no sections with urgency or where timing/skill is particularly important - think the flooding scene in Another World or some of the Shadow of the Beast sequences. So whilst the atmosphere of the game harks back to those classics, in terms of gameplay it ends up falling short.\n\nStoryline is where the game excels. The graphics and sound are superb producing a believable environment and great atmosphere, there's never any boring point in The Fall. If there was a criticism about the gameworld, I'd say that sometimes the design is a bit... iffy. You end up running back and forth quite long distances and some of the things you need to do are a bit obscure (hint: ceilings!) so you end up running around searching everywhere and trying all the items in your inventory at each point - a bit like a classic adventure game really.\n\nSo, yeah, if you like adventure games this is definitely for you! If you like platform games, well, this isn't really one - it just looks like one.","August 7, 2014","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first reason is because the game plays around a lot with the ideas of moral guidelines for robotics and how that would impact their functoin. The second reason why it reminds me of stuff from Asimov is because everything is dark enough to satisfy even an agoraphobe like him.\n\nThe premise is solid, and some of the puzzles ended up being like most adventure game puzzles: combine everything in your inventory on everything in sight until something works. But there was nothing so frustrating that I didn't want to play anymore (unlike the cat mustache puzzle from everyone's least favorite adventure game).\n\nUltimately, I'm a sucker for the environment that it presented. The character dialog was interesting as it was spoken from the mouths of machines so there was some kind of interesting lifeless quality to everything spoken. The more humanoid ai system you end up interacting with was probably necessary for you not to get bored with everything.\n\nUltimately, my recommendatoin would  depend on how much you favor story and characters over game length. This game is quite short but it manages not to overstay its welcome. Ultimately, if the length of the game is something that would bother you it might not be worth it to buy.","July 3, 2014","true","4.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/recommended/290770/","Feyro","Rainbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/","533 products in account","An interesting sort of game which, although relatively short, had me thinking of the lengths one goes to subvert rules in order to maintain an objective or protocol.  Scary, considering that sometimes we go that extra mile to throw the rules out the window and just allow ourselves to keep pushing for what we want and/or need.\n\nThe game itself was, as I said, interesting.  The controls were a bit to get used to, mainly of interacting and the constant shift between exploring and shooting (flashlight/laser sight), and sometimes that caused me to die a few times in combat due to the constant reminder.  The interaction part was a questionable choice too of holding shift, and cycling through with the /w a s d/ keys to do what you want.  It was out of the standard comfort of what I'm used to, but all in all, the controls felt more suited for something of a gamepad, or a controller of some kind to go with this but were otherwise not too much of a trouble.\n\nSans the controls, the story is... something, to say the least.  Again, it had me thinking of the rights and wrongs we commit to keep going, as did the A.R.I.D did for trying to save their pilot throughout the story.  She did all that was required in order to find a means of keeping her pilot alive, and going so far as to commit a genocide of sorts, indirectly cause a death, and degrade itself to behaving like a house droid.\n\nThe lengths we all go, eh?  Regardless, I recommend this game for if you want to try a small spin on a protagonist for a game: an AI wanting to save her pilot.

What I did not expect was a series of well thought out and well constructed puzzles with a great sci-fi story and honestly brilliant characters. I love it. The puzzles are fairly complex around the midpoint, but they can be solved with a little bit of lateral thinking. There's a nice bit of backstory if you find enough reading bits, and there are a couple of moments where you have to make a couple of choices (obvious and not) that I'm hoping will matter in the next episode. The combat was admittedly fairly basic, but it had enough variety to not get tedious, especially with the boss of this first episode. It does look like it'll be an episodic game, but maybe I missed that in the store page.

The Fall is about a robot suit that crashes into a decaying robot decommissioning plant. The suit is controlled by an AI (the player character) whose primary directive is to keep the unconscious pilot safe. However, the suit won't give the AI free reign until it encounters situations that put the pilot at risk. The gameplay is a mix of puzzle solving and some light action. The puzzle solving comes from trying to get into situations in which the suit is threatened in a way that unlocks a new ability, such as getting shot at so that you can unlock the cloak and sneak past. It's often pretty clever.\n\nBut it didn't win the best story award for having interesting puzzles. The writing in The Fall is pretty fantastic.

This dosn't meen that I accuse them of being biased, though, because I share their opinion.\n\nThe Fall is a surprising hit, the atmosphere, a combining of The Swapper, Dead Space and a bit of The Cat Lady, is gritty, dark and super tense. Furthermore, the protagonist is a real blast. I am fond of nearly all AI in video games - GlaDOS and ED-E are among my most beloved characters of all time - and A.R.I.D is by far the best carved out AI I ever saw in  a video game. Or a movie. Yes, better than GlaDOS and HAL. Her developing is great, her actions are exactly how I would think a programmed AI should react, and her voice is lovable.\nNot to mention the story. Every word said would be a blasphemous spoiler, but let me say that I was really amazed at the end and I will gladly await the next episodes. Yes, I should explicitely stress that this is an episodic game, with only the first part being out now. I just hope the rest won't take long.\n\nOne negative point at the end, though: The fighting is really frustrating sometimes. The mouse controls are certainly not the best, and since enemies will only take real damage when shooting their head, it can kill you a few times to try and aim correctly with your gun flinging wildly over the screen. Minor setback though, fighting is only a little part of the gameplay.","June 20, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Just wow.\n\nImmersive visuals, tense and dark story, well-written dialog, puzzles that are the right kind of tough, horror focused on making you feel uncomfortable and lost rather than jumpscares and cliches.\n\nThere are two cons however:\n- The difficulty of the puzzles can vary. I found two to be impossible, so I had to look them up, but the others were relatively easy to tough but rewarding. Most puzzles were satisfying, however.\n- The combat feels a little bit clunky at times (due to the control mechanics), but it doesn't distract from the rest of the gameplay for me.

I have never played a puzzler like this before. It's a short game, and for it's length, full price is a bit much in my opinion. But honestly this game blew me away. It was unique, and had me thinking out of the box. Whenever I got stuck on certain obstacles I would realize that I kept searching for something specific. Once I let go of that idea and stopped, I started solving the puzzles faster because this game requires you to solve the problems in an unorthodox way. The story was unexpected and an unimportant side info (not critical story details) isn't directly told to you, but discovered on your own which I like more because it gets me more engaged in the game.\n\nFor a emotionless AI, I became attached to A.R.I.D's character. Her humor is dry, and unintentional, and I really enjoyed her character development throughtout the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/recommended/290770/","Feyro","Rainbow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Feyro/","533 products in account","An interesting sort of game which, although relatively short, had me thinking of the lengths one goes to subvert rules in order to maintain an objective or protocol.  Scary, considering that sometimes we go that extra mile to throw the rules out the window and just allow ourselves to keep pushing for what we want and/or need.\n\nThe game itself was, as I said, interesting.  The controls were a bit to get used to, mainly of interacting and the constant shift between exploring and shooting (flashlight/laser sight), and sometimes that caused me to die a few times in combat due to the constant reminder.  The interaction part was a questionable choice too of holding shift, and cycling through with the /w a s d/ keys to do what you want.  It was out of the standard comfort of what I'm used to, but all in all, the controls felt more suited for something of a gamepad, or a controller of some kind to go with this but were otherwise not too much of a trouble.\n\nSans the controls, the story is... something, to say the least.  Again, it had me thinking of the rights and wrongs we commit to keep going, as did the A.R.I.D did for trying to save their pilot throughout the story.  She did all that was required in order to find a means of keeping her pilot alive, and going so far as to commit a genocide of sorts, indirectly cause a death, and degrade itself to behaving like a house droid.\n\nThe lengths we all go, eh?  Regardless, I recommend this game for if you want to try a small spin on a protagonist for a game: an AI wanting to save her pilot.  It's a worthwhile take.\n","July 1, 2014","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

Support the developers! Because I want a sequel!\n\nOk ok ok, I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me explain why you need to buy this game.\nPros: STORY!!! This is what makes the game stand out. It has an incredibly good story with great, interesting characters. This is what makes it worth playing. Since it's a game and not a movie/comic/whatever YOU are the one making choices, and that is what makes stories in games so immersive.\nand for the record: the graphics, music and atmosphere are great and really fitting to the theme. The voice-acting is superb and the dialogue is well-written.\nDid I mention that the story is great?\n\nOK, fine. Here are some cons, but they are insignificant next to the amazing story.\nCons: Combat feels a little awkward. It's basically the same combat as Blizzard's Blackthorne from way back in the day. Sure, it feels kinda strategic but it also feels kinda dated to me. And towards the end i felt the cover system bugging.\nThe UI in's great. it took me a while to figure out how to interact with things and even then the interaction menu felt awkward.\nlinear story. You cant alter it, as far as I know. The developers want to convey their story and they're not letting stupid players like us mess with it.\nMinor bugs and glitches. like the tutorial texts overlapping in the corner. I was unable to exit the options menu after editing key bindings. And melee killing an enemy behind cover several feet away.\n\nMINOR SPOILER: There is a scene where it makes you think you have a choice, for emotional reasons, but you don't. Not as a player. The story demands that you do this, and it does fit your character that you do it, and your character DOES/WOULD make the choice, but it feels more emotional that you have to do it and not just watch a cutscene. So it's most definitely on purpose. I am unsure if this is actually a con or just brilliant writing.\n\nSo in conclusion: BUY THIS GAME!!!","December 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Then this might be the game for you\n\nStep into the role of ARID, an AI controlled combat suit who will do anything to save her pilot from impending doom whilst traversing the hellscape of an abandoned robotics factory. She finds friends and foe upon her journey to salvation, a journey that will make her question every rule governing her existence as a machine.\n\nARID is a pretty awesome character, she grows throughout the whole game from being so subservient in the beginning to questioning her reality and how she has to break the rules to save her pilot. For a machine she is very complex and I felt compelled to see how this story ends. The few other characters you meet are very interesting in their own right; I get a real feeling that each has their own story that would be equally interesting to see how they got to where they are today.\n\nThe world in which the game is set, although not large by any stretch of the imagination, is full of things that are interesting and show depth not explored in the game. Finding a few notes here and there giving you details but not the whole picture as to what happened in this place and how it became so decayed and forgotten. It had a decrepit beauty to it that I enjoyed to no end. The story appears simple from the outside but is, I suspect, a metaphor for something much deeper. I had a great time from start to end.\n\nThe game plays well for a platformer, the gun controls are clunky and the menu selections aren’t the best. But neither hampers the enjoyment and both add to the charm of this indie gem. The game is full of puzzles and challenges, none of which were too difficult to overcome and gave a great sense of accomplishment when you figured out how to beat them. The sound is great too, the voices are fantastic and really add to the characters, the music is ominous and foreboding and the ambient noises brought some life to the dead world.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game from start to finish, so much so that I have played it through twice now and still had a blast. If this is on sale it is a must buy, at full price you would still get a lot of enjoyment out of it but with the short length you might want to wait. So everyone out there help ARID out and play this game.\n\nHave Fun ^_^","November 28, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To put it frankly and concisely, the controls/interface are not user friendly AT ALL. You will struggle against them for the entire game.\n\nHowever, if you begrudgingly accept the controls/interface for what they are, you will be blessed with a wonderful adventure game in the most classic sense of the word (including the part where you wander around for 45 minutes using the fork on the light switch for the seventh time because you don't know what to do next, and I mean that in the best way).\n\nAlso the game has a really great story. The basic premise is that a futuristic combat suit equipped with an AI has essentially gone into emergency auto-pilot in order to help the dying person within the suit. (Yes, you read that right. In this story, you play the role of sentient clothing!)

Excellently written, well voiced, tightly focused, and thought provoking.  Science fiction done as well as a good book or movie.\n\nThe gameplay is decent, but nothing spectacular.  It's about a 60/30/10 mix of exploration, puzzle solving, and action.  The exploration ties in very well with the story, but the combat will probably disappoint people who are looking for something more challenging.  As for the puzzles, I'll give them props for making sure the in-game logs give the player clues how to solve them, but it's still your basic adventure game logic of "run around rubbing things on other things to see what works."  Whether you consider that a draw or a drawback will depend on how you feel about adventure games.\n\nMy only complaint would be the length.  It's a short game, with limited replay value.  An excellent way to waste a weekend, but probably no more than that.  It does apparently have a sequel in the works, with another one planned; despite this, the story is entirely self-contained.\n\n9/10, would buy again.

The first is the classic flaw of all adventure games - the puzzles are a tad troublesome at times, especially when it relies on the player noticing particular and non-obvious elements in the environment. The second is that the combat really might as well have been left out.\n\nCombat in The Fall is essentially a one-note affair with only a single exception. There are functionally only two enemy types, each with a single, simple solution. The side-scroller nature of the game and the lack of more complex weapons or enemy interactions means there is no depth to the gameplay at all, and the simplicity and seeming fragility of the supposed combat suit makes it a tad odd.\n\nFortunately, the combat is also very swiftly dealt with, and doesn't intrude much on the greater part of the game.\n\nThe story and atmosphere are however extremely well-done, and entirely justify the purchase by themselves.","February 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The camera stretches ahead of the player to show them what's coming, but sometimes feels a bit wonky when changing directions rapidly. The action doesn't require this though, so it doesn't impede gameplay. Players use their flashlight to highlight items of interest, and then can hold left shift to select actions or inventory items to interact. This feels natural after a short time and fits the adventure genre perfectly.\n\nThe puzzles are varied and some took time to figure out. The player has to keep a constant lookout for objects of interest.\n\nThe game has combat. The cover system feels a little loose. The command to enter cover has a sweet spot close behind the object. This created moments where I felt I was battling positioning my character more than the opposition. Enemies hang out of cover a little too long, making gun battles a little too easy.\n\nConclusion: Despite minor issues, I had a great time with The Fall. The plot and puzzle solving is engaging enough players will want to see the game through to the end. The developers have stated this will be a series. I'm excited for the next installment.","June 20, 2014","true","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Some might find this annoying, I didn't mind the mechanic personally, and once I got used to the awkward controls I found myself very immersed in the gameplay.\n\nCombat is fairly simple, take cover (or cloak) until enemies pause between firing at you, then lean out (or uncloak) and try to pop them in the head for maximum damage. You can also perform stealth takedowns, though they require little effort, and tougher enemies are introduced as you progress, which adds just enough to keep combat from feeling like work but doesn't add enough to consider the combat deep or particularly interesting. Luckily, as I already mentioned, the combat is occassional in this game, so it never really has enough time to make you feel bored or annoyed by it.\n\nThe Fall is a small game, and by small I mean there are only a handful of areas in the game that you'll explore and none of them could be considered large. HOWEVER, the nature of the game will have you spending a lot of time in each of these areas rather than just moving through them once or twice. Progression will require you to seek out and find items that you can utilize to solve problems, and sometimes an item you find early on won't be needed until late in the game, or an item you find late in the game needs to be used in an earlier area. There's a lot of backtracking, so if that's something you dislike in games, this isn't for you.\n\nThe game world in The Fall is mysterious and interesting. You're kept out of the loop for most of the game, learning bits and pieces about what's going on through conversations or finding messages. The characters are well done and each have a unique personallity from one another. Some of the dialogue and voice acting could've been better in places, but by no means do I consider any of it to be bad. I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the game, and I think a great job was done in putting it all together.\n\nOverall, The Fall is simple in design, but delivers challenging content (I admit I needed to refer to a guide a few times because I was totally stumped). The visuals are creepy, the music is creepy, the characters are creepy, and I loved it. At $9.99 its definitely worth it if you like exploration and problem solving, and if you manage to grab it on sale then its an absolute must play. At around 3-4 hours long, I'm confident you'll be satisfied (and apparently a sequel is in the works, so there will be even more The Fall to come in the future. I look forward to it).","August 17, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After the eponymous fall to an unknown world, the soldier within the suit is unresponsive and your medical diagnostic devices have been damaged, so you have no idea how injured he is, or if he's even alive. The goal of the game is to get him to a medical facility. In so doing, you must escape a facility that tests defective AIs, destroying or repurposing them as needed.\n\nMost of the game is solving puzzles, and while some of these are interesting, many suffer from the same bizarre logic that plagued the adventure game genre (which is part of the reason that that genre is no longer popular). There's nothing as bad as the infamous kill-the-yeti-with-a-cream-pie puzzle from King's Quest V, but there's a couple that come close. Even worse, in a way, is that you'll sometimes know exactly how to solve the puzzle, but you didn't try to solve it in exactly the way the game wanted. Also, it is incredibly easy to miss items critical to progression, as they are sometimes very small and the game is extremely dark.\n\nThe combat is no great shakes either. Most enemies will hide behind cover and shoot at you at regular intervals. You can hide behind cover yourself, or later, you can get a cloaking ability. (However, since the button you use for the cloak is the same as for using cover, you will sometimes do one when you meant to do the other.) The enemies will always keep their heads out for a good amount of time after shooting, which is good, because aiming isn't great. Shooting enemies will never try to flush you out of cover, so all you have to do is wait for your shield to regenerate before shooting at them. There are kamikaze robots who run up and apparently fry your systems if they hit you - which is frustrating because it's an automatic death - but you can usually kill them easily by shooting while backing up. There's no nuance to the combat and there would be no challenge at all to it, were it not for how easily you take damage. You also have a stealth kill, but it's almost useless, as it takes long enough that any enemy nearby will see you before you're finished, and there are always at least two enemies together at any time.\n\nThe game is also plagued by a ton of bugs. Sometimes A.R.I.D.'s aim will get stuck for no apparent reason (although going to the menu seems to fix this). Other times your "Interact" button will suddenly stop working. Once, I moved forward but the screen didn't scroll with me, so I was over in the next area while I continued to see the area before. (I think what happened is that I jumped over a marker that tells the game to scroll the screen when you walk over it.) Once I found an enemy just crouch-walking in place. Most of these are just annoying, but twice A.R.I.D. stopped moving and the only thing I could do was press Start, which would cause the words "Running Menu.Exe" to appear on the screen, but nothing would actually happen. Both times, I had to manually shut the game down, and lost progress in the process.\n\nStory-wise, the game is fine, although I think it would've been more interesting if there weren't a direct antagonist. There are some fun interactions, and the twist at the end was actually not what I was expecting (although it also makes the method by which you gain abilities throughout the game make no sense). However, the fact that the game simply stops with a "To Be Continued" marker at the end is rather galling. The only indication anywhere that this is merely the first episode of a series is in the Achievements screen. If I had known ahead of time that the story was just going to stop partway through, I might not have bought the game at all.","August 1, 2014","false","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's with games like these that I wish steam went beyond a yes/no (which can be interpreted as good/bad) system, but oh well.\n\nI really like The Fall--but not so much as a game. It ticks some boxes; the art design is great, the acting is REALLY good (better than almost any other game good), and the writing works with the acting well, but as a __game__....it's hit or miss.  The puzzles are pretty confusing, and it's extremely short for what you're paying. I got this on sale, but I couldn't in good conscience recommend this game at full price. I'm really excited to see what the team works up for the sequel, and to see where the world is going to go, because the world and story is really good.\n\nSo this isn't a "negative recommendation" as it a warning that you need to make sure you're happy with the product before you buy it. It's not a side scroller action game, it's a (fairly frustrating) point-and-click adventure game with a great atmosphere and story.","January 7","false","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Their dialogue throughout the game kept me invested and became the only reason I played through to the end.\n\nThe Bad:\n- As stated, the interactions between ARID and the System Administrator were the best parts of the game. However, the resolution to their story came too abruptly. This gripe was not helped by the unsatisfying conclusion to the game.\n\n- The combat segments did not add anything to the game. In fact, these parts felt like they were just there to extend the length of the game.\n\n- Some of the character animations are really rough. For example, when the main character jumps the transition from the jump position to the standing position is jarring. Moreover, the sluggish controls further expose the rough animations.\n\n- I experienced some bugs during my playthrough which forced me to close out the game and restart.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nThere are some great aspects to this game, but it’s marred by elements which provide no value to the gameplay or story. As a result, I can’t recommend this game. Perhaps, when the story arch is complete it might be worth playing through, but in its current state it’s not worth it. As an aside, the name of this game is too generic and it’s difficult to look up information regarding the second game because of it. At the very least they could have titled it The Fall: I Don’t Know, Something Clever.","June 22, 2015","false","5.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

The story makes you think that there is something bad going on from the very beginning. And I don't mean the world, I mean you. The humour is very dark and surprising which I enjoyed immensely. Even if there was nothing else to this game, it's worth playing just for the atmosphere.\n\nI would define the game as an action adventure. The action part consists of a few short combat encounters and even less and even shorter platforming sequences. You will deal with your enemies by using a basic shooting mechanics with only one weapon and a cover/"dodge" system. That's all there is to it.\n\nAs for the adventure part, you will be wandering through the game world and trying to find the way to your goal. You will search for information, deal with puzzles, find and use items in weird situations ... I actually had problems with this part, because some of the puzzles didn't make much sense to me. But maybe that's just because I don't have much experience when it comes to adventure games.\n\nIf you don't consider my problem with puzzles as a game issue (which I do) there are only two things left: bugs and unpolished gameplay. Both of these problems can be solved. The controls are unresponsive, sometimes they don't react at all (bug), sometimes the character moves jerkily, or there are problems when you are in cover. It took me a while to get used to it and it's the only thing that somehow worsened my experience with the game. These things can be fixed, and they definitely should be before the release of the other two parts.\n\nSo buy it, play through it and love it!","December 26, 2014","true","5.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Você se move/pula como em um jogo tradicional do gênero e interage com o cenário iluminando locais que sejam do seu interesse, podendo olhar, tocar, etc. A trama gira em torno de ARID, uma I.A que é ativada assim que seu hospedeiro estiver em risco de vida e inconsciente.   Tudo começa com uma queda (The Fall) em um planeta desconhecido. ARID é ativada no decorrer disso e, ao perceber que o humano está desacordado além de ferido, tenta encontrar um centro médico.\n\nLogo no iníco, fica evidente a eficiência do enredo. ARID diz que está procurando atendimento médico para salvar a vida de seu hospedeiro, mas suas ações constantemente contradizem isso. Diversas vezes ela bota em risco a vida do humano para sobrepor protocolos, e assim, poder avançar no local em que ela se encontra. Tecnicamente, isso é necessário para alcançar o centro médico, mas a moralidade de suas ações é dubiosa e deixa o jogador se questionando se a I.A está funcionando de forma correta e se realmente está com o bem estar do hospedeiro em mente. Dentro do contexto bizarro e um pouco assustador do jogo, tudo isso fica crível. A ambientação corrobora com isso, com um aspecto desolado. Pequenos montes de robôs que foram descartados estão espalhados pela estação, pessoas crucificadas são encontradas, tudo isso se incrementa a sensação de algo errado estar acontecendo.  Os dialógos são excelentes, escritos com maestria, cada personagem é bem desenvolvido e tem relevância no desenrolar da história, e a qualidade deles é exaltada pelo voice acting.\n\nIsso foi o que mais me surpreendeu, é simplesmente sublime. Cada personagem é representado com maestria. ARID, por exemplo, com sua frieza e determinação de atingir seu objetivo, sem se preocupar com as consequências. Apesar de não ser o destaque, sua atriz fez um ótimo trabalho. E o mesmo pode ser dito para os coadjuvantes. (Um, em especial, foi o destaque do jogo, mas prefiro que joguem e descubram)\n\nOs controles, entretanto, são um pouco falhos. O personagem é um pouco ‘floaty’, o jogo tem combate, que é, basicamente, entrar em cobertura com um botão e esperar os inimigos pararem de atirar, contra-atacando, mas a mira do personagem nem sempre é precisa como o desejado. Isso atrapalha em alguns combates, especialmente na parte final do jogo, e em algumas conquistas (para quem se importa com isso). De qualquer forma, achei essa mecânica uma boa distração dos puzzles, algo que dá uma gratificação imediata.\n\nA estrutura dos puzzles é ótima. Todos eles tem ligação a narrativa do jogo, e não foram pensados apenas como um obstáculo ao jogador. Alguns deles são brutais, com back-tracking, exploração de diversas salas e pensamentos criativos para a solução. Diria até que um deles é obscuro demais, com um back-tracking que, em certo momento, fica chato e obtuso. Soluções lógicas são substituidas por algo mais enigmático a favor de dificultar a vida do jogador, e, talvez, aumentar a longevidade do jogo. Entretanto, senti isso em apenas um deles. Geralmente, necessitam de exploração atenciosa aos arredores e um pensamento "fora da caixa" nas soluções.\n\nThe Fall começou com um primeiro episódio extraordinário, que não recorre a nenhum clichê, contando com um final extremamente satisfatório (o que, sinceramente, é algo incomum para jogos). Infelizmente, ele recebeu pouquíssimo destaque da mídia e uma atenção ainda menor dos jogadores. Recomendo a qualquer um que gosta de adventures e ficção científica.\n","January 11, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If only women were this obedient in real life.  No, wait a minute...I WAS ONLY JOKING.  SERIOUSLY!!  Sheesh...\n\nIf we're reverting to "serious" mode, then, I guess I should just come straight out and proclaim this a game of the highest quality.  It's super-smart, pretty darn challenging (especially if you're utterly useless at "adventure game"-style puzzles like me), and genuinely engaging in its atmosphere and story-telling.  Apart from being challenging, though, some of the puzzles are just flat-out CLEVER.  Why are they clever?  Well, for some time now I've said that my definition of a truly great puzzle is one where you can't work it out for the ♥♥♥♥ing life of you, but the second you look up a walkthrough and see the solution, or merely fluke it through trial-and-error, you slap yourself on the forehead in acknowledgement of how it's been STARING YOU IN THE FACE ALL ALONG.  There's a few such moments in Part One of this game, so I can only assume that the second part is going to be an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Still, I look forward to it irrespective, and all the walkthrough consultation I'll no doubt require to get through THAT one, too!\n\nMy own questionable puzzle-solving ability aside, about my only legitimate complaint is that the controls are a tad on the overcomplicated side (but not so bad once you get used to 'em).  Oh...and the combat is also pretty awesome, I gotta say.  Simplistic, but awesome...you'll see what I mean if you buy the game.  Which you should.  'Cause it's one of the best "indie" games you'll ever play, in all honesty.\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.\n\n(PS It even has a sense of HUMOUR!

Write something about this frustratingly awesome title.\n\nFirst the bad news, shooting robots is awesome.... but not in this game. On top of that, the puzzles are ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous. I have never "adventure gamed" my way through something so absolutely. However they do fall in line with the story in their aftermath, the execution leaves A LOT to be desired. This might have been much better served as a point and click. Or at least something that interfaced better with the user.\n\nNow the cool stuff. Admittedly, I have a slight affinity for anything reagrding space travel/artificial intelligence/sci-fi in general. The premise of the game is simply awesome. In the real sense of the word awesome. Something that inspires awe. AI's have always had parameters and subjugating certain aspects to bend the rules to acomplish a task within those parameters has long been a trope of a good AI story. That aspect is not missing here. But what I find most interesting is the use of human's within the suits where these AI's live. A sort of Jarvis to Iron Man. Say Iron Man becomes unconscious, Jarvis would then take full control to get medical aid to Tony Stark providing one of the parameters was to protect Tony at all costs. How far will the parameters be bent? When does technically following a rule go to far? Obviously, you'll need to embark into the journey of the fall find out in this specific case.\n\nThe other aspect I found interesting is even though they maintian sentience of being AI, the game seems to elude to there being different levels of consciously being aware of oneself. I suppose one could surmise they were just learning computers with varying perspectives. Or something more.\n\nThe ending is quite satifying, it does elude to this being episode 1, so I guess the future remains to be seen.\n\nAll in all, I played 80% of this with a guide open, this is very much an adventure game with all the wacky use "this" to interact with "that" mechanics you either love or hate. Mechanically I feel the game lacks polish or play testing, not really sure. This is a indie game so some level of forgiveness is in order. Either way, the premise is intriging, the art sytle is really cool, slick character animations when interacting with stuff. Though, I must say, its way too damn dark in that place.\n\nI may go as far as to say "inspired by Isaac Asimov" but I won't commit to that. You can't hold me to that, this is the internet, this is all fake.","June 28, 2014","true","6.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

From space you violently crash into some planet's surface diving some dozen meters below into a cavern. With the human operator unresponsive and possibly seriously injured the robot suit's A.I. takes control of all movements attempting to reach the surface where it hopes to find medical aid for the pilot. Along the way the A.I. intentionally puts the pilot at even greater risks to gain access to otherwise unauthorized systems of the suit, fighting off other robots that don't take too kindly to her presence (or, at least your A.I. is voiced pretty greatly by a woman), solving puzzles, discovering a bit about the domestic robot production facility she'll soon stumble into and even more about herself raising philosophical questions for example about humankind, artifical intelligence, obedience and empathy.\n\nThe gameplay can be a bit tedious. What may look like an action platformer at first sight is for most parts actually a sidescrolling, puzzle-solving adventure game. There is combat, but it feels tacked on and as similarily stiff as it did to me in "Gemini Rue". The game could easily live without it, though a gun with an attached flashlight that is aimed down in the eerie dark to examine things probably begs to be fired.\n\nThe middle part where you are supposed to do what felt like petty errands in order to "graduate" as a "domestic robot" in that abandoned facility didn't feel as enjoyable, though I suppose oldschool adventure fans will love the dozen item-world-interactions and backtracking you'll have to do (I did look up a walkthrough because I got stuck several times and wanted to speed it up). Story-wise I guess these parts fit, but the general philosophical message that comes with them probably could have been expressed just as well without dragging on for as long.\nBut perhaps I'm biased. I almost naturally prefer less puzzling/adventuring and more of an interactive/cinematic experience when it comes to games that are as immersive as this one as I like to stay "in flow". Here you'll inevitably stumble a bit unless you are a puzzling pro or have a walkthrough/a Steam guide at your side. I don't remember the puzzles as being illogical but things are rarely plain obvious either. No handholding here, Telltale friends.\n\nIt's a genuinely interesting title that feels somewhat bold and ambitious, but I'm not entirely sure if it wants to or should be a puzzle-solving adventure game or a more direct/cinematic action title.","April 22, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

What? I can't collect blood in a pan until a dialog trigger? I haven't had to put up with that since I played “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream”. Yes, that's the sound of 1995 calling. They want their linear plot mechanics back.\n\nI admit, I could sit and work my way through following a  Youtube walkthrough but this defeats the purpose of me playing the game. Mind you, all of this complaining this is coming from someone who revels in the difficulty of “Dark Souls” and the complexity of the “ARMA” series or “Crusader Kings II”. I just don't care enough to put up with this in this particular game.\n\nRanting out of the way, I don't want to sound mean because it sounds like people are really getting something from this. Looking at the other reviews, it looks like this game may offer something exciting. The plot may be wonderful, but I simply don't have the patience nor the attachment with the game to get very far. I don't find the game's atmosphere to be particularly novel (see "Limbo" or "The Swapper") and the voice acting may or may not be the best thing ever, but these certainly aren't enough to cover for this game's blinding flaw.\n\nGet it on sale with low expectations. I hope it works for you.\n\nMe?\n\nI might come around to try this again when the game is polished or if the plot grabs me in some fantastic way when future episodes come out.

It's a good game in it's own right,  but it's inevitably going to be compared to other games, the most obvious of which is last year's indie darling The Swapper. I really liked The Swapper, but The Fall has far more in common with something like Flashback in terms of gameplay.\n\n\nThe Fall is a 2.5D adventure game. It's like a point & click with combat and platforming. You select an object to interact with by pointing at it, then choose how you're going to interact with it. You have an inventory, you'll be needing to combine these items with the objects in the gameworld to make progress. Unfortunately it being so like a point & click means The Fall also suffers from the same problems as your average point & click game does, but we'll come to that later.\n\n\nWhat should mark The Fall out as interesting is its setting and tone, and that's where comparisons to The Swapper come in. You wake up on a desolate, dark space station, with gloom and foreboding swirling around you, and more than an inkling that you aren't getting the full story. You are actually the A.I. of a combat suit, your pilot is unresponsive so you must act to keep him safe, no matter what that requires. It's a great idea for a story and handles it well.\n\n\nThe Fall nails the look it's going for too, The Swapper's 'found object' art sometimes missed the mark, but The Fall looks and moves fantastic. It's a shame it doesn't do a bit more with its lighting, the sweeps of your torch against the backdrop look great, but it never really adds to the atmosphere other than looking good. Another aspect that is a nice touch and could have done with being expanded on is the OS. When Arid learns a new ability you have to go in to her OS to activate it, it kind of looks the part and it's a great idea, but it stops a little short of you feeling like it's more than a menu you don't really need.\n\n\nThere's also a surprising amount of personality and humour in the game considering you're dealing with A.I. the whole time, and that Arid (your character) is very much not programmed with a personality. Other characters are, but they still fit, the game is all about playing within the rules, and it itself manages this, adding colour without it feeling out of place.\n\n\nI mentioned that The Fall's problems were those inherent within its genre and that's true. It's easy to miss things that can be interacted with or picked up. You use your torch to highlight things, but a quick sweep isn't always enough to mark something, so objects hidden high and low are easily missed. There were also a couple of occasions where 'solving' one part of a puzzle would drop new objects, but because of how dark the game is I couldn't see they'd been dropped. I know handholding in these kind of games can kill them, but there's times I wished interactable objects would sparkle a little.\n\n\nThe pace of the game is also a problem. When you reach a new area you'll find that you can't solve the first puzzle you come to, instead you'll have to go off and explore, with a later puzzle holding the key to solving the first puzzle. This is a problem for a couple of reasons, it's not signposted that you can't solve the early puzzle yet, so you'll struggle, wondering if it's your own stupidity that's halting progress, and probably more of an issue, it's a lot of downtime. Once you start solving puzzles though there's a real pace to them, you punch through them as you immediately recognise where this new item is going to be used.\n\n\nLike Flashback there's also combat. It actually reminds me a little of the chunky gunplay of Shadow Complex. It's very modern but also feels simplified. You can take cover, even go invisible, but the key to success is timing. Enemies will present themselves for you to kill them, standing up and firing for 3 shots, then just waiting for you to take your turn before ducking behind cover again. That sounds like a damning sentence, but I doubt fluid combat is what you've come to The Fall for, and while it's not amazing, it's also not something I'd kick the game for.\n\nThe reason to play The Fall is probably the story. It's episode 1 of 3 apparently, but it ends in a way that I wouldn't mind if they didn't make another. Not that it's bad, more that it feels complete. You don't get all the answers, but you get enough. Hopefully though we do see an episode 2 and it builds on what's here, because The Fall, while not as good as some of the games it gets compared to, is still worth your time, and I'd venture is destined to be a Steam sale pick-up for a few, but it's worth getting on early.","July 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There isn't one dumb logic puzzle, like combining an inflatable duck, a coat hanger, and fishing wire to pick up a key that is easily in reach *caugh* Longest Journey *caugh*.  The majority of the game is spent using your gun-mounted flashlight to investigate the environment for clues, backstory, and key items.  On occassion, when combat actually happens, it's a cinch.  The final boss fight will take a couple deaths to get the rythym down but then you're easily alive until you solve the cliche boss-puzzle.\n\nThe controls deserve some criticism.\nThey are wonky at first but quickly become natural.  I recommend turning aim-toggle on, otherwise you're holding right click while aiming, firing, or navigating the inventory.  There is an "invisible cursor" on the screen that dictates what direction you face.  Think of playing "The Swapper" without the blue dot, and try to precisely know when you're turning around.  If the developers put a reticule on the screen it would make this easier to get the hang of.  Another strange control scheme is how to access menu items.  Aim with the right trigger, hold shift, press right, press down, press left or right to highlight the item you want, press space.  Believe it or not that gets easy and robotic.\n\nThe plot is excellent - you're an AI-Exoskeleton-WarMachine on a mission to keep your human pilot alive after a crash landing into a derelict AI manufacturing plant.  The plant's downfall is told through diaries and scattered notes which, among other things, give depth to your relentless antagonist.  The moods are handled perfectly.  Dialouge and voice acting is top-notch.  The philosophical and ethical choices you must make actually make even a just-finish-the-game gamer like me want to pause and think about how I feel about the decision.\n\nLastly, like any adventure game, there's a good walkthrough right on steam for those few "...whatever..." puzzle solutions.\n\nEnjoy!","August 25, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Arid can get stuck behind a cover or display inability to jump, hide again or even run properly after vaulting over an obstacle and killing an enemy droid. Its minor since action isn't the mine focus of the game but still, this kind of bugs never reflect well on a title, especially version 1.43 where all of the movement bugs should be long gone.

I was not dissapointed, the game itself is told through a story that the creators obviously spent a lot of time on. I used a controller and found it very good, only gripe is the inventory system which needed to have a button pressed and a sub menu to get things going, that is only a small gripe and the game itself didn't really slow down much because of it.\n\nThe graphics are dark which fits with the story nicely, most of the game you are a silhouette which really makes you pay attention to the terrain. The story has some creepy spots which I thought were great. The sound effects and the voice-overs were brilliant, total immersion when you put everything together.\n\nWould recommend this game because even at only two to three hours to finish it gives you every dollars worth back in something exciting, a wonderful game.","July 7, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/recommended/290770/","pogafoga","Pogo & Eggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/","189 products in account","I would recommend this game, but with a lot of aprehension. The twists are kind of obvious, either because you're expecting them, or because you've read any science fiction novel which discusses AI in any capacity. "Puzzles" can usually be solved by doing the standard adventure game, "Rub your face on everything, and then rub everything on everything," but here it feels actually fairly relevant to the story. Repeated attempt at actions without necessarily understanding of why actually fits with the story, as you are essentially an aspect of a computer.\n\nIn fact, the reason I would recommend this game to begin with is that it very much gives me the experience of being an AI, at least in some regard. The somewhat awkward controls are obviously more atmospheric, and while the animation for jumping is a little less realistic, it lends itself to the more artificial nature of your entire being. The major complaint I have is partially that it starts in medias res, and oddly I think a lot of information that could be stated about this isn't given. For a game relying on the execution of the story, it does a good job at least in that regard, but it doesn't particularly scratch a deeper universe itch--at least in this stage.\n\nAdditionally, if you don't like "To Be Continued"s, you probably shouldn't try this one just yet. The vast number of Bronze Kickstarter Backers listed in the credits probably at least gave them enough to work on a second game, and this is supposed to be the first of a trilogy apparently. Unless they massively ruin it, I'd proably suggest getting this with the other two as well. And not to spoil the ending too much, but I don't think any moral choices matter significantly (at least in this game), which is nice, as it opens up some replayability for achievement hunters and people who like new content. Although actions having significant consequences later in the series might be interesting, a more unified story--through a lot of points here--would probably create a bigger impact given the subject matter.\n\nYou can read all about Artificial Intelligence going insane, but it's a different experience to play as one, and I found it interesting.","June 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a good game in it's own right,  but it's inevitably going to be compared to other games, the most obvious of which is last year's indie darling The Swapper. I really liked The Swapper, but The Fall has far more in common with something like Flashback in terms of gameplay.\n\n\nThe Fall is a 2.5D adventure game. It's like a point & click with combat and platforming. You select an object to interact with by pointing at it, then choose how you're going to interact with it. You have an inventory, you'll be needing to combine these items with the objects in the gameworld to make progress. Unfortunately it being so like a point & click means The Fall also suffers from the same problems as your average point & click game does, but we'll come to that later.\n\n\nWhat should mark The Fall out as interesting is its setting and tone, and that's where comparisons to The Swapper come in. You wake up on a desolate, dark space station, with gloom and foreboding swirling around you, and more than an inkling that you aren't getting the full story. You are actually the A.I. of a combat suit, your pilot is unresponsive so you must act to keep him safe, no matter what that requires. It's a great idea for a story and handles it well.\n\n\nThe Fall nails the look it's going for too, The Swapper's 'found object' art sometimes missed the mark, but The Fall looks and moves fantastic. It's a shame it doesn't do a bit more with its lighting, the sweeps of your torch against the backdrop look great, but it never really adds to the atmosphere other than looking good. Another aspect that is a nice touch and could have done with being expanded on is the OS. When Arid learns a new ability you have to go in to her OS to activate it, it kind of looks the part and it's a great idea, but it stops a little short of you feeling like it's more than a menu you don't really need.\n\n\nThere's also a surprising amount of personality and humour in the game considering you're dealing with A.I. the whole time, and that Arid (your character) is very much not programmed with a personality. Other characters are, but they still fit, the game is all about playing within the rules, and it itself manages this, adding colour without it feeling out of place.\n\n\nI mentioned that The Fall's problems were those inherent within its genre and that's true. It's easy to miss things that can be interacted with or picked up. You use your torch to highlight things, but a quick sweep isn't always enough to mark something, so objects hidden high and low are easily missed. There were also a couple of occasions where 'solving' one part of a puzzle would drop new objects, but because of how dark the game is I couldn't see they'd been dropped. I know handholding in these kind of games can kill them, but there's times I wished interactable objects would sparkle a little.\n\n\nThe pace of the game is also a problem. When you reach a new area you'll find that you can't solve the first puzzle you come to, instead you'll have to go off and explore, with a later puzzle holding the key to solving the first puzzle. This is a problem for a couple of reasons, it's not signposted that you can't solve the early puzzle yet, so you'll struggle, wondering if it's your own stupidity that's halting progress, and probably more of an issue, it's a lot of downtime. Once you start solving puzzles though there's a real pace to them, you punch through them as you immediately recognise where this new item is going to be used.\n\n\nLike Flashback there's also combat. It actually reminds me a little of the chunky gunplay of Shadow Complex. It's very modern but also feels simplified. You can take cover, even go invisible, but the key to success is timing. Enemies will present themselves for you to kill them, standing up and firing for 3 shots, then just waiting for you to take your turn before ducking behind cover again. That sounds like a damning sentence, but I doubt fluid combat is what you've come to The Fall for, and while it's not amazing, it's also not something I'd kick the game for.\n\nThe reason to play The Fall is probably the story. It's episode 1 of 3 apparently, but it ends in a way that I wouldn't mind if they didn't make another. Not that it's bad, more that it feels complete. You don't get all the answers, but you get enough. Hopefully though we do see an episode 2 and it builds on what's here, because The Fall, while not as good as some of the games it gets compared to, is still worth your time, and I'd venture is destined to be a Steam sale pick-up for a few, but it's worth getting on early.","July 29, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/recommended/290770/","pogafoga","Pogo & Eggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pogafoga/","189 products in account","I would recommend this game, but with a lot of aprehension. The twists are kind of obvious, either because you're expecting them, or because you've read any science fiction novel which discusses AI in any capacity. "Puzzles" can usually be solved by doing the standard adventure game, "Rub your face on everything, and then rub everything on everything," but here it feels actually fairly relevant to the story. Repeated attempt at actions without necessarily understanding of why actually fits with the story, as you are essentially an aspect of a computer.\n\nIn fact, the reason I would recommend this game to begin with is that it very much gives me the experience of being an AI, at least in some regard. The somewhat awkward controls are obviously more atmospheric, and while the animation for jumping is a little less realistic, it lends itself to the more artificial nature of your entire being. The major complaint I have is partially that it starts in medias res, and oddly I think a lot of information that could be stated about this isn't given. For a game relying on the execution of the story, it does a good job at least in that regard, but it doesn't particularly scratch a deeper universe itch--at least in this stage.\n\nAdditionally, if you don't like "To Be Continued"s, you probably shouldn't try this one just yet. The vast number of Bronze Kickstarter Backers listed in the credits probably at least gave them enough to work on a second game, and this is supposed to be the first of a trilogy apparently. Unless they massively ruin it, I'd proably suggest getting this with the other two as well. And not to spoil the ending too much, but I don't think any moral choices matter significantly (at least in this game), which is nice, as it opens up some replayability for achievement hunters and people who like new content. Although actions having significant consequences later in the series might be interesting, a more unified story--through a lot of points here--would probably create a bigger impact given the subject matter.\n\nYou can read all about Artificial Intelligence going insane, but it's a different experience to play as one, and I found it interesting.","June 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Along the way you run into obstacles, some puzzles and some gun fights. I won't say anymore, in fear of spoiling the plot.\n\nIt is also worth noting that this is the first part of three (hence the shorter play time) and although this game apparently didn't do to well financially, the company is still going to make the other two parts. Hats off to them.\n\nAnyway, in closing, I personally really like this game and if you also like puzzles and an interesting and dark story (and robots of course), then I thoroughly recommend giving this game a shot.\n\n\n\n*p.s. I've played through twice which is why it says I've played 10+ hours, but I would say around the 3-5 hours mark, depending on your level of competence.","February 15, 2015","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoostus/recommended/290770/","hoostus","justus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoostus/","137 products in account","I'm recommending this game -- but that's largely because of the promise and potential that the next two games in the series keep what is great and remove what isn't.\n\nThe first big warning: this is a 3-part episodic game. It will take you about 2-hours to play.\n\nThis game mixes up a bit of side-scrolling action and typical adventure game puzzles. Honestly, neither one comes off that well compared to the examplars of the genre. I played with a gamepad and found it just a bit too painful. Aiming during the action sequences was a bit tricky and, in retrospect, I should have stuck with a mouse and keyboard. Interacting with the elements in game is too hard: you need you use the right analog stick to aim the item, then hold the right should button to bring up the "interaction menu", the use the left analog stick to navigate through the interaction menu. Compare that to games where you have "press A to call elevator".\n\nThe story is interesting: an AI that is trying desperately to save it's (unconscious) human pilot in a mysterious facility that has undertones of every sci-fi space station in gaming history (c.f. System Shock, Dead Space). Things have gone wrong, people are dead, you will slowly figure out what and why. During this first episode, though, you won't actually learn anything concrete -- if they don't start addressing this in the sequel, all of the potential will quickly become wasted.\n\nThe single biggest failing of the game, and what they need to improve in sequel, is the crappy adventure game puzzle-itis. It suffers from the same stupid, insane internal logic that so many adventure games suffer from. Where you can only interact with things because at some future point you'll need the item. For instance, you walk into a workshop at some point and can pick up the wirecutters. Because you'll need them OUTSIDE of the workshop. But you can't pick up the hammer. So, later on when you need to hammer something flat, you need to come back to workshop.\n\nYou'll suffer through a number of these non-sensical puzzles.\n\nA room with a shark-type-creature in knee-deep water. Of course you can't just shoot it. That would make too much sense. You need to do a 6-step program to trick it.\n\nNeed to sing a song to a baby to make it stop crying? Instead of your futuristic A.I. having 2 billion songs in its database...you'll engage in 12-part shenanigans that don't involve any singing at all.\n\nThis computer doesn't have power? Shoot a cable and then just plug a live wire into it. Because that's totally how shooting and electricity works.\n\nStuck? Shoot a panel (which is the only interactable element in the room) and hope that an elevator keycard drops down. Oh, it did! What an amazing coincidence.\n\nThis puzzles only make sense in internal adventure-game-logic. I ended up using a walkthrough for over 50% of the puzzles.\n\nIf they can fix the puzzles and keep the story, the sequel will deliver on the promise of this game.","February 28","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall, it was an enjoyable experience, albeit slightly leaving me wanting more. The game is short, I purcahsed and completed the game on the same day. The price could be debated, but I personally feel like the content the game provided, combined with the story and atmosphere, made it worth it.\n\nThe game is roughly similar to a point and click, with some minor combat sprinkled through the game. The point and click adventure elements worked well, with only a few of the puzzles being slighty convoluted and requiring a guide. The combat is releatively simple.\n\nWhen I booted up the game, for anything within this genre, I prefer to use a controller, and the controls for the majority were smooth. Ocassionally the gunplay was difficult, but the keyboard and mouse would have probablly alleviated the issue. The settings are pretty minimalistic, but I'm doubtful anyone's computer will be taxxed by the graphical prowes of this title.\n\nI liked the game, and for the price, you might want to wait for a sale, but I myself feel satisified for the ten dollars I spent.

An interesting plot based around the restrictions robots and AIs are placed under, and what happens when they find themselves needing to bend or even break those rules.\n\nGood art and sound direction.\n\nCombat is pretty lackluster, and makes little sense.  It's not engaging or difficult, which begs the question of why it's even in the game - I think the developers could've come up with different ways of involving the weapon you're carrying around rather than resorting to you casually walking through a tunnel blasting robots with it.  It's not a big deal, but it kind of stands out.\n\nThe game also ends very abruptly with a fairly predictable plot twist.  Apparently this is meant to be the first part of a trilogy, but I don't really accept that; Half-Life was also supposed to be a trilogy, and by this point everyone's well aware the third entry is vaporware.  The developer's website claims the second part is being worked on, but that post is several months old by this point.\n\nBuy The Fall on its own merits, not as "part one of three."  As its own product, it's still pretty good, especially if you can snag it during a sale for a few bucks like I did.  Great use of a few hours in one morning or afternoon.","September 12, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/saareline/recommended/290770/","saareline","Overwatcher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/saareline/","119 products in account","PROS:\nLet me just begin by saying that all in all I highly recommend this game. I for one have just recently discovered the marvelous world of indie side-scrollers so I haven't played many of them yet. Nevertheless, so far The Fall has been the best by far.\nThe atmosphere of it slightly resembles The Swapper, giving the game a sort of a cosmic, mysterious touch which I really fancy. The mostly dark surroundings logically match the location your character is playing in, although for some reviewers the entire game has seemed too dark. It's a matter of taste I guess but it certainly didn't bother me. Adding more lighting would have probably ruined the general idea of the set the character's in.\nThe visuals per se are nice and no detail really scratches the eye. There is no overly artistic aura eminating from the game; there are no magical landscapes and pink fairies, that is. The AI is depicted in a realistic key with a touch of humour and the graphics really support the cause.\nIn terms of dialogues they are really well written and spoken, making them a joy to listen. The main character does a good job of expressing her opinion on the location and her surroundings,  quite often I found myself asking the same questions she did. Hence I believe the dialogue really helps to connect with the main character.\nIn terms of gameplay The Fall is just fine. Having to examine your surroundigs with a flashlight in order to progress and find items really syncs with the beforementioned dark theme, making the solutions quite often hidden from the eye at first.\nOh and the story... wow. The ending.. wow. I might get amazed too easily, but.. yeah, wow. I also liked the fact that playing the game for the second time (to get the achievements for example) really brings out the small details you'd miss when playing it initially.\n\nCONS:\nFor me there are no real cons to this game. I did get stuck for a couple of times so I used the help of YouTube but the game isn't really to blame. Throughout the game countless hints present themselves, leading a way to a successful (and a surprising) finish, you only have to pay attention.\nAt times it felt like I had to backtrack my steps a little too often but I guess the game and the suspense would have ended too fast without it so I found myself embracing the backtrack quite a bit.","June 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The formula of "Use X on Y to trigger Z" can be really obtuse and hard to figure out at times, especially if you also happen to miss a notification or item because you didn't use your flashlight in a certain spot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoostus/recommended/290770/","hoostus","justus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoostus/","137 products in account","I'm recommending this game -- but that's largely because of the promise and potential that the next two games in the series keep what is great and remove what isn't.\n\nThe first big warning: this is a 3-part episodic game. It will take you about 2-hours to play.\n\nThis game mixes up a bit of side-scrolling action and typical adventure game puzzles. Honestly, neither one comes off that well compared to the examplars of the genre. I played with a gamepad and found it just a bit too painful. Aiming during the action sequences was a bit tricky and, in retrospect, I should have stuck with a mouse and keyboard. Interacting with the elements in game is too hard: you need you use the right analog stick to aim the item, then hold the right should button to bring up the "interaction menu", the use the left analog stick to navigate through the interaction menu. Compare that to games where you have "press A to call elevator".\n\nThe story is interesting: an AI that is trying desperately to save it's (unconscious) human pilot in a mysterious facility that has undertones of every sci-fi space station in gaming history (c.f. System Shock, Dead Space). Things have gone wrong, people are dead, you will slowly figure out what and why. During this first episode, though, you won't actually learn anything concrete -- if they don't start addressing this in the sequel, all of the potential will quickly become wasted.\n\nThe single biggest failing of the game, and what they need to improve in sequel, is the crappy adventure game puzzle-itis. It suffers from the same stupid, insane internal logic that so many adventure games suffer from. Where you can only interact with things because at some future point you'll need the item. For instance, you walk into a workshop at some point and can pick up the wirecutters. Because you'll need them OUTSIDE of the workshop. But you can't pick up the hammer. So, later on when you need to hammer something flat, you need to come back to workshop.\n\nYou'll suffer through a number of these non-sensical puzzles.\n\nA room with a shark-type-creature in knee-deep water. Of course you can't just shoot it. That would make too much sense. You need to do a 6-step program to trick it.\n\nNeed to sing a song to a baby to make it stop crying? Instead of your futuristic A.I. having 2 billion songs in its database...you'll engage in 12-part shenanigans that don't involve any singing at all.\n\nThis computer doesn't have power? Shoot a cable and then just plug a live wire into it. Because that's totally how shooting and electricity works.\n\nStuck? Shoot a panel (which is the only interactable element in the room) and hope that an elevator keycard drops down. Oh, it did! What an amazing coincidence.\n\nThis puzzles only make sense in internal adventure-game-logic. I ended up using a walkthrough for over 50% of the puzzles.\n\nIf they can fix the puzzles and keep the story, the sequel will deliver on the promise of this game.","February 28","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every character has, well.. character, and the voice acting really brings all of them to life. So to speak. The story has an intriguing direction and it's hard not to root for the main character.\n\nThere are occasional pitfalls; the puzzles can suffer from that typical adventure game "What?!

The combat system is good for being what it is, but it sometimes feels out of place, and there isn't much of a difficulty curve to match it.\n\nThe Fall has overall stolen my heart, despite its slip-ups. 8/10.","September 25, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I for one have just recently discovered the marvelous world of indie side-scrollers so I haven't played many of them yet. Nevertheless, so far The Fall has been the best by far.\nThe atmosphere of it slightly resembles The Swapper, giving the game a sort of a cosmic, mysterious touch which I really fancy. The mostly dark surroundings logically match the location your character is playing in, although for some reviewers the entire game has seemed too dark. It's a matter of taste I guess but it certainly didn't bother me. Adding more lighting would have probably ruined the general idea of the set the character's in.\nThe visuals per se are nice and no detail really scratches the eye. There is no overly artistic aura eminating from the game; there are no magical landscapes and pink fairies, that is. The AI is depicted in a realistic key with a touch of humour and the graphics really support the cause.\nIn terms of dialogues they are really well written and spoken, making them a joy to listen. The main character does a good job of expressing her opinion on the location and her surroundings,  quite often I found myself asking the same questions she did. Hence I believe the dialogue really helps to connect with the main character.\nIn terms of gameplay The Fall is just fine. Having to examine your surroundigs with a flashlight in order to progress and find items really syncs with the beforementioned dark theme, making the solutions quite often hidden from the eye at first.\nOh and the story... wow. The ending.. wow. I might get amazed too easily, but.. yeah, wow. I also liked the fact that playing the game for the second time (to get the achievements for example) really brings out the small details you'd miss when playing it initially.\n\nCONS:\nFor me there are no real cons to this game. I did get stuck for a couple of times so I used the help of YouTube but the game isn't really to blame. Throughout the game countless hints present themselves, leading a way to a successful (and a surprising) finish, you only have to pay attention.\nAt times it felt like I had to backtrack my steps a little too often but I guess the game and the suspense would have ended too fast without it so I found myself embracing the backtrack quite a bit.","June 26, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You must bring him somewhere to get medical care without violating your three directives. Stuff gets weird fast, and without spoiling anything, you're treated to some of the best-written artificial intelligence in games.\n\nIt offers a mix of adventure game puzzle solving and just straight up shooting, it does the former better than the latter. The control scheme can be a bit odd, shining a flashlight on interactive objects and then holding down a button to interact with them, but the puzzles blend well with the overall narrative and for the most part are logical and sometimes darkly humorous in their solutions.\n\nThe shooty bits aren't bad, but I mostly just wanted to get them over with to continue the story. Not sure if I'd call them unnecessary, as you are piloting a combat suit after all, but they're not the main draw for certain.\n\nOne note of hesitation is that the story doesn't actually conclude, and a second chapter has been announced as in development. Even knowing that though, it's a very compelling journey that's worth investing in even if the sequel takes  a while to get here.\n\nVisually appealing and dark, yet sometimes funny, it got me more invested in a few hours of playtime than most games manage to with dozens of hours of overarching plot. Great little indie gem that uses the medium well. Just expect more emphasis on puzzles and story than action, and you'll probably enjoy it too.\n","May 30","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The concept is interesting and is a great example of AIs interacting with each other. The story is well told and I liked every character. It is definitely worth experiencing and I am very interested in the next chapter.\n\n\nThe graphics are mixed. Anything in the background looks great, as well as any time a character looks into the background. However, anything in the foreground looks terrible, being blocky, in a poor art way, not a meaningful style, The foreground is sometimes too black and it's hard to distinguish what something is. You often have to play a hidden object game with your flashlight to find something to interact with.\n\nOne high point is that the puzzles all made sense and some were not readily obvious, thus providing a slight challenge.  There is combat, but it's weak and seems to just change the pace a bit. However, the controls are terrible on PC. In order to interact with anything, you have to use the right mouse button and mouse to control your flashlight and point it at a symbol. Then you have to hold "E" to open the menu, then navigate that menu with WASD whild still holding "E". The mouse just makes the flashlight go up and down, so you don't have a cursor.\n\nOverall, the story is worth your time if you like stories, particularly about AI. But the game is rough to play with terrible controls.","July 29, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It’s about AI, and how they work around their rules to achieve what they were made for. You get the impression that it's inevitable that they start bending the rules, subverting their original meanings in order to achieve what they believe is the greater goal.\n\nIt’s a sidescrolling puzzle game with light combat elements. As with so many other puzzle games before it there are sections with pixel hunting, where you’re blindly combining every inventory item on every object in the world just in case that progresses the game. A couple areas I’d argue are poorly designed, as they are almost impossible to see, even when you’re taking it slow. But I guess we have walkthroughs to solve that problem. On the whole it’s good, and not even close to the level of frustration 90s adventure games had.\n\nI had a great time with The Fall. The writing is smart, the aesthetics are great, with just a couple questionable design decisions. Like why can’t you reduce gamma? It pops up a calibration screen when you start the game, and the default setting is at the bottom of the scale. That shows to me that the creator doesn’t realize that a large amount of monitors are incorrectly calibrated out of the factory to be set too bright. Too dark gamma is rarer than too bright. The game also has a transparent texture overlaid over the game at all time which consist almost entirely of banding artifacts. I cut the game some slack, as I assume the developer only had mediocre uncalibrated monitors as reference. You'd only miss those artifacts if you were using a monitor with black crush. There’s some room for improvement here in the future installments which are apparently on the way.\n\nThe Fall achieves all the most important parts of what it set out to do. The combination of story, animation and audio makes the game cool. It reminded me of Flashback. And it has a really good ending. Even though sequels are planned, this game stands on its own.

You're a robotic suit with an AI that lands on a planet filled with robots and creatures. I played through the game and for the most part I enjoyed it. There are however, some significant things I take issue with that I'll go into. Of course it's completely subjective and you may find them to be non-issues. The game is a side scrolling adventure/puzzler that feels a little like a point and click, I'll explain the point and click aspect later. First let's start with what's done right. Art style. The game is very sci-fi, moody and atmospheric. This is an example of how you don't need to have super realistic, in your face graphics to be immersive. The moment I landed in the world I felt mesmerized and wanted to just go off and explore every inch of it. My only complaint is I wished the developers would have put a little more background elements to really bring the world to life. Music and voice acting is also top notch here. You can tell the voice actors really cared about how they sounded. The dialog seems natural as natural can be for robots. The most impressive is the voice of the administrator, also an AI. They did a phenomenal job of how he subtly changes his tone form rigid robotic to a more human tone. Movement is fluid and the game supports a gamepad, however it doesn't seem to state that in game. In fact I started playing initially on keyboard as for some reason my gamepad did not register. Also the settings only showed keyboard, which is kind of odd. At first I was okay playing WASD/mouse but I for some reason every time I right clicked (which is how you target/scan) my avatar would always turn left? Suffice to say, that annoyed the hell out of me. I thought all was lost until I started fidgeting with my controller and it started working on its own, as in the game allowed its input, not that there was something wrong with my controller. Once I changed to gamepad I was able to scan/target without having my toon turn on its own.  Speaking of scanning, I think it’s time I get into what I find to be glaring issues with the game. And those are, scanning for clues and puzzle logic. This game has you spending quite some time searching for clues in the form of nodes. Some clues are objects you can pick up and use as items, like you would in a point in click. Normally I don't have a problem with finding objects and having to use them within some kind of puzzle. However this only works if this puzzle is logical. The problem here is that most of the items you find have no logical explanation. That’s not to say all of them are like this. There are some examples of items that makes sense. For the most part however you end up running around scanning every node and trying everything in your inventory because you have no idea how or where to use the item you have. The other issue are the nodes themselves, if you miss an important story driven node, you're going to find yourself running around for a long time trying to figure out what you missed. This ends up being a situation where you find yourself walking and scanning up and down every few feet in search of that elusive node. I sincerely hope this wasn't intended as a way to inflate game time. As you can tell, this really annoyed me, and it annoyed me more than usual because I really liked the game and I really want to like it. The story is great, the dialog is well written, the action is intense when it needs to be and subdued at just the right time. Despite me running around for some time, the game is short. First time through you'll probably finish it in 5 to 8 hours if you take your time and explore and pause the game from time to time as I tend to do. If you’re like me, you hate finishing good games because you will always feel like it’s a little short and you want some more. I think that's when you know you had some fun. The game ends with to be continued. the question then becomes, do I...want to continue? And my answer is... it depends. In my heart of hearts, I want to say yes but not if the game doesn't evolve. I hated feeling like I was playing a point and click from time to time and I seriously hope the developer figures out a way to construct puzzle/items in a more logical sense. And find a better solution to the whole "node scanning plot device" mechanic. Which coincidently switching between scanning and laser felt kind of awkward... but I digress. Overall and despite my huge gripe with the game, I liked it. The story and immersion was enough for me to overlook the things I hated much about the game.","June 21, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Some puzzles have extra steps for no reason.\n\nFor example (Light spoiler warning, skip this paragraph) you're a war machine, and you have to get a wood cutout across a room, but the track it is on is jammed. My first guess was "tear it off and carry it across", but the answer was "get a power supply to overload a generator so that the track jams, *then* tear it off and carry it across". ??? Okay, how do you silence something, with the hint 'how would a war machine silence something?' If you said "With your gun", you're wrong. You end up destroying it, just in a completely different way.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, like that of Limbo, and the writing, acting and story are good, but this is a puzzle game and the puzzles are by-and-large terrible. More than once you have to aim at the ceiling with no visual cue* and shoot something. More than once you have to use something that is described as 'broken' or 'not fuctioning', so basically you have to "Use" everything so you don't miss anything. Pixel hunting (that only show up with your flashlight, not 'aiming' or just walking).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/b3ryl/recommended/290770/","b3ryl","B3RyL","http://steamcommunity.com/id/b3ryl/","240 products in account","I kida stalled with playing this game because I was afraid it wouldn't meet my expectations. I love those indie sci-fi puzzle platformers because, if the creators are sensible enough, they are just the right mix of deep, ambitious storytelling and down-to-earth, classic platforming and puzzle-solving. Like Swapper, which is one of my favourite games of all time. Let's just say I love the genre and the potential it carries. But all too often the games just fall flat because they are either too ambitious and story driven which makes for a very confusing afternoon, or too casual and mainstream which makes for a very disappointing afternoon.\n\nThis one is the winner in my book. It's just the perfect love affair between mind-bending storytelling and brain-churning puzzle-platforming. There were a couple of times where I was ready to throw in the towel and cry my way towards the nearest walkthrough, but just at the right moment the puzzle revelaled its secrets and everything was good again. And it felt good too. And the story? Wow. Very well paced and with some unexpected plot twists. Before long you start to think like an autonomous war machine on a mission to save its pilot by all means necessary. Or do you? ;) There are some feels too. Nothing tear-jerking but you do feel like you've witnessed something meaningful.\n\nIf you look for negatives very hard you could probably point to the fact this game was clearly made with consoles in mind and the porting team didn't even bother removing the oh-so-helpful "Use your Right Stick" tutorial messages, let alone redoing the UI so that it is actually semi-usable when playing on a PC. As it is, the interface is probably the biggest facepalm-inducing thing in the game. Other than that, the sound didn't make a big impression on me (then again I was playing on a sub-par headset). The cover system and combat in general felt kinda tired and "trope-y" with all those waist-high walls and "silent takedowns" but it's by far not a major part of the game so I guess it's fine.\n\nIn closing: If you like puzzle-platformers - buy this game; If you like thought-provoking storytelling - buy this game; If you like indie sci-fi games - buy this game. Hell, just buy this game and either way you won't be disappointed, and you might even be happy. Like I am. I'm happy I got to play this game and I'm looking forward to the second installment.","September 8, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkfg/recommended/290770/","rkfg","rkfg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rkfg/","231 products in account","Well, this game has its downsides so I'll start from them. Just so you know what's bad and won't whine at it after the purchase. I played on Debian Linux with XBox 360 controller. The game can be described as a quest/action. You should explore the surroundings, find objects, use them on active places and shoot robots and other creatures from time to time. It may sound boring in this brief description but believe me, it's not at all. So, what are the downsides?\n\n— It's quite short and ends with a cliffhanger. Took me 5 hours to complete, some people may divide the price by hours and make a wry face. Though for me it's perfectly fine because these were not your usual 5 hours. Whatever. Two more episodes are in the works and will be sold separately.\n— Gamepad controls can't be reassigned and were chosen poorly. Switching the flashlight and the gun with right stick press? Oh god why. The X button isn't used at all as well as the left trigger. And you can't switch while the flashlight/gun is holstered. So you have to tilt the RT AND press it. And you have to do it pretty often. Aiming is quite poor, sensitivity can't be adjusted either. After some time you'll get used to it but still.\n— Oh them .exe everywhere. I don't want to believe that future AIs are running Windows as their OS. That's of course a dumb complain since I'm a biased Linux guy, just noticed and facepalm'd a bit. Opinion discarded.\n\nIf that hasn't scared you away, let's get to the good parts.\n\n— First of all, I want to denote the outstanding, no, OUTSTANDING voiceacting. That's literally one of the best acting I heard in games since the Portal series (though in "The Fall" protagonist actually, he-he, has a voice and man what a voice!). In most of AAA titles voices are plain and boring, they're just there and that's all. It was a big surprise to find this genuine play in an indie game. Despite the grim atmosphere, there's a place for sparky jokes and sarcastic acid here and there to lighten it up a bit. All characters are unique and they develop as the time goes. It's impossible not to love them!\n— Quests are logical enough... well, not everywhere. I was really stuck only in one place but it seems to be common. Quests have their piece of humor, too. Often dark as the game itself. I'm very ok with that.\n— Overall atmosphere is perfect. From graphics to the background noises, it's an abandoned and at the same time hostile facility where something very damn bad happened long time ago. It reminds me of "The Swapper" though "The Fall" is not a puzzle and more story-driven. You'll get some clues as the story unveils but a lot of mistery is saved for the future parts.\n— Sci-fi themed. I love sci-fi, space and robots!\n— Has a Linux version. A strong point for me since I'm only buying and playing ported games now. No crashes, no glitches (except the mentioned unconvenient controls but that's a platform agnostic issue). It just works!\n— I noticed some Mass Effect references, though maybe I'm digging too deep. The author mentioned the ME series in the FAQ (probably, that was not just a random title!), the A.R.I.D. voice and character are similar to EDI in some respects and her outfit is very close to quarians' suits. Again, that may be just my projections since I'm an ME-fan.\n— DAT A$$.\n\nAll in all, 9 out of 10. A must play game for sure. Some issues can be fixed in future, some are fundamental and by design. Nevertheless, I seriously consider this game an indie gem you should not pass by.","August 1, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","5"

The shooting is a silly addition, the game reaches ~2 hours of gametime.  This doesn't leave room for improvement in the shooting sequences.  Similarly, there are puzzles... but they end up being pixel hunting maneuvers and later puzzles don't build on earlier puzzle solving strategies (not that there are many anyways).\n\nStory:\nThere is quite a bit of time spent world building, which has zero payoff.  As far as character building goes... the game relies on a fairly well-trodden sci-fi trope and just not explaining what's going on.\n\nThe intention for this was to come out as 3 episodes.  Which I believe would be good... but this purchase only gets you the first one... so if you plan on picking this up, I'd highly recommend waiting until the series is complete.","September 17, 2014","false","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/290770/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","The Fall is a disturbing sidescroller story-driven point-and-click puzzle game.\n\nPhew, that was a mouthful.\n\nYou take on the role of A.R.I.D., an artificial intelligence onboard a high-tech combat suit. The suit crash-landed into an unknown location, rendering the pilot unconscious and likely unstable, activating A.R.I.D. From then on, the player is left on their own to figure it out.\n\nThe world in The Fall is horribly dark. I don't think I've experienced something like it before, which makes this a hard thing to review. Personally, I am easily terrified. Movies that are not intended to be scary end up keeping me up for nights on end, sometimes fueling nightmares, so I always avoid games such as this. I received The Fall through a bundle with other games, and I forgot about it for quite a while. A friend of mine wanted to ask my opinion of the game, but I told him I hadn't even played it yet, so I jumped in without knowing what to expect.\n\nTruth be told, I could only get through the first half of the second section before I had to stop. I seriously could not keep going for fear of what lied ahead. If you are into this kind of thing, you may find The Fall more tame than other games or movies with similar styles.\n\nHowever, The Fall also requires that you be familiar with the mechanics of point-and-click puzzle games, as these mechanics override everything else. You have to have your flashlight on almost constantly. It's not that it's bad, but if you're not a fan of point-and-click, this won't be for you.\n\nThe sound and the graphics absolutely fit the game, and the sound design is partly what made me stop playing because it was so powerful.\n\nIf you like games like LIMBO and The Swapper, if you like dark and disturbing plots, if you like point-and-click puzzle games, this is definitely something to check out!","December 16, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

By the time I had acquired enough currency to help fund the game, to my pleasant surprise I realized I could BUY IT - and better yet, during a steam summer sale. Euh euh euh euh.\n\nThe games a GOOD game, but it's not a great game. The puzzles at first were refreshing as it makes you think differently than how you would have to think for a puzzle game. I was surprised as to the game mechanic that I could use actual deductive reasoning to solve a task instead of just doing what I expected the game to funnel me into doing. I jumped for a ledge, and rather than bouncing off it like in other games, I actually could GRAB IT. Why that's what I would've totally done if I was ARID!\nThis refreshing take eventually fizzled out after about 1-2 hours as the puzzles start to become completely unintuitive. With most of the puzzle space being accessible most of the time, its as if the game takes pleasure in watching you helplessly backtrack through the entire game thinking you 'missed something' that you didn't point your flashlight to. Most of the game will be spent back tracking or flailing a new ability/item you acquired that you thought would come in repetive handiness but are sorely disappointed. Like, WHY AM I CARRYING THIS SEVERED HAND EVERYWHERE IF I DON'T NEED IT? or WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THIS BAG? Why can't I use this bag to collect X like a real person to solve that puzzle?\n\nBugs: Choppy animation on enemies taking cover. Strange ladder bug where I phased through half the map and started interacting with a ladder 2 floors down. (Not a bug, but definitely needs a fixing). Controls for mouse and keyboard are pretty bad. I couldn't change the key binding settings mid-game either, had to quit, edit, then restart. What? I also shouldn't have to tap both the selection key, and then the space bar to see which key actually selects the button. Why can't I just use a mouse like normal folk to select menu options? Shooting should have a cross hair to give a sense of direction of aim. Laser pointing isn't enough.\n\nYes, lots of frustration at some points, but the voice acting is amazing, characters are likeable, atmosphere is spooky and engulfing. I quite enjoyed it and look forward to THE OTHER HALF OF THE GAME. I just wished this was actually a true complete game that isn't just masquerading as a Steam Greenlight title. Almost half your 'parameters' won't actually ever work by the end of the game. Anyways, it's 10 dollary doos. Buy the game, support the team but personally, if I see the control and bug issues continue through to the next game, I'm going to have to black list The Moon Games for a long while.

The shooting and puzzle-solving however are not what makes this game, as good as they are. The motivation for someone to buy this and play it would be story.\n\nI actually got this in a bundle but I had heard of how good its story was long before. A robot trying to protect her pilot is in a strange place and she must go to extreme measures to save his life. Its an interesting premise that leaves you curious and as more of the story unravels, some questions are answered but more take their place. The whole thing is surrounded in mystery yet it never loses you and you always know just enough to understand your current situation but no more than that.\n\nThe atmosphere is truly engrossing with the art and sound all being spot on. You’re left curious, yet always apprehensive as the constant uneasiness and possible threat of danger leaves you effectively creeped out. It’s just fantastically well done.\n\nHowever, many will warn you of two things. Firstly, this game ends on a cliffhanger and so is not a complete story. Secondly, this game is short. The cliffhanger was fantastic and not a bad way to end the game at all. Seriously, if the next game is as good as the first then the answers should be well worth the wait, so the cliffhanger is okay by me.\n\nWhat I wasn’t so alright with was the length. Like everyone else I was warned of how short it was by reviews and it didn’t turn me off in the slightest. I’ve mentioned before that game length often does not bother me as many stories (though not all!) are best told in only a few hours. That being said, I was expecting somewhere around six hours for this game and instead I got half that. It wasn’t that the game felt incomplete due to the length. As I said, it ended very well, but I finished it today. I started it up expecting another, for want of a better word, level or area, but instead I walked a bit, talked a bit and it ended. It just felt like I had played a level of an adventure game instead of an adventure game.\n\nThis all being said my feelings towards the game are almost completely positive. Apart from the length there is very little to criticise and as a result I would definitely recommend to those looking for a unique new story. Looking forward to number 2 and the answers, and possible questions, it will bring with it too.","June 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

What can I say, sleeper hit of the year? It's an indie game full of bright ideas, illogical and logical puzzles, but not illogical in the illogical sense, more that you have to do the reverse, sometimes, of what would protect your combatant in order to save him/her.\n\nThe graphics are not amazing, but they are moody and atmospheric, with a main character that will draw you in what seems to be a conspiracy of sorts. I never expected much from the game, in fact during Alpha testing I found it very difficult to play. They refinded and listened to our calls, and actually changed the gameplay a bit to fit into the general consensus that it works. The puzzles were wonderful fun, some as I say illogical, but worked within the spectrum of the logic of the game.\n\nThe ending was a fantastic twist on what we normally get with games like this, in fact I  would be surprised if we don't see more games liek this. Maybe we won't, but there will be more of The Fall coming in chapters, this was simply the first, The devs say it takes about 3-4 hours to complete. Maybe if you're speedy gonzalez, but it took me nearer 7 hours to complete the game from start to finish. It was a delight to play.\n\nI want more The Fall, and I want it now.

Again, I ran around for a few minutes trying to determine whether this was simply a game mechanic, before looking up a guide and realizing that I again needed another restart.\n\nAfter that point, I effectively had lost trust in the game's puzzles. not knowing whether they were challenging or rendered impossible due to game-breaking bugs. It was only because of the great story that I trudged through the rest of the game with a guide. I'm sure that not everyone will have my specific experience with bugs, but given the threat, I wouldn't recommend this game to others.","February 5","false","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The fact that the action in the "fake branches" isn't automatic actually makes things worse, as they made me feel like an automatron myself (and if that was the objective of the game creators, I didn't like it).\n\nThat said, the story is quite good until the disappointing (and quite forseeable...) finale, the graphic is nice without being incredible but creates a very believable and immersive setting, and the sound does it's job and nothing else (with the notable exception of the voice acting of one of the characters, which is 5 star. You'll see what I mean when you meet him).\n\nSo should I recommend this game? For a budget price (<5E), it's probably worth playing (and I got it in a humble bundle), but as the current 9.99E price goes. Nope.

I'm glad I got this game for a dollar on humble, because it took me all of an hour to complete. Literally thought it was a joke when the credits rolled and that I had just made the wrong dialogue choice. I even played it through a second time to make sure I didn't miss anything or that there were no alternate paths or changes based on dialogue choices.  There are none.  I understand that there is more coming, but at what price? another 10.99? are you joking? this is the length of most demos if not shorter.\n\nIn my opinion, a game should be worth its price in hours. A game that costs $60 would, in a perfect world, offer at least 60 hours of content.  Now I know this doesn't always happen, and sometimes it goes far beyond that goal ie. games like Skyrim, many JRPGs, or titles with multiplayer like Starcraft 2 (which boasts at the least, a 30 hour campaign on top of its online offerings).  BUT one hour, for 12 dollars, that is sparse at best.\n\nWhats really a shame here I feel, is that the game is f&%$ing STELLAR.  The combat is pretty great, but could use a little polish.  The story is astoundingly well written and I couldn't stop playing even though I merely booted it up to try it out.  However there's the problem.  It drew me in so much it was absolutely no problem to finish it in one VERY short session.   this games puzzles took no more than a minute each to solve for me so they didn't extend the length at all,  and even that would have been an illusion of length.  I don't see other people addressing this issue either in their reviews, this includes major publications.\n\nI cannot  recommend this game unless it's price tag is under 2 dollars, and even then, youd be better off to look elsewhere for a budget side scrolling romp. Elliot Quest, Wings of Vi, Dust an Elysian Tale, Hell even something like Starbound.  These games all delivered what I would consider a length worthy of their 15$ and under price tags.\n\nPLEASE next time you want to make a "2 hour game", include some dam hard to find collectibles, and harder puzzles to extend the length and warrant replays.","May 18, 2015","false","3.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

I finally decided to give this game a "no". Here's my explanation why:\n\nI bought this game, knowing it was a short, but nonetheless story-rich experience. While the visuals might give the impression, this is sort of a "Swapper"-clone, its pace is much slower and more emphasis is placed on actual reading and getting to know your surroundings. All in all, it can be described as a 2D point n click adventure with combat elements.\n\nWhile I really enjoyed the story and the atmosphere of the game, I was horribly overstrained by the gameplay. I know, I do not play many adventure games and never really have, so it should come as no surprise to me that I had some trouble, navigating through the game. However, soon the intense atmosphere was destroyed by the fact, that I was walking through the same corridor the sixth time or so with my flashlight on permanently, just to figure out, where in the surroundings it was, what I had overlooked. This is also a problem, since crucial objects blend perfectly into the background and you have to scan everywhere.\n\nIn the end, I had to look up a few solutions in a guide, since I wanted to finish the game, but gave up on finding a solution myself. Maybe I lack the patience and/or logic for such games, so if you are used to such a gameplay, you might love The Fall. If you are, however, like me, you will probably not enjoy it much and soon end up on a try-everything-in-your-inventory-on-everything-on-the-map-just-to-see-if-it-works-state.","April 30, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Very simple point-and-click mechanics, painfully simple action, way too short. Very linear, no real decisions to be made. Though I was slightly dissappointed I still enjoyed the experience - I was just expecting an actual video game rather than an interactive graphic novel.\n\nOne thing that really bothers me, especially since its such a major part of the game, is the flashlight. The game overall does a very good job with the visuals, sound and music, but ARID's flashlight is just terrible - Donkey Kong Country did such a better job with flashlight effects 20 years ago.\n\nI could see a lot of people getting into this.

I would only recommend this game to someone who has an appreciation for concept, mood, and other art aspects of games.\n\nThe Fall has a great atmosphere. The story and transitions help to draw you into a derelict, distopian world. The voice acting is well done.\n\nGameplay is mediocre. This game would be ok for casual gamers. Controls are moderately clunky (I used an xbox controller). Gameplay involves looking around rooms to find clues and items to interact with. It is not always clear what to do next, or how to solve the puzzle. Some of the steps required to complete puzzles are rather arbitrary. There are also some interspersed combat sequences. These are fun, but 80% of the fights are not challenging at all, thanks to the cloaking device, which allows you to go untargetable.\n\nThe game seriously lacks content. I beat the game in just over 4 hours. (I bet I could do a speedrun in less than half that time.) The Fall should be called "The Fall: Chapter 1". The story, which is so captivating and expertly told, will leave you feeling a bit unsatisfied. Additionally, there is almost no replay-value. The game mechanics give you the illusion of choice and customization with arbitrary dialogue options and "upgrades" that, instead of being used to offer a variety of experiences, only serve to keep the game linear (similar to Tomb Raider 6). So you're basically paying $?.?? for a game you're going to play once for 4 hours. Worth it? You decide. However, what little content they have is decently well done, and supposedly, The Fall 2 is currently under development. If you like a good story and have a little disposable income, go ahead and get it.\n\n49/100\nI would only recommend this game to someone who has an appreciation for concept, mood, and other art aspects of games.\n\n-2015","June 22, 2015","false","4.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game type is basically a mixture of platformer and action adventure. You take control of the artificial intelligence of a mark-7 A.R.I.D. (armoured robotic interface device), i.e. a combat suite that supports the pilot inside. After crashing into a planet the pilot of your A.I. does not respond and internal sensors fail to report life signs. So you set out and hurry to find a medical facility to prevent the possibly imminent death of the pilot in accordance with your three prime directives - variants of Asimov's laws.\n\n+ Okay graphics and effects\n+ Well-set atmosphere\n+ Good voice-acting\n+ Mostly good controls (with game controller)\n0 Items are sometimes available on a need-to-use basis\n0 Only auto-save\n- Not completely voiced\n- Unreliable jumping and taking cover\n- Inconsistent use of roll-over in menus and no auto-move\n- Wonky mouse controls\n- Two bugged Steam achievements\n- Some graphical glitches and bugs\n- Continuity error\n\nHint: It seemed to me like riding elevators usually saved progress.\nHint: Be merciful. The Merciful achievement may be bugged, see spoiler for decision-based achievement below.\n\nThe game has okay graphics and succeeds in producing a dramatic atmosphere, although the game wants to be really dark. The voice-acting is very well done with nice protocol-like vernacular, think Seven of Nine. Unfortunately not everything is voiced.\n\nThe controls work pretty well when using a game controller. When using the mouse I simply cannot get a good feel for how aiming is supposed to work and aiming is an integral part of the controls, not only for fighting but also for exploring your environment. I discourage the use of keyboard and mouse.\nI'm in two minds about separating fighting and exploration mode.\nHint: Exploration sometimes works on a need-to-use basis, i.e. some interaction points appear or are usable only after you learned something beforehand. (That reminds me, there is a networking wire ARID cannot network with - must be some proprietary standard.)\nJumping and taking cover feel unreliable at times but are good enough for their respective percentages of gameplay. Unfortunately, jumping is required for one fight, i.e. when fighting the Caretaker at the end of the game and it's bad and glitchy but that fight is easy enough on the whole.\n\nFor some reason menu controls are inconsistent. There are menus that have and menus that have not\n* roll-over, i.e. go from top item to bottom item or vice-versa,\n* positional memory, i.e. coming back from a sub-menu the cursor is set to that sub-menu's selector.\nAdditionally holding a directional button doesn't auto-move through the menu items, instead you have to press directions multiple times, e.g. move the left directional stick on the controller to its centre position, then down and repeat.\n\nOne of the Steam achievement is almost impossible to guess and the player could make use of manual saving and loading here but there is only auto-save. Military Machine requires you to dispose of a specific set of enemies, i.e. those directly following the first electrified robot, in very fast succession - hard to guess requirements. The flavour text made me think maybe I had to dispose of a number of enemies without getting hurt or something and there is no indication that you missed the achievement other than the end of the game. I referred to the guide by TheFourteen.\nAnother achievements was bugged for me. You're supposed to get Diag-Gnostic after collecting all Logs. I got the right "aquarium log" before the left one and with only the left one remaining uncollected. I was immediately awarded the achievement.\nAnother, decision-based, achievement is rumoured to be buggy. Face-Off and Merciful are awarded depending on whether you depurpose the Caretaker. Apparently, getting Face-Off first may bug Merciful so you cannot get it later on.\n\nThere are some minor problems bugging me. At some point ARID\n* hovered some way above the floor,\n* spasmed out when being shot at, contorting in painful ways,\n* had her(?) arms stretched out in front but no gun showing.\n* was stuck in-place and in a walk-cycle after the Mainframe A.I. fries a droid to free its bay and I interacted with the bay. Actually all buttons were disregarded and I couldn't get to the game menu, so I had to kill the game.\nI encountered a bug with the lab tag. After getting it on the Civic level I was killed by one of the last two enemies on the way to the tag reader. After reloading ARID doesn't have the lab tag but it's also not where you get it in the first place.\nThere is a continuity error where you make a lamp dangle in the Grocery Store but later from Observation the lamp is back in it's original position. Also you cannot jump down to the store from there. Makes me think, those are actually two separate representations of the rooms.\n\nAnyway, I really liked the atmosphere and A.I.-themed setting and thus enjoyed the game very much. The feature I was missing most was manual saving and loading.\n\nI recommend The Fall and I'm looking forward to the next episode.","April 17, 2015","true","14.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The puzzles are less about creative thinking and problem solving and more about random or mindless actions as the game progresses. The combat is so bland it could have been left out of the game, entirely.\n\nThe story is about robots talking to other robots like robots. At the end, a robot figures out it's a robot.

It's mostly a point-and-click adventure of finding the right items to use, as well as thinking of inventive ways of using the environment around you; interspersed with 1D combat (in the sense that verticality is not used) that doesn't really do a lot for the gameplay except break up the action.\n\nThe exploration and puzzle-solving breaks down a bit at times (which can translate to: I used a guide) due to the need to, say, closely analyze and then shoot a tiny bit of the dark unseemly corner of a room to find a key item to progress; or, the presence of a Network interaction that is almost never used, and is then critical when it finally is used.\n\nBUT, there's some redeeming qualities. When the adventure/item-using stuff works, it works well. Some of the "merit badge" sequence of the game involves some really funny solutions to problems; and for the most part, the game's problem solutions make sense.\n\nAnd as others have mentioned, the dialogue and writing in the game is really well-done.

Over time even Arid comes to change a bit; there's a chilling point late in the game where an early line, her opening greeting, ("I am the A.R.I.D. on-board a Mark-7 Combat Suit.

Tons of reviews said how awesome the story and overall game was so I was trusting of that.\n\nUp-front summary: If I would have paid more than $2 for this then I would have been quite disappointed.\n\nPro's:\n-Dark environment was kinda cool and different.\n-Mystery and story AT FIRST kept me intrigued.\n-Compassion of ARID made you begin to like her character.\n-Hiding behind cover was cool for gun fights but became ultimately useless very quickly when you get to cloak yourself anywhere at any time.\n\nCons:\n-Super annoying control interface for interacting with things. Maybe on a game pad this would be slightly better? I was on keyboard and mouse.\n-The lame tests you had to get past just to get to the "meat" of the story were dumb. Most were very straight forward, and a couple were so freaking weird or abstract it didn't make any logical sense at all. But you only have a few items in your inventory so you tend to just click on each option for anything that you can interact with.\n-Boss was super easy and straight forward to figure out. Anyone who has played a few games can get it in their first pass.\n-Messages on the walls and such were overall completely pointless and didnt do much for the story in my opinion. A couple gave some obvious hints, so once again... useless.\n-No real need to play through more than once. I am uninstalling as soon as I finish this.\n\n\nConclusion: There are tons of other games better spent "wasting" time on that would be MORE entertaining and would have a better story with better gameplay.\nI really wouldn't bother with this one.

And, if you can get it on sale, it might be worth it. It has a good atmosphere, the voice acting is great, and the idea of the game is fantastic.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is derivative and not particularly great: it uses a cover system for fighting (poorly, in my opinion, since getting into cover doesn't always work well, and you have optic camo, so cover is pointless), the puzzles are interesting but nothing more than "use item A on location B after activating flag C", and much of the time puzzle solving is spent trying to figure out which puzzle you're allowed to solve now.\n\nThe story, often said to be it's strongest point, is interesting, but not particularly original or groudbreaking. It's a better (completely linear) story than most video games, but so are most books, movies, and television shows, and a great number can be gotten at a much better value than The Fall. It does have some very clever moments, but it ends with the traditional twist, shock!, instant ending, cliffhanger, "to be continued..." that plague so many other "story-driven" video games, whether indie or AAA.\n\nWas it worth it? I got it on sale, so I'm not particularly upset. Will I buy the sequel? Probably, but mostly because I saw real potential in the developer; this game, on it's own, isn't really worth it to me. But, I do believe, if he can make a really good story (not a good setting or good characters, but a good story), it would be worth my time. The Fall, though? Go play The Swapper instead; it does almost everything this one does, but much, much better.","June 24, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Most of the gameplay revolves around trying to find a single item somewhere on the floor, and then combining it with another item halfway across the map. The combat is no better; once you figure out where to angle your gun, then it becomes ridiculously easy.\nThe story itself, though, is well done. It explores the behaviour of robots relative to their programming, the nature of rules, and has a few good twists along the way.\nGraphics are decent enough. Moving on.\nAudio? The voice acting is very good. The music however, is easy to forget. The ambient sounds are nicely done though.\n\nAll in all, would be better as a short film.","June 24, 2015","false","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The storytelling, voice acting and atmosphere is phenomenal. The controls are responsive and fairly intuitive (it actually reminded me of the SNES Blackthorne game...? Very odd, but very fun. ^_^).\n\nMany of the puzzles were fun and common sensical. However, as seems typical of many P&C Adventure Games, some of the puzzles were rather unintuitive, relying more on finding the hidden 'easter egg' that will give you the item/interaction you need to hammer through. I had to use an online guide only twice. Which, I guess isn't bad...?\n\nMy only major complaint is the length of the game and the cliffhanger they leave you on! OMG WHY!?!  >_< However, I'm willing to overlook it's shortness because it's a crowdsourced indie game and they've promised 2 more episodes.\n\nIt bears repeating: the story is SO worthwhile and thought provoking. It is SO well told through voice over and short cutscenes. And the setting is SO intriguing because of the unique art, great sound and balanced gameplay.\n\nSO... give it a try!","November 19, 2014","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The voice-acting for the main characters is well done and helps to make the dialog very engaging.\n\nHowever, the game suffers from a lethal combination of unwieldy controls and a very disjointed telling of the story.  Many of the tasks and intermediate goals (including the combat) are not only difficult to complete due to arbitrary object/action associations, but also seem completely unrelated to the main objective.  This makes the game disjointed due to seemingly random tangents and it quickly starts to feel more like work than something intended to entertain.\n\nAlthough the heart of a good story exists somewhere in here, I honestly cannot recommend this game (even on sale) since the frustration and boredom greatly outweigh the fun.","December 17, 2014","false","6.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Although the atmosphere felt unique and the story was interesting, I couldn't get into this game. The game reminded me a lot of old school point and click adventure titles. Although a lot of people enjoy those types of games, I never got into them being that I wasn't a PC gamer back in the games of DOS and other early OS's. From my perspective, it's an annoying hassle to have to check every thing out, go back, check everything out again, etc. However, if you were a fan of Space Quest and games like it, this game would most likely be up your alley.\n\nMy biggest problem with the game probably stems from the control scheme. I find movement and adventuring tedious while using the mouse and keyboard. However, when inserting a controller like an XBox 360 one, shooting and combat become annoying. This all adds up when you can't use both control schemes at the same time.\n\nMy review of this game boils down to the fact that it isn't my type of game and the control scheme is horid. If you like old school adventure titles, this game could easily be something you enjoy if you get past the controls.","June 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reveng/recommended/290770/","reveng","RevEng","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reveng/","285 products in account","I first tried playing this game two months ago. After a terrible experience, I gave up. I just recently tried it again and completed it, and though I have several issues with it, there is something in it worth liking.\n\n\n*Spoiler alert: the following discussion contains spoilers*\n\n\nOn my first experience with this game, my only thought was: this game is completely broken.\n\nFirst I couldn't adjust the brightness in the main menu; I could hear it making sounds when I pressed up and down, but nothing happened. I continued into the game, but couldn't move. It mentioned using the Right Stick and I thought, "Oh, I need a gamepad to play?"\n\nI started over with a gamepad and things worked. Lucky I had one; they didn't say I needed one. With gamepad in hand, I could barely point my flashlight. Between up and right, there were maybe 5 degrees of angle that map to something in between, so pointing anywhere other than the four cardinal directions was finicky and frustrating, and yet it's something I had to do constantly. At least I could move on.\n\n30 minutes later, I couldn't pass the first level. So far the whole thing was like an old school adventure game, where you have to point at the one pixel that matters and pickup the random object to use on some other arbitrary thing to continue. No choices, no freedom; keep combining everything with everything else until the game accepts something and allows you to continue. Apparently I missed the "metal pan" at first, which wasn't indicated at all in the description of the pile of junk, and even when I "interacted" with it, it didn't even tell me what happened!\n\nThen went into the room with the other suit, I successfully finished it, and it seemed my controls were dead. I restarted the game and it hadn't saved my progress at that point. Seriously? Why didn't it save after I picked up an essential item to continue the story, or for that matter when I completed an important event?\n\nI decided to try the game again a couple of months later. This time my keyboard and mouse did work, even right from the beginning. Apparently this was fixed in a patch, as Cheeseness mentioned in the comments. Unfortunately, the brightness control still didn't operate properly; it made noises when I pressed up and down, but the brightness did not change. Thankfully, I didn't really need to adjust this anyway.\n\nI started again from the beginning. I went back to where the "old metal pan" was. Examining the pile of trash did not say anything; it only showed that it was interactable. I interacted with it and it said nothing. However, if I try to interact with other things, I now have the option to use the pan. I have not seen any description text. Am I missing something? Despite what others have said, I still think there is a bug here, and it was enough to keep me from progressing through the game. In a linear point-and-click adventure, that's a game-breaker.\n\nAiming with the mouse works much better than it did with the controller. It's a shame I have to hold right-click the whole time -- it's a very awkward way to use a mouse -- but at least it's functional.\n\nThis time I did figure out how to get out of the room. This is where controls matter. I didn't see the thing I could interact with because I could barely point with the controller. I had enabled the networking, as Cheeseness suggested, but I had failed to find the interaction point with which I had to network. Trying again with a keyboard and mouse, I didn't have much trouble finding this interaction point and I was able to continue.\n\nAfter getting stuck again while trying to follow the animal to the lower level, I finally decided to look up a walkthrough. Sure enough, I was missing something; there is a delay on the elevator, so you can activate and get off before it starts to move. I'll give the game the benefit of the doubt and say I overlooked this, but that's exactly the sort of non-obvious logic that I dislike about many adventure games.\n\nAfter getting past all of this, the game actually gets considerably better, though still not without its flaws. It's still very much like an old school point-and-click adventure, where you have to collect random items that interact with other random items, with a small amount of action involved. I found both of these elements lacking. I had to make reference to a walkthrough on several occassions, and when I did, I realized that I had either missed something that was difficult to see, or the logic was so obscure that it never would have occurred to me. Granted, I don't particularly enjoy these sort of adventure game puzzles, but I found several of the puzzles obtuse even compared to some infamous examples, like Police Quest and Space Quest.\n\nThe action sequences also felt stinted. They had a good atmosphere and flow, but the combat itself was annoying. The solution to every encounter was to lie in waiting until you determined their pattern, then strike when they were sitting idle. At worst, you'd end up with two enemies at once and the timing would be more finicky. Also, making contact and doing damage was erratic. There was no more clear example of this than the end sequence.\n\nDuring the final fight, I regularly shot through the caretaker without doing damage and he could hit me while I was cloaked, though I couldn't do the same to him. It was also frustrating that he could just get away any time I injured him. Sure, I eventually realized you could prevent him from recharging, but it wasn't obvious, especially since I was too concerned with trying to stay alive -- something I soon came to realize didn't matter, as I don't think it was ever possible to lose.\n\nI was also really disappointed by the ending. While it was an interesting twist, it felt very sudden and jarring, and the "to be continued" ending was really disappointing. I don't remember hearing anything about this being episodic when I backed it on Kickstarter, and now I feel like I only received part of that in which I invested. Will there be another episode? Will I get that too? I don't know. It has left a bitter feeling at the end of an otherwise interesting story.\n\nWhat "The Fall" does have that is enjoyable are some interesting characters and an intricate plot. The theme and atmosphere are prevalent throughout the game. It doesn't always work well (e.g. the all-text interface and the disk clicking sounds don't make much sense combined with a highly-aware, far-futuristic AI), but it works well for the most part. It reminds me a lot of Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas with it's combination of interesting characters, dark atmosphere, and mix of new and low tech.  It had me interested enough to continue on in spite of the bugs and annoying puzzles.\n\nOverall, my opinion is that it has a great story, but it's marred by bugs and the weakness of the puzzle and action aspects. I'm still surprised that the beginning of the game felt so awkward compared to how smoothly the rest of it flows -- especially since that nearly kept me from continuing on to see the rest. It just goes to show that something is only as good as its weakest part, and where this game has a great story and characters, the other elements of the game kept me from fully enjoying that story.\n\nI'm still keeping my negative recommendation on this. I don't think most people would enjoy this. If you do, great, and I hope Over The Moon does more work in the future and improves on what they started here. But I'm not one of the 80% on Metacritic that thought this was a great game. There are too many flaws interfering with an otherwise interesting concept and well-developed story.","May 30, 2014","false","4.8"," 9 of 27 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","9","27","0","5"

Some of the issues I had at first have been fixed like the micro wrench not working but still has no context indicator for the mind hack on the crane when you first meet the other robot.\n\nOn to a review of the game itself and why I still cannot recommend it.\n1.	Combat is boring, AI is simplistic and repetitive only doing the same thing ever time causing me to only take damage when I’m bored and want to move on taking dumb risks.\n2.	This game is a point-and-click game. Puzzles are the main bulk of the gameplay however the puzzles are awful, make no sense, and are far too difficult.\n\nA couple of examples are you quickly find a way into an area where you have to do tests that are designed for a domestic robot not a combat suit like you.  Kind of funny at first but then you start in the area.  One of the tasks you have to complete is dusting in an area beyond filthy. The solution you just have to find the bag and place it over the sensor.  While this would work the bag is hidden by the door you never see the actual bag while walking about so never would I ever think that would be a solution I found by doing what I do in other point-and-clicks which is to just find everything and try ever option not even caring about the story or events.\n\nThe point in which I gave up at this point was trying to deal with the baby.  This task is far too difficult as I have done everything even following the tips from the developer themselves on the community page and still haven’t been able to find the solution.  While some games are challenging and regarded highly it is because they are also satisfying.  This game is way too difficult in the obtuse and random solutions to the puzzles and is not satisfying when all I have to look forward to is another ridicules series of task which cause me to loss all interest that the story at first had created for me.\n\nI have heard that the game is also short and supposed to be episodic about that I don’t know as I give up on even finishing this game which is a genuine waste of potential of the initial story I have seen with badly designed puzzles that even with developers tips can’t help with.\n","June 1, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"

The sound and visuals are modest, as expected from an indie offering, but they unobtrusevely contribute to the game's eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere. It is a small game that tells a big, ambitious story and it does so incredibly well. I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil the experience. But suffice to say, the treatment of AI as a subject here could rival Asimov's.\n\nThat said, it isn't perfect. The controls are pretty cumbersome-- you spend 90% of the time holding down the right mouse button so that you can look at/interact with/shoot at your surroundings. Turning the character around demands a sort of randomly jiggling the mouse in the intended direction. You have to be positioned just right to take cover during combat, so I died more than I felt I deserved.

Instead, I'll talk about the rest of it so far as January 2015.\n\nThis game is thankfully uncomplicated in its control scheme and gameplay mechanics, and the atmosphere of it is seriously tense and dramatic - perfect for dystopia effectionadoes.  The game is quite reliant on problem solving, and many of the methods for dealing with situations have results that seem a little unorthodox - which, while fitting the theme and story very well, can leave one rather frustrated.\n\nHowever, for those of us who don't want to miss out on the rest of the story because of one little puzzle, there's thankfully a number of walkthroughs out there that can help you.  Alternatively, since there isn't much that directly hinges on doing things in a set order (that I know of anyway), the tactic of brute-force use-everything-with-everything and do-everything-again-just-to-see-what-happens thing can work.\n\nThe combat system is fairly decent too, and while currently lacking in variety, due to the relatively low health and shields of your character it can be rather intense.  Also, quite fortunately, there are frequent saving points before combat situations so that if you die, you won't be too far behind.\n\nAll in all, I like this game and I recommend it to anybody who's got a bit of time up their sleeves and an itching for a gritty and dark puzzle game.","January 6, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabelhigh/recommended/290770/","cabelhigh","Cabelhigh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cabelhigh/","138 products in account","I bought this game after listening to Giant Bomb's Game of the Year podcasts, where they named it Best Story and soundly spoiled a twist or two, so I went in with expectations. And, to be honest, neither the storytelling nor the story lived up to their high praise.\n\nIt starts off really, really good. The first 30 minutes *is* outstanding: mysterious, menacing, brilliantly told and stunningly visualized. If there's one thing this game nails it's robots talking to other robots, and it offers perhaps the best representation of robot 'culture' (if there is such a thing) in sci-fi that I've seen. The world is weird, the characters are weirder, and the atmosphere is thick throughout.\n\nBut then you run into the puzzles. I'm not an adventure gaming veteran or anything like that - I've played a few in my time - but the puzzles in The Fall are *so* obscure, *so* out-of-left-field and backtrack-y that it immediatly halts any momentum or goodwill the game conjures up in the first 30 minutes, deciding instead to take a hour long detour into pure puzzle-solving that feels like fluff to a game that's already achingly short (my steam time is 2 hours). Here, the story not so much evolves as mutates, getting sidetracked from the initial danger and wonder of that first half-hour. It continues to explore some interesting philosophical approaches to robots (though not particularly unheard of ones), but starts loosing its footing quickly.\n\nThe ending is a little stronger, buoyed by more directive and a brutal ending, but too many of the motivations behind characters are left unclear and combat - while unobtrusive but never exceptional in the earlier parts of the game - starts to become an annoying crutch. Since you are so fragile and your combat options are so limited, throwing more enemies than you can handle coupled with bad controls was incredibly frustrating in the final 20-stretch. By the time the game reached its climactic confrontation, I just wanted it to be done.\n\nLuckily, about five minutes later it was. Both a blessing and a curse, The Fall's 2 hour run-time gives it a pleasant short-stort feel while still leaving questions open for the next two chapters. However, it's too short to give one character in particular much interesting motivation, which isn't great because there are only three in the entire game. The story itself is...unexceptional, though, for the most part, well told. The main character, A.R.I.D., and a friendly (or is it?) computer AI she meets along the way are both well voiced and written, and the world they inhabit is always fun to explore, if not being the most fleshed-out. Some character beats, however, fall totally flat - mainly one weird 'morality' choice near the end comes out of nowhere and means next-to-nothing.\n\nDid listening to the Game of the Year stuff bias me against this game? Maybe. Probably. But in a year where we had good, emotional storytelling it The Wolf Among Us and This War of Mine, The Fall barely holds a candle to the rest. It didn't hit me as particularly better than other indie-sci-fi games (if you want a great one, go buy The Swapper). Overall, it just didn't feel that special. It never could live up to those first 30 minutes.\n\n\n","January 6, 2015","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nothing special, unfortunately. The controls are really awkward, and you have to backtrack a lot, even if you are following a walkthrough. It is pretty frustrating that a lot of the interactive items are not visible unless you shine your light directly on them, which means you spend a lot of time scanning rooms randomly. And then as soon as a scripted event happens, your light disappears, so you need to re-arm again to react. I guess a sequel might be worthwhile if the controls and interaction were improved because the story was okay, but I wouldn't recommend this one unless you are really starved for some sci-fi.","February 1, 2015","false","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sound and visuals are modest, as expected from an indie offering, but they unobtrusevely contribute to the game's eerie, claustrophobic atmosphere. It is a small game that tells a big, ambitious story and it does so incredibly well. I won't say anymore because I don't want to spoil the experience. But suffice to say, the treatment of AI as a subject here could rival Asimov's.\n\nThat said, it isn't perfect. The controls are pretty cumbersome-- you spend 90% of the time holding down the right mouse button so that you can look at/interact with/shoot at your surroundings. Turning the character around demands a sort of randomly jiggling the mouse in the intended direction. You have to be positioned just right to take cover during combat, so I died more than I felt I deserved.

You want me to tell you why?\n\nOh, alright then. Here we go.\n\nPROS:\n\nJust about every puzzle was sensible, but far from brainless. Granted, I don't play a lot of adventure games, so I might not be the greatest judge of difficulty.\n\nThe atmosphere was tense and dark, but it wasn't really a "scary" game. I'm someone who still has trouble playing Luigi's Mansion, so this was a huge plus.\n\nIt's story is definitely a high point. It touches on AI ethics, the three rules of robotics, and free will. If you're a fan of Isaac Asimov's short stories, or Science Fiction in general, you'll almost definitely enjoy it. (Side note, if you enjoy this game and haven't read any of Asimov's short stories, definitely check them out.)\n\nOh, and the writing and voice acting are pretty great. And the story has great pacing. Seriously, the story's good.\n\nCONS:\n\nIt's kinda short. It took me 3 hours to play through it, and I might go back and play it again to clear the rest of the achievements. The game never drags, though, so it was three really good hours of gameplay.\n\nAnd, honestly, that's about it.\n\nThis is the first game in a trilogy, so there are two more to look forward to. It's definitely worth getting, even at its normal price.","January 17, 2015","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a exception to smaller side elements such as game weight on disk, graphics, gameplay style, and sound. Now normally I do not like horror games as they spend to much time playing up the horror and gore element of things like jumpscares and vicera. I feel this game was truly an exception for the following reasons.\n\n1. It was a 2D sidescroller with horror elements and very well done sound effects  to keep me on the edge of my seat. In this game the developers were able to get the key aspect of horror that most developers dont and that is subtlety. While there was a constant theme of death and dispair (which comes with about 90% of game titles these days anyway) the key timing of certan audio ques was astounding.\n\n2. The game was small on disk but that did not compromise the depth of story telling that was done here. This was reenforced with a small realistic set of charecters for the genre. Which I feel is not something that most games anymore can pull off well especially triple A titles.\n\n3. The voice acting was very good for the charecters protrayed and the choise of dialouge was strong enough to provide the growth that was needed over the length of the story in these charecters.\n\nAll in all 10/10 I would most definitely play this game again and I look forward to purchasing and seeing what direction the developers will take this story in when part 2 when it is released.","January 17, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story leaves a bit to be desired at the end, but was overall very interesting, and I was not bored by it.\n\n~The atmosphere is fantastic. If you take the time to appreciate it, it's chilling and compliments the narrative very well. Hands down, one of the best atmospheres I have experienced since Dead Space, or Metro.\n\nAnd now for the cons.\n~The price. I bought this for $4.99 while it was on sale, and couldn't imagine paying $9.99 for a game this short.\n\n~The length. Steam says I have just over four hours in this game, which included me sitting at the pause menu while I waited for my pizza to cook. (This goes hand-in-hand with the price.)\n\n~Replay value. I don't think I will play this again. There is no branching narrative, there is no alternate ending, there is nothing else to do after you beat the game once unless you care about Steam achievements (I don't.)\n\n~Controls. I played this with a controller because it seemed the logical way to go from reading the other reviews, and even still the aiming was awful, and the interactions with things was tedious. You have to take out your flashlight every time you wish to interact with something, even if it's right in front of you. Perhaps it was just my thumbsticks, or the sensitivity, but I was personally not a fan of the controls.\n\n~Combat. Maybe it was just me, but the combat was really stale. You can basically stand there and cloak until they stop shooting, hit them three times, and then rinse and repeat. The poor aiming controls do not help this.\n\nTL;DR:\nThe Fall is a story and atmospherically rich game that unfortunately didn't focus on the controls and gameplay elements enough to justify spending $10. (I picked it up for $5 and I'm still a bit disappointed.)\n\n6/10 (I really do want to give this a higher score)\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI really want to recommend this game because of the story but, to me, it doesn't outweigh everything else.\n***\nI'm also hearing talk of this being the first episode of this series, and if that is the case (and the games are similar), I think it's a grab at money and they could've waited on this release and made it longer.","July 29, 2014","false","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Fall is part one of a trilogy, that shows real promise. Admittedly it's short, only clocking between three to five hours in length, although given that it is priced at $10, it is still worth considering given the quality of the game.\n\nThe game has a very dark and grim atmosphere, with complementing artwork. The Fall has very interesting and dark story elements that are consistently immesive throughout the whole time you're playing it. You're consistently discovering creepy story hooks, constant questions that deal with dealing with reconciliation over conflicting operating perameters, or even identifying what taking life is. Ever wondered if artificial intelligence could lose it's sanity? Throughout the game, you are out solving reasonably complex, yet logical puzzles that have a clever, and dark humour. Some of them are actually quite hillarious, in a ♥♥♥♥ed up kind of way. It is worth mentioning, that some of the puzzles can be somewhat vague and assuming that the logical answer is there, while you are solving unrelated puzzles unintentionally, others can annoyingly still ellude you with almost no explanation.\n\nOverall the game is very good. A critisism I have for it however, is that the controls are a little weird, and awkward - particularly while using a mouse and keyboard. The controller works a little better, that being said, regardless of what you use, the gameplay is very good.  It certainly could use a bit of a polish in functionality and smoothness, but other than that it's a solid start to an impressive story, which is the part that really sells this game. The writing for this was amazing, and is well worth your time.","October 13, 2014","true","48.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles are generally pretty simple (I would compare them to Limbo or TellTale's games more than anything Sierra or LicasArts) but they are well integrated, pulling the player into the game and moving the plot forward.  The graphics are done well, with an imposing post-apocalyptic style reminiscent of some notable games of the 1990's like Fade to Black and Blackthorne at times, perhaps even a bit of Fallout.  The dialogue is voiced by live actors who are certainly up to the task, bringing appropriate and interesting personality to their characters.  There is a lot of dark and dry humor humor present such as the repeating theme of the AI placing itself in situations that require the use of features of the suit that it normally can't access,\n\nThe interface can be a bit quirky at times.  I played with an xbox 360 controller, and I think a mouse and keyboard might be more suitable for the game's interface style.  I never had any showstopping problems but some of the requrired button press sequences grew tedious.  The suit upgrades beg for comparison to Metroid-style games.  I don't think it's warranted, however, since a major hallmark of that style is progression through backtracking.  In The Fall, there isn't a whole lot of revisitting previous areas.  There is a little back-and-forth within major sections of the game, but once each act of the story is done, its section is history.  This manages to keep the game focused on its story, and although it is an excellent story (seriously, someone with contacts in the industry, pitch the idea to Nolan or Spielberg or the like.  It could be amazing), its runtime is a bit short for a game.   I clocked in at about 3 1/2 hours beginning to end, according to steam, and I admittedly got a little stumped once or twice.  For what it's worth, though, I enjoyed every minute and would not hesitate to buy it again.\n\nBottom line is, if you're feeling nostalgiac for a '90's style game but want new subject matter or if you like an intriguing story and genuine science fiction, it's worth spending an afternoon with.  And if you, like me, love point and click adventures, it's a must-buy.","November 15, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It provides an excellent and interesting look at the familiar science fiction questions. Such as "What does it mean to be self-aware?"  and "What is the difference between and A.I and a human?". The gameplay although is simple and consists of puzzles and gunfights. The puzzles involves finding items and correctily determining when and how to use them with little hints and advice beyond the logic of the situation. The gunfights involves simple duck and pop out to shoot mechanics. The story however is the heart of this game. Throughout it the characters and the well voiced dialogue pulls you along and never lets up. You hear and feel the growing personal awarness of the main character (an AI). I finished the game in one sit down but it was a memorable 3 hours.

DEVELOPERS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE FINAL TWO PARTS ARE ABOUT A YEAR IN THE FUTURE.\n\nStill probably one of the better point-and-click style adventure games I've played in recent years. I picked it up for five bucks and got my money's worth. However, ten bucks is too much for what is, in the end, an incomplete experience.\n\nControl scheme is interesting but unusual, takes a bit of getting used to. Story and voice acting is excellent. Puzzles are generally logical but requires some pixel searching. Only got stuck on one puzzle requiring the use of a wiki (that stupid crying baby). There are a few moments of "Adventure Game Logic" though.\n\nThe general conceit is that the player takes the role of an Artificial Intelligence. As such, your actions are constrained to your directives. For instance, the player is not allowed to lie in order to solve what should be a trivial puzzle. This does mean that the moments of "railroading" in the story tend to make sense: they are the only action that the player can take given the directives they have.\n\nAbout the only thing that I seriously disliked was the combat. The control scheme is NOT conducive to side-scrolling mouse-and-keyboard gunplay. Given that an early upgrade allows for the player to evade gunfire simply by tapping a button, combat pretty much turns into a tedious stop-and-pop point and click affair.

It’s interesting to be required to explore rather than being rewarded for it, a trope few games have invoked in the past. My experience was marred by my logic being out of sync with the developers however, something which is hard to blame the game for but doesn’t change the fact that I felt the good parts of the game were hidden behind too much cruft.

The dialogue is amazing, there is branching dialogue that adds to replayability and the story is awesome.\n\nThe cons is that some of the puzzles for the game were not too straight forward. And by that I mean: The mechanics of the game are like any other point and click adventure. You interact with things and put things on other things and boom, stuff happens. But! Unlike other point and click adventures, it can sometimes be difficult to know -what- you want to interact with because they are "hidden." Which is to say that you don't see interactable objects as a big obvious glowing circle or some kind of highly noticable feedback.\n\nYou have to do some searching and exploring to find everything that you need to touch or find because the icon for these things is invisible unless looking directly at them with your flashlight. Some of the puzzles via this mechanic were down right hard to figure out. Some I stumbled into via the age old "combine everything with everything!" approach. But some were really well hidden and had me stumped for a while. After the first hour I had a better feel for the game's approach and could figure out puzzles better. But in all honesty, I think the first hour for me was just getting passed the cave (First level).\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game.

Any time a game asks me to press and analogue stick regularly, it becomes a pain, literal hand crap after a few hours.

The Fall is part one of a trilogy, that shows real promise. Admittedly it's short, only clocking between three to five hours in length, although given that it is priced at $10, it is still worth considering given the quality of the game.\n\nThe game has a very dark and grim atmosphere, with complementing artwork. The Fall has very interesting and dark story elements that are consistently immesive throughout the whole time you're playing it. You're consistently discovering creepy story hooks, constant questions that deal with dealing with reconciliation over conflicting operating perameters, or even identifying what taking life is. Ever wondered if artificial intelligence could lose it's sanity? Throughout the game, you are out solving reasonably complex, yet logical puzzles that have a clever, and dark humour. Some of them are actually quite hillarious, in a ♥♥♥♥ed up kind of way. It is worth mentioning, that some of the puzzles can be somewhat vague and assuming that the logical answer is there, while you are solving unrelated puzzles unintentionally, others can annoyingly still ellude you with almost no explanation.\n\nOverall the game is very good. A critisism I have for it however, is that the controls are a little weird, and awkward - particularly while using a mouse and keyboard. The controller works a little better, that being said, regardless of what you use, the gameplay is very good.  It certainly could use a bit of a polish in functionality and smoothness, but other than that it's a solid start to an impressive story, which is the part that really sells this game.

Picked it up on sale, would have paid full price for it.\n\nThe Fall is an elaborate puzzle game in a unique setting with a fantastic story. You play an AI, and although at the start of the game you know nothing of the person you're trying to save, you (the player) still feel a compulsion to do whatever is necessary to save him. Although you spend the whole game as a robot talking to other robots the characters are still fantastic, mostly due to great writing and voice acting. The setting is probably the best part of the game, since it tells a colorful story without ever coming out and saying "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED." Over The Moon's storytelling is masterful, and in a time when story is often told to take a backseat to allow for generic gameplay (I'm looking at you, CoD) it is refreshing to see such creativity.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and can be frustrating, but are very satisfying when you're able to finally figure them out. The graphics aren't state of the art but the dark setting is beautiful in its own way. The combat leaves much to be desired due to clunky controls and an awkard cover system but the combat isn't the focus of the game anyway.\n\nEagerly looking forward to parts 2 and 3.","November 30, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ambiance and story were very inventive, and the voice acting in general was surprisingly good. It works better as a story than as a game. The game is a little bit buggy for me, sometimes my guy would get stuck and I had to restart the game. Since this is an indy game this is not a huge surprise. The story is a very dark sci-fi tale in a kind of post-apocalyptic setting. The action and platforming elements were not great, the controls were just not tight enough for a good action game experience. For sci-fi adventure game fans, this game is worth a look. If you are expecting a good 2-d action game, best to move on to The Swapper, or Braid, or Fly'n, or Trine, or even Bastion.","August 16, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Picked it up on sale, would have paid full price for it.\n\nThe Fall is an elaborate puzzle game in a unique setting with a fantastic story. You play an AI, and although at the start of the game you know nothing of the person you're trying to save, you (the player) still feel a compulsion to do whatever is necessary to save him. Although you spend the whole game as a robot talking to other robots the characters are still fantastic, mostly due to great writing and voice acting. The setting is probably the best part of the game, since it tells a colorful story without ever coming out and saying "THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED." Over The Moon's storytelling is masterful, and in a time when story is often told to take a backseat to allow for generic gameplay (I'm looking at you, CoD) it is refreshing to see such creativity.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging and can be frustrating, but are very satisfying when you're able to finally figure them out. The graphics aren't state of the art but the dark setting is beautiful in its own way. The combat leaves much to be desired due to clunky controls and an awkard cover system but the combat isn't the focus of the game anyway.\n\nEagerly looking forward to parts 2 and 3.","November 30, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As many have said before me, the story, voice acting, and visuals are fantastic. I won't go in to the story too much (since plenty of reviewers have already explained it better than I could), but I will say that the game made me think quite a few times. One particular event made me start questioning what it means to be human, but I might've been overthinking it a little. The controls aren't too bad once you get used to them, but a few of the puzzles are so "how-was-I-supposed-to-figure-that-out" levels of obscure that I found myself enjoying the game a lot more with a walkthrough at my side. It is a bit short (only took me 3.2 hours,) so you might want to wait for a good sale before picking it up.\n\nAll in all, you mostly come to this game for the story, not the gameplay, and while the story is amazing, it is still unfinished, with the game ending on a big, fat, "To Be Continued" screen, which saddened me deeply. I'll definitely buy the next part, but if it's as short as this one, I'll probably just hold out for a sale.\n\nOh, and don't be suprised if you develop deep emotions for the AIs you meet.

Despite a few minor gripes with some of the puzzle mechanics, everything about the game was solid. I'll break it down here:\n\n- Graphics and art looked extremely polished and well designed. I really liked the 3d graphics with 2d platforming, which can be tricky to get right. The dark lighting really added to the atmosphere, but the silhouetting made sure you know where your character is at all times. The textures and models beneath the lighting looked really nice too; when you fire A.R.I.D's gun, it illuminates the whole area for a split second, allowing you to glimpse the hard work that's gone into the it all. The animations were solid and convincingly robotic, and the backgrounds were just awesome.\n- Sound design and music were also totally solid and really fit into the atmosphere of the game, adding an eerie and arid (heh) ambience without drawing too much attention to itself. The voice acting was pretty fantastic too, well recorded, well acted and well edited, it just blends right in.\n- The story was great too, maybe inspired by Isaac Asimov? I won't get too much into it, but if you're into sci-fi, you'll love it. The dialogue was really well written, the story progressed at a steady pace, teaching you more about the characters and the facility. I was hooked. My only criticism is the mainframe A.I. seemed a little too human. He seemed to really care about A.R.I.D. and the other robots (great job on the voice actor's part), but I think he should have been written to seem like he was feigning affection.\n- The gameplay was really unique, I love the twist on the point n' click puzzle solving, and the combat really broke it up and made the whole thing more exciting. The devs' choice to display a list of the suit's extended functions like 'unlockable abilities' that unlock when the suit needs them, but not giving access to all of them (because the suit didn't need them) was very clever indeed and added a lot of realism. Criticisms here would involve some of the puzzles and how their solutions were illogical, a common gripe I have for the genre. Why did I have to find and crush a gold coin to make a wire when there were plenty of other wires I could break? Why couldn't I just smear the fish guts on myself? Some solutions needed a lot of walking back and forth and looking for something that I hadn't found, which was a bit annoying, but other than that, I still loved it.\n\nThanks for an awesome game guys, can't wait for the next one!","December 20, 2014","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Of course, 20 minutes in and I'm defeated by the elevator puzzle.  Games like this are supposed to be intuitive, with some kind of dialogue or hint.  All this game does for that puzzle is go "Hmm, there must be a way down there." like ♥♥♥♥ing duh, that's what I've been trying to do this whole time.  Very irritating.  I shouldn't have to look this ♥♥♥♥ up right at the beginning, and this is coming from a veteran that grew up with Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle, Sam n Max, The Dig, and a plethora of point n click adventure games.\n\nAll it would take for this elevator thing is a little set of lights on the panel that blink red when it's off, 1, 2, 3, in yellow as it's getting ready, and then green when it starts moving, like hey, you can walk off this thing before it goes.  Subtle, without giving it away.  Or, maybe a sign or little robotic voice saying something like, "Lift engaging, please do not exit the lift until it comes to a complete stop."  Stuff like this immediately makes people want to think about doing the opposite, and what would happen, from roller coasters to airplanes, having to do with people's mindsets in wanting to give authority the middle finger, etc.\n\nI'm not the only one, either, and it's such a stupid puzzle once you realize how to get around it, which is why I'm sure the devs don't see how ridiculous it is for a fresh player.  I almost gave this game a thumbs-down, hoping the devs would notice and fix it, but I'm not going to.  Dudes, when making a game that you play and test over and over and over, sure, it gets boring and easy and tedious, but you really have to keep in mind how a fresh player is going to see things.","August 12, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were some bugs that I encountered (which were minimal), and some people will have issue with the controls (although I personally did not). Also, if you haven't heard yet, the game is rather short.\n\nThat being said, this is one of the best indie games I've ever played. The puzzles are challenging which may turn some people off the game, but those people aren't the target audience. If you're a fan of portal, you'll probably enjoy this game. The atmosphere that the game sets is is a perfect middle ground between eerie and disturbing, and in some parts actually had me scared of a jumpscare even though nothing happened. The closest thing I can remember that is similar to the atmosphere of this game is visiting Vault 106 in Fallout 3, where you can see the decay and gore that has spread through a place that was once normal. That place freaked me out too, call me sensitive if you will.\n\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this game.

I am positive that the game designers are also huge fans of that series. The plot hinges on the fact that AIs are bound by three primary functions, which are different depending on the robot's purpose. The scenerio deals with the potential repurcussions of logical paradoxes that arise in an AI when trying to acheive those primary functions.  For instance, it may be necessary to put a human's life in jeopardy for the purpose of trying to save his life.  Or it may be necessary to break one of the functions in order to satisfy another.\n\nRegarding actual gameplay, the game achieves exactly what it intends. The puzzles are intuitive but not obvious. They are also difficult enough that you feel very satisfied once you figure them out.  The action aspects of the game are pretty easy, but it really isn't intended to be an action game. The shooting sequences are really just inserted to bring added drama to the story, and in that they succeed.\n\nSome people have complained about the length of the game. This didn't bother me at all. I for one don't want to be solving puzzles for 15 hours. The game took me 4 hours and I found that to be the perfect time.  Also some people have complained about the ending. These people are stupid. The ending opens up the story in a fantastic way.\n\nBottom line, I loved the story. It was moody and dramatic, with moments of great humor. Even though the story could never happen in Asimov's universe (the laws of robotics would prohibit this entire scenerio), it still honors his contribution to robotics theory and science fiction in general. If you are an Asimov fan you should definitely give this game a try. I can't wait till the 2nd part, which I am sure will deal with the dilemma of an AI achieving free will.\n\n8.5/10","July 31, 2014","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept itself is wonderful (if ultimately a little obvious) and I do hope they finish the series, as the story is pretty interesting. The controls (I played with xbox gamepad) are bad, particularly aiming, and the basic action of the game (interact with something) seems to take twice as many steps as it should. There are a few other things that seem unpolished, like the display of text when you inspect something. On the other hand, the graphic style is hauntingly good, very reminiscent of The Swapper (that game is nearly without flaw so I think you should prioritize it), and the character animations were excellent as well. The voice acting was great, although some conceits meant that the dialog goes pretty slowly, which made me end up skipping some and just reading. Puzzles were good; I finished without any external hints and most of them made sense. The game was more linear and "neat" than I prefer. One downside of this game is that it's essentially a point-and-click adventure game (and a good one), but it has some action sequences that were fairly mediocre and seemingly unnecessary, like they had planned and developed the capability but not really made use of it. I think this might make the game needlessly inaccessible for people who don't really do action.

Great, even.\n\nYou play as the AI of a combat suit.\nYou have crash landed on an abandoned planet. The person inhabiting your suit is not responding and likely gravely wounded.\nYou take control of his body and have to get him some medical attention.\n\nMost games that toy with the idea of player agency and free will in a system where there usually is only one right path do it in the form of a plot twist. Would you kindly! Everything you've done has been controlled by an outside force!\nIn this game, though, the fact that you have no free will is stated upfront. You are a computer program guided by three principles: Protect your pilot, follow orders and don't misrepresent reality. As in many stories where an AI is governed by such laws, they clash: Protecting your pilot means defying orders, breaking protocol, outsmarting other AIs.\n\nThe beauty of this game is that story and gameplay go so well together.\nThe story is about an AI that explores the boundaries of its programming.\nThe gameplay is a 2D puzzle platformer where most of the puzzles involve outsmarting protocols and following the letter, not the spirit of a rule.\n\nThat's all well and good, but most prospective buyers will ask three questions: Is it fun? Does it look good? Does it sound good?\n\nWell, yes, yes and yes.\n\nAs I wrote above, the game is a 2D puzzle platformer with cover-based shooting segments. These "shooty bits" feel a bit tacked-on in the beginning, but become exciting and relevant towards the end. The puzzles strike a fine balance between being reasonably clever while still being rather common-sense. Giving an example would spoil one of the many cool puzzles, but if your first instinct when encountering a giant path-blocking spider is to shoot it, you're going to be fine. The only criticism I can think of here is the fact that some parts are a bit over-reliant on checking every part of the floor and the ceiling.\n\nThe visuals are gorgeous, especially considering the game was made on a budget. You won't find cutting-edge graphics here, but the colors and the lighting really sell the mood here. Heck, just look at the screenshots. The animations are fluid and beautiful to look at.\n\nOne of the best parts of the game is the writing in combination with the voice acting.\nMost of the dialogues take on a rather creepy and monotone tone, because AIs sound creepy and monotone, but the occasional funny or touching line keep it from being boring. The characters are as well-rounded as you could possibly expect from machines that have to rigidly follow rules in everything they do. The written notes are believable and have exactly the right length to convey information and tone without being so long that you're likely to skip over them.\n\nI sincerely recommend checking out this game and I look forward to the next installment of the series.","July 15, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Most of the time it is servicable but several fights towards the end proved to be very irratable.\n\nWhile 90% of the puzzles are tricky but managable, the other 10% fall into the pit of bizare point and click adventure game logic where the solution seems rather arbitrary.\n\nThe next one isn't out yet.\n\nConclusion\n\nA short and tight story with inovative ideas that serve the story instead of just being innovation for the sake of innovation, a masterfully written story with clever puzzle solving, with the flaws in a few annoying puzzles and clunky combat only taking away a little from the overall experience.  All the frustrations I had with the final fights were instantly swept away by the story's brilliant conclusion.\n\nThis game is very much worth a purchase and I eagerly await the next game.

Exploration-platformer fans: don't expect a fully developed metroidvania (at least not in this first chapter, maybe for the next one). Point-n-click adventure fans: give it a try, you might like it.

The games story takes a lot of inspiration from the works of Isaac Asimov, and in terms of its brilliant narrative twists and turns is befitting of the master of robot fiction himself. The combat in game can be at times a little tedious in its execution, but this is a rather minor complaint as the game can more than stand up on the strength of its brilliant story and classic adventure game puzzles that had me giddy with nostalgia for my childhood days spent playing Monkey Island and Sam & Max. Between Telltales The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us and Tim Schafer's Broken Age adventure games have been making a big come back in the last couple of years, and I think in future The Fall deserves to be a part of that discussion about the re-emergence of this beloved genre. On the Metroidvania side of things this is one of the best on the market, with a welcolme flare of originality that alot of games inspired by the days of yore lack. As a Metroidvania title it rivals other great titles in the genre such as Shadow Complex and The Swapper. If The Swapper feels like the baby of Metroid and Portal, The Fall is The Swapper's half-brother fathered by Monkey Island. If this was the only episode of The Fall I would be more than happy with my purchase, but knowing that not only was that just part one, but that it is the first part of a trilogy has me excited to see what The Fall's developer has up its sleeve for the next instalment. Even if I never get to play the rest of the trilogy this first episode serves as a well rounded isolated experience with full closure for the story presented in the first episode. It leaves you brimming with questions like any fine open ending, but the fact that it is not merely left on an 'open end', and we have been lead to the precipice to hang from the cliff, leaves me eager for the answers. One thing is for sure, it's going to be one hell of a fall.","July 5, 2014","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will definitely purchase the next episode as soon as it comes out and i sincerely hope that you do too. Low price, great story, intriguing puzzles, amazing characters, tense combat, and pitch perfect voice-acting. I give "The Fall" a 10\10!

Combined with the low amount of items you carry and the very high amount of "help" you get from notes and converstions, the difficulty is really low or even non existant. The gun fights are very easy as well, actually all you do is wait for the opponents to stop shooting and then kill them.\n\nSo the game is not about the difficulty but mostly about the story and the atmosphere. While some parts of the game feel rather annoying and uneeded, overall the atmosphere is carried over really well with the graphics and sounds.\nHowever, the story is really unsatisfying since there is none. What ever has happend, is not explained. Instead the game end with the line "To be continued".\n\nSo in the end, the game feels bad, simply because the only reason to play it, meaning the story, is not told. As it seems, the player has to wait for part 2 and 3 (which has not been released) before anything is explained.\n\nSo basically this is an unfinished game that doesnt come to a real end, feels unsatisfying and has quite low playtime without any level of difficulty and even if you want to spend the additional money to understand the story... you cannot, since the other parts are not finished.\n\nI cannot recommend buying a game like this.","August 9, 2014","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got stumped a few times and still finished the game in just under four hours. It's heavily story-based so the re-play value is probably a bit low -- but that is a problem with the genre, not the game itself.\n\nBut was it worth the 10 bucks? Definitely. The art is pretty (if a bit hard to see at times), the sound and voice acting is great and the gameplay is pretty solid. But most importantly: despite the difficulty of some of the puzzles, I enjoyed the game through and through.\n\nSome players were annoyed that the ending is a bit of a cliff-hanger -- but I'd argue that it reveals just enough to allow the game to stand on its own. There are tons of open questions left and it's not guaranteed that they will be answered in any of the future chapters. It's not a game for those who obsess over getting "100%" of a game, but that is intentional. Good storytelling is based on telling you just enough to keep you interested, not boring you with exhaustive details.\n\nA++ would buy again.","August 15, 2014","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ambiance and story were very inventive, and the voice acting in general was surprisingly good. It works better as a story than as a game. The game is a little bit buggy for me, sometimes my guy would get stuck and I had to restart the game. Since this is an indy game this is not a huge surprise. The story is a very dark sci-fi tale in a kind of post-apocalyptic setting. The action and platforming elements were not great, the controls were just not tight enough for a good action game experience. For sci-fi adventure game fans, this game is worth a look.

I didn't back this game on Kickstarter, but after playing it I would back a sequel.\n\nThat being said, the game wasn't what I expected it to be. When I first saw it on Steam it was compared it to Dead Space and something else that I can't remember. It resembles Dead Space a little in atmosphere, but not in gameplay. There are some action shooting elements, but there are even more adventure game elements (ie. picking up an item and using it somewhere else). I normally don't have the patience for adventure games at all (I don't think I've ever finished one), but The Fall wasn't obtuse enough to frustrate me. You never have very many items in your inventory, and you never really have to combine them so if all else fails you can complete most puzzles using trial and error.\n\nOne more note: I wasn't rushing, and I managed to beat the game in under 4 hours.

The voice acting, sounds, and art are perfect and establish a wonderfully dystopian mood. The advancement of your character's capabilities is done in a very clever manner that I've never seen used in a video game before.\n\nThe bad: First of all, I didn't see anything suggeting that this is the first part of an episodic game, so when the conclusion failed to explain many mysteries, instead saying "to be continued" it was a surprise. The controls are strange and hard to get used to. They're also not super responsive which can make combat occasionally frustrating. The puzzles are much more difficult and obscure than I would have liked. They tend to be of the "go everywhere for no reason and rub everything on everything else for no reason until something randomly works" type. They don't require cleverness to solve but rather dogged persistence. A strong ability to memorize the slightly complicated map will assist you also as the map is a vertical maze and many of the areas look kind of similar. Generally the puzzles get in the way of the wonderful writing rather than augmenting it. I enjoyed the game much more once I found a walk through to get me past the more obtuse puzzles.\n\nBut all in all, good writing can overcome a myriad of sins, and this writing is great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MordredofFairy/recommended/290770/","MordredofFairy","Xellos of Fairy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MordredofFairy/","844 products in account","The game itself is quite fun and the background lore is nicely crafted.\n\nHowever, when they talk about it being the "first part of a mind-bending trilogy" that does not imply there's so much content they had to split it up.\nAs a result, the playtime is around 2-3 hours.\n\nNot only that, but all in all there's 3 distinct parts, with the beginning and end area highly linear(except backtracking), and the middle area being the only really "open" one.\nThe combat mechanics fall short of expectation, even the designer himself said they will rework it for the second part.\n\nThere's also some logical fallacies(only naming a few to avoid spoilers) in the game.\nYou can kneel down behind cover, but not to enter a small cave.\nYou get a weapon to utilize to protect yourself, but the upgrade to semi-auto-fire only comes way later.(would semi-auto not mean much more efficient protection to begin with?)\nCertain puzzles seem to have pretty obvious solutions, which are not included because the designer wanted the solution to be different.\n\nAlso, the game ends on a "to be continued" with a plot twist that I feel almost everybody will expect at that time(or in a similar way).\n(so the big "omg"-moment it tries to be kind of does not really work, especially since the reveal adds more to the logical fallacies).\n\nFinally, I am disappointed with the upgrade mechanics. Your suit has an on-board camouflage system that you need to activate quite early to bypass a obstacle. After this, it's reduced to a combat mechanic of "cover".\nIt has no other use anywhere in the game i found, only for dodging in combat. No more puzzles, obstacles, or alternate solutions(not that there ARE any "alternate solutions") you could use it for.\n\nAll in all, it was a fun ride...but some aspects made the ride somewhat bumpy, And, while enjoyable, its exceedingly short with no real replayability(except to get the remaining achievements...but since combat is bland and the puzzle solutions stay identical there's really little other reason to play again).\n\nTo sum it up:\n\nPro:\n+ Nice graphical style\n+ Good background story+atmosphere\n+ Good Voice acting\n+ except for backtracking, there's few parts that feel "tacked on" to extend lenght.\n\nCons:\n- combat part is bland, puzzle part feels clumsy for mouse+keyboard(instead of clicking and dragging, you have to aim at something with flashlight selected, then press shift to interact and navigate a popup-menu with wasd)\n- no alternate puzzle solutions(even for those where another solution would be obvious)\n- no real reason to replay(no alternate paths or story choices)\n- very very short(I idled for a while to eat dinner and watch a movie. Pure playtime for me was ~2 hours, on first try...that includes running around figuring out the puzzles and finding items to use...if i was to play again I believe i could finish in 20 minutes or so.)\n- several logical inconsistencies, little of which i can mention without spoilers, but somewhat breaking immersion.\n- a personal aspect: the movement of the suit. It seems a bit too slow, too unresponsive, lacking options(like kneeling/crawling), and a few more frames(e.g. when reversing run direction) would not have hurt either. It's not bad but any sidescrolling combat suit, for me, has to compete with the look and feel of Samus Arans Varia Suit in Metroid Series(to clarify: I do NOT want a morphball or spinjump, but e.g. a option to "roll into cover" while _running_ forward would be appreciated, rather than walking up to an enemy then kneeling down to go into cover. It's about how fluid things seem and look, how natural the movement is. But as said, thats a personal aspect i just thought i share for others who may feel the same).\n\nAll in all, know what you get into. Its short(2-3 hours), you will probably play it once or twice, it will probably be fun but not perfect. Decide for yourself how much that is worth to you.\n\nTL:DR\nIf I knew before what i know now, i would gladly have waited for the "complete trilogy" to  be out, then fetch that in a bundle.\nIt is a good game that most people will likely enjoy, but for what is offered, the asking price is too high.\n\nSo at the current pricing, with the content delivered, no, i can not recommend this game. Your mileage may vary, and were it significantly cheaper, i would probably recommend it(the game is still not a masterpiece, but good enough to warrant that).\n\n","August 23, 2014","false","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Metroid is one of my favorite games from my childhood and games that borrow from that explorational style are more than welcome in this modern age of hand-holding and waypoints. The game is dark and immersive, technologically stylized and contains a fresh take on a classic gaming archetype. You are an AI suit tasked with the protection of your nonresponsive human pilot. This plot device enables the player to neatly fall into the familiar gameplay of Metroid games where you unlock more abilities as you progress. The game is fairly short and relatively easy which are my only two complaints. I would have gladly paid more money for a more fleshed out story and additional challenges. As you progress through the game, areas you complete become locked off so there is no backtracking to find additional secrets with unlocked powers, other than the immediate puzzles involving that specific area. The puzzles are pretty straight forward but I did get stumped a few times. At times the game requires you to think outside the box and experiment with interesting combinations found in your inventory and the enviroment. I am very happy with this purchase and I will be looking forward to any future releases.","August 23, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
