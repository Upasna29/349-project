Steam is forcing me to choose whether to recommend this or not, so I'll go with 'Yes', but with a number of caveats.\n\nIt consists of 3 "episodes" that are fairly short in duration. All together, the episodes lasted probably 20 minutes or so for the main playthough, with you getting booted out of the episode after a set time. You can then play through an 'inspector' mode that apparently unlocks endless modes for the episodes (although the developer has indicated that they may change the flow of this).\n\nThe episodes in many ways felt like a demo for the Vive, but wow, what a demo. They really show just how amazingly immersive VR can be. I've seen a number of references to others having previously seen the "Whale Encounter" episode and having been impressed by it, but that was by far the weakest episode (probably from having been the first one). The other two episodes allow some degree of interaction, and are just on an entirely different level of impressiveness (especially the Reef).\n\nUnfortunately, with just 3 episodes in which you really pretty much see the content in 20 minutes, I'm not sure that I can recommend it at the initial $9.99 price, but at the same time it's impressive and immersive enough that I cannot recommend against it either.\n\nAnyway, I've purchased it and it will be the first thing that I'll have others try when demoing my Vive.","April 6","true","0.6"," 32 of 33 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","32","33","0","0"

I had been hesitating to do so, knowing that the amount of content that you get is very very small - especially considering that the whale encounter is free through transport. I don't regret the purchase, and won't be refunding it. You get maybe 10 minutes of total content outside of the whale experience, I didn't time it, but it wasn't a lot. It's two different scenarios, but both of them were definitely longer than the whale expeience, and just as stunning the entire time. Know going into this that you're not going to get a lot of content... but what content there is is probably the most gorgeous that exists on the vive thus far.\n\nMy one complaint would be that you can't just sit in the scenarios once they end, they go to credits and you have to select them again. I really wish the devs would implement either just an automatic repeat without credits in between with an exit button, or just an environment that you could sit in because the reef migration would be an incredibly relaxing way to spend an hour meditating.","April 20","true","1.8"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

One is a Reef Migration where you watch turtles, manta rays, fish do their thing as a huge swarm of jellyfish migrates across your path.  Whale Encounter brings you up close with a traveling whale. Luminous Abyss (my personal favorite) drops you into the bottom of the ocean where there is no natural light... barring a few strange aquatic animals.\n\nThis is not a game but an experience; there are no goals, no points, no loss conditions. There is some interaction; you can bop jellyfish and scare off fish, for example. For the most part however you're observing and immersing yourself into the ocean.\n\nOptions are limited. The Luminous Abyss episode allows you to slow down time so that you can enjoy it for longer. It also allows for screenshots. The other 2 episodes are missing these options and I'm not sure why.\n\nWith that in mind, it's a very good experience and is now one of my go-tos for showing people new to VR just what it's about. The ambient music, sound effects, and movement of the environments really allow you to get sucked into it. Be warned: this is very short. Going through all 3 episodes will take roughly 20-30 minutes.  Given the $10 this may be a bit much for what is offered.\n\nOverall this a good, albeit pricey experience and is great for demonstration if you're the "Show all my friends/family" type.","June 2","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You just totally feel transported. It's beautiful, just beautiful. And fantastic for demoing to other people as their first taste of VR: I always start with the whale, and then go on to the second one - which is just majestic - before the dark one.

It's a series of short tech demos, designed to show off the power and potential of VR.\n\nWhen I first ran this and realised I couldn't move around, or do much of anything, I thought, thank god for Valve's refund policy.  Seeing the whale swim by was neat in the first part, but it wasn't until I saw- no, make that experienced- the 2nd part that I was blown away by the simulation, and by the true potential of VR.\n\nRemember the first time you experienced 3D in the cinemas, and you find yourself reaching out with your hands to interact with the scene?  I did the same thing with this, and it was incredible.  Having fishes swim up to you, and then reacting and darting away when you reach out to touch them... seeing the jellyfishes ripple as you go to brush them away.  Looking up and seeing the swam of creatures floating above, and then finding yourself standing up from your chair and turning 360 degrees to follow their movement...\n\nWill I play this again?  Probably not.  But do I recommand this?  Yes.  Don't think of this as a game.  Think of it as an experience.  Like going diving, or paying for a ticket to go into an aquarium in real life.  The price might be steep for a tech demo, but for the experience you are paying for in VR, it is well worth the price of entry.","May 26","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A week ago when I had no prior VR experience and my Vive was still somewhere in the Czech Republic I watched a youtube video of this game and thought "well that's cool but not really that amazing.". Turns out I was wrong.\n\nThis is one of these games where videos just don't do it justice. I was really really scared when this huge whale approached me and looked at me for what seemed like an eternity. My GF and my mom both totally lost their shi t when they tried it and could not look at the whale because they were so scared. My mom screamed her soul out. This game is no joke, you totally forget you are standing in your small room grinning (or screaming) like an idiot.\n\nApart from the famous whale level there are two more which are equally amazing but much longer. I won't spoil them for you because I think part of the experience is the fact that you don't expect what's coming up next.\n\nOne level, however, was very relaxing. You could interact with the water plants around you and it was a very peaceful scene. The sounds and the lighting made it even more relaxing so I just sat down on my floor and got carried away. I think there is even more potential to these relaxing levels - just imagine sitting in a nice part of the ocean for half an hour to relax until you go to bed.\n\nIt is a really unique experience and one of the greatest.

The sense of peace is something I will carry to my grave.\nThe limited, yet, interactive experience of theBlu makes it the perfect introductory piece for all audiences.\n\nThe breath-taking experience has been the same for everyone that I've shown it too.

It should be a 4.99 price tag. If they added more content i'd be ok with 9.99.\nThe reason i bought it was because its a good introduction to show people VR","June 1","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This group of experiences have very high production values and are are without a doubt worth the entry price. At least one of these habitats will be used in every HTC Vive demo I run. Ultimately theBlu is one of the most immersive introduction options available and doesn't need users to tackle complex interactions or explanations, this is perfect for tech newcomers. I only recently found time to try Luminous Abyss and this is arguably the most impressive yet. I truly hope that Wevr produce more experiences like this in the future. If you are reading this review and have the PC specification required then don't hesitate... Thanks for the memories Wevr","May 27","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's nothing too frightening going on here, but the experiences are really impressive. The small amount of interactivity isn't a big problem, but I do wish there were more scenes.","June 6","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
