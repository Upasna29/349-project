You have to enter a code using only certain letters, but you can't walk away from it and failing keeps you trapped in the same place, trying over and over, not knowing what will work, or even what *should* work, until you're desperately trying anything because you don't want to give up...\n\n10/10 - this is my life as a game.","April 9","true","0.6"," 43 of 49 people (88%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","88","43","49","19","8"

YAY!!!! :D\n\n\nSeriously, this is a short, free game with achievements.  The "Story" on the store page is misleading as you're a spider-like machine turning on antennae.\n\nThis is a sound game, so you need to listen closely if you want to beat the game.  (I haven't figured out how to obtain the final achievement yet)   Sometimes you need to match sounds, other times to increase sounds.  Other that than, it's pretty straight forward.  Finishable in 13-20 minutes.\n\nMy only complaint is that on sound puzzles, it gives you little to no clue what to do, but it is solvable.  Also, the atmosphere does feel surreal and creepy, but it's not scary.  I kinda' feel strange after playing this game, but it wasn't a terrible experience.\n\n7/10","April 7","true","1.0"," 61 of 83 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","61","83","7","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AustinL_4/recommended/443580/","AustinL_4","AustinL_4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AustinL_4/","131 products in account","Antenna is a short and simple puzzle game with a very unique art style that seems to derive from games like LIMBO and Closure. If you enjoyed either of those two games, or the many other games like it, it's likely you'll enjoy this game too. The story is pretty simple, you play as a lonely robot in a world unknown, and your objective is to contact someone out there, using the radio towers and other equipment the robot hopes to find someone out there, anyone out there. The puzzles are pretty simple once you realize how to solve them, and the atmosphere and sound in the game is quite pleasing to go along with the simple game play. I do really wish there was a bit more to this game, because it's fantastic, unfortunately it's very short and doesn't have a lot to offer. I recommend playing this game when you've got nothing better to do, as it's not a game you'll have to spend a lot of time in and it's an easy game to complete in it's entirety.\n\nAverage Play Time - 20 to 30 Minutes.\n\nAverage Re-Playability - N/A.\n\nAverage 100% Completion Time - 30 Minutes to 1 Hour.\n\n6.5/10 - Short and simple with a great art style and interesting puzzles, but could perhaps use a little more.","April 15","true","0.5"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

It didn't need much of a story, or any real fancy gameplay dynamic. Just some nice art style involving silhouettes and simple black/white backgrounds. It can be described as having a minimalistic art style. Antenna does the same, though with far less content.\n\nPersonally, I looked a little deeper into what this game is about. The description for the game: "A machine ponders its loneliness. It scans the radio spectrum for an answer to its question."\nI think a little imagination is needed to fully encapsulate what this game is about and what it attempts to achieve. The robotic creature scuttling along seems to act as a sort of caretaker for the structure which the game revolves around. You control the creature to raise radio antennae and activate generators, to power up/turn on parts of the structure and to strengthen the radio waves needed to access the underground area and progress.\n\nThe games' greatest flaw is definitely the lack of content. Plenty more is need. However the content that is there is good. The puzzles were fun and I'm sure a story could have been made to accompany extended gameplay to give this game more than half an hours worth of gameplay. But for what its worth, I enjoyed it. For a free, short game, you can't go wrong and I just don't see why people write negative reviews when this game didn't relieve them of a single cent/rupee/rand/ruble/peso etcetera, and didn't take much of their time. As for unique, I dunno man. If you're after a unique game these days, you're in for a struggle.

And honestly, I really enjoyed this game, so it definitely does in my books.\n\nIn a game where the main focus is sound, the game nailed it. Although there isn't much variation in the sounds, what's there is good. The visuals are nice as well, taking a sort of LIMBO approach to the graphic choices, with everything monotone. However, there is a  large problem with this game, though it was a simple fix.\n\nAt the very start of the game you are required to press a series of buttons, and it just so happens that one of these buttons is '?'. This becomes a hassle though when pressing '?' does absolutely nothing, though a quick look at the guides for the game showed that the game is made for US keyboards, meaning that for most other non-US keyboards you have to press shift + ?, something that is not explained at all, leaving you to find your own external solution.\n\nOverall, great game (for free), with good visuals and sound.

These are all lies.\n\nYou randomly set up anntennas, randomly search for radio signles and then you randomly become a robot and just walk around. The puzzles give no hint of what to do. There is one puzzle where you have to change the sound of 2 monotone blocks. Yet it gives no indication why they need to be changed or what too. No where in the game do you hear these sounds ever again so it is not a case where you needed to listen to find the answer, or look around for clues. It becomea a guessing game.\n\nThe next puzzle is a combination, which again is a guessing game, with no hints if your hitting the code in the right order. There are potentially thousands of combinations it could be with no help as to what it is.\n\nThe game is just bland. You walk around and do unimaganitive puzzles. There is no story. you don't contimplate your exsistance you are on no known quest. The ending is just setting up more anntennas. You achieve nothing, discover nothing except feeling like a fool for wasting 40 minutes of your life.\n\n\nIts free though and you can get all the acheivments in one sitting so whatever. If your Mrs is taking her time to get prepared for a night out this will tide you over til shes done.","April 11","false","0.7"," 31 of 56 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","31","56","5","0"

Am I missing something? I think I'm missing something. I mean, it really feels like I'm missing something. I've definitely gotta be missing something... right?\n\nAntenna is a short, free, 2D game based largely around audio puzzles. Follow some on-screen button prompts to raise and activate antennae, scan the frequencies for the correct audio, traipse around as a weird, four-legged spider drone thingy, do a couple more audio puzzles, see a picture of a planet slowly become ever so slightly more distant, have the game shut itself down on you, then scratch your head and wonder what the hell you just played. There, I've saved you half an hour of having to play this yourself.\n\nMaybe some will brand me a philistine, but I just don't get what the point of this thing is. There's no explanation given to anything in the game; no real clear objective for any of the puzzles, no set-up for who, what, why or where exactly you are, no form of context for anything at all, it's all just... stuff. Formless, meaningless stuff. I guess all just... because. I know brevity is the soul of wit an' all, but c'mon, would it have really hurt to provide even the slightest form of basic insight into anything? Maybe they hope the environment or apparent scenario will lead us to question everything and make us create our own story, but that really feels lazy if that's actually the case. That's why I almost feel like there must be some kind of inside info I'm somehow completely missing. Everyone likes a bit of mystery, but the joy of that comes from teasing us with a little information then having us chase after the rest of the answers that will eventually come. Here, there's just nothing - nothing teased, nothing to chase, just... nothing.\n\nI guess the actual audio design itself is pretty well done, and the minimal, heavy-silhouetted visuals are as appealing as they've always been, but personally that doesn't count for very much when the gameplay itself is so lacking. I feel like someone's given me a single paragraph from a novel but then denied me the rest of the book, and by the end I was mostly just annoyed and left empty by the lack of direction or context.\n\nIf you feel like you haven't been especially catered for in the audio puzzle department and have been looking for something to fill that void, this may give you a little kick while it lasts. For everyone else, I honestly don't know what this has to offer you.","May 30","false","0.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","6"

Without the description from the designer, there would really be no basis for the game. It's basically "walk in the dark and find things simulator." However, given the whole "AI with a soul, searching for it's place in the world" vibe, I get it. Life is struggle, and so is this game. Right from the get-go, you're placed in a situation where you don't know your ♥♥♥ from a hole in the ground, and that's basically the way it stays right up 'til the end.\n\nTL;DR: This game is your Freshman college experience, with less booze.\n\nPros:\n+ Pretty stunning atmosphere (in fact, it's really all there is to the game).\n+ Visuals were dark, but crisp (think Limbo).\n+ Sounds were actually interesting. Take some time to give them all a listen.\n+ Cool twist on a puzzle game. Very few games I've played have had puzzles based solely on sound.\n\nCons:\n- Lack of any real overarching story.\n- Expensive.\n\nOverall, I give it an 8/10.

There are four achievements just for doing small puzzles and such, but there is a fifth, hidden achievement...\n\nThe fact you could go faster by holding shift did unsettle me though...why would you need it? I honestly did expect something to chase me at anytime during the experience.\n\nThere is more to this than meets the eye, I can feel it... From what i've gathered from the broadcasts though, it does seem that this game takes place in Russia perhaps (some of the voices did seem to be talking in what sounded like Russian, but this is coming from a guy whose best Spanish translates to something close to "The cat runs up a ladder"). Maybe after a war? I did hear some of the NATO alphabet at one point.\n\nI liked it for it's simplicity and beauty.

My only complaint is that the reception puzzles in the game never made any sense, and never seemed to have any rhyme or reason to their solutions, mandating that I found an online walkthrough for some parts.

Why did it take me so long? A few reasons. Both the intro and the closing are unnecessarily delayed. That robot is really slow. You take a wrong turn, and it takes forever to get back. Also, I stepped away for a few minutes.\n\nAnyways, the description definitely sums it up: Antenna is a short experience, an atmospheric expression. The only "game" aspect to this is the frequency matching and tone puzzles. Everything else is either pressing the keys it tells you to or moving the robot around.\n\nThe minimalist style and mostly ambient sound fits with the atmosphere. Anything else would take away from the meaning. It takes a bit of imagination to fill in the story about "A machine ponders its loneliness." The best comparison that comes to my mind is a dark Wall-E, and instead of gathering garbage, this thing is running an antenna array.\n\nI can appreciate this 2-man art piece. However, it would've been nice if they didn't feel the need to throw their names on the screen 3 times. It just seems amateurish to do that, like "Look at me! I made something!"\n\n---\n\nFor more...

It's underlying theme though is quite enigmatic and honestly makes no sense to me. But other than that, the surrealist feel and simplistic gameplay makes me thing that it was worth 30 minutes of my time. My only complaint is that the reception puzzles in the game never made any sense, and never seemed to have any rhyme or reason to their solutions, mandating that I found an online walkthrough for some parts. That was dissapointing.\n\nOverall, I did enjoy this game, and would give it a 7/10 for a unique game atmosphere, but unnecessarily (seemingly) unsolvable puzzles.\n\n\nI did also go through to replay it to get all of the achievements.","May 15","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why did it take me so long? A few reasons. Both the intro and the closing are unnecessarily delayed. That robot is really slow. You take a wrong turn, and it takes forever to get back. Also, I stepped away for a few minutes.\n\nAnyways, the description definitely sums it up: Antenna is a short experience, an atmospheric expression. The only "game" aspect to this is the frequency matching and tone puzzles. Everything else is either pressing the keys it tells you to or moving the robot around.\n\nThe minimalist style and mostly ambient sound fits with the atmosphere. Anything else would take away from the meaning. It takes a bit of imagination to fill in the story about "A machine ponders its loneliness." The best comparison that comes to my mind is a dark Wall-E, and instead of gathering garbage, this thing is running an antenna array.\n\nI can appreciate this 2-man art piece. However, it would've been nice if they didn't feel the need to throw their names on the screen 3 times. It just seems amateurish to do that, like "Look at me! I made something!"\n\n---\n\nFor more...

I pretty much see in some reviews that it somewhat has the eerie atmospheric feel similar to LIMBO, or it's just plain similar. In this game, you will need a very good sense of hearing, because if you have a very unclean ear or you have hearing problems, that would spell trouble for you, depending on your situation. The game starts with a very simple puzzle, made for very simple minds. If you find the first one confusing, you'll probably need help for the rest of your time in the game. Antenna is a small, short game that won't waste your time. If you loved LIMBO, you'll most likely to remember this game once in while, just like you did when you saw the little girl under the tree.\n\n"Antenna"\n\nIf you're good enough at this game, 5-10 minutes of your life won't go to waste.","April 10","true","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/443580/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Antenna is a short puzzle game from indie developer LWNA. Given its short life span of 15-20 minutes, there is little to say about the game, as there is very little content present. You initially set up an antenna, find the correct frequency, and then you end up controlling a semi-arachnid type robot. You wander a desolate landscape, setting up more antennas and generators, and sometimes solve small sound puzzles.\n\nThe art style is of the modern, "stylish" silhouette variety, much akin to Nihilumbra and Limbo. The foggy, gloomy, blue background instills the alone and depressed direction of the game. While not solving puzzles, the sound is very quiet and ambient, save for the hums and buzzes of generators and frequencies in the background when you pass by power stations. The puzzles themselves aren't overly complicated, but they aren't exactly fun either. The title in and of itself isn't exactly fun, it's just mediocre and existing.\n\nSure, Antenna is free and that's great for those of us without deep pockets. Quite honestly, not many people would've paid for the game anyway; if they had, they'd probably have requested a refund when finding out it only lasts 20 minutes. I will hand it to LWNA for not gouging gamers for a title so short, unlike the dollar games that have been popping up left, right, and center. While Antenna isn't a bad game, it's not very fun either, nor is it unique. If you're an achievement hunter, there's no harm in wasting time on this one for the easy achievements; if you're a passerby, give something else a whirl.\n\nRating: 2.5/5.0 It's not bad, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 11","false","0.3"," 25 of 49 people (51%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","51","25","49","4","5"

However, it only accepts a certain key binding (shift+key at the bottom left of Enter). For me this is pressing "^". I believe it would be best if the key was a more consistent one over keyboards, like with all other keys you press in this game. Maybe Ctrl, idk.\n\nAnother thing that bothered me is how insanely difficult the "TYUGHB" puzzle was.

If you look through the guides and forums many people are having crashing and game bugs. The total play time should be roughly 20 minutes, but due to the irritating sound "puzzles" it adds at least another 20 minutes. You'll spend that time looking at the guides trying to figure out these rather tedious puzzles.  don't know what I was really expecting when I downloaded this, but I was hoping for at least a small story and some dialogue...\n\n*Spoilers*\n\nWhat I got was a boring radio puzzle which was repeated at the end, two but pushing sequences, and one actually fun puzzle where I had to match four tones. The game's background seems kind of pointless, it’s some post-apocalyptic Earth, but it really doesn’t have any effect on the game. The protagonist, a spider robot thing doesn’t really have any purpose either. The game creates this really interesting atmosphere, yet does literally nothing with it.\n\nI'm not saying the game isn't worth some people's time, because some people might really like comparing monotone sounds and listening to static. I'm just saying for everyone who is like me and finds that a waste, I recommend doing something a little more productive instead.\n","April 8","false","1.4"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

I thought so too when I saw them.\nUnfortunately, as I've already mentioned, I was a bit disappointed. The description on this game's shop site is pretty much the most you're gonna get out of this story. Unless you're some person that can find theories in the smallest of things, but even then you probably won't make much of a breakthrough.\nThe game is also very short, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, if the game was interesting enough.\nIf you're some kind of (lazy) achievement hunter, you'll probably "like" this game a little bit because this game might have some of the easiest achievements ever. Just beat this (very short) game and stand in a specific spot for a few minutes and TA-DA, game completed.\n\ntl;dr:  This game isn't very interesting and really short. Does this game have any difficult puzzles to compromise for this?\nNo, it really doesn't.

It takes an age to load, if you try and skip the opening 'cinematic' it will freeze for infinity, when you're in the game it will crash and without checkpoints you have to start over and the 'puzzles' are buggy. There is a four square puzzle relies on sound distinction (Always a bad choice as all audio setups are VERY different) and the way of manipulating it gives very little feedback and is tedious to control. I got past the puzzle after that which again is about ascending notes so not such a problem, but then the game crashed again. That marked my fifth attempt to just play the game and I had gotten bored of a robot spider moving at half a mile an hour toward half baked puzzles. The art style is ok, but derivative, I would say best described as limbo style sillohettes meets a near future apocolypse setting, however in contrast the coding and puzzle design are incredibly poor. This urges the question of 'why play this?' the answer is there is not a single reason. If you want something like this then I would recommend Limbo. It is far more thought out, doesn't crash, has puzzles that work as such, in short it is everything this game tries to be but fails to reach. I hope the developer of this is not too discouraged as it has potential, but it needs to be more thought out, and a some Q/A to be worth your time.\n\n\nTL;DR\nGame is broken both in mechanics and through bugs, if you want this but thought out then play Limbo.","April 9","false","1.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

To put it in simple terms, this is a game that tries too hard to be artistic. The game itself is about 10 minutes long, not including the time it takes to beat your head into the wall until you give up and look up a guide on how to complete its obsfucating and meaningless puzzles. The game is inconsistent, there is NO discernable story, and no subtext. Antenna. That's the name of the game. And there are some antennas. And a walking robot. That's basically all the semblance of meaning there is to this game. I know it's free and all, but this game should never have been added to steam. Or rather, this should only live on as an example of how NOT  to make games. The buttons do different things for different reasons and there's no semblance of any kind of coherence in the controls or the puzzles or anything. It very likely was made by a team of asset flippers in high school building their portfolio for a game design college in Tenesse. This game is literally the worst, most useless game I have every played, and the only thing I like about it is that I can finish this review, be done with this game, and never have to think about this piece of garbage for the rest of my life.","May 14","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It also has the potential to cause one to contemplate one's existence. I say potential, because I certainly lost any desire to do so once the frustration set in. The "puzzles" in this game fall on two opposite ends of the spectrum: simplistic and arbitrary pushing of keys/mouse buttons (sometimes in cominations), and infuriating sound-based puzzles that are just cruel to those of us who are tone deaf or otherwise hearing impaired. The former may be simplistic, but only when one manages to get them to work. When I first started playing, I gathered that I was supposed to hold down a certain key, but after several minutes and nothing happening, I left and came back only to discover on starting a new game, that it suddenly worked. In the end, I resorted to walkthroughs and guides to get me through the sound based puzzles, only to discover that the ending wasn't satisfying enough to justify the frustration of the game.","May 3","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I don't know if this was intended but if it was, they did a great job.\n\nIf you play the game, you'll soon realize that every major puzzle is based on sound. Although I won't tell you how these puzzles work (because "spoilers"), I can tell you that some are obvious and some (one in particular) are not all. It would be neat to see what other sound puzzles this game could have if it was fully fleshed out.\n\nAll in all for a free 15 min puzzle game it isn't bad and worth a try.","April 9","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The music keeps you wondering whats gonna happen next with its beep boop and all mysterious type sounds.

My personal favourite part was the robot that didn't talk there was something so wonderful about him/her..

The music keeps you wondering whats gonna happen next with its beep boop and all mysterious type sounds.

Shortwave, Numbers Stations, Ham radio, etc. This was a real treat. There were a lot of very fimilar and well known sounds put into this. The puzzles,  using these sounds, were very enjoyable. I know for a fact that the developer(s) have spent a good amount of time exploring the radio spectrum just as I have. This is a total masterpiece for the RF educated. I plan on running this again and seeing what I can get out of the JT63, CW, etc. What I found cool is knowing what these sounds were. It's great! I am going to have a friend, who has not spent years within the headset, give this a try and see what sort of results take place.\n\nIf this were to have Workshop, the creations would be amazing as I know some pretty serious minds would really do it up. The first thing I would create would be a Numbers Station scenario.\n\nThank you for such a great production, concept, and a good time. I  have to tell you, when I first got it started, I actually looked over at my Flex SDR, then my FT-900, thinking I had left them on!

Very well done. There is a lot of mouse wheel usage in the game, so for the few out there that don't have a scroll wheel (or who use a laptop that does not have scroll active) I don't know how the game makes up for that, but keep that in mind.

The game involved puzzles with very little explaination... Actually, no explaination. The puzzles were loud and obnoxious and I spent about half an hour on one that just kept making noise at me, even though I followed the one (and only) guide this game has on that puzzle. It didn't increase the signal at all. Other than that puzzle, I literally turned on a light, used an elevator, built an antenna, tuned a radio, and charged a battery with this game... Within that 30 minutes I spent on that puzzle. The game appeared to be mainly silouhettes, which was... an okay art style. It doesn't look bad. The character, when you finally get it, moves too slow too in my opinion. Other than that, it's a great game....

Reminder though you may find puzzles irrational.\nQ: Is game hard  A: Not hard but unguessable without guide  video guide 1 (not mine)  video guide 2 (not mine)\nsteam guide 3 (not mine)   steam guide 4 with vid but medium rated (not mine)\n\nPros  Atmospheric.\nAn experience.\nScreenshots & videos looks promising\nFree\nNetural   Its has a reference that I find out later\nAchievement perfection in 1-1/2 hour for hunters\nCons  Game has lot of bugs mostly about input. ex.\nno real keyboard support except EN  (this is a game breaking bug)\nMost of the people get black screen, memory leak due to unoptimized game  (this is a game breaking bug)\nsliders get stuck very often,  (this is a very annoying)\nslider can go where it shouldn't suppose to be going (very tragic)\nthere is no actual sound or music except mechanical sounds, radio signals, and radio parazites /and  sounds gets very annoying/repetetive.\nNot a single clue will be given to you, Im not talking about lore, Im talking about controls & what to do. Even in dark souls game teaches you with tutorial and tolds you to ring bells.\nonly gameplay is holding buttons, walking  and solving sound puzzles.If you think you'll get bored listening same sounds over an over again dont play it. This isn't a good way to kill time Devoloper never tested game with beta testers before releasing. Sure it could be easier to solve puzzles you have created but its not easy for a player who has no clue to solve it\nDev thinks we have machine perfect ears  but we only passed puzzles by try&error or watching a guide\n\n\n\nthis not enjoyable for most of the time, sure its atmospheric but visuals are %25 of this game %25 holding buttons and %50 boring puzzles with repetative listening. Its more fun for you to join army communication radio section.\n\nno remapping controls and input doesn't work unless you use EN keyboardYes Im very serious, normally you have to press the "?" button in order to proceed but button did nothing at all. So I switched EN keyboard looked layout online and I advanced the game.\nwalking sim you mostly walk slowly on this game (a lot).\near bleeding in the first puzzle you have to find sound on the radio same frequency as the sound you have. But there is no way to mute radio and get a clear shot of the sound that was given to you. Also since I couldn't find the "?" button I listened parasites in the radio a lot till I figured the button.\n2 bar adjustment puzzleYou have to create the same sound again but this time there is a time challange circuit going on and you can barely adjust them. Because its want you to be very quick.\nlet me explain it there are 4 buttons. first and last one unchancable unlike middle ones. Each time one button highlights and plays a sound, next it plays the button comes after it. the last one resets the circuit. Each button highlights less than 2 second and its very fast in this situation.\nIt wasn't hard and I managed to make all buttons play same sound but it wasnt perfect enought for the game so I couldn't pass it\nI looked up for guide (which is saying second lower than %50 and third around %75)\nI cant get a good playback because sound chance too sharp, you move it %5 and it completely chanced. Also time challange makes it super boring.\nFor a game like this puzzles shouldn't be that hard","April 9","false","0.7"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","3"

This is followed by a sound puzzle yet the gamers only way of knowing whether or not this is a puzzle is a google search, lazy devs again couldn't be bothered to put any explanation dialogue in their game. In fact if you go online all you see is people askig what these puzzles are and how to complete them.\n\nEventually I find a thread that explains how the first puzzle works, complete it and head to this Lift (after some mandatory pressing of buttons to show off basic animation skills). Press down to use it a little icon explains. Press down. Nothing happens. Press up. Lift goes down.\n\nOnce at the bottom unable to move in the direction it looks like I should be going the game shows another mandatory button, by now I'm so used to having to waste my time pressing these buttons for so little to happen I press it, whilst wondering if the devs should consider a career in  retail? It's no surprise the only good reviews about this game came out AFTER a compehensive guide to completing it was created\n\nIt just brings the eleavator back up, fortunately enough for me the game just crashes for the third time.\n\nI don't try to re-open.","April 9","false","0.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It's unusual. It's kind of pretty if sillouettes are your thing.\n\nThat's where the good ends.\n\nI liked The Plan, but this game - while having more elements of a game than The Plan - feels like less of a game.\n\nEssentially, you press keys when they tell you and occassionally face a pretty simple puzzle or a puzzle that more or less relies on dumb luck. There's no story. The cool premise you see in the description is all the story you get. If there was no description, then you wouldn't know about a machine pondering its lonliness, much less a question. The game goes nowhere in terms of story and is basic and at times frustratingly slow in terms of gameplay. It's free, though, and the art is interesting (both visuals and sound design).\n\nGive it a try, I guess, but I think this could have been good had it been a little less postmodern or a whole lot more postmodern. As it is, it is pointless as a game and as art. You might like pointless, and it's not bad, but that's where it is.\n\nAlso, it was laggy and even buggy at times, which is inexcusable for a basic game like this.","April 7","false","0.5"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","26","7","27","2","1"

For example, (SPOILER ABOUT THE GAME INCOMING) situations where you might do something wrong which casuses your work to be ruined and you would have to start over with the specific signal you were working on.\n\nAll in all despite the cons, the game is free to play and an entertaining way of spending a little hour or so.

Though it is an indie game it is not very well made.. Too short and too many cut scenes, and most of them are there for too little reasons. You move too slowly, but I feel like that's what's making the game longer. The puzzles aren't the best they can be, to someone like me they don't have a reason as to why you're doing the puzzles and it feels pointless.\n\nNegatives out of the way, the art style is very unique and gives a feeling of mystery.\nThe experience does feel cinematic capped at 60fps, which is great for a game like this.\nThe atmosphere is very good, I love the sounds that you hear and they fit really well with the art style.\n\nBut there's really no other positives I can think of. Maybe if you have some sort of background, or some kind of interest in signals, you will really like this. But to me, it just seems like there's nothing.\n\nBut hey, it's an indie game and games take a long time to make, and I guess it's not really aimed at me. So I guess this leads me to giving two seperate scores.\nFor the people who have a background, and are interested in signals maybe, 7/10 (results may vary depending on them, since I am not them c:)\nFor me, it was a 3.5/10\n\nSo it's a "play the game for yourself and see if you like it" situation.","April 11","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although you can hardly call it a game (you can beat it under 30 min the second time easily) it is astonishingly immersive. It never felt so good to walk on a desolate field of grass with a highway roaring in the distance, controlling possibly the coolest bug ever.\nIt's basically a puzzle game with very few indications of what you're supposed to do, or why you're doing it at all. I captures the atmossphere so perfectly that I really wish it was a sandbox that I could explore for hours. The peace, the eary sounds, everything fits.\nI really recommend downloading it, best experience when you play at night with all the lights off.","April 11","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Or what in the days used to be a mix tape of your band for publicity on your work. I don't like consuming publicity and it seems to me like the authors wanted solely to get their work out there with this game. I understand them, but that doesn't make it fun and consequently a propper entertainment product for Steam to present.\n\nRegarding the "game" in itself it features a total of 4 puzzles and they can hardly be called that. As any short game, they favor the slow avatar movement speed to make it seem longer. It doesn't. And everyone creating a short game should not force us to go through their game at a reduced speed. It just makes me bored. Pressing a key for a long time just to get from A to B in order to progress is not my idea of fun.\n\nFuthermore, the universe felt bland to me and the antenna animations were so chopped that I actually thought I had a drop in frame rate, but I stayed at 50fps constantly. Which also leads to the question as to why it didn't reach at least my screen's refresh rate of 60...\n\nIn the end, this is another game from Steam's catalgue of silly offers and there is no way I can recommend it to anyone. Only download and play this if you feel like doing the devs a favour. Kinda like when you go see your neighbours' childrens' play. You know it won't be excellent, but you want to be nice at the expense of some of your time, which could have been used to do anything else much more productive.","April 11","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound: the sound cut out for an extended time at one point. Additionally, the sound quality is crackle-y and spotty. Sounded like a broken speaker.\n2. The game would freeze up from time to time during actions, such as raising the final antenna.\n3. The game isn't as responsive to the button presses or mouse wheel movement as it should be. At times, it was hard to figure out if I was doing the right thing or if the game was just having issues.\n\nOverall, with some fixing, it could be a worthwhile game.","April 13","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first thing I did was hold down random keys until antennas popped out of the ground.  Then I was faced with a screen showing what looked like an old radio tuner, the "X" key and the "?" key along with instruction to use the scroll wheel.  I never made it passed that.  I tried everything.  I went from one side of the tuner to the other.  I held "X" while going from one side of the tuner to the other.  I held "?" while going from one side of the tuner to the other.  I held both "X" and "?" while going from one side of the tuner to the other (not an easy feat BTW,  just try holding "X" and "?" while turning the scroll wheel  and you will understand).  I wanted to like this game.  I wanted to play through this game.  Maybe something did not download properly.  I would give the developers the benefit of the doubt, but I have a feeling that I was just missing something.  I hope anyone else who reads this and gets past that part will tell me what I am doing wrong because I want to enjoy this game\n\nEDIT:  Okay guys, I am obviously used to having my hand held in most modern video games.  I played through the entire thing, and I must say that is is a great little game.  My only complaint is that there isn't enough!  It has a great atmosphere, fun little puzzles (except for the first one which completely kicked my but on every level imaginable).  I am changing my recommendation for this game.

I was expecting more game length from it, but for a free-to-play, casual, puzzle title, I can hardly complain. With it being in a slightly unusual in format, as well as being a puzzle game, it can cause a great deal of frustration to players that are missing a key hint as to what to do next.\n\nOne thing I need to point out is that the puzzles are sound based, hence the theme of Antenna! You need to listen carefully to get through the puzzles.\n\nIt is really short once you know how to puzzle it out, like with most fixed puzzle games, but with such games it is not for the impatient when first playing through it. I would recommend checking the game’s Community Hub for a hint or technical help if stuck. I needed to, since the interface had a slight glitch with the “?” button, and the implied hint of what to do kind of went over my head on the first puzzle. Heh, woops.\n\nAnyway, if you are looking for a short break from other games, I would recommend checking this one out. You can likely beat it in one or two sittings, but the visual, and especially audio, details in it are what really make it interesting. Any armature radio operator would like find the details in the radio chatter almost a puzzle in of itself, since there are some encoded messages in it as well.","May 1","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's somewhat simple regarding actual gameplay, but it's not mindless by any means, there are riddles; they take a bit of critical thought to understand, but they're not impossible.\n\nOne thing I have to bring up is this game's ability to raise so many questions with so little actually presented. What's going on here? Where did this come from? Is this Earth? Is this in the future? The past? Who am I trying to "tune-in" to? I can't think of another game I've played that caused me to question it so much.\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing by any means; some games do this really well, some don't. Some games hide a bunch of easter eggs or something hinting at (read: forcing) a backstory... some imply a grander idea that may never be understood completely. This game does the latter - and does a darn good job at it too.","May 12","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also I didn't experience this myself but there have been many users that have the game constantly crashing and leaking memory.\n\nFor the game itself, it's a nice endeavor. I'm a fan of simple puzzle games with an unconventional aesthetic. I'm sad to say, though, that the aesthetic is similar to many indie games I see these days (obvious comparison is Limbo) and the puzzles are scarce and unchallenging. They may take you a while only because they are esoteric, and some of the sliders required pin point percision.\n\nThe time I spent in the game is so long because I did groceries in the middle, it is very short which is nice sometimes but here I just wanted something to do--So it actually felt long.\n\nI think it shows promise but right now it has a few too many flaws. I'm not complaining, it was free and reminded me a lot of the early web games that some people (who turned into great developers) did. I just hope in their next game the gameplay informs the player enough so there's never a "What do I do?" moment.","April 9","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So if you are tone deaf like me you might have a hard time. The puzzles are very interesting and varied but still connect with a common theme.

I was wrong.\n\nYou won't think much of this game at first - I certainly didn't. It's incredibly short. It has no meaningful dialogue. The graphics are very minimalistic. There is no plot to speak of.\n\nThen I started to think about why. Why is the only dialogue in the game vague muttering in foreign languages? Who left this little AI machine behind to maintain radio equipment? Where is everyone? What happened here?\n\nIn my opinion, you're not supposed to know, because there is no way to know. The machine AI seems only enough to maintain equipment that it doesn't truly understand, for a purpose that's unknown to us, for masters who may or may not exist anymore.\n\nThe game is free to play and doesn't take long: I highly suggest you check it out and form your own opinion.","April 18","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I explain how to do the puzzle more ahead.\n\nWARNING: This game may give you nightmares. It has some frightening sounds. It made me think they're programming something in our heads, with these sounds.  Heh heh. not kidding. Im scared. The sounds also get super annoying. Like super annoying. I still hear the beeping sound in my head. Heh heh. I'm not going crazy. Heh heh. Don't play rhis game. The graphics aren't worth it. Also it has no tutorial and it is just a very annoying game to play.\n\nAnyhoooo here is how to SOLVE IT:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nyou don't solve it.\n\nHa ha kidding.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Puzzle: Find in the radio, the sound that matches the sound you get when you press the letter "z" in the keyboard. Which for me, was more in the left. Not that far to the left, though.\n\n\nSecond Puzzle: Just follow the instructions. When your scrolling the mouse, it is up and down. Not in one direction. Use wasd or the arrows to move the creature. Use shift to move faster. Okay so then you just keep on walking and ignore the elevator going down. Keep on walking till you get to some blue pad. Their scroll the mouse up and get the battery to full. Then go left to the box on the floor that is asking for a battery. Press the 2 buttons at the same time.\n\n3rd Puzzle: Go down the elevator. Go right. Press the button they ask. Keep on going right. Now you have a super wack puzzle. I thought at the beginning, your goal was to make them all sound the same. It's not. or is it? You can also make the thing go out of the square itself, if you scroll far enough. Which is either a bug or part of the game itself. Yeah this is as far as I got.\n\nHmmm maybe you can't beat it. Or can you? Heh heh hehh.","April 9","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're looking for a way to kill an hour for free, have fun.\n\nThe trailer is the game. You could leave a weight on the keyboard, let your robot walk, and come back and smash some buttons and finish the game. There is no strategy, there is no adventure, there is nothing to entice someone to play.\n\nAlthough this game looks like Limbo, rest assured that it does not play like it. Your character is slow and clunky. Moving from one objective to another with no interference takes upwards of a minute of leaving your finger on just one button. I could've left a weight on my keyboard for the majority of the gameplay.\n\nThe controls are wonky and do not work. There is no way to remap the keys. View the community hub for workaraounds that the community have found.\n\nIf you mess up, that's it. Time to start over. My game continuously bugged on the second radio signal. It would not let me properly select the channels to advance.

I started playing, expecting yet another bland clique indie puzzle game, but for some reason I really loved it. Right away I had no idea what to do, which in most cases would be bad but actually made the gameplay so much more interesting. Very little was explained making not only the puzzles puzzles, but in actuality every bit of the game was one giant puzzle. There is just something special about the game, so much is a mystery; with no backstory it makes you wonder how and why this little spider bot is roaming the planet in search of a signal.

Sometimes boredom does great things. (emphasis on sometimes) I stumbled upon this little gem while binge downloading free-to-play games. I started playing, expecting yet another bland clique indie puzzle game, but for some reason I really loved it. Right away I had no idea what to do, which in most cases would be bad but actually made the gameplay so much more interesting. Very little was explained making not only the puzzles puzzles, but in actuality every bit of the game was one giant puzzle. There is just something special about the game, so much is a mystery; with no backstory it makes you wonder how and why this little spider bot is roaming the planet in search of a signal.  I would love to see more of this game in the future. My 0.3 hours was well spent.","April 22","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Kind of like Shadow of the Colossus, where you start without a tutorial or prior clues, and just figure it out as you go. On the same note, the story is left up to interpretation. Who is the robot? What planet are you on? Where are all the signals coming from? You will be pondering the meaning of the Antenna long after you've solved the puzzles. Which, by the way, are very clever. Being a jaded audiophile myself, I got a kick out of listening for the tonal match or solving a passcode by thinking like a musician. Any short-wave radio enthusiast will be miles ahead of the rest of us when it comes to finding the last achievement, and may have a few more clues to its overall meaning.\nFind signal--->send query--->find bigger antenna--->repeat.\nA beautiful void.","April 23","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was expecting more game length from it, but for a free-to-play, casual, puzzle title, I can hardly complain. With it being in a slightly unusual in format, as well as being a puzzle game, it can cause a great deal of frustration to players that are missing a key hint as to what to do next.\n\nOne thing I need to point out is that the puzzles are sound based, hence the theme of Antenna! You need to listen carefully to get through the puzzles.\n\nIt is really short once you know how to puzzle it out, like with most fixed puzzle games, but with such games it is not for the impatient when first playing through it. I would recommend checking the game’s Community Hub for a hint or technical help if stuck. I needed to, since the interface had a slight glitch with the “?” button, and the implied hint of what to do kind of went over my head on the first puzzle. Heh, woops.\n\nAnyway, if you are looking for a short break from other games, I would recommend checking this one out. You can likely beat it in one or two sittings, but the visual, and especially audio, details in it are what really make it interesting. Any armature radio operator would like find the details in the radio chatter almost a puzzle in of itself, since there are some encoded messages in it as well.","May 1","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The ambience and visuals in this game really hits the spot, and brings a very LIMBO environment, however some of the frequencies are quite painful to the ear for long periods of time. It's just a really dull drone that's not for everyone.\n\nOverall, this is not a difficult game for those fellow fine tuners out there, and if you're looking for some easy achievements to accomplish, this will be the game. There is no storyline or plot or reason behind what you are doing, so if you are here for the plot - probably best to find another game...","May 10","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldn't call it GOTY worthy, but this game has a certain desolate land feel to it. No backstory, no real objective except to (sit down for this one folks...) restore signal by initializing antennas. Somehow this game invokes my thoughts (as a good indie game would), it makes me question things such as:\n\nWhere is this little robot sent from?\nWhy do they need these signals to be up?\nThere are still humans speaking over these frequencies you can slowly tune into, if that's the case why is this robot sent in to fix this problem?\nThere is a lack of life yet trees are seen in the backgrounds (What kind of Earth is this?)\nOverall, I would say this game is a good time killer. Replayability isn't so high up there, but it definitely is a worthy experience. It is a very small environment, but it still captivates me tremendously. Most of the negative reviews on this game are people who expect big action-packed, story driven, colorful, indie games. I believe this one is worth checking out.
