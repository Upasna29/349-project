"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/111100/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","Snuggle Truck attempts to do something very simple in what it offers, and for the most part it succeeds. The main problem comes with the frustration of acquiring all medals available.\n\nThe basic premise of the game is to go through groups of increasingly difficult levels and achieve specific goals in order to earn medals. There are easy, medium, hard, and extreme groups of levels. In easy and medium, it's actually fun to hone in your skills and fight for all the medals. In the hard levels, the fun begins to diminish into something comparable to an annoying task or a dreadful job. The extreme levels are so much worse than the hard levels, that the experience ceases completely from being a game and fully becomes a terrible chore, or a punishment.\n\nIf getting the basic medal for all levels is enough to please you, then you'll be able to easily beat the game in less than an hour. On the other hand, if you're a perfectionist, and getting all possible medals is your goal, I'm sure that there may be at least ten hours of entertainment here for you. There are also some bonus developer created levels, as well as thousands of user created levels for you to download from within the game, but actually wanting to experience this much content will depend on how patient you are and how much fun you are able to get out of Snuggle Truck.\n\nSnuggle Truck is okay.","August 19, 2014","true","4.6"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

Why was there a game called snuggle truck in my steam library? This question haunted my very existence for days. Did I buy it? Did I get it in some humble bundle I spent ten cents on? Was it a sigh from some great cosmic God? I hesitated to play this game because its name had suggested such unimaginable terror.  Would it consume my very soul? Every time I opened the steam client I would see it there, waiting for me, waiting for a moment of weakness where I would finally break down and play it. I fought off the urge for weeks, but deep down I realized that one day I would have to play it. The day finally came, I could no longer fight against it, I clicked on it and installed it.

Its personality is lost in a deluge of repetitive, tedious levels, designed in such a way as to be just obnoxious and tedious enough that they become a monotonous chore to complete. The challenge feels mostly arbitrary and poorly planned out, existing as little more than to cause you to replay levels numerous times but providing no satisfaction when you finally achieve a faster time or medal.\n\nI wish I had some more elaborate criticism to add, but that's honestly all I can muster. Snuggle Truck feels like the cute but entirely moronic cousin of games such as Trials and Joe Danger, full of bright colors and upbeat music, but hard to spend more than a few minutes with before you can feel your eyelids start to close.","October 30, 2014","false","1.0"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","14","22","0","0"

I wouldn’t call this one a “thrill ride,” but Snuggle Truck can be your burst game, that title you play when you’ve got three minutes to spare.\n\nIt’s hard to just peg Snuggle Truck in a genre. I call it a side-scrolling racing game and then toss in the caveat that it’s highly physics-based. In the game, you control a dirty truck that can be highly reactive to the terrain its meets -- the smallest dips and jumps cause the truck to lean back and forth. You can correct its arc with the arrow keys, but you don’t do it for the safety of the vehicle -- you get lined up to protect the cargo, those cartoon animals riding in the back. Each animal is just as reactive to the truck’s trajectory, and the point is to hit the end point as quickly as possible with as many animals as possible. Easier said than done, I've learned.\n\nThere’s a lot of stuff that can get in your way in the process of getting to the end goal, the "zoo": there’s an assortment of bumps, massive hills, dips, and even a few surprise environmental objects like explosive crates that get thrown into the mix in later levels. For the most part, Owlchemy Labs does a fantastic job providing change of pace opportunities: there’s a ton of different layouts and jumps experimented with, which give you plenty to do and think about.\n\nHitting and landing a jump without losing your animal dudes is all in the wrist and in the finger. You can use your keys to correct the trajectory and also use the basic movement mechanic -- pressing your fingers on either the up or the down key -- to slow or speed up your truck.\n\nSnuggle Truck introduces one new mechanic at a time, giving you the ability to slowly learn and react to obstacles as you progress through the levels. But there’s a big trial-and-error element as well since you never know what’s around the bend. One small jump, for example, can take you straight into a wall while another of the same exact kind might not present any mission critical navigational issues.\n\nTo its credit, Snuggle Truck remains fun despite its clumps of middling level design. I chock this up to its relative snappiness -- levels take, generally, under a minute to finish, so it’s not a great loss to start over again. Nor do you really need to ace a level since there’s so many in each tier.\n\nOf course, there are carrots on sticks to chase -- Snuggle Truck goes heavy on the rewards after completion of each level. You can earn your traditional star medals, as well as completion medals based on completion and number of animals you save.\n\nWhile Snuggle Truck actually feels like a game that went one direction and then the other, I recommend it. The truck controls well, the physics respond well, and the level design has that right mix of snappiness and intrigue. Check it out if you’re in the market for another racing side-scroller, and keep your eyes peeled for updates. Owlchemy Labs has crazy plans for Smuggle Truck which include implementing community-generated levels which could lead to some awesome replay value.","December 25, 2013","true","119.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skelig/recommended/111100/","skelig","Skelig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skelig/","240 products in account","Snuggle Truck is quite possibly the greatest game ever made. From an objective standpoint, nothing else comes quite close to delivering the kind of experience that this game is capable of. If I were to choose one game in existence to prove to somebody that video games are art, it would definitely have to be this masterpiece.\n\nFirstly, I would like to begin this review by asking the question: what is a video game? Some people would simply answer this by saying that video games are an interactive medium with the sole purpose of delivering entertainment to the players. Others prefer to give long philosophical answers which tackle every facet of this age-long riddle. After playing Snuggle Truck I can honestly say that any answer to this question is meaningless, and one only needs to play this game to fully appreciate the marvellous wonder of this pastime known as "video games."\n\nWith that said I would like to break the game down as much as possible within the limitations of purely text-based reviews; after all Snuggle Truck is a deep, complex experience which would transcend standard, traditional review formats. One of the most notable things I would like to bring to the forefront is Snuggle Truck's graphics and visual style. When I first loaded this game and began playing, I thought the game had crashed. Let me explain: I'm an avid fan of trucking in general, and as a result my desktop background is a constantly-changing slideshow of truck imagery. The visuals in this game are so incredible that I mistook graphical images for photography. The animation is also so incredibly smooth and lifelike that I actually started to feel brief motion sickness after only a few seconds of play.\n\nThis soon passed however as I quickly became immersed in the truly innovative and revolutionary gameplay found in this work of art. Snuggle Truck takes similar games such as Euro Truck Simulator 2 and completely slaps them in the face with its own brand of hyperrealistic physics and gameplay scenarios which leaves a completely before-unseen impression on the player. Because of how intuitive, responsive and predictable the controls felt, I was very quickly able to adapt to how the game must be played; and it even left me thinking "hot damn, this is so lifelike, I could probably do this in a real life truck."\n\nThat's not to say the game is easily played, however. While the game presents itself as being extremely accessible through its  controls and simplstic gameplay objectives, this game has a very steep difficulty curve which constantly demands the player to step up their game. The difficulty is fair and never feels artificial, and if you mess up, it's 100% your fault.\n\nThe audio in this game is beyond noteworthy. No lie, when I finished playing this game because I had important things to do - such as sleep so that I would have enough energy the next day to play more Snuggle Truck - I basically had to leave the game idling on the title screen because the music is so incredible. It's insanely catchy and would make great classical composers of past ages such as Bach and Mozart weep with envy.\n\nWith everything said, I believe it stands to reason that Snuggle Truck should be considered one of if not the greatest game ever made. If, after reading this review, you still have any doubts as to whether or not you should buy this game, you are probably literally Satan; though I doubt even the dark lord himself wouldn't get a kick out of this truly magnificent magnum opus.","December 31, 2013","true","0.4"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

This is an awesome feature as it adds an potentially unlimited amount of levels and content to the game)\n♦ Truck and Stuffed Animal skins are very detailed (Custom Skins are designed very well for what they are and add a nice little bonus to the game)\n♦ Price is reasonable ($5 for a game is decent as if you look past all the cons you’ll get your $5 worth)\n\n\nCons:\n\n♦ No Steam Cloud Storage (I’ve had to restart this game 3 or 4 times for the sole fact of no Steam Cloud Storage and me always losing my save file. You could say I should’ve backed up the savefile, but there is no easy way to tell which games you own have SCS. Therefore, as the game progresses by completing one level to unlock the next, SCS would be relatively beneficial. Plus, If a game is on Steam and doesn’t make use of this free feature, then in my opinion it shouldn’t be on Steam)\n♦ Method to activate custom skins is annoying (Firstly to be able to even use them you have to go and enable them in a “+more” menu. The “+more+ menu doesn’t lead on to what it is until you click it which is annoying as I had no idea what It was until I clicked it. Though, once you’ve enabled all the custom skins, you have to then get into a level and click the truck until your truck has the skin you want. This concept would be fine if it didn’t mean you had to waste a play through just to enable a skin. The skin should be able to be enabled and selected from within the “+more” menu)\n♦ Lacks Steam Workshop (This is bad as the game makes you upload to their servers and for some reason created levels don’t always stay. I say this as I created a level a while ago and started playing Snuggle Truck again only to find my level deleted. Plus, custom levels not moderated properly as the only way is by a star rating which doesn’t explain much. With Steam Workshop levels would be moderated by the community via ratings and comments etc and would be more likely to stay in the game)\n♦ Has DLC activated automatically (This is a weird concept as the game calls certain features DLC but you can’t actually buy any DLC for the game. This confuses me as to why it’s even called DLC)\n♦ Custom level highscores don't load and you have to quit the game to continue playing (When you click the highscores in Custom levels made by users, it just shows a spinning loading circle and does nothing else. You can’t close out of the spinning loading circle, meaning you have to close the game and re-open it if you want to continue playing)\n♦ No way to delete a Downloaded Custom Level (This is annoying as I stated not all levels are moderated. Therefore, if you download a bad level there is no way to easily delete it within the game. This is annoying as it fills your list of custom levels with a lot of potentially unwanted ones making it hard to find the ones that you actually enjoyed and work)\n♦ Has impossible times in highscores rendering them broken (Highscores just work, however some scores are obviously impossible and hacked in some way. There needs to be some sort of moderation of highscores or a global reset to make number one even achievable)\n♦ Pressing escape to go back to the main menu at times loses the mouse cursor making the menu unusable (This is annoying as not being able to use the mouse on a menu means you can’t actually select anything. This ultimately means you have to close the game and re-open it to continue playing)\n♦ Alt+Tab brings up a pause menu that doesn’t act properly (When you press Alt+Tab and return to the game it brings up a pause menu, which is nice ingame but out of game on the menu it still comes up and trying to return to the game or close this menu doesn’t function properly)\n♦ Makes use of Steam Global Leaderboards via Steam Stats but they don’t function (This is a nice feature to have, but for whatever reason there are no entries in these leaderboards and one of the level entries is “Test” which shouldn’t be the case)\n\nOverall, even though gameplay seemingly works and is fun, the game is cheap and has a decent amount of content, I can’t recommend this game. I can’t recommend it because there are too many minor errors within features of the game that should have been eliminated in early beta stages. Plus, having no cloud storage is a big factor for me not to recommend a game like this.","November 21, 2015","false","5.8"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","10","19","0","0"

I stared entranced, soaking in owlchemy Labs' new material, chiseling each gameplay moment into the best functioning parts of my brain which would be the only platform for the material for months.\n\nThis is an emotional, psychological experience. Snuggle Truck plays like a clouded brain trying to recall an alien abduction. It's the sound of a development studio, and its leader, losing faith in themselves, destroying themselves, and subsequently rebuilding a perfect entity. In other words, Owlchemy Labs hated being Owlchemy Labs, but ended up with the most ideal, natural game yet.\n\nThe experience and emotions tied to playing Snuggle Truck are like witnessing the stillborn birth of a child while simultaneously having the opportunity to see her play in the afterlife on Imax. It's a game of sparking paradox. It's cacophonous yet tranquil, experimental yet familiar, foreign yet womb-like, spacious yet visceral, textured yet vaporous, awakening yet dreamlike, infinite yet two hours long. It will cleanse your brain of those little crustaceans of worries and inferior games clinging inside the fold of your gray matter. The harrowing sounds hit from unseen angles and emanate with inhuman genesis. When the headphones peel off, and it occurs that six men created this, it's clear that Owlchemy Labs must be the greatest developer alive, if not the best since you know who. Breathing people made this game! And you can't wait to dive back in and try to prove that wrong over and over.","January 13, 2014","true","0.1"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","1"

Over-sexualised women in today's videogames is what's ruining the industry, and this is a breath of fresh air from the otherwise disgusting misogynist priviledged men in our videogame world.\n\nSnuggle Truck is a gender-friendly game that I highly reccomend you let your children play, and even you play!\nGames need to be more like this game, long live Snuggle Truck.\n\n9.5/10","December 25, 2013","true","1.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Humanity's time on earth is fleeting and the vehicle with which we are transported on is the Earth. Snuggle Truck really teaches people how much work the Earth has to do to keep us from flying out of the back of itself and into space. Clearly it is using a lot of rocket powerups as only a net could hold billions of people back.

Found myself getting addicted.\n\nI will need to get my kids to get the harder levels completed for me LOL, I dont have the skillz.\n\nThis is actually called 'SMUGGLE TRUCK', description taken from the website;\n\nhttp://smuggletruck.com/\n\nSmuggle Truck was inspired by the frustration our friends have experienced in trying to immigrate to the United States. With such a troublesome issue being largely avoided in popular media, especially video games, we felt the best way to criticize it was with an interactive satire.\n\nIn Smuggle Truck, players are driving a truck with passengers in the back, bringing them over a fictional border. This idea originated as a result of learning that the process of legal immigration was not as straightforward as we had assumed. As we lived through a painful 12 months of our friend struggling through the absurd legal minefield that surrounds U.S. immigration, we felt that we should create a game that touches on the issue. The comment was thrown around that "it's so tough to legally immigrate to the U.S., it's almost easier to smuggle yourself over the border", and thus Smuggle Truck was born. A two-day prototype eventually turned into an iPhone game, with the plan to reach as many players as possible.\n\nThroughout the creation of the game, we maintained a meticulous eye to avoid depicting a specific stereotype or location, instead opting to generalize smuggling to its most basic abstract form. Through user testing and feedback from fellow developers and even random strangers, we worked to maintain a light and humorous representation of a subject that is normally avoided.\n\nWith a satirical angle on a real issue, we want to create a game that is fun to play but also stirs up discussion on ways to improve the problematic immigration system in the United States.\n\nC'mon STEAM where is the smuggle DLC?","January 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

On your travels you will encounter various obstacles and will have to overcome them with the various power-ups that you are provided with.\n\nSnuggle Truck's gameplay is decent, and can be challenging if the player wants to unlock all the medals the game has to offer. However the game has definitely lost character since its late production change from "Smuggle Truck" to "Snuggle Truck".  Rather than using a rundown pick-up truck to smuggle immigrants over the border you have to transport stuffed animals to a zoo in a similar fashion. In other words, they are both the same game.\n\nOverall, Snuggle Truck is an average game which has sadly had its unique concept ripped out from underneath it via censorship of Apple. Like many games of this nature it is great for those that are looking to lose a few minutes. I would recommend "Smuggle Truck" instead as I believe this is the game that Owlchemy Labs wanted their audience to experience.

You have two goals: get to the goal as quickly as possible, and keep as many stuffed animals in the back as possible. To complete the stages, you need to perform both tasks well enough, with more rewards for a speed run or a perfect run. I found it to be a lot of fun. Getting through the levels with both speed and grace is an entertaining challenge.\n\nThe truck controls decently well and the art is vibrant, though the sound is a ittle obnoxious. The game doesn't seem to have the same skill/strategy depth as Trials, but there is quite a lot to do, and getting through the harder levels can be very difficult. I found that this game is best played in short sessions (though, for later levels, a short session may not be enough time to accomplish much).\n\nIf Snuggle Truck looks at all interesting to you, it will be well worth your five dollars.","March 26, 2012","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You've got a truck, there are things to snuggle in it, and you've got to keep it that way. Unfortunately, the rest of the world seems out to prevent that, as harmless as it sounds. The bulk of the gameplay is managing the bounce of your plush toy cargo since you couldn't be bothered to invest in a net or a closed truck bed, which is surprisingly more fun than it initially seems.\n\nThe risk/reward balance of Snuggle Truck is such that the game becomes a great deal more engaging than you'd expect. The first few levels, you'll screw up a few times, but learn what bounces where and how to recover when it does. As things ramp up, however, you start actually caring a bit about how many snugglies you deliver, until the game sucks you in for more levels than you expected. It's not super deep, but it's enough to keep you going for a session. You can also try your hand at making levels if design is more your jam; there are already tons of them out there, so you'll never be at a shortage for things to complete.\n\nI'd say Snuggle Truck is worth it as a pick up and play title to keep tucked in your game library for downtime or when you need a good distraction. It's unlikely to rock your world, but it's hard to hate.","January 13","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
