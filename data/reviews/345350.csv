"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MIB2/recommended/345350/","MIB2","=(eGO)=™ MIB2","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MIB2/","838 products in account","Most of the reviews out there touch upon technical details of the PC port, leaving the substance of the game alone. I aim to fix that.\n\nFirst off, let me confirm everything you heard so far about the quality of the port itself - it's really the best one by far by Square Enix. It's smooth, it looks better than on consoles, there is a higher variety of visual options. The port includes all DLC and both English and Japanese audio.\n\nNow, let's move on to the reason I even decided to write this in the first place: the game itself.\nIs it good? In short: Very.\n\nAt this point, I've spent a little more than 6 hours in it, and I already feel like it managed to justify the price.\n\nThe story is pretty good so far, that said, it is very important that you play FF XIII and XIII-2 first, otherwise many many things will be lost on you.\n\nThe combat system is probably the most dynamic and player-inclusive in the FFXIII trilogy. It feels quite responsive and your own skill matters quite a lot.\n\nThe music is very good, unlike XIII-2. I am yet to find a piece that drives me nuts, like Unseen Intruders, which is a good sign.\n\nThe world is gigantic in this game, and it's very non-linear at that.\n\nNow, the dreaded time-limit. I understand that many of you hate the very idea of it, and I was one of you, but now that I tried it, I have to say: the feature is solid. The need for time-management grants the gameplay a sense of urgency and pacing that translates to you feeling on the edge. You experience something similar when you have a last sliver of health in games like Dark Souls. The tensions is exquisite. Completing quests in the game actually allows you to postpone the timelimit, which gives you very real insentive to be efficient. Every day at 6 AM (game time) you are returned to the hub area, and you can see your progress. Let me tell you, when you get there and see that all your actions were not in naught, all the tense gameplay of the day pays off tenfold.\n\nSo, yes, I do recommend this game, the only caveat being: "If you played XIII and XIII-2 first".\n\n9/10 so far. Will edit if my opinion changes.\n\nEdit #1.\n\n28 hours in. The gameplay is still solid, as is the music, however, I want to add some important things.\n\n1. The side quests are divided into two categories - normal ones that you find in the world and boring fetch quests that you find on special boards. Initially, this was ok, but now it seems somewhat repetitive, as I am running out of quests that don't descend into tedium.\n\n2. The culmination points for each story arc are mostly very good, but the build up to them can be somewhat lacking.\n\n3. The time limit is a joke now. I have 5 days left, and it seems I did most of the content available. This might be because I heavly used the game mechanic allowing you to briefly freeze the clock for special points you get form battles.\n\n4. That said, some of the achievements and many items, and even gameplay mechanichs, seem to only unlock on NG+.\n\n5. I like where the main story arc is going so far.\n\nRating: 8.5 because I hate fetch quests and pointless grinding.\n\nWill edit again, possibly.\n\nEdit #2\nBeat the game. 100% achievements. Took me 51 and a half hours. Final thoughts:\n\n1. The game stability is faulty in a certain large underground story-related location in the Dead Dunes. Aside from that spot, it ran smoothly.\n\n2. The main story arc did not disappoint.\n\n3. The game offers some surprisingly good end-game content, including the superbosses.\n\n4. The time limit IS a joke. I had 4 days with nothing to do towards the end of the game, so I just slept in the in-game inns.\n\n5. NG+ on Hard felt easier than NG on Normal. I'm still glad I picked Normal, it wasn't as hard as people say it is.\n\nFinal rating: 8.0-8.5. It was a solid game.","December 12, 2015","true","51.6"," 351 of 419 people (84%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","84","351","419","25","5"

It features a day/night cycle that dictate npc interactions and serves as a constant reminder of how much time has been spent. The story was mediocre and aimed too high. However the cinematic story rendering was fantastic and the voice acting was well done (English).\n\nSmall gripes I had with this game - Firstly I felt the day/night countdown timer really made players hardpressed to find efficient quest completion routes. If you are a relaxed and slow player like myself, you might not be able to progress far enough into the game to defeat the last boss. My second issue was with the characters and the actual story. I felt the storytelling in Snow's and Noel's storylines were languid. Their motivation in the game weren't realistic and didn't support their original actions against the protagonist. Lumina's behavour was also perplexing, her attitude flip-flopped and you couldn't tell when she was was lying or telling the truth. The story becomes even more unrelatable when you're forced to trust in something she says, given her history of messing with you.\nFinally the overarching story aimed too high and simply fell short of my expectations. The final boss and the the wrap-up all felt a little too forced as Lightning, storywise, was shown to be more impressive in comparison to the final boss, a notion that wasn't conveyed properly through the cinematics.\n\nHowever, despite these gripes, Lightning Returns does conclude the stories of FF13-1&2 in a meaningful satisfactory manner. 8/10. Pick this game up only if you've invested in the first two installments.","February 25","true","68.6"," 110 of 130 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","110","130","5","1"

The version I purchased here in North America included both English and Japanese voice options. The game also came packaged with a fairly decent amount of graphical options compared to the two previous installments.\n\nThe graphics options are as follows:\nDisplay Format (Choose between Windowed or Borderless fullscreen)\nDisplay Resolution (1920 x 1080, 1600 x 900, 1440 x 810, 1366 x 768, 1280 x 720)\nScale Display Area\nColour Correction\nGlare Adjustment\nDepth of Field Adjustment\nShadowing\nLighting\nTexture Filtering\nFrame Rate (Choose between fixed 30, or Dynamic 60)\n\nThe included DLC is very nice, but quite overpowered. It makes the boss battles super easy, so I advise using normal equipment if it's your first playthrough to avoid ruining the enjoyment of the game. I believe most of the DLC is included in the game as well, minus the Aerith garb.\n\nFinally, the performance of the game is pretty good on my end. I'm running a mostly smooth 60fps on the highest possible graphical settings. The framerate never drops below 60 in battles, and seemingly only drops in the open world when you're loading in a new area, or many new NPC at once. Even then, it only lasts for 1-2 seconds for me.\n\nAll in all, this game is a really good port. It's quite a step up from the previous two games in the series. Square Enix taking the extra time to release it made a large difference in the quality. It's an even larger step up from the console versions, and I would highly recommend any fans of the series to give this a go.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that Lightning Returns is a far superior experience overall.\n\nTo begin with, the world opens up fairly quickly, letting you explore four different hub areas and interact with the NPCs there, from vendors to quest givers, imbuing your character with a sense of freedom that was sorely lacking in XIII. The story is more focused, taking Lightning on a journey to save the souls of mankind before the world comes to an end, but building on that simple premise by adding layers of intrigue through the character of Lumina.\n\nAnother positive is how side quests are tied to this story (main is a given), as Lightning will have to undertake personal quests to save souls and learn a little bit more about herself in the process. Nevertheless, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Canvas of Prayers' quests that basically have you running around collecting materials for anonymous people.\n\nSince the world is coming to an end it makes sense that there's a ticking clock haunting your every step. At first glance this will undoubtedly come across as a huge negative but the game itself provides you with the means to stall that clock in a variety of ways. First, as you gather souls you collect something called Eradia, what can be used to add more days to the clock. Furthermore, you have an ability in-game called Chronostasis that will let you freeze the clock for thirty in-game minutes. If you're still doubtful, start on easy and you can pretty much forget about that clock. On the plus side, the passage of time allows the game to make the hub areas more dynamic; unlocking areas, vendors, quest givers, and even events, during specific times, building on the illusion that this is a living, breathing, world you're in.\n\nCombat reprises the XIII formula with the ATB system but enhances it via schematas. Schematas are essentially builds you can create comprised of garbs, weapons, accessories, and abilities. During battle you can switch between three different schematas, each with its own ATB bar, what gives you more leeway when dealing with a variety of enemies. Furthermore, both abilities and weapons can be upgraded throughout the game, though the latter only on NG+.\n\nIf it helps, I found myself sinking a lot of time into this game without even realizing it. What impressed me the most, personally, was its gripping story and actually interesting and relevant side quests. You also don't need to have played the previous games to enjoy or even understand what's going on in this one as the game does a pretty good job of laying out the background. Ironically, Lightning Returns is, to my mind, a much better entry point than XIII ever was. The ending can be a bit confusing, I'll give you that, and does have a Return of the King-esque feeling to it, but I found it immensely satisfying.\n\nSo, if you want to get into Final Fantasy in general, or the Lightning Trilogy in particular, give Lightning Returns a shot. Like me, it could be the game you were looking for.","December 28, 2015","true","46.3"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","63","71","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/adnqt/recommended/345350/","adnqt","zao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/adnqt/","222 products in account","This is a very tough negative review for me to write, because Lightning Returns does so many things right but it also narrowly misses on some very important things.\n\nLightning Returns succeeds on every technical level.  The graphics are gorgeous, the music is good, and LR has received the best PC port of any Square Enix game to date. It runs flawlessly and even has full Japanese interface available for bilinguals like myself. It is by all means an excellent game on many fronts, and a drastic improvement over its predecessors.\n\nThat said, Lightning Returns is direly lacking in both story and gameplay depth. Let's start with the story: It is quite simply eye-rollingly bad. Almost every single line of dialogue is hopelessly contrived at best and laughable at worst. In the interest of avoiding spoilers I'm not going to go too far into details, but my eyes start to glaze over when the major characters are all constantly making melodramatic monologues about how they've been lovesick for 500 years.\n\nTo make matters worse, everyone's problems that they've been dealing with for 500(!!) years are MAGICALLY resolved by Lightning Ex Machina because all it takes is a 10 minute chat with Lightning and maybe a fight or two and all 500-year-long issues are instantly resolved. There is no nice way of saying it: it's awful writing that makes Lightning come dangerously close to Mary Sue territory. Which is a real shame because I love Lightning and she has some genuinely great moments.\n\nAnother massive issue is that the game is very short. Imagine my surprise when I checked a FAQ to see my progress about 10 hours in and discovered I was over 40% done with the main quest. The main story is astonishingly short and then you're supposed to spend the rest of the time running around doing random side quests before the final boss.\n\nThen there's the battle system. At first blush it seems quite engaging and deep but the problem is that this is actually a massive façade. There is in reality very little strategy or depth to the system at all. I kept waiting for them to introduce new elements that mix it up or keep things interesting but it pretty much stays the same way through the entire game, and that boils down to this:\n\nA) Read stagger conditions/try to stagger the enemy\nB) Block when they attack\n\nThat's literally it. Stagger conditions and weaknesses vary depending on the enemy but for the massive majority of the game you can get by just spamming whatever and blocking occasionally and you will be fine. I really feel like if the player had been given FULL control of Lightning in battle instead of very limited control that it could have introduced a new dimension of depth to the game that would have kept it feeling fresh.\n\nOverall I have to say though that Lightning Returns is a beautiful game that does so many things right but falls tragically short of being a great game. It may be the right game for someone else, but it just left me wanting more.\n\n\n","January 3","false","12.6"," 90 of 114 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","90","114","2","3"

PC players will remember the multitude of crashes that pestered XIII and XIII-2. I played this game on the PS3 and loved it, clocking over 200 hours on it.\n\nAll core gameplay remains the same, and Square Enix has rather generously given access to all DLC except the Aerith set. You're really not losing out on anything special. Outerworld has been disabled on the Steam port, making it potentially more difficult for PC players as they can't get Turbo Ethers and Ethers off random NPCs. As mentioned before, DLC does make up for this by providing fairly overpowered equipment. If you want to experience the game with some challenge, try not to use Yuna's Summoner Garb and Cloud's Soldier 1st Class.\n\nI hate the fact that you can't truly customize your key assignments. This port forces you to bind keys to the PS3/Xbox configuration, such that Jump/O/A. Full customization of FFXIII and XIII-2 was possible. Why not here? This is arguably more important for LR, where button preses are even more important than past games. If you don't have a Numpad, you're going to find it difficult to find space to bind keys into a comfortable configuration.\n\nFirst, some background. Lightning has awoken from crystal stasis 500 years after Chaos flooded the world. When Chaos flooded the world, it had the side effect of stopping humans from aging. Humans did not age, and thus no longer died of old age. They could, however, still be killed by monsters, or die of disease. Lightning was awoken by God, Bhunivelze, to be the saviour. Her duty is to save souls from the remnants of the world so that they can be reborn in the new world that Bhunivelze is creating. Lightning has 13 Days to fulfill her duty before the world ends.\n\nNow let's address the content. Lightning Returns is completely unchanged from the PS3/Xbox version. So let's look at some of the graphics: The NPCs don't look great, the dogs look horrendous. However, the environments bring across each individual theme well. Lightning, however, is of course well animated, although there's some visible tearing in her hair when Lightning touches the crest on her chest where her L'cie mark used to be.\n\nStory: One of the main issues with this particular installment of Lightning Returns is the terrible English translation which ends up contradicting itself. The English localisation does not differentiate between 'Heart' (Kokoro) and 'Soul' (Tamashi). This is a key point of contention within the mythos, and has to be cleared up. As a result, I highly recommend having audio in Japanese and reading the English subtitles. However, always keep an ear out for the above two Japanese terms, 'Kokoro' and 'Tamashi', as the English translation makes no distinction between the two.\n\nCharacters: One of the most obvious problems since XIII has been the bland, one dimensional characters. While we may be tempted to continue the bashing, there actually is justification for a one-dimensional character this time around. Imagine if you've lived for 500 years with no true end in sight. No new lives are being born, and death is common. Nothing changes. You'd be depressed too. Each character has their own motivations, but they all end up the same. "I'm in despair, Lightning, save me whether I like it or not." It is bland, and this time, understandably so.\n\nGameplay: I'm going to be breaking the gameplay down into 3 parts, Adventure, Time Limit, and Combat.\n\nAdventure: Lightning Returns gives you four fairly large regions to explore. In each region, you'll need to clear a Main Quest, and do a fetch quest for the 5th Main Quest. The rest of the Side Quests are fairly simple fetch quests, which tends to be boring more often than not. The mythos is well fleshed out, however, and you'll finally understand what the hell is going on when you clear Main Quest 4. But as with non-linear stories, depending on the order in which you choose to clear the Main Quests, you may find yourself confused at one point because you may not have the context of XIII or XIII-2 to back up your knowledge.\n\nMonsters are in limited quantity, as befitting a game where the world is ending. Large scale enemies like Zaltys and Zomok have a population of 30, meaning there are only 30 of them in the game. Monsters do NOT give experience upon defeating them. Instead, stats are given as quest rewards. Basically, the more souls you save, the stronger Lightning becomes.\n\nTime Limit: Take it from a player who has over 200 hours into the PS3 version of this, there's more than enough time to do everything. The clock DOES dictate some actions. Some NPCs require you to report to them at a certain time of the day to advance a quest, and some quests are time-sensitive, meaning if you don't fulfill the requirement about visiting them the 'next' day, you fail the quest. You are going to have to keep track of things, so it is recommended to clear Side Quests city by city. As the days pass, monsters also get stronger and drop better abilities. Thus, please don't hunt them to extinction within the first few days. Take your time.\n\nYou start with 7 days, and you extend time as you complete the five main quests to a maximum of 12 days before the Final Day arrives. If you complete enough side quests, you unlock a bonus dungeon and a bonus day for a grand total of 14 days.\n\nPersonally, I like the time limit. XIII and XIII-2 had themes about time. The party of six in XIII were counting down the days till they turned into C'ieth. Serah was counting down time as well. Lightning Returns makes it literal, forcing it into your face, "TIME IS PRECIOUS", and you only have THIRTEEN DAYS to save the world.\n\nCombat: This is where Lightning Returns shines. Unlike XIII and XIII-2, where Auto-Battle was your main option, Lightning Returns has a very immersive combat system, and is extremely customizable. Think of Lightning Returns as more of an Action JRPG than the traditional turn based JRPG. The Stagger system makes a return, although it's not as necessary as it was before in XIII and XIII-2 for normal encounters. Do note that for Boss encounters, you are expected to know how to Stagger the enemy, so build up your knowledge on normal encounters, and check the Bestiary regularly.\n\nYou control Lightning; ;her equipment, every movement, every Guard, every attack. Both your strategy in setting up Lightning's loadout and your execution of your strategy is extremely important, and this is what makes combat in Lightning Returns so satisfying when you are successful. However, inversely, every failed fight is also the fault of the player. Not Guarding, or not reading the Bestiary to find out stagger conditions is a recipe for failure. There is good news, though. Tons of players before you have beaten this game, so if you need an active demonstration, Youtube is an excellent teacher. Unlike old Final Fantasy games, stat grinding doesn't win fights. Execution of your strategy does. Keep that in mind.\n\nSummary: While the characters are justifiably one dimensional, the story itself is actually fairly decent as the mythos of this series of worlds is finally explained in greater detail. This is, however, let down by a bad English translation (I'm running on the assumption that most people speak English here...), which makes the story seem self-contradictory. As mentioned above, it is recommended to play with Japanese audio and whatever language you prefer.\n\nThe combat system shines. I would really love to see a combat system similar to this in the future, but with hopefully more customization of Locked Abilities. However, for new players, the learning curve might be fairly steep especially if you run into an encounter you're not prepared for. All I can say is, keep at it.\n\nWhile I do recommend this, I can't give this game a really high score because of the HUGE GLARING FLAW in translation, which is integral to storytelling. 7/10.","December 13, 2015","true","110.4"," 125 of 174 people (72%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","72","125","174","5","2"

The artwork is killer, the gameplay mechanics come across quickly while having major depth, the story team really found their groove with wrapping up the mythos, and everything is polished to a mirror-shine - it's all top shelf craft.\n\nThere's nothing to have a problem with there.\n\n...and the game is a HUGE improvement over its predecessors. The environments are expansive and free-roaming from the beginning, and the emotional core is handled far better. Yes, it really is a bunch of fetch quests, yet it all manages to contextualize itself in a motivating way. Not everything is directly tied in with the main plot, of course, but everything does manage to feed into the main plot. The "just a bunch of random stuff going on" problem is NOT in play here, which is a welcome upgrade from "XIII-2."\n\nSo, why did I hate the game at first?\n\nThe theme of the game is time, and the race against it. This is already a bit of a precarious thing when it comes to a Final Fantasy title, where the "Take Your Time" trope has been essentially baked-in since the 8-bit era. The experience of racing the clock gets downright VICIOUS in "Lightning Returns," because of how everything seems to pile on.\n\nTo start, battle is a tough business in the early game, and battle is still central to getting anything done. Fighting is also clearly tied to the central "time" theme, with getting the rhythm of the encounter exactly right being very important. The thing is, getting the rhythm exactly right is extremely difficult. The window for getting a "perfect guard" (where you take no damage) is very small, and the enemies hit hard. The window for getting enhanced attacks is even smaller - so small that I gave up on it almost immediately. (To be fair, it doesn't seem that enhanced attacks are really core to successful gameplay.)\n\nFurther adding to the difficulty of battle is the way resource management works. You start out with a very limited stack of carryable restoration items, and a similarly shallow pool of EP. Your EP is sort of your "safety net," because you can cast curative magic from it. Where things get hairy is that EP is also your pool for attacking powerfully, and for all practical purposes, you can NOT restore EP with your item inventory. (There are ethers in the game, but they are as rare as megalixirs were in other titles.) You restore EP by winning battles, but winning battles can be quite pyrrhic: A difficult encounter can burn through all your items and all your EP, leaving you with nothing in reserve for the next face-off.\n\nYou have to fight to progress, but fighting is actually pretty dangerous.\n\nIf you get into a really tight spot, you can escape from a battle and get your used items back, but escape costs some of your limited time.\n\nAll this creates a nasty ball of frustration, especially at the beginning of the game. You don't really have a handle on how long things are going to take to do, so you don't know if you're taking too long to do them, There's no indication of exactly how much is required to extend the world's time, and the go-where-you-want nature of the game means that you can waste precious hours in finding out that you're just not ready for a major encounter. (The only way to find out is the hard way.) If you're like me, you end up being very tense about everything that doesn't go well, because running out of time means starting over. From the beginning of the game. (!)\n\nAs a motivator and tension builder, it's incredibly effective. It can also be not very fun.\n\nThe good news is that things get a lot better as Lightning strengthens. As that happens, and you get some wins, the tension begins to ease. That's when you can really start to appreciate just how tightly woven the whole thing is. I might even go so far as to call the game a masterpiece of interlocking mechanics.\n\nA pretty darn difficult masterpiece, but still.\n\nWhen you do "find the groove," you'll have many hours of enjoyable questing in the world. You'll even get good at the time-management aspects.\n\nSo, why did I give up at the very end (literally, at the final stage of the final battle)?\n\n"Lightning Returns" ended up doing what the other games in the "Fabula Nova Crystallis" series did: The end boss is essentially a puzzle that is not solved in ways that have worked for the rest of the game. If you try to solve the puzzle the wrong way, you encounter a near-vertical difficulty spike. You can have progressed diligently through the whole of the quest, finding a setup that works for you, and then "bang," the setup stops working.\n\nThis title, much of the time, has your character on a solitary journey. To give Lightning the necessary versatility to survive, she's equipped with "schemata," or battle setups that allow her to switch "jobs" instantly. The thing is that it's easy to start leaning heavily on say, physical attacks. It's a bread-and-butter configuration that actually can end up being very effective - right up until the tail-tail-tail-end of the game.\n\nI finally survived the other stages of the final encounter, and suddenly noticed that my attacks were doing almost no damage...on an opponent with over a million HP! I went back, tried switching things up, couldn't repeat my previous success, tried again, got beaten into the ground, and finally said:\n\n"Forget it. I could win the stupid game if I was willing to have a three-day fight with this thing. I'm going to find the ending on YouTube."\n\nOther people have, of course, legitimately seen the quest through to the actual end, but I was done. I play games to enjoy myself, not to be frustrated by trying every combination of character configurations.\n\nLike I said earlier, though, this game is really well made. It seems to be the perfect capstone to the series, even if I really disliked parts of it. If you've played the others in the series, be sure to play this. I don't think you'll be disappointed, but you may grind your teeth a lot...","April 30","true","56.2"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","35","37","0","0"

(this is subjective)\n\nI hope square continues to improve on thier games. As to the render situation, 1080p is still the norm and 4k isn't standard yet for many but pc gamers needs entitlement so I threw it into the con. Not everyone has 3 titan X or 980s yet but pretty soon it should be the norm to have 4k in every game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DespairAndFear/recommended/345350/","DespairAndFear","Senpai Edition","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DespairAndFear/","766 products in account","Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (ライトニング リターンズ ファイナルファンタジーXIII) is action role-playing video game developed and published by Square Enix. The game is a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XIII-2, concludes the storyline of Final Fantasy XIII, and forms part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries. Lightning Returns employs a highly revamped version of the gameplay system from the previous two games, with an action-oriented battle system, the ability to customize the player character's outfits, and a time limit the player must extend by completing story missions and side quests.\n\nThe game's story takes place five hundred years after the previous game's ending. Lightning, the main protagonist of the first game and a key character in the second, awakes from a self-imposed hibernation 13 days before the world's end, and is chosen by the deity Bhunivelze to save the people of the dying world, including former friends and allies who have developed heavy emotional burdens. As she travels, she learns the full truth behind both the world's fate and Bhunivelze's true agenda.\n\n( Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Returns:_Final_Fantasy_XIII )\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is a wonderful game. The story of the game is interesting. If you enjoyed the previous FFXIII games, when you will enjoy this one too. As always the final boss is a God and he is pretty tough opponent. The ending is beautiful and Lightning's smile is especially heartwarming. In game the time is limited and at first I felt like I have to rush all the time, but little by little I felt more comfortable with the clock and the good thing is that the time can be extended. Story missions are quite good and while the story develops further, you will be able to meet game characters from the previous FFXIII games. I like that the side quests has their own little stories and it doesn't feel like it's a 'hollow' quest. Some side quests are directly connected to the main story. There are also Canvas Of Prayers quest that are kind of boring. Those quests are 'hollow'. Basically you only have to defeat monsters and bring back the stuff. The music is very beautiful and fitting to the mood of the game. The visuals are nice and the style of surounding is sweet.\n\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII has a lot of freedom compared to the previous games. The map is quite big and to complete the story you don't have to complete the quests from 1 to 5. The point is that the order doesn't matter. Another good thing is that there are a few ways to travel form one point to another. You can use trains, teleport and ride chocobo in one of the regions. When the game will be completed, the new feature will be unlocked. It's New Game +. As in most games the character's stats will be the same, new difficulty will be unlocked. Also it will be possible to upgrade your weapons. The interesting thing is that if you decide to figh a boss in early days, thIs boss will have one form, while if in the next playtrough you decide to fight the same boss in the end, this boss will look differently and also he will be stronger. Instead of Paradigm fighting system this game has a new system called Schemata. Lightning will be able to change her costumes while fighting the enemy. The thing is that this power reminds me of Erza's Requip Magic from Fairy Tail. One more different thing is that in the battle recovery items are very limited and it makes the game a bit more challenging. Most of the time you will be fighting alone, but at some points you will be able to fight together with chocobo and Fang. The controls are good. I played with Xbox controller and it was very comfortable.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII has 6 playable characters and each of them has 1 costume. Final Fantasy XIII-2 has 3 playable characters. 2 of them has 4 costumes and the other one has only 1 costume. Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII has 1 playable character and she has over 80 costumes. Well that escalated quickly. In game costumes are called garbs. These garbs have different stats and the colors can be customized. There are also DLC garbs. To unlock them you have to go to settings and enable it. DLC containts costumes from FFVII, FFX-2 and FFXIII games. Also there is costume from Tomb Raider. Some garbs are very sexy, others are badass and some are just adorable. To make your character a bit more stylish you will be able to choose from a lot of adornments. Also I like that the variety of weapons is very big.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=646008014\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=644818529\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=644394857\n\nTo sum up I can say that Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is one of the best JRPGs on steam. I really enjoyed the game and I think that game's price is pretty good compared to the quality of the game you get. If you are a fan of Final Fantasy games, when you should get this game even for a full price.\n\nFor me this is the best game I have played so far.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/DespairAndFear/recommended/292120/","March 16","true","123.7"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/345350/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","As most of the other reviews have mentioned, this port is pretty good in terms of performance compared to the previous two games in the series. It runs better and looks better, and though people with higher-end monitors might be disappointed with the 1080p/60fps limit (I personally have a 144hz monitor so it's a bit of a downer), it's nothing worth complaining about in my opinion. I am, however, disappointed by the fact that there are no mouse controls, at all. Why they waited for the third game to remove them is beyond me, but the game is a mess to play unless you have a gamepad to the point that if you don't have a gamepad you may as well stop reading here. The game also requires you to activate the Steam Cloud in order to play, which doubles as more-or-less of an always online requirement, which may bother some people. I found this annoying because I really don't like using the half-baked feature that is the Steam Cloud, but not enough to prevent me from playing.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Lightning Returns is a pretty dramatically different game from its predecessors in a lot of ways, with the big one being that the world is ending in 13 days. Rather than just being a plot point, this is an actual timer in the game, similar to Dead Rising. The actual timer itself only counts down six days, and you have to extend the clock by doing side quests and helping others pass on into the next world until the full 13 days have passed. The timer isn't enough of a threat for me to imagine anyone being turned off by it, and if you manage your time well you'll still have plenty of exploration time, but it does add a nice pressure to it that gives the game a unique feeling. If you don't manage to do everything the first time, there is a New Game+ option, which gives the slower or more thorough players a chance to see everything the game has to offer as well. The game is full of quests, both main ones and side ones, and even the main quests can be tackled in any order due to the game being a fully open world from the start, with the only limitation being the tougher monsters in certain areas. Monsters can be killed to the point of extinction, discouraging farming and encouraging you to fight for your right to have a peaceful nature hike through the Jagd Woods or even just kill every monster on the planet if you're feeling particularly full of determination. The overall frame of the game sort of feels like a less forgiving Majora's Mask, and while a lot of people seem to be against it I really like this system.\n\nThe other big difference is the combat. The combat is now far more action-oriented; you don't move around much, but there are no turns, and instead of controlling a party you control Lightning alone and swap between 3 outfits, each with 4 attacks you can assign. The new system feels both smoother and faster, and you get in and out of small fights a lot faster due to the lack of unnecessarily long intros and outros. The same tactics from the previous games are all here, but now they feel more active, with many things requiring timing and strategy to do instead of just choosing the same attack order every turn. This is all aided by the fact that there's no longer a leveling system, removing the urge to grind entirely and allowing you to actually fight because you want to fight something instead of fighting everything because you need the experience. You upgrade your equipment instead, through various methods such as combining spells to increase their power or changing outfits with different stats.\n\nThe story is where Lightning Returns falters somewhat. The game only introduces one new character, and the returning characters get painfully little time to do much of anything except for Hope, who serves as your guide. The main quest itself is pretty shallow, and instead the game focuses primarily on the content of the side quests, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since a fair amount of them are pretty interesting in their own right, but it's a shame that the characters they spent two games buildling up get more or less sidelined for the grand finale, with some of my favorites being outright benched and getting less than a minute or two of total screentime. The overall plotline isn't bad by any means, but I just didn't find it as interesting as XIII-2, and I felt like they could've done more with the returning cast to make the end of this series more exciting.\n\nOverall, Lightning Returns is a pretty great game and mechanically my favorite in the series by far, and even though there's plenty of room for improvement it's already worth playing in its own right. If the port woes don't scare you away, there's no reason not to finish the series if you're already this deep into the XIII trilogy.","December 15, 2015","true","54.3"," 60 of 87 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","60","87","3","0"

Lightning Returns has run pretty much flawlessly, and I assume Square Enix put more effort into this port.\n\nThe game is set roughly 500 years after the events of XIII-2, where Lightning is brought back to save the world. Lightning is the sole character you get to play as, though you get a couple of party members for certain areas during the course of the story. The story mainly revolves around Lightning saving the souls of the people that are left, and using this to lengthen the time the world has left, as well as strengthen herself.\n\nLike the previous games, theres a system quite similar to paradigms, though in this one they're called "Schemata". These schemata are based around different garbs that Lightning collects and wears, each having different stats and giving certain advantages (i.e. giving different values for Strength and Magic, ATB speed etc). You also collect different weapons, shields and tokens which give certain benefits (again, Strength, Magic etc) so you use these to benefit different situations. Unlike paradigms, abilities aren't confined to certain schemata (for example, you could use Fire with Guard or Attack).\n\nCombat has also been changed for this game. Lightning still makes use of an ATB gauge during the battle, though each of her different Schemata has an independant ATB gauge that refills at different rates. Each schemata is limited to four abilities, which the player chooses (though certain garbs come with abilities that can't be changed). Unlike the other games, you don't "lock in" the abilities that you're using and pick which enemy to use them on. If you're using an Xbox 360 controller (which I am), you can use each of your four abilities using either A, X, Y or B, and targets can be changed using the D-Pad. Guard abilities (Mediguard, Heavy Guard etc) play an important part of combat. As well as reducing damage, guarding precisely at the point when Lightning is struck can (most of the time) completely negate damage. Guarding also plays a role in staggering foes (more below). Lightning can also be moved around the battlefield (albeit slowly), though the effect this has on combat is almost negligible in most situations.\n\nStaggering is still important in combat. Most enemies have different conditions for stagger, which can be viewed at any time during the battle if Lightning has either staggered them using this condition, or has bought notes that give her strategies for different enemies. Certain abilities increase an enemy's stagger percentage (like Ravager abilities, Fire etc), and others can maintain the stagger (like Ruin). Certain enemies can also be staggered by guarding their attacks at the precise moment they strike. Personally, I feel that staggering is more strategic in this game, as with many strong enemies they can only be staggered during certain situations (spamming magic abilities won't always work).\n\nSo, most importantly, the main storyline and quests in this game are far different than its predecessors. There are four areas, each with their own Main Quests which Lightning must complete to progress through the storyline. These areas are also littered with Side Quests, which, arguably, are just as necessary for completing the game, as every quest completed will increase Lightning's various stats, as well as increase the size of her ATB gauge and recovery item capacity. The quests can range from finding different items, killing enemies or returning to a quest giver on sequential days. The game also features a day/night cycle, where different areas can be accessed at different times, and certain quest givers will only be available during certain times.\n\nSo, my personal Pros/Cons:\n\nPros\n- Combat is much more "active" in this game, not that I didn't enjoy it in the previous games\n- The Story, for the most part, I enjoyed, though it can get a bit cheesy\n- Choosing schemata for combat requires strategy and planning\n- A wide range of garbs, weapons and shields are available, which allow plenty of customization for different roles and situations.\n- Many, many side quests, which could get tiresome for some people, but I personally enjoyed finding and completing them\n- The return of some old friends\n\nCons\n- Some enemies are ridiculously hard if you don't have impeccable timing and planning\n- Most enemies can be made "extinct" in the game if they are grinded enough. Once enough of them are killed, a "Last One" variant of an enemy will appear which is more powerful than regular enemies and will drop an item. Grinding these can be very time consuming and boring, and unfortunately killing all of them is required for an achievement, though grinding is not entirely necessary depending on how much time you have by the end.\n- Very rare FPS drops\n- Some garbs look absolutely awful\n\nEDIT:\nI've also read that your computer must be connected to the Internet while playing the game (something to do with cloud saving), which is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but if your computer is always connected like mine is, it shouldn't be a problem.","January 1","true","79.0"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","18","20","2","0"

It is up to our old pal Lightning to save the day (or is it days?)\nLightning, who slumbered for 500 years is awakened by the god of light Bhunivelze. The world isn't like she hoped it would be, the people are stuck in a world ruled by chaos, they do not age, but they are still able to die from diseases. Bhunivelze gives Lighning the task and power to save their souls so that they can be born again on a new world created by the almighty god of light. Lightning seeing her efforts were in vain sets foot again on a quest to save her sister Serah.\nShe soon meets her old partner Snow, who knows she's sent by god and isn't so willingy to hand over his soul and questions Lightning's beliefs. So, after a little fight Lightning retreats, while so she meets a mysterious young girl named Lumina who only she can see and hear, her role in this story very important and and she frequently shows up to help Lightning, in her own mischief ways and remind her what she's fighting for. Who Lumina really is, is something that you can find out pretty early if you use your wits. Lightning herself will stay dumbstruck till the end of the game and when she finally figures it out you get a relieved satisfactory feeling.\nLightning will meet many of her old friends on her journy to save the souls, some want to fight her, one just doesn't give one f*** and others welcome her with open arms! Lightning helps them get a hold of themselves by helping out with serious troubles, something they couldn't figure out on their own. Which brings me to something I noticed. There are quests that involve a children who lost their things, one lost her stuffed animal, another lost his ball. In both instances the belongings are literally 30 feet away from them and family disputes which could easily be solved by talking to each other, but instead it took a middle woman a.k.a. Lightning to go back and forth delivering messages. Wheter these people got realy lazy because of the chaos or if it was the developers who couldn't come up with better quests will be a question I don't know how to answer.\n\nSo far, there aren't too many main quest, you can finnish these quite fast. The game revolves about a timed based kind of gameplay. The world as we know it will end in a couple of days and it is Lightning's task to save as many souls before they are lost forever. In order to save people's souls Lightning has to help these troubled people across the world, which usually  translate to fetch quests and defeat xx number of enemies or talk to a person. Completing these quests mostly end up in a follow up quests. Once you successfully complete a quest you will be awarded xp and unique items and the person's soul. At 6AM the day is over and you will return to "The Ark", here you will drop the souls into a gigantic flower named Yggdrasil, the more souls you put in the more it will grow and by giving many souls, you will be granted extra days. You will also find some useful items here and you can fight previously fought bosses for idk, better score? Oh, and there's Hope who you can talk to and replenish items. Anyways...\n\nAs you explore huge fields and cities, finding people who are in need of your help, time keeps on ticking and boy does it tick fast! Like, two seconds in real life equals one minute on the clock. Now this can be countermeasured with a skill named chronostasis, this skill will cost the player 1 EP. EP which is from a special meter that fills up from defeating monsters, the stronger the monster, the faster you build up your EP meter. Chronostasis will only last about a minute, but recharging just one point of the EP meter will take quite some time and most of the time you use it, there won't be strong monsters around, so it makes this skill totally impractical. Personally, I think they did the whole time constraint thing better in FFXIII-2, since you could just travel through time via the Historia Crux, why the Ark doesn't work this way? Beats me. I am not sure what they were thinking. I wish time would only advance when you completed a quest or that the clock didn't tick so quickly. Fortunately I found an easy mod to stop the clock for good.\n\nWhich brings me to the combat. The combat in this game involves Lightning switching between three active roles which all have a matching costume (garb), hp and atb, that last one is very important, because it's the feul in a well oiled machine! The idea is to equip three garbs and balane them in a way that gives you the upper hand in battle. For instance, you come across enemies that are weak to ice, but strong to fire attacks. Each costume has four slots, usually they have one or two occupied slots, so you choose a garb that has the skills you need and fill up the rest of the slots with attack, defensive and debilitating skills, you then switch between switch between garbs during battle to attack relentlessly. Come across different enemies? No problem, you can save your setup to extra slots and equip a whole new garb + skills without overwriting your old setup. Defeating monsters reward you with skills that you can then equip and fight with. You can obtain unique garbs from shops and completing quests. A fun way to make up for just controlling one character throughout mostly of the game. If there is one garb I can recommend, the FFX Yuna garb is extremely powerfull, I used this garb till late end game.\n\nThere are a handful beautiful locations you visit, from a town with little restaurants and terraces, a field with windmills and in the distance a view of something that resembles a city of modern day skyscrapers, a forest so huge that it is easy to lose your bearings, to a desert where the most fun you can have there is sand surfing!\nAll the areas look really amazing and are rendered with a pretty smooth 60 fps, which is a nice job. The only time the fps drops is when passing through obvious load areas, which is a bit of a let down, but since you run right past it, it doesn't really hinder the experience.\nThe sounds in this game are alright,  in the huge city Yusnaan there are street artist who play memorable final fantasy songs on their instruments which is really cool and the background music is really nice, because there are different tracks that play depending on what time it is, so no happy joy joy festval music at 6am in the morning, just a nice mix of synths and piano and at night you will something jazzy. The voice acting is done beautiful, I actually prefer the english dub because I got so used to hear Ali Hillis's soothing voice. The japanese voice actress who sounds also great and fitting to the character is just missing that little bit of uniqueness. Although the voice cast sounds great, the sound editing crew did a poor job of making everything sound in place, so when you are located e.g. in a church, the voice acting will sound like they are in a studio talking through some really expensive equipment. No biggy.\nThe world feels alive, with people doing their thing like, doing the laundry, moving boxes around, run when they see you run, petting animals, walking in between you and the npc, pushing them 30 feet away from you, you know the usual thing.\nGraphics are quite good, but there are definitally moments where you will see some really low res textures and npcs and animals look like they were transferred from a PS2 game, but that didn't bother me very much.\nUltimately, would I recommend this game? If you like to find out wha happen with Serah or if you just like Lightning and the fanservice, then yes, otherwise no. it's a fun game that you can play for a while and then pick it back up couple days later. this is not like other jrpgs where you have tons of interaction between the characters and just enjoy it so much that you forget about the time.","February 9","true","34.7"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","44","67","4","0"

As I was expecting, Nova Chrysalia got my heart. Lightning Returns is a true open world Final Fantasy with places to explore and a bunch of content to keep the player entertained. At first I thought the time limit would drive me mad, but it turns out I was able to explore, run side quests and follow with the storyline smoothly without having to worry about how much time I had left. As someone who enjoyed the story and atmosphere of XIII, however, I was again disappointed at the sequel. I feel like LR could've been its own thing instead of a sequel since its story feels completely unrelated to XIII (it is instead an epilogue to XIII-2, which also felt like it could've been its own thing) and revisiting the characters doesn't strike the possibly intended feelings. I recently started to really understand the atmosphere and I think now it works very well. It's still not the feeling I liked from XIII, but it's done right. After rubbing shoulders with Vanille for a little while I realized that the characters we encounter from other games are distant bc that's just how relationships work over time. People drift apart and I can't possibly imagine how distant from people I know I'd be after 500 years.\n\nOther than my beef with the atmosphere, it's a very polished game well worth the price if you're looking for an open world RPG with a considerable amount of content. Gorgeous designs, polished mechanics and runs smoothly enough. Steam cloud being used as a DRM doesn't bother me cos Steam is a DRM itself and my internet is always on, so I never even saw the initial message regarding the system. I do hope Square Enix changes that and I understand people who are offended by that, but at the same time I don't have personal problems with it.","December 12, 2015","true","154.3"," 52 of 83 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","52","83","0","0"

I think a second in real time is a minute in game time. Some people like this features and others don't, I am mixed about it. It adds to the story and immersion which is good, but I hate feeling like I have to play the game a certain way, like I'm forced to do things in specific way; I feel restricted.

Gran Pulse was invited to a picnic, but was given nothing but ♥♥♥♥ sandwiches. All that's left of the world now is Nova Chrysalia, four continents inhabited by humans who have lost their "time". Children never grow up, adults never grow old, and the seniors... they just keep being old. For 500 years the last remnants of humanity have endured, but it's all coming to a close. The world is ending in 13 days, and no I'm not talking in JRPG days. The clock is ticking, and only a Goddess can save everyone's souls. Lightning has returned to settle this mess once and for all.\n\nAs with the previous game (FF13-2), Lightning Returns is a major departure from the first entry, yet it carries over many of the sub-systems and combat-design. It's a decidedly different adventure, with its emphasis on open-world exploration, and stat-building tied almost entirely to quests, but the elements of familiarity keep everything somewhat grounded. The battle-system still revolves around the number 3. Lightning can equip three schematas aka outfits. Each set of clothes has different stats or abilities tied to them. These schemata are customized further with abilities you acquire from monsters or treasure.\n\nBattles are entirely real-time, and you're given far more agency than previous FF titles. By switching between the three schemata, you'll account for every possible situation. You can even deflect large amounts of damage with a perfectly-timed block. Unlike a number of JRPGs, high stats tend to take a back-seat to planning, strategies, and reflexes. Lightning also has access to a handful of EP skills. These powerful abilities can really turn the tide. All in all, the battle-system in this game is excellent. It really feels like the culmination of all of the ideas Square-Enix has implemented throughout the FF series.\n\nThe rest of the game is more interesting in concept than execution. As with most open-world games, there are a lot of side-quests. These side-quests usually involve fetching items, or finding people to converse with. This means you'll be spending a ton of time just running around. The in-game timer isn't too much of a worry, especially on the easy setting, because you can just spam chronostasis to stop the clock. However, your real-world time is going to be rather dull and annoying. I won't lie, I used a guide to locate all of the quest-giving NPCs. There was no way I was going to run circles around every continent just to find people.\n\nIt's too bad really, because there is a subtle cleverness to NPC interactions in this game. As with previous FF-13 games, most of the NPCs don't really have anything to say, aside from sharing their opinion on Lightning's current outfit. What is this? Skyrim? Maybe the guards will ask Lightning to conjure them up a nice warm bed next. Anyway, almost all of the interesting NPCs have ??? marks over their head. This is what catches the player's curiousity. Sometimes these NPCs can't be talked to at first, so the player will think: "Hmm... I'll have to keep them in mind in the future." When using a guide, all of the mystery is lost, since you'll know where to go, when to arrive there, and how to go about accomplishing the task you're given.\n\nWhile there's a heavy amount of combat in Lightning Returns, there are actually very few bosses. This is disappointing for a number of reasons. Due to the constant fighting, you'll figure out the strategy for every monster, and get lulled into a sense of complacency. Unfortunately, this means you'll be ill-prepared for the few major encounters, which are varied and immensely thrilling. In keeping with LR being a "send-off" for FF13, you'll face "Last Ones". Ever see that Jet Li movie The One? Same concept. When a monster is hunted to near-extinction, the Last One gains the power of all the others that had died before it. Some of these Last Ones can be really tough, especially when fought near the very end of the game. The problem is that you either have to grind away, or face them all in a gauntlet. I tried to do a bit of both, and it led to boredom and then frustration, because I got my tail handed to me quite a few times.\n\nI really like the idea of The Last One, it drives home the fact that this might be the last time you experience FF13. Unless, of course, you decide to play New Game+. I approve of any RPG that implements this system. Although, I think making equipment-upgrades NG+ only is a real head-scratcher. I believe that having weapon-upgrades available earlier would make the level of difficulty more fluid. More players would opt to choose the normal setting for a first play-through, if they had additional opportunities to strengthen Lightning. Also, while this game offers a lot of niceties to NG+ players, you still have to re-do almost every quest, especially if you're like me and didn't defeat a certain end-game super-boss.\n\nAs for the story, well, I can't tell you how many times I got the urge to skip a cut-scene or three. It's not that the storyline is particularly bad, there's just not much to it. When there's organized religion in a JRPG, you already have an idea of how things are going to turn out. A lot of the time I felt like I was just going through the motions. Still, I have to say that Square-Enix really knocked it out of the park with the final portion of the game. Everything about the last hour or two is just perfect. To give an idea of how good it is, it not only lifted my opinion of LR, but also the other FF13 games. This is a trilogy that put its cast of characters as well as the players through a lot of crap, but its ending is so great, that I felt it was all worthwhile.\n\nSurprisingly, this port is the best of the FF13 PC trilogy. Aside from that nasty online-only DRM that was quickly removed, I'm very pleased with how it turned out. Granted, the frame-rate chokes a little when moving around, but for me it's always been at or around 60 fps during battles, which is exceedingly important. I didn't run into any crashes or other major issues, and that's always nice. Actually, there might have been one crash, but I'm going to blame it on my PC, it was acting a little strange that day.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Lightning Returns. Aside from its many unique ideas, this game presents one of the most refreshing and fun battle-systems in franchise history. It carries over the familiarity of the previous FF13 titles, but with its own spin. Nova Chrysalia is an interesting world, and each continent has at least one or two cool aspects to it. While LR's ambitions are never quite matched by tight game-design, S-E still managed to craft something very special.","March 16","true","42.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/balls_of_ice/recommended/345350/","balls_of_ice","Scopedog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/balls_of_ice/","387 products in account","I’ll be honest with you. I bought Lightning Returns primarily for the dress up, and my expectations weren’t high. While I wasn’t a fan of FF XIII, and even less of a fan of it’s confused, malformed sequel, you couldn’t fault either game for their excellent selection of high quality, glossy lipped and slightly dead eyed Japanese dolls. The producers of Lightning Returns seem to have realised this and baked it into the marketing campaign with all the subtlety of a cruise missile aimed at a nunnery.\n\nWhat will come as something of a surprise to many then is that the game is not the car crash disaster it by all rights should have been, though it is heavily flawed. Lightning Returns is a good example of why steam needs a middle ground rating – I can’t honestly give it a thumbs up, not without serious caveats but dismissing it entirely is every bit as unjust.\n\nThe core conceit in particular is both original and compelling – God is going to end the world in seven days in order to create a new one, being evidently based on the bored bi-polar sociopath of the Old Testament. You as the hero can do nothing to stop this – all you can do is save as many souls of those in this world as you can, so that they may be reborn in the next. There’s a further wrinkle to this - no-one has been born in 500 years, but equally no-one can die of old age. However, people may still be killed by other traditional means such as disease, misadventure or good fashioned suicide. This sets up a nihilistic Children of Men-esque world covered in a thick malaise of apathy, offset by a tense race against time as you do what you can to save what little hope is left.\n\nThis being based on the characters and premises of FF XIII, this potential is of course completely squandered. The story is borderline incomprehensible at best, a train wreck with no survivors at worst. Set 1000 years after the first game, Lightning is awoken from cryosleep by God and has agreed to be the world’s soul collecting saviour with the hook that her sister Serah is reborn in the next world. But she’s also had her emotions removed, the reasons of which are never adequately explained, so why she should be moved by this emotional plea is unclear. Removing your main character’s personality as well as driving motivation doesn’t sound like a recipe for entertaining drama without a careful writer at the helm. Sadly the writing is roughly on par with the last two games – which is to say it’s crushingly, wincingly awful. All of the characters you either loathe or barely remember make their melodramatic, floppy haired return, and chew their way through dialogue so purple it would make Anne Rice blush.\n\nWord of advice – set the language to Japanese. All credit to the English voice actors, they do the best they can with the material they’re served but this is hot, George Lucus tier garbage and not understanding the words being spoken adds a comforting, brain shielding barrier between player and script. Your comlink companion Hope (also thankfully de-emotioned) never shuts the ♥♥♥♥ up either, and in English his repeated dialogue goes from irritating to excruciating very quickly indeed.\n\nSo it’s down to the mechanics to save the whole show, and I personally found the game quite compelling in spite of its shortcomings. The impact of the time limit on this game can not be overstated. Make no mistake, this is an absolute core part of the game that cannot be ignored in any way, shape or form. You have six in game days to finish the whole thing, with an hour of game time being roughly equal to a real-world minute. You have a limited supply of EP (I forget what it actually is, so I’m going to assume it refers to Lightning’s collection of Emerson Lake & Palmer records) that can be used to stop time for about three real world minutes – EP is regained slowly, typically by killing baddies. Time management is absolutely crucial, and it is a massive barrier to relaxed exploration. If this sounds like a deal breaker to you, I would not recommend this game regardless of how much you want to see Lightning in her knickers.\n\nIn terms of freedom, Lightning Returns finally gets the balance right after the hand holding corridor of FFXIII and the borderline cryptic non-linearity of the sequel. There are four large areas, each containing their own main quest as well as a series of side quests that can be tackled in any order, though enemies do get tougher in the larger, more open sections. The side quests are of particular import – Lightning does not level up by fighting monsters (the lazy cow) and instead gains flat bonuses by completing these quests. They’re of a variable quality – there is a literal “find my dog” quest, but there are some nice multi-tiered interwoven quests that don’t inhale dong in there as well. The time limit alongside a general lack of waypoints can make this aspect of the game quite frustrating, and I feel that they should have made these more optional – you will have to complete a sizable number if you want to have hope of beating the bosses or even some of the tougher basic enemies.\n\nA word of warning - The game is surprisingly difficult, and demands you learn its mechanics quickly. You will need to learn how to block quickly, or you will die, frequently and unceremoniously to even the lowliest of enemies. You will not be able to muddle through things on the default difficulty –Every loss results in a loss of a precious hour from the in game clock. The first boss in particular is a wake up call, and they only get harder from there – seriously consider starting on easy if action games are not your forte, though it should be noted that if you do so your future descendants will feel your gaming shame.\n\nThe battle system is fantastic once you get the hang of it though. This is by far the most action orientated of any of the FF games, with nary a menu to be seen. You control only Lightning this time, but she can switch between three different costumes at will – when one is in use, the ATB gauges of the others will recharge faster. While each costume has different abilities and stats, you’re largely free to customise their active abilities as you wish. There’s a bewildering number of costumes and accessories available, and those wanting skimpy bikinis might want to temper their expectations- while those exist, they’re vastly outnumbered by the range of much more tasteful outfits. This is probably for the best, as Lightning is built like a 15 year old boy with two oranges in a bra – her bottom is Isaac Clarke levels of flat. Flatter than Master Chief. Flatter than Sigourney Weaver in Alien. I’m not some kind of badonkadonk zealot, but this is heartbreaking stuff.","April 7","true","59.5"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","12","14","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alleboes/recommended/345350/","alleboes","Cicak Tempur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alleboes/","75 products in account","Square Enix's most underrated game that every RPG buff should experience\nLet me start by saying that I dropped FFXIII halfway and couldn't even stomach pass the first area of FFXIII-2. Confusing plot, mundane gameplay, annoying characters; the list goes on endlessly. I'm a massive Final Fantasy fan (played all the numbered entries, some spinoffs and currently clocking 1000 hours on FFXIV) but FFXIII and its sequel is a steaming pile of disappointment. When Lightning Returns went on sale, I still had doubts that the trilogy could get me interested. One hesitant purchase later, I was pleasantly surprised that all my earlier worries were for naught. Not only is Lightning Returns a great comeback to quality Final Fantasy, but it's also one of the most exceptional RPGs to come out in a while. And just so I can make this clear before continuing my review:  you don’t have to play or like the first two games to appreciate Lightning Returns, although they may help in your enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe plot picks up centuries after the second game’s ending. After being crystallized for hundreds of years, Lightning awakens to find that the entire world is ending in 13 days. Numerous monsters rise from sinister zones called Chaos, most of the world has been engulfed in darkness and the remaining traces of civilization left can be found in the Dead Dunes, The Wildlands and the cities of Luxerion and Yusnaan. The worst realization for Lightning, however, is her sister Serah being held captive by the god of light, Bhunivelze. The god then made a deal to Lightning: she would become his servant for the final 13 days in return for her sister's freedom.\n\nI have not finished both prequels, but I can assure you that the game does a good enough job in explaining its branching storyline. Some terms and characters are foreign at first for new players, but it's nothing a few hours of playing the game can fix. The story is also easier to follow and not distracting unlike in the past two games. Also two giant thumbs up for wrapping up the story in one of the most epic finale in the series!\n\nSpeaking of characters, Lightning Returns takes a step forward for the supporting characters and a massive leap for our titular heroine. If you couldn't stand any of the characters in the prequels, you'll be glad to hear that this game made their presence actually bearable. All returning characters except Lightning receive limited screen time, but their personality this time around is fleshed out through individual story arcs. With an impending apocalypse in sight, it’s not really surprising that many of the upbeat characters took a turn for the worst. Lightning herself is no longer the constantly broody genderbent Cloud from the first game, but a strong woman who is constantly seeking out her true self while looking out for her sister. From her rich interactions with the other characters and NPCs, I realize that she could be snarky, cynical, hilarious and even (gasp) feminine. She yearns to help others while always putting her mission first. I couldn't help but notice that the characterization of Lightning here just screams Geralt from The Witcher 3.\n\nI would like to thank Square Enix for heavily revamping the combat system and making the battles actually enjoyable. Still remember the clunky mix of turn-based and real-time combat of the prequels? In Lightning Returns, the battles feel like a fresh hybrid of FFX and Crisis Core. You can unleash different attacks real-time using the four button inputs while keeping an eye on the ATB bar. If your ATB bar runs out, you'll be unable to take action for a period of time. Timing your attacks, managing your bar, exploiting the enemy's weaknesses and switching between garbs (which I'll get to in a sec) form the combat mechanics of Lightning Returns. There's even a dose of Dark Souls thrown in where timing your blocks become essential to survive against tougher foes and bosses. Unlike other Final Fantasy games, Lightning Returns will reward players who can master strategic combat instead of those who can grind the longest or obtain the best equipment. This is further backed up by the lack of EXP system in the game.\n\nWait, did I hear that right? No EXP, so no levels? That's absolutely correct. The term "experience points" and "levels" is nonexistent in Lightning Returns. The only way to boost Lightning's stats is by completing main story missions and side quests. Instead of getting EXP, killing monsters will net you new skills, rare weapon drops and EP for your counter. The EP counter is sort of like your SP bar in traditional RPGs for using utility skills. The only reason you will want to grind mobs is to farm skills and build up your EP counter for very situational moments. Strong skills are essential to create the ultimate Lightning, but fear not since the drop rate in this game is abnormally high.\n\nIn exchange for controlling Lightning the entire game, our heroine can equip different armors called "garbs" to fulfill the role of an entire party. Think back to the different roles like Commando and Ravager in the prequels except it involves Lightning switching garbs mid-battle instead. Each garb has their own ATB bar so timing your switches is essential since they can only refill their bar while on standby mode. For even more customization, the garbs can be modified heavily with skills that drop from monsters. The maximum number of garbs you can wield per battle is three, and there are over 80 different garbs you can buy and find. Not to mention all the garbs have pretty sweet designs!\n\nA major complaint I've seen by most critics and players is the clock system. Every three seconds in the real world equals a minute in Lightning Returns. Right out of the tutorial level, you are given only 13 in-game days to complete numerous tasks before the world ends. Fail to do so and Lightning might not be strong enough to fight through the final day. Here's a confession: this feature was actually the main turnoff that almost made me pass the game. Even I thought the developers were on meds when they decided to make a time-restricted RPG. Guess what? By the 9th day, I was able to complete virtually every side quest and story arc! This includes me wandering around aimlessly, backtracking a lot because I felt like I skipped a treasure chest and even falling asleep once (which, by the way, causes the game to pause automatically to not waste precious time). My total playtime was already a good 40ish hours by then. The clock system may sound restrictive, but the time available is actually much, MUCH, longer than you think. For those who played the game and still think that time is too short, be aware that a skill to temporarily stop time is forever at your disposal for only a measly 1 EP. The only minor annoyance with this feature is that some quests can only be taken and turned in at specific times. The same goes for the accessibility of several areas in the world.\n\nAll in all, I consider Lightning Returns as a reminder to why I love the series so much. It's the second game I ever cared to Platinum to date, so take that as you will.\n\nDefinitely a strong  9/10","March 22","true","72.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

It´s the best port out of the three games XIII / XIII-2. Had zero crashes (it even runs zero crashes with only CPU). Story wise i probaly say its the weakest of them all in the series and XIII being strongest.\nBut being the weakest on Story dosn´t mean it´s the worst. The freedom of Customizing your garb (armor/Class) is really cool. And there are tons of garbs to get and find! You pick three garbs and they become the classes you play as. Each  garb comes with diffrent stats/abilties. This is a strong point which the other series imo missed. XIII had the same looks expect weapon, XIII-2 had diffrent looks but not by alot. This game probaly has about 50+ diffrent garbs didn¨t count them all and i guess about 50 + weapons too. Compared to the three games this one gives most Freedom out of them all. You can go whereever you want in Nova Chrystalia whenever you want. This is something i wish the original XIII had freedom to walk wherever you want to. There is 5 Main quest stories and tons of billboard side quest and regular side quest which you talk to people. Dont be scared about the time you have when you start playing, you could actually gain a 14th day and you probaly complete almost all quests anyways or atleast 90% by ease! Content wise I would say in one way weakest to in series since alot of the time you run back and forth if you take that in consideration probaly the least content of the trilogy. What makes this the best is the Freedom,Customazation and exploration.  What give this minus compared to the other ones is Story, lenght and battle system is the most boring one to easy.","December 29, 2015","true","78.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

All kinds of messed up but decent, nonetheless;\nb) the schemata system is decent;\nc) battles do require more attention than your typical turn-based system;\nd) decent voice acting - special mention goes to the voice talent behint Chocolina, Mog and Lumina;\n\nCons:\na) throughout the entire game you'll fight the same twenty or so types of enemies.  Many borrowed from the previous two games with no changes or variations to the animations.   Considering one of the highlights of the game is the different battle system, it is vexing they did not introduce a larger variety of enemies to showcase its potential;\nb) the storyline is borderline nonsensical with the forced injection of religious overtones.  A mash of plots of concepts that were probably leftover from the previous two games;\nc) game starts off on the wrong foot with a weak hook;\nd) in case you don't have enough stress in your life they made the game so that it requires players to manage their time, with a clock in your face for 90% of the game.  You will always feel rushed and end up sprinting for most of the game.  If you're looking for a relaxing RPG where you can take your time to explore your surroundings, this is not it.\n\nAfter a hundred side-quests and a fair bit of grinding you will realize this is a story about gods and man.  About love and chaos.  About souls and crystals.  About despair and hope.  About death and salvation.  About self-fulfilling prophecies and human frailty.  About strength and self-image.\n\n","January 24","true","62.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarena/recommended/345350/","sarena","Sarena","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarena/","57 products in account","At first I was weary about buying another Final Fantasy XIII title. But after playing through this game, I am so glad that I did.\n\nLightning Returns really feels like a Final Fantasy game. When I played XIII and XIII-2, they felt like okay games, but for Final Fantasy games, they really fell short in a lot of places. On the other hand, LR had the same feel as the old Final Fantasy games did. I could not stop playing, because I wanted to explore the world and literally do every side quest I could in the game. This is the kind of feeling that FFVI - FFX had for me, and I'm really pleased with how Square-Enix brought this exciting feeling back.\n\nA few things that made this game so much more interesting than the others:The opening sequence really drew me in and made me extremely interested in what this game was about. While the other two had slightly interesting beginnings, neither of them pulled it off quite as well as this one did.\n\nAnother thing that made this game so strong was the interesting world. It was so open world that you could literally do any of the main quests in whatever order you wanted. I loved exploring the whole world, and how each area had its own unique culture.\n\nAll of the NPCs had their own back stories and interesting reasons for doing what they were doing. This is one of the features that really made me want to do all of the side quests, without making them feel like "extra work" or generic "fetch quests," even if they were technically asking you to go get an item for them or slay a monster. There were even certain times of day that certain NPCs would be in specific areas. This made them seem so real. Like they were real people with real lives, and couldn't just be sitting in the same spot all day, because they had things to do.At first the battle system was my main complaint, but after getting used to it, it turned out to be my favorite battle system in the XIII series. It requires so much strategy and isn't as simple as hitting "auto-battle" and sitting there, watching the battle play through. I love how it has elements of the ATB system from previous Final Fantasy titles, but it also brings in much more action elements to really make it feel like you are participating and controlling every move.\n\nAnother thing that turned me off at first was the time limit of the game. At first I was worried that I would be unable to do everything in the amount of time given, but as I played the game, it really wasn't a huge issue. I was able to complete all of the main five quests with at least three days left to finish up side quests. Using the combination of Chronostasis and Teleport really makes things fairly easy to complete in the time limit given. Also, being a project manager, this was really a lot of fun for me to manage my time and use every second efficiently. It got me excited to be able to write down what times certain quests could be completed, and when things had to be done by. This might be hard for people who don't enjoy time management as much as me, but honestly it's a really fun challenge that is added to the game.\n\nOne last thing that I would like to point out is the improvement from XIII-2, in regards to the PC Port. I didn't find too much wrong with this port, and it ran just like it would on a PS3, for the most part. No lag at all (I played on the lowest settings and it still looked beautiful). The only issues I had were that it would crash in the Jagd Woods in the Wildlands sporadically if I did not save every few minutes. Other than that, I never had any problems.\n\nOverall, I can't express how pleasantly surprised I was with this game. I spent about 56 hours on my first play through, but I got 81% of the achievements and did all besides three side quests (that's about the same amount of time it took me to play through both XIII and XIII-2 combined).\n\nTL;DR:This game is the best in the XIII series. I definitely recommend buying this game if you like unique worlds, interesting characters, and have enough time to dedicate to having fun.\n\n10/10\nI was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this game!","January 27","true","56.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

The XIII trilogy might've started off on a bad note for many but it was a great start to what would be a great adventure to look back to. This game made up for any faults the others might have had. It has exploration, tons of quests, "limited" monsters, Postgame/New Game+ content, and more! Sadly the weapon, armor, and accessory enhancement part of the game comes after beating the game in New Game+.\n\nThe game follows a sort of Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask timed playthrough, where everything has to be done withing a certain amount of time or doom for all (game over). I was afraid to go into the game knowing this, but I ended up having so much spare time in game that I didn't have much to do. In this game you do not get any sort of XP from killing monsters, but you get a raise in stats after beating quests and saving souls of the remaining people in the Chaos ravaged Nova Chrysalia. I enjoy beating quests and getting the rewards, but this way I thrive even more! Now I gotta admit that I played it on Easy mode so I could escape battles without any penalty, so I did it to have fun, relax, and watch this great story unfold.\n\nThe story continues 500 years after the events of Final Fantasy XIII-2, and the world has been, mostly, eaten away by the chaos from Valhalla. Lightning awakens from her crystal sleep after these 500 years by the god of light, Bhunivelze, to help the survivors and save their souls so Bhunivelze could create a new world for mankind. Throughout the story you see some familiar faces (of course), and some familiar names from the FF series (you'll see... maybe). While most of the characters don't help in battle at all, because it is mostly focused on Lightning and her role as savior, they will have great importance in the story and help fill in some o the blanks from the 500 years Light missed.\n\nI'm just going to have to stop there and say that I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of the game. While I do miss having some companions accompany you through the story, it is a nice way to see the adventure through one person's perspective and get more details from them. The music, while a lot of it sounds like some sort of remix of "Blinded By Light" the battle theme from Final Fantasy XIII, it is put together well to make each track fit in with the environment and situation at hand. Many of the tracks are pulled from the two other FFXIII games, but I loved so many of them that I was glad to hear them in this game, it also has a few songs from other FF games so keep an ear out, and the battle music isn't just one to three songs, but many pulled from the XIII trilogy and played in different maps and times of day.\n\nContinuing from my opinion of the various aspects of the game, the visuals are still easy on the eyes with the same amazing look from the recent games. For you PC snobs (no offense), the freamerate does go up to 60fps so that's a good upgrade, and it has different options for the graphics (look below in the info section to see what exactly). I've seen other reviews complain about the always online DRM, but I haven't gotten knocked offline so I played comfortably, but please Square Enix, don't do that, sometimes we might not be able to connect to the inetrnet, so don't add that kind of thing alright? Anyways, I feel that theer is a high replayability for people who like New Game+ content, achievement hunting, and simply just becoming some kind of overpowered god (out of my Bhunivelze, there's a new god in town) through weapon, armor, and accessory upgrading. Did I mention, the attacks and clothing Lightning wears is customizable? Well, yes it is, each "grab" has it's own stats and some might come with locked in abilities like magic slash and such, but you can change the other abilities to whatever you please.\n\nNow I know I didn't cover everything, I will let you the reader (thanks for taking the time btw) discover everything yourself. I don't mean that in a rude way, but I did mostly have a lack of information purposedly to have that "wow" factor to what new features are in this game. The combat is great too for anyone who felt like they weren't really feeling like there was any strategy to the other combat systems because of its real time live action battle system. I hope you guys enjoy the games itself and ignore the whole "stay online" DRM as this game ends on a high point for this great trilogy.\n\nVisuals: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Sound: 10/10 Entertainment 10/10\nOverall 9.75/10\n"Meow-meow Choco-chow..."","December 20, 2015","true","39.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

The reason for this of course was the dreaded "timer".\n\nWell, the game has been out a while, it was on sale for 8 Euro, I figured id keep an open mind and try it out! And I gotta say.. I misjudged it. Don't get me wrong, I still don't like the time management aspect as it stresses me out, it makes me rush more than i'd like in an RPG, some of the zones are pretty huge and i'd love to just go exploring for a while - but I can't because i'll game over if I do. Im a completionist and this game doesn't allow it. With that said I gotta say for what it is, the time aspect is well done - it's actually bareable even for someone who hates that sort of thing, the timer pauses in conversations, cutscenes, menu's - and when you chill at your base (ark) in between days, stopping to take a breather or tinkering with your gear/shopping is really not an issue which is great! The timer will only run when you are running around the map exploring and moving about.. It even pauses in combat, and the more combat you do the more "EP" you collect, which you can use to cast Chronostasis which freezes the timer for a while. You can also extend your total time by several days when you do certain quests, so in short.. You have plenty of time. I haven't finished the game at the time of writing this but I am quite confident that i'll be able to do most if not all things that I want too during my first playthrough with some management, and with the game being built around multiple playthroughs (like Type-0) anything I do miss i'll be able to check out the next time around, and there seems to be plenty of reasons to play through a second time.\n\nAlright, im ranting on so i'll move away from the timer topic and get into the game itself. The story has been referred to as lighthearted but I think that's incorrect, it's not as deep as what you are used too from the main series of games, but was any spin-off sequal ever? Think X-2, yes it has a few more lighthearted moments and some obvious fan service, but the story do have a serious tone as well as it wraps up the series.\nThe performance of the game is great, it looks pretty and runs smoothly and I haven't run into any bugs or crashes. The only thing that I would complain on from a technical standpoint is the controls, they are really weird and you can't set everything as you want which makes it feel like an obvious console port, for an example your map button and one of your attack buttons shares a key, and similarly with the menu button and a second attack, etc. So if you want your map on M and your menu on say Tab or Esc like in a typical PC game, you would have to do combat with those two keys as well which is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and 20 houres in im still not used to the controls and I probably won't ever be, so i'd definetly recommend trying a controller if you have on since the game is obviously built for that!\nLastly the gameplay itself, combat is suprisingly fun although some of the random monster encounters can be a bit annoying, either they will knock you to the ground all too often, or die too easily, when you to get around to a boss you are rewarded for strategy. You can play the game button mashing, but the game rewards you if you choose to play better, as an example - you can hold the block button to block things, but if you simply press block at the right moment you might knock back and stagger your enemy, and there's also tactical strategies as using vulnerabilities against enemies.\nYou do not get to level up in the traditional way which im not sure if I like or not.. Instead you are rewarded with permanent stats for each quest you complete, another reason to replay the game, as you can increase in power endlessly (?). You also get quite alot of new equipments and you can equip multiple setups to switch between in batte, and you can upgrade your spells - and from what I hear your equipment too once you unlock hard mode, so despite not leveling up you still have plenty of ways to increase in power and you get quite a few ways to customize your Lightning the way you like her.\n\nThat should cover the basics so i'll just TLDR; The time management is annoying but ok, it sounds worse than it is - the game is not as serious as the previous two installments but doesn't screw around with it's story, don't go into it expecting another main series game, with an open mind though you should definetly have alot of fun and get a nice conclusion to the story.\n\nAnd most of all - get ready to repeat these words regularly every time you play.. SHUT UP, HOPE.","March 6","true","58.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Issues from previous Final Fantasy ports such as optimization issues and graphic options have been fully addressed in this port. The game offers a lot of visual adjustments and resolution, it also runs great on most modern systems, including gaming laptops.\n\nThis game and generally speaking the XIII series as a whole has divided the Final Fantasy fan base into two opposite groups. You will either love this game or hate it, there's no middle point. The first thing you need to know about the gameplay is the global Time-limit. That's right, you're given 14 in-game days to finish the game in the best case scenario and if you fail to do that (which is quite hard to do unintentionally to be honest), It's an automatic Game Over with an option to keep all your stats and items and restart the game.\n\nBut keep in mind that even though there is a time limit, you don't need to rush the game AT ALL. There is MUCH more time than you need to finish everything on your first playthrough. You can also freeze the time by using an in-game ability as well.\n\nIf you mostly play video games just for the story (like I do), then you're gonna be hugely disappointed in this game. The whole story revolves around an illogical concept which is pure non-sense. And I mean it in an objective sense. Basically, everything you do until the very end is completely pointless. Honestly, Lightning Returns has one of the worst plot I've seen in a long time and the ending is even worse. I'm not gonna spoil the plot so pet me put it this way. The ending will take everything you've done and throw it out the window, it would also ironically point out the fact that the whole story was intentionally nonsense and why.\n\nOn the bright side, Soundtrack is astonishing and gameplay is great. I would highly recommend Lightning Returns solely becuase of its gameplay. If you like to play good games, you should definitely play this. However, if you just want a good story, you would be disappointed.","January 4","true","51.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Well.. people say that, but I'm not sure what their standards are. It runs fine except for 1 certain spot in the Dead Dunes where it crashes constantly. I also had to reinstall it instantly because apparently enabling the JP voice pack with subtitles won't allow you to pass the first cutscene due to certain antiviruses like Avast. Other than that it ran fine.\n\nThe combat system - is nothing like the prequels. It's lightning alone changing between three schemata(clothes) with different ATB(stamina gauges) that each have their own 4 attacks. *The system itself isn't bad* but there are some annoying delays that can cause abilities to go off after switching schemata. The primary problem with this system is that the schemata have locked-in abilities that you can't rebind as far as I could discern. This means if you need to change your style for a boss or harder mob you'll have to relearn keybindings. Aerora used to be 1? Sorry, the new schemata you have to use has that bound to debrave. Enjoy casting debrave constantly by accident. This results in a very high amount of irritation while playing and against hard bosses it generally means you can't win until you memorize keybinds completely.\n\nAddendum. The combo mechanic is incredibly stupid. Using finales is generally considered to be a detriment to your gameplay as it is so slow that their stagger gauge recovers AND it leaves you wide open for an attack. This means nuke->nuke->change schemata->nuke->nuke->change schemata repeat until staggered rather than nuke->nuke->finale.\n\nThe time limit - isn't as bad as you might think. I presumed it would be rather harsh, especially given that certain quest NPCs, items or pathways are blocked during certain times of day. This resulted in me killing every mob I came across for 'EP' to use Chronostasis and freeze time - resulting in my completing of all main story quests and most side quests by day 6 of 13-14.  Also there is constant chit chat between Lightning and Hope throughout the game which you - if you want to hear it - must stop and listen to, wasting time. It *does* continue after you exit a fight, however there are certain interactions that can cancel it outright and it's gone forever.\n\nThe boss loot system - is pointlessly bad. I forgot about it at times and missed very powerful pieces of equipment like the sword with quick stagger that you CAN'T get back to without going through the game again. What happens on boss/omega level monsters is they drop a red shiny on the ground instead of giving you it in the loot screen. Makes sense right.\n\nThe "clothing" - is ridiculous. Look, I've always thought metal-kinis were stupid, but I'm also not one of the totally unhinged psychofeminists. That said, the clothing is this game is just ridiculous. There are a few really well designed sets but I'd say around 50% of them are Lightning wearing bikinis and latex ultra miniskirts with a thong pulled up over her hips. That's just pathetic for an AAA developer and it's a trend that's happening more and more with FF games. "Classic Japan" jokes don't cut it with a franchise like this. Wh*r*ng out you're main character to perverts to sell a FF game. It's just sad. Almost forgot..  you can change the colors of the clothes. Just in case you prefer electronica to have a pink thong.\n\nThe game's length - isn't actually very long. If you remove the cutscenes it's actually quite short, as the game has no level system for Lightning - only for abilities. I presume this means the last boss will be rather tough unless you farm mobs for ability drops to level up in a very tedious combination system. ** Edit - As well as length there are only 4 areas in the game, with 2 or 3 relatively small dungeon areas that are essentially just repeating hallways. You'll quickly find yourself very tired of running around Luxerion for the 100th time or back and forth across the Wild Lands.\n\nThe sidequests - make up the vast majority of the gameplay. As mentioned above it's pretty short for a FF game. It's packed full of a sidequests which are almost entirely fetch/slay quests which are very boring. They give slight stat boosts upon completion and rarely an item. There is a bonus area  for completing some however. Fortunately it's not too hard to reach that goal.\n\nThe story - is utterly F'ing nuts. If you played the first two and aren't a blind fanboy you probably already know the storyline is completely insane. Even if they do maintain the rough formula of a FF game they are disconnected and hard to follow with 13-2 being considerably more bizarre than the original. FF13-3 compounds that confusion even further. Constantly contradicting itself and failing to explain major plot points. Even ignoring the repeated contradictions of their own story and absence of how x or y happens the storyline itself is total nonsense. I don't want to spoil it so I'll simply say  It's cliche, cringeworthy and entirely mad.\n\nKnow now that you will understand little to nothing about everything in this game and will only have a very vague understanding of what is happening with almost all remaining unexplained. For a Final Fantasy game this is unrepentable and the main reason I would never recommend anyone play this game. It's not worth it. At least not for the story. Maybe if you really like the combat. Take that from someone who spent 57 hours trying to enjoy it! If you absolutely MUST see it then at least 99.9% of the storyline happens via cutscene. Just go watch them instead.\n\n*Spelling/clarity","January 12","false","57.2"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Just let me say this:\n\nThe game has absolutely NOTHING to do with the previous two except the main characters. The battle system is in my opinion not that entertaining, graphics are ugly and low-budget-ish and even the music is below the average for a FF game with exception of some tracks (The Ark, A Sacred Oratorio, Altar of Light, Claire Farron, Sash and Dajh, Sneaking In and a few others).\n\nAnd yet I did enjoy playing Lightning Returns. XIII characters really grew on me and it was interesting to watch their personalities develop through all three games. That said - the story (although still confusing) is great, voice acting fabulous again (not talking about English voices; Liara and Joel should go back to their games, they do not belong here!) and the finale pretty satisfying.\n\nWhat really surprised me was a depth of side quests. The quests themselves were made in a boring "fetch this and that" style known from many MMORPGs, but their backstories were always beautiful. Especially the "Life of a Machine" quest almost made me shed a tear.\n\nAaand that's about it.

The battle system and enemies give you something to chew on, making you come up with complex combinations of different gear, weapons, and abilities to find that sweet spot in quickly tackling individual fights. The combat is fast, dynamic, and requires sound strategy, while button mashing and brute force are punished. Even on Normal mode, the gameplay should give veterans a fair challenge. There's also a lot of meat to the gameplay, and even the fetch quest diversions tend to be interesting thanks to the short stories they tell. The bottom line is that this game offers quite a lot of mileage in terms of game time till you've seen and completed everything, and even then it invites you to master everything on New Game+ cycles, a Hard mode, and some optional content of exceptional difficulty.\n\nThe story isn't bad, but a bit on the short side. It is however a nice finish to the XIII trilogy that shouldn't leave your eyes dry if you've stuck with it from beginning to end. I'm fairly certain that it will leave anybody utterly confused if they haven't completed the stories of the previous games before it, though.\n\nTechnically speaking, the optimization is lacking. You can tell this is a console game port through and through, from low-rez textures, over significant framerate drops in towns with lots of NPCs, to a lack of in-game mouse controls.\n\nIf you do not intend to play with a controller and mediocre ports or performance are things that bother you, steer clear from this game and consider me giving it a flaming thumbs down.

LIGHTNING RETURNS™ aknowledges the faults of previous installations and offers this time only four areas that are considerably sizeable compared to one big area fo the original FF XIII.\n\nTo be more dethful LIGHTNING RETURNS™ has a 13 day cycle. Unfortunately the days don't really vary, just mostly add more quests. So the game doesn't come anywhere near the (very old) gloriousness of the Majora's Mask where every day was unique and the fates of inhabitants were genuinely touching. The writing team seems to be aware of this and really like to emphasize how Lightning has lost all of her humanity and empathy and is a do-gooder only for quest-rewards, or something.\n\nOne thing that really shines in the game is the voice acting. The game is full of sounds and every line that is said is voice acted. This might come close to 20 hours of voice acting both in japanese and english. This partly remedies the lifelessness of the game world and the game is more vivid than Final Fantasy XII, which had the series record in this field.\n\nDespite the critique of the world I had two reasons for complaining. Another them is a stupid and addicting cheat code called chronostasis that should be NEVER used, the game would have been better without. I think time restrainment in rpg is a very cool idea especially if failing makes you stronger (and smarter). Another complaint is that the guy responsible for dress attributes should have been fired. He effectively ruined the very awesome work of this very awesome person that made a huge effort for Lightning's pretty <3 dresses.\n\n\n\nForgot to mention: Controller is mandatory!","May 25","true","164.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is basically a cosplay simulator, and it gives you all the DLC outfits for free at the very start of the game, you shift costumes to shift, well, basically shift characters, Lightning acts as a 1 person 3 man party in this game. I loved Lightning as a character (again, probably in the minority here) so I'm really enjoying playing as her again.\n\nThe game plays almost like Majora's Mask or DeadRising, with a deathclock time limit, and you as the player working within these time constraints as well as a day-night cycle that determines who you can speak with and what you can do at any given time. It's a fresh challenge, and if you enjoy time management you'll enjoy this aspect of the game.\n\nBottom line, if you like more action-y combat as opposed to the straight up turn based methods of older FF games, or if you've been enjoying the XIII trilogy so far and see the deathclock as a fun challenge as opposed to an oppressive limitation, I see no reason not to pick this one up, especially at it's 20-25 dollar pricepoint.","April 10","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Taking out of the way time for me to do a spoiler free review of the game, so let's start with the Pros of the game.\n\nLet's start that first that as a PC Port is definitely the best of the serie, before the recent update (dec 24) you couldn't play offline because of cloud which they finally took off, and now they have added more resolution options. Thank you for that Square. Ok now let's start with the Pros and Cons of the game so you get an idea of what to expect.\n\n+ pro(s):\n\n+ Graphics\n\nLet's get something first, this game cameout in 2013 (Japan) - 2014 (America & Europe) so you wont find new things on it that weren't in the console, now that's not bad, the game still mantains the beauty that was known for it has aged quite well to be honest.\n\n+ 60 FPS\n\nWhat else i can say....60 fps are best fps and something you wanna see everyday all day in your life.  ?(????)\n\n+ DLC Included\n\nFREE DLC ARE BEST DLC.\n\n+ Battle system:\n\nThe battle system  had a huge improvement from previous 13's and now it has more strategy to it, being able to have 3 different schemas (Class) in battle each corresponding to a different garb (Armor) that you need to set up, you could have a debuff class to start the battle and lower the melee and magic resistance to an enemy, then change to a mage class to deal from affar and then a melee class to hit hard and fast ?(?_??).\n\n+ Music\n\nOne that has not change much from the other games in the aspect that it's awesome you will simply love the soundtracks of the game and each song reflects very well the place you are at the moment giving you a more deph and meaning to the place. You can find the soundtrack in youtube and see it for yourself but it will have more meaning when you are listening to it ingame.\n\n+ Price\n\nbecause yeah, i had to go there, i mean to be honest the original price of $60 i would have never recommend the game but now that we have the PC port at  $19.99 this is definitely a must have and even then you could wait for another sale and have a go for it.\n\n+ World map\n\nIf you hated how the previous games felt a little bit linear  ( im looking at you XIII) you will be pleasantly surprise and glad to see that Nova Crystalia is such a beautiful place with lots to explore.\n\n+ Side Quests\n\nFinally! the side quests are not only optional but have a meaning for you there are lots of sidequests in the game and they even tho most of them are optional they actually help you improving your stats (hp, magic, strenght...) so if you love to do this then you are in luck.\n\n+ NG+\n\nIt's NG+ what else you want me to say\n\n+ Dual Audio\n\nWe have the amazing choice to hear the game in English or Japanese (Only voices) so if you preffer the game in any language well now you have the choice, even tho i would recommend to here the game first in english to get more of the story\n\n* Neutral:\n\nGraphics\n\nWhat? Ceopls you said this was a pro what gives man?... Well yes i said it was a pro and it is BUT here comes the big butt...(see what i did there) it also has its flaws depending on how you look at it, some places will look rather "empty" for you in some parts not all thats why is not good or bad, it all depends in your point of view.  Also while its nothing really bad you will find some flickering and some weird shadows ingame but nothing too distracting but hey...i have to be fair\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThis game has a mechanic very similiar to The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask where you have a certain number of days to save the world, now you can use some skills to actually stop the time while using EP which can be recovered having random battles or doing side quests (see what i meant with having a meaning) so AGAIN depending of your point of view this could be good or bad, now i was skeptic about this when i started but let me tell you that you will have more than enough time to do everything the game has to offer. There is always guides that shows you the best root if you get lost at some point.\n\n- Con(s):\n\n- Controls\n\nLighting Returns was literally ported to pc meaning that the control settings is are mapped with the Keyboard keys, you can play with a 360 controller but all the commands show the keyboards ingame, worry not you can find button does what when you are on the intro, but it would have been nice to add full controller support to the game so that it shows also the controller buttons in the game\n\n- Challenge\n\nThe game itself is quite a challenge on NG (normal, you unlock hard after beating the game) but once you get to NG+ either normal or hard the enemies wont scale their stats meaning they will have the same stats they had while playing  in NG.\n\n- Story friendly\n\nWhile the story of Lighting Returns is amazing, you would also need to know what happen in XIII & XIII-2, so for new players i would strongly recommend watching the story on youtube from the previous games.\n\n- Hope\n\nHe becomes the FF version of navi enough said...\n\nOverall:\n\nLighting Returns its a good game and i would strongly recommend it if you like FF's even if you disliked the first 2...13's, like any other game and as you can see it has its flaws but for the price you are paying you are getting quite a deal dont miss the chance to have a good FF port on your pc.\n\ni give this game  score of 8/10 and a rating of must play.","January 16","true","11.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Good game. Game did not crash once or have FPS issues and ran smooth on my A10  processer on my laptop. None of the problems I had with the first 2 games in the series which were terrible ports and not so good games. This game is actually fun. Thrilled Final Fantasy XV will follow in the steps of this game.\n\nI actually enjoyed his game so much I spent time finishing nearly every quest.  The combat is much more fun and more hack and slash action based never seen in a FF game. The number options are good and only get beter with more costumes, items, and weapons. More open world and plenty of quests.\n\nDon't be fooled by the smaller  disk space of this game compared to the first 2 games.  I played this one for many more hours than each of them individually and actually enjoyed this game instead of feeling like I was grinding and wasting time. I deleted the other 2 games from my drive after beating them to have disk space and because I will never play them again. Kept this game on my drive because it's a really good game.\n\nIt's not Final Fantasy VII but it's not Final Fantasy XIII either.

Final Fantasy game with only one controllable character and no form of party at all? Sounds like heresy, however the gameplay is actually quite enjoyable. The ATB system they implemented feels very good and with the "fashion change" you don't feel as much that you're just a single man army.\n\nKeep in mind it's a Final Fantasy game at core, so if you're not into fights with the same enemies in a rather repetitive manner... this game won't make it up to you. Unless you're a fashion freak, in which case this game is your dream come true.\n\nThere are few things to watch out for though:\n- completionists, you're gonna have nothing to do on 6-7th day if you're utilising the Chronostasis a lot.\n- some say the DLCs included in PC version ruin the progress feeling... there's some truth to that, but there's always the option of avoiding them\n- although the technical side is better than previous FFXIII titles on PC, it's still... bad. If you like some ambient occlusion, I suggest googling out GeDoSaTo.\n\nGenerally speaking, this game is actually worth playing if you're a fan of jRPG or... fashion.","May 13","true","104.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Lightning Returns is probably the first truly open-world FF game and rather than having an incoherent mess of locations like XIII-2 did, it instead has just four but each one is different from the gloomy European Luxerion and the vibrant, festive Yusnaan to the more open and diverse spaces of the Wild Lands and the Dead Dunes, each of which has a different atmosphere depending on the time of day (the day-night cycle is dynamic for the first time in the series). The battle system is the best in the series, being less about cheap and tedious grinding and more about precise timing, exploiting enemy weaknesses and having the right kind of schemata. The game's most notorious feature, the clock, is perhaps also its best feature, encouraging you to be efficient with your time, and allowing you to feel good about yourself at the end of a productive day. (It's also quite generous; after having finished nearly every available quest on Normal, I still had almost a week left on the clock.) And then there's Lightning, the icing on the cake if there ever was one and a reason in itself to buy the game. You may dress her in all kinds of cool outfits ("garbs"), which really makes the game the ultimate Waifu Dress-Up Simulator. Note that there are some jarring fps drops especially in the cities, a "feature" of the graphics engine, but that's pretty much my only complaint.","March 5","true","53.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/recommended/345350/","sweetzz","Sweetz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/","320 products in account","Lightning Returns is easily my favorite Final Fantasy XIII game.  Given my opinion of the other two games that's not saying all that much, but I genuinely like this one.\n\nThe battle system is the best thing to happen to a Final Fantasy game in years, it's a fantastic hybrid between direct character control and picking commands from a menu and it's something I've never seen before.  It's possible it was ripped from some MMO I don't know about, but it was very fresh concept to me and it took me by surprise how much I'm digging it.  The battle system alone is enough to put this game ahead of the other games in the series for me.\n\nI also really like the character customization system.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about basic abilities like attack and guard being limited, equipable items, but it works.  The garb (aka dress) system also works because, whether we admit it or not, we all like playing dress up with our virtual action figures (they're totally not dolls! :) - whether it's putting spiked pauldrons on a barbarian or a highly impractical "armor" on Lightning.\n\nBeyond the combat systems, I like the general structure of the game too, even though it's exceptionally basic.  Sadly none of the quests are all that compelling by themselves, they're still all Fedex and monster hunts, but I like the regulated nature of having a bunch of quests and gradually working through them.  It keeps me going in Bethesda RPGs where most quests are similarly hollow and mechanical in nature, and it kept me going here.\n\nThe time limit did worry me quite a bit.  Basically you have a limited about of time to accomplish a particular number of tasks in game, and if you fail to do so, you get a bad end and have to restart.  The notion that I could play the game for 20+ hours only to get a bad ending and have to start over seemed ridiculous.  However, it turns out it's a complete nonissue. I decided to play the game on easy because I was so worried about that and I ended up completing all main quests and like 90% of the side quests by the game's half way point without looking at a guide once.\n\nThe story is the one area I'm pretty disappointed with the game.  The plot is nonsense, but that's no different than the other FFXIII games...or Final Fantasy games in general for that matter.  However, in other FF games you at least get some degree of enjoyable spectacle in how the story is presented - big set piece moments and scenes.  Apart from the always cool opening cinematic, I've only come across one other scene that I thought was cool.  Other than that, the game doesn't even get its anime drama-on properly.  All the series main characters have like 2- 5 minute cameos at best, during which they try to cram in entire emotional arcs and it comes as especially absurd how quickly characters change from one viewpoint to another and resolve their conflict.\n\nSo the story is a wash like the other games and the spectacle that was the saving grace of the original FFXIII isn't there, but I like playing the damn thing more than any other game in the series.  It goes without saying that you shouldn't bother playing this unless you suffered through the other FFXIII games, but if you do, you might just find is a nice way to finally be done with that chapter in FF history.","April 4","true","56.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, this game does not support mouse control so you could only play with either a controller or just the keyboard. Unique to the PC platform is the ability to increase the graphical performance of this game as there are options for resolution, lighting effects, shadow quality and et cetera. There is also the options for english and japanese voiceovers which are both equally good.\n\nIn this game you play as Lightning and you have thirteen in-game days to complete it. You might think that it would be very constraining since you are given a time limit, but you are also given an ability to stop time which you could use to complete various quest and activities. Speaking of things to do, there are quite alot of them! There are five main questlines and over a hundred side quest/canvas of prayers to do to increase stats and unlock cosmetics. You could also hunt different monsters to extinction and would be given a powerful reward in doing so.\n\nThis game would be a delight for those who love customization. You could unlock many different garbs, weapons, shields and adornment to dress Lightning up in and they each have special abilities and stats. The combat in this game is pretty satisfying as it is semi-action combat and no longer turn-based. You could customized your garbs with different abilities and this would allow you to pull out some great combos during battles.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing and really fits well during different scenarios of the game. After completing the game you are given the ability to continue with new game + which allow you to retain almost everything such as gears and stats. You might be wondering why would you want to replay the game again, well there are some pretty cool features in new game + such as a hard mode for added difficulty, ability to upgrade weapon, shields, accesories as well as the ability to restart the game from day one with almost everything intact at any point of the game.\n\nOverall this is a great game and I would recommend it for those who like customization and role-playing games. I would give it a 9/10!","March 25","true","65.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Lightning Returns is the final game of the FFXIII Trilogy. That being said this game is made to give the player closure after playing FFXIII and FXIII-2. The closure this game gives may or may not be enough for some people but you just have to play it to find out if it is enough for you. Now Lightning Returns introduces a new combat system, Instead of the menu combat it is now Realtime Combat. Realtime Combat made the gameplay extremely immersive and alot more fun (In my opinion). Now Lightning gets to use 3 Schemas which the player can customize like this:\n-Garb\n-Weapon\n-Shield\n-Accessory 1\n-Accessory 2\n-Adornment (Optional Wear: Bunny Ears, Tails, Wings, Tattoos etc.)\n-Ability 1\n-Ability 2\n-Ability 3\n-Ability 4\n(Note that some Garbs have locked abilities where the player cannot put their own ability into the locked slot)\nLightning again uses 3 Main Schemas and switches out between the 3 different schemas the player has put into their Main Schema Slots.\nATB Bars are basically Mana Pools where Lightning uses an ability and that amount of ATB is taken from the ATB Bar. (Note that ATB is NOT shared between your Schemas and will regenerate when not in use.)\nCombat Highly Revolves around how well the player can perfectly Block and Attack.\nStaggering is the main way to do damage, Staggering has different conditions depending on the enemy and there are many different ways you can stagger a single enemy.\nThe player may choose whatever goes into the schema and is completely up to the player on which they would like to use. While on the topic of Schemas I would like to address a complaint that some players have about the Schema Setups.\nSome players may feel forced to use a certain garb for a locked ability  Soldier of Peace with Artemis's Arrow  Choosing to use a garb for the reward of easing the play is the PLAYER'S choice and not the games. I personally beat the game using garbs that Lightning wore in the previous games; which are given to the player for free in the Rewards Barter Shop (Only on the PC Port, On console you must have to have a save file from FXIII for 1 and FXIII-2 for another).\nOne of the aspects of the game are the Time Limit, You are given 6 Days to start but by progressing through the story you are given more. (PROTIP: DO NOT LOOK AT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OR YOU WILL GET SPOILED VERY HARD ;-;) Now roughly 2.5 seconds in Real Life are equivalent to 1 Minute in Lightning Returns clock. So 1 Hour of Lightning Returns time is equivalent to 2 minutes and 30 seconds of Real Life. That being said a Full Day in Lightning Returns is about 1 Real Life Hour. The clock is stopped during cutscenes, fights, and interaction with NPC's. Do not feel rushed, Square Enix knows that the time limit may be stressful and they incoporated abilities to help Lightning get through the quests without running out of time.\nLightning is also given Eradia, which can be found in the bottom left corner indicated by a glowing orange number with orange bars. Eradia has many uses which are given to the player throughout the game. Eradia is lost when using an Eradia Powered ability and is gained by killing enemies. Certain enemies such as, Niblets, will not grant as much Eradia (roughly .02 Eradia gain) than slaying a Zaltys ( 1 Eradia gain). So killing big monsters will grant more Eradia to let Lightning use the Eradia spells.\nNow the world is dying and it's all because of the Chaos. Chaos can be seen as a black aura with many tiles. If Lightning chooses to go to this area enemy encounters are alot harder. The enemy is given certain buffs while in the Chaos but if it leaves the chaos it becomes a regular enemy again. Fighting inside chaos may prove a challenge but if Lightning does win a battle inside the Chaos she is rewarded with: Bonus Eradia, Bonus Gil, and a higher chance of good drops.\nUnlike the regular experience system in other FInal Fantasy games, Lightning Returns doesn't give you an experience system. Instead Lightning gets stronger through finishing: Main Quests, Side Quests, and Canvas of Prayer Quests (The Board found by Chocolina). While it may annoy some people having to grind quests to get stronger, it is optional. I was so engrossed in the story that after day 7 I slept all the way through the last day to see the ending.\nNow we all play Final Fantasy Titles expecting story. Lightning Returns gives us story, some may not like it some may, Personally I enjoyed it. The story may be rushed at times but isn't that how it's suppoused to be? The world ends in 13 days and you can't dally or you fail your mission. The ending is something very special and if you hate Lightning as a character from FXIII and FXIII-2 for her attitude I would say you HAVE to play Lightning Returns. I personally loved Lightning as the main character throughout the series, being cold, violent, and mean made her seem like the biggest ***** alive but if that's the reason you don't want to play Lightning Returns you are doing yourself an injustice. The ending is something VERY SPECIAL while many seem to hate it I loved it (Even though I could barely see the screen through all my tears). It's something unique to say the least, I had always had an emotional connection with Lightning and the character progression of Lightning in this game parody'd (Related too well) to me, May have just caused a more emotional effect (I literally was blind in tears)\nNow Square Enix forces you to start with either Normal or Easy, Both do NOT offer the full experience and the player must play again on HARD, which is awarded after completing the game. You basically have to play through the whole game again to get the full experience. May be annoying for some people I found it fun going through the tougher bosses for round 2.\nThe PC Port of FXIII Lightning Returns, as said in other reviews is undoubtedly the BEST PC PORT for the FXIII Series and is great. I ran FXIII Lightning Returns on 1920 x 1080 60 FPS (Ocassionally dipped down to 40) on a NVIDIA GTX 960M (Comparable to the GTX 750TI for Desktop Users) I5-6300HQ 2.3GHz with 8 GB of RAM\nFXIII Gets alot of hate and alot of negative reviews for different reasons and people always have differing opinions. If you did play FXIII and FXIII-2 you MUST play this one. If you want to start with Lightning Returns I would highly oppose it, and URGE you to play through FXIII and FXIII-2 to get the story and get the most from FXIII Lightning Returns.\n\nToo Long; Didn't Read\nPROS:\n-Realtime Combat System\n-Gives Closure\n-Replayability (The game gives the option for NG+ I have seen people do 9 Playthroughs)\n-Open World (Not Linear like FFXIII)\n-SE Gives an ability to FREEZE Clock\n-Lightning is Customizeable\n-BEST PC PORT for the FXIII Series\n-Most entertaining and immersive boss fights (IMO)\n-Game Comes with DLC (Except the Aerith and Seigfried Garbs)\n-Character Development\n-Beautiful Landscape\n-No Party Members (If you didn't like the FFXIII Characters will be a pro)\n-No EXP system (Lightning gets stronger through finishing Main and Side Quests)\n\n\nCONS:\n-Time Limit (Unless you play like a turtle or lose every fight you will not Time Out)\n-Military Time (The Game Clock is in Military Time, Might be difficult to tell time for some people)\n-Rushed Story (Makes sense because of the time limit)\n-If you don't play on HARD you don't get the full experience.\n-No Party Members (Revolves around Lightning, May be a Con for some people)\n-No EXP system (Some people liked grinding monsters to lvl, I am not one of those people)\n-Difficult Boss Fights (Hard NG+)\n-Story might be difficult to understand (Really only in the beginning)\n\nSolid 9/10, My favorite of all the FF games.\n\n(I will finish this review after my completion of NG+ on HARD)","March 23","true","46.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

I've spent 88 hours on it in less than a month.\nThe game had a functional story with lots of character development, especially for Lightning. I felt immersed in the beautiful environments. The soundtrack set the mood perfectly, even in moments of satire. I enjoyed interacting with anyone I could find to hear amusing and even sometimes touching dialogue.\n\nI rate this game 9/10.\nI'll go ahead and say that this is one of my all-time favorite games. Across 10 Final Fantasy games I've played this is the only one that held me until the end, even for another playthrough on Hard Mode.\n\nPros!\n-Highly interactive and challenging combat system. Practice makes a huge improvement.\n-Vast array of outfits to wear, each with their own buffs and abilities - AND they react to wind and movement, which calls for fantabulously impressive victory poses!\n-A myriad of adornments to add style to Lightning. More than I can keep track of.\n-Anti-frustration features and intuitive controls/interface\n-Memorable story, music, and visual art that capture the essence of the Final Fantasy universe\n\nCons!\n-Many outfits become obsolete upon progressing to New Game+, because the bound abilities can not be upgraded.\n-Some bosses can be -incredibly- difficult on your first playthrough, and may make you ragequit. *cough* Chocobo Eater *cough*\n\nAlmost cons, but more just gripes.\n-Lightning looks slightly different in CGI cutscenes, as if she's wearing makeup that she isn't wearing in-game. She does look incredible in CGI though. With that said, there are comparatively few CGI cutscenes, some crucial story moments don't even have one.","March 14","true","104.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The PC port is the first one in the whole FFXIII series to be not only ported correctly with features that easily make this look like a next gen title.\n\nThe game itself features a convoluted story and is a side effect of upping oneself in scale and epicness. But don't let that distract you from the game which is really a showcase of the graphics and the combat system.\n\nThe side quests are a grind without any real substance, the main quest is much better but still leaves something to be desired. Still, since it's trying so hard to innovate with the combat and mechanics, I really think people owe to themselves to give it a try and see how semi-real-time combat can work.","February 23","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story is probably the weakest point, even due to the nature of the gameplay, you will have to complete many sidequests to level up your characters, not fighting, and this is just the beginning of the peculiarities of this original game.\nSadly it's noticeable the low budged of the work, some zones are clearly better than others and it's the same for the main quests, it took 3 games to understand how to make XIII a really good game but it was too late, so in the end it's "just" a good game.","January 2","true","53.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/recommended/345350/","sweetzz","Sweetz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetzz/","320 products in account","Lightning Returns is easily my favorite Final Fantasy XIII game.  Given my opinion of the other two games that's not saying all that much, but I genuinely like this one.\n\nThe battle system is the best thing to happen to a Final Fantasy game in years, it's a fantastic hybrid between direct character control and picking commands from a menu and it's something I've never seen before.  It's possible it was ripped from some MMO I don't know about, but it was very fresh concept to me and it took me by surprise how much I'm digging it.  The battle system alone is enough to put this game ahead of the other games in the series for me.\n\nI also really like the character customization system.  I wasn't sure how I'd feel about basic abilities like attack and guard being limited, equipable items, but it works.  The garb (aka dress) system also works because, whether we admit it or not, we all like playing dress up with our virtual action figures (they're totally not dolls! :) - whether it's putting spiked pauldrons on a barbarian or a highly impractical "armor" on Lightning.\n\nBeyond the combat systems, I like the general structure of the game too, even though it's exceptionally basic.  Sadly none of the quests are all that compelling by themselves, they're still all Fedex and monster hunts, but I like the regulated nature of having a bunch of quests and gradually working through them.  It keeps me going in Bethesda RPGs where most quests are similarly hollow and mechanical in nature, and it kept me going here.\n\nThe time limit did worry me quite a bit.  Basically you have a limited about of time to accomplish a particular number of tasks in game, and if you fail to do so, you get a bad end and have to restart.  The notion that I could play the game for 20+ hours only to get a bad ending and have to start over seemed ridiculous.  However, it turns out it's a complete nonissue. I decided to play the game on easy because I was so worried about that and I ended up completing all main quests and like 90% of the side quests by the game's half way point without looking at a guide once.\n\nThe story is the one area I'm pretty disappointed with the game.  The plot is nonsense, but that's no different than the other FFXIII games...or Final Fantasy games in general for that matter.  However, in other FF games you at least get some degree of enjoyable spectacle in how the story is presented - big set piece moments and scenes.  Apart from the always cool opening cinematic, I've only come across one other scene that I thought was cool.  Other than that, the game doesn't even get its anime drama-on properly.  All the series main characters have like 2- 5 minute cameos at best, during which they try to cram in entire emotional arcs and it comes as especially absurd how quickly characters change from one viewpoint to another and resolve their conflict.\n\nSo the story is a wash like the other games and the spectacle that was the saving grace of the original FFXIII isn't there, but I like playing the damn thing more than any other game in the series.  It goes without saying that you shouldn't bother playing this unless you suffered through the other FFXIII games, but if you do, you might just find is a nice way to finally be done with that chapter in FF history.","April 4","true","56.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lightning Returns is the final game of the FFXIII Trilogy. That being said this game is made to give the player closure after playing FFXIII and FXIII-2. The closure this game gives may or may not be enough for some people but you just have to play it to find out if it is enough for you. Now Lightning Returns introduces a new combat system, Instead of the menu combat it is now Realtime Combat. Realtime Combat made the gameplay extremely immersive and alot more fun (In my opinion). Now Lightning gets to use 3 Schemas which the player can customize like this:\n-Garb\n-Weapon\n-Shield\n-Accessory 1\n-Accessory 2\n-Adornment (Optional Wear: Bunny Ears, Tails, Wings, Tattoos etc.)\n-Ability 1\n-Ability 2\n-Ability 3\n-Ability 4\n(Note that some Garbs have locked abilities where the player cannot put their own ability into the locked slot)\nLightning again uses 3 Main Schemas and switches out between the 3 different schemas the player has put into their Main Schema Slots.\nATB Bars are basically Mana Pools where Lightning uses an ability and that amount of ATB is taken from the ATB Bar. (Note that ATB is NOT shared between your Schemas and will regenerate when not in use.)\nCombat Highly Revolves around how well the player can perfectly Block and Attack.\nStaggering is the main way to do damage, Staggering has different conditions depending on the enemy and there are many different ways you can stagger a single enemy.\nThe player may choose whatever goes into the schema and is completely up to the player on which they would like to use. While on the topic of Schemas I would like to address a complaint that some players have about the Schema Setups.\nSome players may feel forced to use a certain garb for a locked ability  Soldier of Peace with Artemis's Arrow  Choosing to use a garb for the reward of easing the play is the PLAYER'S choice and not the games. I personally beat the game using garbs that Lightning wore in the previous games; which are given to the player for free in the Rewards Barter Shop (Only on the PC Port, On console you must have to have a save file from FXIII for 1 and FXIII-2 for another).\nOne of the aspects of the game are the Time Limit, You are given 6 Days to start but by progressing through the story you are given more. (PROTIP: DO NOT LOOK AT THE ACHIEVEMENTS OR YOU WILL GET SPOILED VERY HARD ;-;) Now roughly 2.5 seconds in Real Life are equivalent to 1 Minute in Lightning Returns clock. So 1 Hour of Lightning Returns time is equivalent to 2 minutes and 30 seconds of Real Life. That being said a Full Day in Lightning Returns is about 1 Real Life Hour. The clock is stopped during cutscenes, fights, and interaction with NPC's. Do not feel rushed, Square Enix knows that the time limit may be stressful and they incoporated abilities to help Lightning get through the quests without running out of time.\nLightning is also given Eradia, which can be found in the bottom left corner indicated by a glowing orange number with orange bars. Eradia has many uses which are given to the player throughout the game. Eradia is lost when using an Eradia Powered ability and is gained by killing enemies. Certain enemies such as, Niblets, will not grant as much Eradia (roughly .02 Eradia gain) than slaying a Zaltys ( 1 Eradia gain). So killing big monsters will grant more Eradia to let Lightning use the Eradia spells.\nNow the world is dying and it's all because of the Chaos. Chaos can be seen as a black aura with many tiles. If Lightning chooses to go to this area enemy encounters are alot harder. The enemy is given certain buffs while in the Chaos but if it leaves the chaos it becomes a regular enemy again. Fighting inside chaos may prove a challenge but if Lightning does win a battle inside the Chaos she is rewarded with: Bonus Eradia, Bonus Gil, and a higher chance of good drops.\nUnlike the regular experience system in other FInal Fantasy games, Lightning Returns doesn't give you an experience system. Instead Lightning gets stronger through finishing: Main Quests, Side Quests, and Canvas of Prayer Quests (The Board found by Chocolina). While it may annoy some people having to grind quests to get stronger, it is optional. I was so engrossed in the story that after day 7 I slept all the way through the last day to see the ending.\nNow we all play Final Fantasy Titles expecting story. Lightning Returns gives us story, some may not like it some may, Personally I enjoyed it. The story may be rushed at times but isn't that how it's suppoused to be? The world ends in 13 days and you can't dally or you fail your mission. The ending is something very special and if you hate Lightning as a character from FXIII and FXIII-2 for her attitude I would say you HAVE to play Lightning Returns. I personally loved Lightning as the main character throughout the series, being cold, violent, and mean made her seem like the biggest ***** alive but if that's the reason you don't want to play Lightning Returns you are doing yourself an injustice. The ending is something VERY SPECIAL while many seem to hate it I loved it (Even though I could barely see the screen through all my tears). It's something unique to say the least, I had always had an emotional connection with Lightning and the character progression of Lightning in this game parody'd (Related too well) to me, May have just caused a more emotional effect (I literally was blind in tears)\nNow Square Enix forces you to start with either Normal or Easy, Both do NOT offer the full experience and the player must play again on HARD, which is awarded after completing the game. You basically have to play through the whole game again to get the full experience. May be annoying for some people I found it fun going through the tougher bosses for round 2.\nThe PC Port of FXIII Lightning Returns, as said in other reviews is undoubtedly the BEST PC PORT for the FXIII Series and is great. I ran FXIII Lightning Returns on 1920 x 1080 60 FPS (Ocassionally dipped down to 40) on a NVIDIA GTX 960M (Comparable to the GTX 750TI for Desktop Users) I5-6300HQ 2.3GHz with 8 GB of RAM\nFXIII Gets alot of hate and alot of negative reviews for different reasons and people always have differing opinions. If you did play FXIII and FXIII-2 you MUST play this one. If you want to start with Lightning Returns I would highly oppose it, and URGE you to play through FXIII and FXIII-2 to get the story and get the most from FXIII Lightning Returns.\n\nToo Long; Didn't Read\nPROS:\n-Realtime Combat System\n-Gives Closure\n-Replayability (The game gives the option for NG+ I have seen people do 9 Playthroughs)\n-Open World (Not Linear like FFXIII)\n-SE Gives an ability to FREEZE Clock\n-Lightning is Customizeable\n-BEST PC PORT for the FXIII Series\n-Most entertaining and immersive boss fights (IMO)\n-Game Comes with DLC (Except the Aerith and Seigfried Garbs)\n-Character Development\n-Beautiful Landscape\n-No Party Members (If you didn't like the FFXIII Characters will be a pro)\n-No EXP system (Lightning gets stronger through finishing Main and Side Quests)\n\n\nCONS:\n-Time Limit (Unless you play like a turtle or lose every fight you will not Time Out)\n-Military Time (The Game Clock is in Military Time, Might be difficult to tell time for some people)\n-Rushed Story (Makes sense because of the time limit)\n-If you don't play on HARD you don't get the full experience.\n-No Party Members (Revolves around Lightning, May be a Con for some people)\n-No EXP system (Some people liked grinding monsters to lvl, I am not one of those people)\n-Difficult Boss Fights (Hard NG+)\n-Story might be difficult to understand (Really only in the beginning)\n\nSolid 9/10, My favorite of all the FF games.\n\n(I will finish this review after my completion of NG+ on HARD)","March 23","true","46.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

However, this game does not support mouse control so you could only play with either a controller or just the keyboard. Unique to the PC platform is the ability to increase the graphical performance of this game as there are options for resolution, lighting effects, shadow quality and et cetera. There is also the options for english and japanese voiceovers which are both equally good.\n\nIn this game you play as Lightning and you have thirteen in-game days to complete it. You might think that it would be very constraining since you are given a time limit, but you are also given an ability to stop time which you could use to complete various quest and activities. Speaking of things to do, there are quite alot of them! There are five main questlines and over a hundred side quest/canvas of prayers to do to increase stats and unlock cosmetics. You could also hunt different monsters to extinction and would be given a powerful reward in doing so.\n\nThis game would be a delight for those who love customization. You could unlock many different garbs, weapons, shields and adornment to dress Lightning up in and they each have special abilities and stats. The combat in this game is pretty satisfying as it is semi-action combat and no longer turn-based. You could customized your garbs with different abilities and this would allow you to pull out some great combos during battles.\n\nThe soundtrack in this game is amazing and really fits well during different scenarios of the game. After completing the game you are given the ability to continue with new game + which allow you to retain almost everything such as gears and stats. You might be wondering why would you want to replay the game again, well there are some pretty cool features in new game + such as a hard mode for added difficulty, ability to upgrade weapon, shields, accesories as well as the ability to restart the game from day one with almost everything intact at any point of the game.\n\nOverall this is a great game and I would recommend it for those who like customization and role-playing games. I would give it a 9/10!","March 25","true","65.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

While he can be helpful at times, his need to rephrase the same thing ten times is exasperating.  The side quests are rather enjoyable and I spend most of my day running around in an attempt to complete them all.\n\nCertain NPC's can only be found at certain times in the day/night which makes you have to manage your time. The cities feel lived in and I'm sad that I can't fully enjoy my time exploring (and cosplaying as Yuna) because I'm always anxiously looking at the ticking clock.  Whilst it is a fun challenge to manage your questing/EP, sometimes it feels restricting.\n\nI'm only 5 days in so I'm sure my opinion will change as I gain more time & complete the areas/main story. The combat is refreshing and the world is immersive as always.

Final Fantasy: Majora's Mask, essentially, but with some cool semi-action combat; this creates a game with far more satisfying combat and depth than MM had, but with that same atmosphere of tension and meaningful time management. The game is reasonably difficult, though at times it can delve into near-unfairness (such as fighting a certain boss after running through a location that slowly drains your HP).\n\nThe Lightning Saga naysayers are morons. FFX was far more linear than XIII, and X-2 was just unsatisfying and trapped in the deepest ravine of the Uncanny Valley in terms of its graphics (I understand that it was a different time, but seriously take a good look; that game has NOT aged well in any regard).

Can’t speak for the keyboard controls as I use a controller but in terms of the game itself the time concept and the open world nature FINALLY back to an extent is very refreshing to see again. The game play is fun and the story is not as deep as other games but still a good game, just a shame it didn’t get much development. Really love lightning as a character but the whole emotionless all the time though got annoying but well play the game and see what happens. If you haven’t played it then may be worth playing if you want an end to the XIII story and played the other two but overall I didn’t mind it. Just I’ve played it on PS3 already when it was out. Only got the steam one because it was pretty cheap on sale.\n\nPositives:\nThe successor to XIII and XIII-2 and how the other two games should have been.\nFinally open world again allowing for doing things pretty much however you want with the exception of time based events.\nThe time concept was an interesting one. And for those who find it annoying just keep using Chronostasis. When I played it on PS3 I stopped for awhile and totally forgot about that ability and ran out of time. But using that ability you pretty much never will run out of time.\nLighting dress up simulator.\nNegatives:\nFound myself doing a lot of grinding for items or quests. But that’s what I expected having played the PS3 version upon release.\nThe depth of the story was a little bit disappointing. I was hoping for a super expansive story and universe after XIII was a little bit of a flop. XIII-2 improved a little but while LR was good, it wasn’t the bound I was hoping for.\noccasional cringy dialogue.\nTime sink. Loss of productivity for awhile …  Loss of self-respect.

My main motivation for and why I even played it was to get some closure on 13-2's ending and Serah and Lightning. I approached it with the mindset of completing it as quickly as possible to see the story, but I found myself enjoying it more the farther I got.\n\nSo first, things I liked. I loved the environments. Such an improvement from 13-2 in terms of size and utility. There was much more to see and do in the world that felt a lot more expansive. I liked how there were a greater variety of NPCs you could interact with (whether as vendors, quest givers, or just random people) It also looked a lot nicer than 13-2, particularly the Wildlands and the Dead Dunes. Side quests are a MASSIVE improvement over 13-2's. I'm not talking about the side AREAS in 13-2 like the Vile Peaks or the extra Oerbas that had a side story (they were well done and we SO needed more of those), I'm talking about those meaningless fetch quests with pretty much zero interaction and take up the 80% of the side quest datalog. In LR, there are more side quests, and a good portion of them have interesting stories and actually feature our protagonist INTERACTING with the quest givers. Not perfect, but a major improvement. I actually liked how this game took a bit more of a personal tone with the protagonist, really delving into Lightning as a person and character. I wish 13-2 treated Serah in the same way. Maybe because this series is pretty much just about Lightning :/.\n\nMoving onto things I didn't like:\n\nThe time system. It's awfully frustrating and inconveniencing. How I have to wait for a specific time to access some area or a particular quest. There are some quest givers that only appear during certain times of the day and some parts of any main or side quest can only be done at certain times of the day. And once you're finished your quest and go to turn it in? Oh sorry, the NPCs aren't there anymore and you have to wait till the next day... It's annoying, especially when you have a THIRTEEN DAY TIME LIMIT. You have to painfully wait for some quests to progress because of the time while having a constant reminder of the short amount of time you have left. It's stupid. I know there should be enough time to complete most of the side quests, but it's stressful to have to worry about what time of the day I can do what while being reminded that time is running out. I understand how the time limit imposes a sense of urgency that's more realistic, but it could have been far less annoying and restrictive. Maybe I just want to take my time, enjoy the environments and explore as much as I can.\n\nThe combat. I liked having a real time battle system (it's what I'm used to), I liked being able to time my attacks, my dodges, and my guards. It made fighting more immersive. But what I liked even more was the more strategic-based combat system in 13-2. I liked the paradigm system where I was able to choose my strategy, assign roles to party members. Every move felt like it had some thought and planning put into it. I usually like real time combat, but for some reason, it felt off in this game. Nothing bad about it, it's just a personal preference, I guess.\n\nThe story for the most part felt rather incoherent and messy. There wasn't some underlying path Lightning was treading on to reach her goal. Her journey felt all over the place. There wasn't anything significant tying each chapter of her goal to save Serah. It felt like she was just visiting the areas to do busywork, taking part in the irrelevant lives of others. Yes, she was working to save the souls of her close friends, but it wasn't tied to her ultimate goal. It feels like the work she's doing throughout those thirteen days didn't advance any part of the overarcing plot: to save Serah. The final encounter did not have enough buildup from the plot at all, which made it feel rather incohesive with the rest of the story. I still enjoyed Lightning's reunion with her friends throughout her story, however, especially the Snow part (one of the sections where you could really feel the connection to the plot). Sections like that maintain the game's continuity from its predecessors.\n\nThe villain was a disappointment. He wasn't much of a character. He basically had no presence in the whole game until the very end. He had zero development and didn't feel like a threat at any point in the game, because he was missing for like 95% of the game. You couldn't really feel his influence on the story at all, it's like he came out of nowhere and conviently makes an appearance to take the physical form as a target who the good guys need to unleash their weapons at.\n\nThis brings me to my biggest complaint: how the characters were handled. My ultimate motivation for playing this game is to get some closure on what was left behind in FF13-2. Mostly on the characters. For the most part, the characters were handled well throughout the story. It was how they wre concluded that left me really disappointed. Serah, the person that Lightning starts this whole journey for, the centerpiece behind her motivations, and the person who was the main drive for her actions and story, is basically non-existant in the game. And what little there is of her takes form mostly in a fake Serah they created. I thought this was a neat concept (especially how this fake developed to harbor feelings for Lightning) but WHY NOT use what little characterization and development time there was on the REAL character? You know, the one Lightning talks about for the WHOLE GAME. But the biggerst letdown was how the journey for Serah concluded. There is basically no satisfactory closure on her relationship with Lightning. What did Serah want to say to Lightning after being revived? Did she forgive Light for her death in 13-2 (we should all know the answer but I would've liked to hear it from her)? Did she and Light have anything to say to each other after 500 years that showed the power of their will to be together again? Did she have any words about how she felt about everything that happened and being together with Light again? Did she even acknowledge Snow? Her fiance??? Nope, it ends just like that. She utters maybe three lines (that weren't all that memorable) before the game ends. Lightning has spent THREE WHOLE GAMES trying to get her back, even defeated a god. Then it's like she came back and it doesn't even matter at all. I mention Serah, and not so much the other characters, because I really felt like Lightning and Serah were the two most important characters in the trilogy (on how every game has been about them trying to be together), with everyone else a whole level below in terms of significance. If that is to be the centerpeice of your trilogy, it better be well developed and concluded, which I felt that it was not. Not only that, closure on the other characters were scarce too. It's like how everyone is leaving behind their old lives and homes, and no one cares. This game needed better, more satisfying closure on the characters than that last cutscene. It's supposed to be a happy ending, which is good, but there's no reason that a happy ending like this can't be more satisfying.\n\nOverall a decent game that I enjoyed my time with, despite frustrating things, mostly because of the return of characters I grew into, even though in some cases they may have been inconsistent or lacking. The gameplay held its own well enough for me, though on a mechanical standpoint, this game really doesn't have much going for it, as there isn't anything all that special about it. The game is mostly carried by the characters built from the two precious games, and their stories. If you like the character or generally like Final Fantasy or JRPG style characters, then this may be your thing. If you don't care about the characters or the story beyond 13-2, I would say this isn't worth the time.","May 19","true","19.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/letmefeelmyoats/recommended/345350/","letmefeelmyoats","Tess Tickles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/letmefeelmyoats/","128 products in account","Played this game on console prior to the Steam release. This was a decent enough port. It ran smoothly for me and even had English voices included, since XIII and XIII-2 only had Japanese VO for me due to regional restrictions for whatever reason. But overall it was a good port and it felt nice to finally play LR at 1080p 60 fps and have shorter load times. Really made a difference.\n\nAs for the game itself, my opinion stands that gameplay-wise it's superior to the previous XIII games, because of the brand new combat system that's reminiscent FF X-2's dressphere system, even though sometimes it may seem like the game is basically Lightning Dressup Simulator 2013. There are a WIDE range of garbs you can choose from, and you can customize the skills and weapon types that they use. They usually have one or two skills that are locked to that specific garb, so each garb can be unique in their own way.\n\nYou get skills like Attack, Fire, etc as drops from enemies and their levels vary. You can upgrade these skills by way of synthesis and later on in the game boost their levels. There's an encouragement to do New Game + with this game as well, because there are a few new features available to you that you can only get in NG+, such as upgrading weapons and shields. I was a little disappointed at first that you couldn't do that from the start, but if you think of your first playthrough as a stepping stone, it's fine.\n\nThe game pretty much drops you into its world and lets you go about the various main quests and side quests however you like, so I wouldn't say it's COMPLETELY linear. But I wouldn't say that it's open world, either. It also has a time limit with an in-game clock that can be a hassle if you don't know how to manage it and use it efficiently. I highly suggest following a guide, because certain quests in the game have very specific requirements, and their availability very much depends on the time of day and your progress in the main questline of that area. The reason I recommend guides is because the game doesn't really tell you much about these things when it comes to finding or completing these quests, and since the world of the game is a literal ticking timebomb, having a guide handy will help you complete as many quests as possible, as fast as possible, if you're the completionist type like myself.\n\nThe story is, quite frankly, abysmal nonsense. Granted, the XIII series' story in general wasn't that strong in the first place, but I liked the simplicity of it and thought it ended nicely. However, starting from XIII-2 it just went downhill from there when it started to introduce time travel and alternate universes. LR expanded on that and made the story even more nonsensical and not even worth your time investing in, in my honest opinion. Since I'd already experienced the story in my first playthrough on console, and was completely baffled at the time, this time around I skipped through the cutscenes and dialogue. I just couldn't be bothered with it anymore.\n\nI'd recommend this game based on the gameplay alone and suggest that you tune out the story if you liked the story in XIII, because this game pretty much ruins it all with unnecessary convolutedness and turning all the characters into hollowed-out shells.","December 14, 2015","true","37.4"," 22 of 43 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","22","43","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/light-rainsworth/recommended/345350/","light-rainsworth","Light Rainsworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/light-rainsworth/","25 products in account","In this game, you play as an overburdened and emotionally withdrawn warrior named Lightning. She has been awoken from centuries of sleeping in a crystal stasis to be humanity’s savior in the last days of Nova Chrysalia.\n\nThe world is going to end in thirteen days (or fewer, if Lightning fails). Lightning’s primary motivation throughout the game is to reunite with her sister, Serah. The primary conflict of the story is Lightning’s increasingly antagonistic relationship with the all-powerful deity who holds Serah hostage unless Lightning agrees to become humanity’s savior. This relationship is strained by the presence of an enigmatic figure named Lumina.\n\nLightning is a steadfast protector of her friends and offers salvation to those who need it most, but the burdens of godhood force her to struggle with her own humanity. She remains emotionally unavailable to those who care for her and her interactions with those she saves are (at least on the surface) cold and driven by necessity more than empathy. Nonetheless, she is determined to protect her last remaining family member, Serah, by any means. Her journey reminds me of Rose’s from Sony’s Legend of Dragoon and her cold but protective persona reminds me of Mikasa Ackerman from Attack on Titan.\n\nMechanically, I had low expectations going into this game. The doomsday clock scenario sounded needlessly constricting and the new combat style seemed unvarying from fight to fight. However, I am happy to say that the doomsday clock gave me more than enough time to finish all that I wanted to do in a single playthrough. The combat was enjoyable, though I didn’t enjoy the staggering mechanic in this game as much as I did in the previous two entries.\n\nMy least favorite thing about this game is the dialogue (and unnecessary monologues). Almost every sentence felt banal, monotonous, and repetitive. Though I was emotionally invested in Lightning and her journey, there were several times throughout my 50-hour playthrough that I felt compelled to skip through cutscenes and conversations. The ideas the story reaches for are interesting enough, but the way they are presented comes off uninspired. Luckily, the game keeps track of all major events in its ‘Datalog’ feature (a catalogue of information about the game’s world and mechanics).\n\nYou can choose between English audio and Japanese audio (with subtitles). I chose to play the game with Japanese audio and I feel the game’s dialogue wasn’t quite as bad. I feel the voice acting in the Japanese audio is more genuine than the English one, so the dialogue doesn’t come off quite as tedious.\n\nThough the objectives are typically mundane and the dialogue remains uninspired at best, I love the sentimental plots of some of the side-quests. You have the opportunity to save a robot who rationed his energy source just enough that he could be with his friends at the world’s end, reunite a woman and her dog, and attend a romantic dinner with a man who was stood up by his girlfriend. Some of these stories are contained to a single quest, while others may result in a chain of quests. In completing these missions, you save the souls of these people so that they can be reborn in the new world.\n\nOverall, I loved the time I spent watching Lightning’s epic tale unfold and interacting with the world of Nova Chrysalia. The ability to customize what Lightning wears into battle is great (I liked her outfits from the previous two games the best). I liked the pacing and difficulty of this game well enough to recommend it to anyone who enjoys roleplaying games, though I would like to see more complex battle systems in the future.\n\nI strongly disliked the game’s dialogue writing and I also disliked how mundane some of the side-quests were. I would like to have been more involved in Lightning’s decision-making regarding some of these quests, but the game offers plenty of player agency otherwise (in selecting which quests to do, which areas to explore, what gear to wear, and which abilities to use).\n\nThe game runs well on my Intel Core i5-3570k (3.40GHz) CPU and GeForce GTX 660. I have no complaints about its technical performance.\n\nOverall, I am very happy I purchased this game and heartily recommend it to other people who love sentimental stories of stoic warriors fighting to save humanity!","February 28","true","50.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skylxtumn/recommended/345350/","skylxtumn","SkylXTumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skylxtumn/","14 products in account","The Performance of the PortLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is a port that completely blows its predecessors out the water. Performance-wise, Lightning Returns is pretty much superior in every single way compared to its predecessors. Gone are the 30 fps limiters, controller-seeking microstuttering and just terrible optimization in general. With any decent modern day GPU/CPU, you can typically expect a rock solid 60 fps gameplay in battles with only occasional drops to 40-50 fps in the Open World. Due to 60 fps being most important in battles, this port sells itself as a pretty darn optimized port.\n\nSpecs that I'm running:\ni7-4710HQ @ 3.4 GHz Turbo\n8 GB RAM\nGTX 860M 4 GB GDDR5\n\nNote that the 860M is the laptop equivalent to the 750 Ti, a mid end gpu that most people use in modern day budget builds. Even so, with everything on max settings (except Scaling - as I'm running a display of 1920x1080 on my laptop), the game holds a 60 fps in battles effortlessly while having occasional dips to 40+ fps in the Open World. Considering the fact that the game had such terrible performance even on consoles, the performance of the PC version is not just a small step-up; it's a huge one.\n\nThe Minor Gripes about the PortDespite having such a stellar performance compared to its predecessors on Steam, it takes a few frustrating steps back - steps that which are easily rectifiable and would have made it a perfect port. For one, as this is a first day review, the game only supports a resolution up till 1080p. Hence, everyone who runs higher resolution monitors would not find this too pleasing. There is a very very good chance that some workarounds will be here very soon though, and perhaps, just maybe, a patch from Square Enix themselves.\n\nOther than that, the game still has no option for True Fullscreen to be enabled. True Fullscreen would give quite a big performance boost to everyone, but alas, its not present. The game's "fullscreen" is a borderless window.\n\nThe biggest gripe to all non-controller users though, would be that the mouse is not integrated into the game. As such, the mouse holds no significance/level of control whatsoever in the game. The cursor is visible too. For non-controller users, you'd have to be playing this game with both hands on your keyboard. The plus side is that all keyboard controls are rebindable, unlike its predecessors, although its predecessors had mouse integration into the game. At this point, I'm not quite sure which is preferable if you could only choose one of them to be integrated...\n\nThe Game ItselfThe Final Fantasy XIII trilogy is a very controversial series due to its nature of making its players either absolutely detest it or love it. Admittedly, if you've gone through the first 2 games, the 3rd won't be a disappointment. The combat system of the game is quite different from its predecessors and just about every other main title Final Fantasy. It uses a very heavily modified ATB system that functions more of like an "energy" system of sorts for your real-time actions. You also only control Lightning in this game as opposed to other entries in the series.\n\nThe game is widely known as a Dress Up Simulator for various endearing reasons. Lightning pretty much has to swap "schemes" (formally known as schemata) that features her in different garbs (read: clothes) with different equipment customized to the garbs themselves. The entire bundle forms a schemata. As one would expect, every garb/piece of equipment has its own intended job, and as such, can be viewed as something like a paradigm/mode by itself. Lightning is able to battle with 3 schemata at any one moment, and this is pretty much where the common FF strategy part lies.\n\nSince the game is already 2 years old, there is really no better way to describe the game than to simply watch some video(s) of it and form your own opinion around it. Unlike the initial entry into the XIII trilogy, Lightning Returns stays true to an Open World scenario too, and is where you do everything that isn't a battle.\n\nOverall Feelings on the PortWhile the port is certainly incredibly impressive in terms of its performance, it startlingly lacks some really tiny yet important features that its predecessors had. Frustratingly, it serves to show that it really could have been a perfect port if only it paid attention to some smaller yet integral fine details. Regardless, especially if you're a controller-user, the port is pretty damn solid and is very satisfactory, especially when compared to its predecessors.\n\nAs this is a first day review, it will be updated, should any fixes/patches get rolled out. I definitely want to believe that Square Enix would deliver some proper love to M+KB users as they did in Final Fantasy Type-0 HD.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skylxtumn/recommended/345350/","skylxtumn","SkylXTumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skylxtumn/","14 products in account","The Performance of the PortLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII is a port that completely blows its predecessors out the water. Performance-wise, Lightning Returns is pretty much superior in every single way compared to its predecessors. Gone are the 30 fps limiters, controller-seeking microstuttering and just terrible optimization in general. With any decent modern day GPU/CPU, you can typically expect a rock solid 60 fps gameplay in battles with only occasional drops to 40-50 fps in the Open World. Due to 60 fps being most important in battles, this port sells itself as a pretty darn optimized port.\n\nSpecs that I'm running:\ni7-4710HQ @ 3.4 GHz Turbo\n8 GB RAM\nGTX 860M 4 GB GDDR5\n\nNote that the 860M is the laptop equivalent to the 750 Ti, a mid end gpu that most people use in modern day budget builds. Even so, with everything on max settings (except Scaling - as I'm running a display of 1920x1080 on my laptop), the game holds a 60 fps in battles effortlessly while having occasional dips to 40+ fps in the Open World. Considering the fact that the game had such terrible performance even on consoles, the performance of the PC version is not just a small step-up; it's a huge one.\n\nThe Minor Gripes about the PortDespite having such a stellar performance compared to its predecessors on Steam, it takes a few frustrating steps back - steps that which are easily rectifiable and would have made it a perfect port. For one, as this is a first day review, the game only supports a resolution up till 1080p. Hence, everyone who runs higher resolution monitors would not find this too pleasing. There is a very very good chance that some workarounds will be here very soon though, and perhaps, just maybe, a patch from Square Enix themselves.\n\nOther than that, the game still has no option for True Fullscreen to be enabled. True Fullscreen would give quite a big performance boost to everyone, but alas, its not present. The game's "fullscreen" is a borderless window.\n\nThe biggest gripe to all non-controller users though, would be that the mouse is not integrated into the game. As such, the mouse holds no significance/level of control whatsoever in the game. The cursor is visible too. For non-controller users, you'd have to be playing this game with both hands on your keyboard. The plus side is that all keyboard controls are rebindable, unlike its predecessors, although its predecessors had mouse integration into the game. At this point, I'm not quite sure which is preferable if you could only choose one of them to be integrated...\n\nThe Game ItselfThe Final Fantasy XIII trilogy is a very controversial series due to its nature of making its players either absolutely detest it or love it. Admittedly, if you've gone through the first 2 games, the 3rd won't be a disappointment. The combat system of the game is quite different from its predecessors and just about every other main title Final Fantasy. It uses a very heavily modified ATB system that functions more of like an "energy" system of sorts for your real-time actions. You also only control Lightning in this game as opposed to other entries in the series.\n\nThe game is widely known as a Dress Up Simulator for various endearing reasons. Lightning pretty much has to swap "schemes" (formally known as schemata) that features her in different garbs (read: clothes) with different equipment customized to the garbs themselves. The entire bundle forms a schemata. As one would expect, every garb/piece of equipment has its own intended job, and as such, can be viewed as something like a paradigm/mode by itself. Lightning is able to battle with 3 schemata at any one moment, and this is pretty much where the common FF strategy part lies.\n\nSince the game is already 2 years old, there is really no better way to describe the game than to simply watch some video(s) of it and form your own opinion around it. Unlike the initial entry into the XIII trilogy, Lightning Returns stays true to an Open World scenario too, and is where you do everything that isn't a battle.\n\nOverall Feelings on the PortWhile the port is certainly incredibly impressive in terms of its performance, it startlingly lacks some really tiny yet important features that its predecessors had. Frustratingly, it serves to show that it really could have been a perfect port if only it paid attention to some smaller yet integral fine details. Regardless, especially if you're a controller-user, the port is pretty damn solid and is very satisfactory, especially when compared to its predecessors.\n\nAs this is a first day review, it will be updated, should any fixes/patches get rolled out. I definitely want to believe that Square Enix would deliver some proper love to M+KB users as they did in Final Fantasy Type-0 HD. If they do, that would definitely make me not hold back on going on some 700 hour crazy spree or anything of that sort. As it is now, it's just not so comfortable playing this game unless I buy a controller, which is a shame too, since this is definitely the game that I've been waiting for since... well since it was announced back in 2012.\n\nAt the very least, in a lot of ways, I can honestly say:\n\nWell done Square Enix.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/light-rainsworth/recommended/345350/","light-rainsworth","Light Rainsworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/light-rainsworth/","25 products in account","In this game, you play as an overburdened and emotionally withdrawn warrior named Lightning. She has been awoken from centuries of sleeping in a crystal stasis to be humanity’s savior in the last days of Nova Chrysalia.\n\nThe world is going to end in thirteen days (or fewer, if Lightning fails). Lightning’s primary motivation throughout the game is to reunite with her sister, Serah. The primary conflict of the story is Lightning’s increasingly antagonistic relationship with the all-powerful deity who holds Serah hostage unless Lightning agrees to become humanity’s savior. This relationship is strained by the presence of an enigmatic figure named Lumina.\n\nLightning is a steadfast protector of her friends and offers salvation to those who need it most, but the burdens of godhood force her to struggle with her own humanity. She remains emotionally unavailable to those who care for her and her interactions with those she saves are (at least on the surface) cold and driven by necessity more than empathy. Nonetheless, she is determined to protect her last remaining family member, Serah, by any means. Her journey reminds me of Rose’s from Sony’s Legend of Dragoon and her cold but protective persona reminds me of Mikasa Ackerman from Attack on Titan.\n\nMechanically, I had low expectations going into this game. The doomsday clock scenario sounded needlessly constricting and the new combat style seemed unvarying from fight to fight. However, I am happy to say that the doomsday clock gave me more than enough time to finish all that I wanted to do in a single playthrough. The combat was enjoyable, though I didn’t enjoy the staggering mechanic in this game as much as I did in the previous two entries.\n\nMy least favorite thing about this game is the dialogue (and unnecessary monologues). Almost every sentence felt banal, monotonous, and repetitive. Though I was emotionally invested in Lightning and her journey, there were several times throughout my 50-hour playthrough that I felt compelled to skip through cutscenes and conversations. The ideas the story reaches for are interesting enough, but the way they are presented comes off uninspired. Luckily, the game keeps track of all major events in its ‘Datalog’ feature (a catalogue of information about the game’s world and mechanics).\n\nYou can choose between English audio and Japanese audio (with subtitles). I chose to play the game with Japanese audio and I feel the game’s dialogue wasn’t quite as bad. I feel the voice acting in the Japanese audio is more genuine than the English one, so the dialogue doesn’t come off quite as tedious.\n\nThough the objectives are typically mundane and the dialogue remains uninspired at best, I love the sentimental plots of some of the side-quests. You have the opportunity to save a robot who rationed his energy source just enough that he could be with his friends at the world’s end, reunite a woman and her dog, and attend a romantic dinner with a man who was stood up by his girlfriend. Some of these stories are contained to a single quest, while others may result in a chain of quests. In completing these missions, you save the souls of these people so that they can be reborn in the new world.\n\nOverall, I loved the time I spent watching Lightning’s epic tale unfold and interacting with the world of Nova Chrysalia. The ability to customize what Lightning wears into battle is great (I liked her outfits from the previous two games the best). I liked the pacing and difficulty of this game well enough to recommend it to anyone who enjoys roleplaying games, though I would like to see more complex battle systems in the future.\n\nI strongly disliked the game’s dialogue writing and I also disliked how mundane some of the side-quests were. I would like to have been more involved in Lightning’s decision-making regarding some of these quests, but the game offers plenty of player agency otherwise (in selecting which quests to do, which areas to explore, what gear to wear, and which abilities to use).\n\nThe game runs well on my Intel Core i5-3570k (3.40GHz) CPU and GeForce GTX 660. I have no complaints about its technical performance.\n\nOverall, I am very happy I purchased this game and heartily recommend it to other people who love sentimental stories of stoic warriors fighting to save humanity!","February 28","true","50.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

In order to rescue her Lightning has to become the Savior and get (save, rip or whatever action is suitable for particular situation) souls of people of the dying world.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=583625882\n\nAt the start there are 6 days, 5 main quests, 4 regions and one "Hey, listen" companion. Completing each main mission gives one more day and stats increase, side quests give stats increase (less) and possibly some equipment (also access to Ultimate Lair and its boss), Canvas of Prayers quests give small stats increase and an adornment. Most of them have 2 possible outcomes - completed (you've got the soul) or failed (you haven't got it), instead of "helping a good character or helping an evil one" or "persuading enemies to surrender or killing them".\n\nThe battle system is more action-orientated. The player can choose equipment (garb, sword, shield, 2 accessories) and abilities (up to 4) sets and switch between them freely during fight. Each action consumes action points (read, stamina), which restores with time. Power of abilities depends on attributes (strenght for physical attacks, magic for magical), resistance depends on passive effects (from equipment or abilities), shield and ability used (Heavy Guard protects better than Light Guard), power of debuffs isn't affected by the character's stats. The Savior abilities consume EP (restores by defeating enemies). During some quests a companion (AI) is added to the party. Enemies and bosses grow stronger with time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=575207567\n\nThe time limit stops being a problem, when the player learns to use Chronostasis.\n\nGraphics, sound and level design are good (except 1 platform sequence in Wildlands, when comments were quite distracting). Key bindings are customizable.\n\nEdit.

It only goes up to 1080p by default, and I have noticed some stuttering when the game streams in new areas, but that could be just my computer. The PC version includes almost all the DLC, but I recommend playing a few hours before unlocking any in game, it's mostly a bit overpowered.\n\nThis isn't a technical overview though, so what about the game? Personally I thought the first XIII was okay but often monotonous, and I hated XIII-2. Lightning Returns is by a very large margin my favorite game in the XIII series. They have crafted a much more enjoyable non-linear campaign than XIII-2 by essentially breaking it into a series of short stories that can be tackled in any order. They fixed the monotony of XIII through myriad improvements that make the world feel more alive and interactive. The plot is ridiculous, but it works much better than XIII-2's. No terrible mixed metaphors, no more purple prose. Lightning's personality has changed, and her new aloof, deadpan style is a joy to see against some of the crazy situations. I genuinely love most of the dialogue.\n\nCombat feels like the ultimate refinement of the previous 2 games. I enjoyed the paradigm system alright, but taking direct control of lightning makes you feel more involved in the action. Designing your schemata (a mix between dress-up and paradigms) is fun and gives you a ton of control over what abilities and stats you are focused on. Passive abilities on equipment push you toawrds certain strategies while wearing them. You will swap between them constantly in battle, changing your style as you do. (unless you make 3 very similar ones, which you can do.)\n\nCharacter growth is unique. You don't get XP from killing monsters and there are no levels. Rather, completing quests rewards you with permanent stat boosts. I love this system. It encourages actively play towards your goal and not grinding. Which is good, because the game is on a (very generous) time limit. Lightning has the ability to pause time, this ability, and others like a full heal, self res or limit break, use a limit-esque gauge that is refilled by killing monsters. At first the gauge will seem very limiting, but in monster filled areas you can often keep a time-stop going indefinitely. (Be sure to abuse it!)\n\nI do have a couple issues with the game. Missions locked to a time of day are a neat way to have the player explore and branch out more, but certain time locked mechanics (like doors that lock/unlock every hour in one dungeon) just punish players for poor play by wasting their time. That makes sense mechanically with the game... but is not terribly fun if it happens. A few missions send you out to find things with no further hints (many let you gather information and are fine) these just feel like complete time wasters and I recommend looking them up online. Additionally, some enemies can be complete sponges that are almost unbeatable unless you carry the right abilities. This led to me running from battles a lot when I first entered areas, and running costs you an hour of in game time every time.\n\nThe game is still the best port so far (still have a bit of work to do there) and I believe the best XIII title both in terms of storytelling and game-play. FFXIII fans will probably get the most out of Lightning Returns, but even if you couldn't complete XIII or were turned off by XIII-2 I recommend you check out Lightning Returns.","December 12, 2015","true","31.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ignitesplash/recommended/345350/","ignitesplash","ignitesplash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ignitesplash/","52 products in account","I played the original ff13 way back in release and understand why some might think the original game sucked... It was too linear, and there was no freedom to explore the world. Like most games that were made after 2010, the developers seemed to have put in too much time and money on graphics, and not much else for their story writers.\n\nff13-2 promised; and admittedly did its best, to fix all the aforementioned "problems" in the original game. I played it when it was released as well. As the original game poorly reviewed, you'd think that nobody (outside of japan at least) had the taste for a sequel. The time traveling aspect of 13-2 was too complicated for some people, and many couldn't stick through with it despite the many improvements from the original game. As much as I didn't enjoy the story in 13-2, knowing about it is important in order to understand some parts of the story in this game.\n\nAfter 3 years of not touching ff13, Lightning Returns actually brings an unexpectedly good closing to the original game, and fills in many of the holes left behind after the arguably complicated mess that was 13-2. The PC port is actually rather decent for a PS3 game; FPS drops are rare except in towns, although the controls could definitely be better. For one, there is no option for mouse use at all, it's basically a direct traslation of the console controller buttons onto the keyboard. For a more fulfilling and immersive experience, I suggest the use of a gaming controller. Combat is fun and challenging, and the multitudes of sidequests are really fun to do. The story does justice to the characters and I think they are given the "ending they deserve" with this final sequel.\n\nFor those who have yet to play final fantasy 13 at all, I suggest doing the following if you wanna give it a shot:\nPlay the original ff13 (or watch if you can't stand the linear gameplay), watch ff13-2 (or play if you don't mind sidequests and alternate timelines/endings), definitely buy and play lightning returns once you've seen the first 2.\n\nOh and as with all JRPGs, the japanese dub is way better and you should always play in jp with eng subs if you want to play the better narrative.","December 13, 2015","true","23.6"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfganghype/recommended/345350/","wolfganghype","Wolfgang Hype","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfganghype/","280 products in account","This has been a really weird trilogy. The first game was rather bland in total. It had some nice character development, but the story and gameplay just fell flat for me. So then I tried the "sequel" which was really just a completely different game that happened to use the same characters. Honestly nothing from the first game really mattered for the second. Combat felt a bit better, since it focused on two characters instead of two parties worth that you had to juggle back and forth if you wanted even growth (hint to developers: if your cast is bigger than your party, share exp with all of them, not just the active party). Asside from being completely unrelated to the first one, the story was pretty good, though the ending was obvious sequel bait.\n\nAnd that brings us to this one. Which I feel is the worst of the lot. First of all the time mechanic and open world feel like terrible ideas. I know they got a lot of flak for how linear the first game was, but trying to follow a story in an open world game is always a pain. I go over here and find something out and then go over there and pretend I've never heard it before because they didn't know which I'd do first. The timer had me initially worried about running out of time, so I stopped time as often as possible, which resulted in me finishing ALL of the main stories by day 4 (out of 13). So I relaxed a bit more and did the side quests... and got them all done by day 8. So the Savior slept through the last 5 days. Needless to say, between those two elements pacing was killed, cremated, and thrown to the winds.\n\nCombat was pretty meh at first, but the tougher enemies just annoyed me. They weren't so much hard as tedious as hell. There were a couple enemies I got halfway through and just reloaded a save to ignore them. Your selection for combat is also rather limiting and there's no way to adjust in combat for the various enemies you'll face. Where the last game gave you access to all the spells in a set that you had (if still forcing you to have certain Paradigms) this game limits you to 12 abilities spread over 3 outfits, each with one or two locked in abilities. (Another developer hint: don't do this crap. Allow players to be flexible in combat, not force them to reload and change the loadout because they didn't bring a fire spell or something.) And then there was the timing elements which were just annoying. It didn't feel like things were telegraphed all that well either for your attacks or your enemies (such as for attacks that seemed to move the camera off to some other part of the field entirely or come from off screen). Overall, I just avoided it near the end.\n\nAnd finally there's the story itself, we've got another disconnect where it's 500 years past the last game (which had a good deal of jumping around by itself) and we start off at odds with a number of our past friends. It felt like the game was deliberately trying to make Lightning a boring character, despite most of her actions in the field not really fitting with that persona. Certain parts of the plot are dragged out between various days but are forced to wait for the last day for final resolution... which makes very little sense honestly. I could tell stuff was happening but for the most part I had either no investment or no clue.\n\nOverall I can't recommend this game.","May 11","false","84.4"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

Compared to Xiii and Xiii-2 this actually feels like a PC game, the difference in graphics and overall finish is that much better than the first 2.\n\nThe new fight system took a little while to figure out but despite the dramatic fights and abilities you can't help but feel the fights would be better if Lightning had some company. Don't get me wrong you do get some allies every now and then but still the lack of a full team (even filled out with monsters) bothers me.\n\nAfter 17 hours of gameplay I've only had 1 crash and that could be down to anything outside of the game so no negative marks from me for that.\n\nThe story is more structured in Lightning returns.

After a day of grinding and exploring I can say the time limit everyone is so scared of means little to nothing against the gameplay; if anything it just serves as a catalyst to make gamers fight more often (which you have to do anyway) to collect something called EP that lets you stop the clock for a set amount of time. I'm still in the first day and I've completed 5 side missions, 4 parts of 2 different main missions, and have collected much. If the time limit scares you, don't let it\n\nReview -\n\nI'll make it quick, there are no bugs in my play through so far and the graphics look amazing. The FPS can be locked or stuck on Dynamic and the graphic options are all present. The graphic options are basic however with only Normal or Advanced to choose from and the screen size stops at 1920 x 1080. I love the cut scenes, action, and combat as its different but a take on a few things other titles had; if I had to explain it I would say a mix of FFXII and FFX-2 as you can move freely during combat and switch what you do by switching outfits during combat and there are a lot of outfits to choose from. This title ends the story and the gameplay gives a sense of urgency and grandeur you don't see often, I believe this game to deliver in both presentation and execution.\n","December 13, 2015","true","124.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I have learnt that I can't play it offline, I don't know why devs like Square insist on forcing such annoying DRM's on paying customers, since they almost never work to deter piracy and only serve to deter customers who are actually willing to pay for the game, only to get the most annoying DRMs ever.\n\nThanks Square.\n\nBesides that the game runs smooth at 60 FPS on the 980TI (Not really required to max the game) with all settings set to "Advanced" which I am guessing is the highest setting of the two options for each category (lighting textures etc).\n\nThe game doesn't have a launcher anymore, it simply launches straight into the game in windowed mode and from there you can use the drop down menus to adjust the options to your liking. The resolutions for now are quite limited, especially for someone with a higher resolution than 1080p, thankfully I only have a 1080p monitor, so that's not currently a problem for me.\n\nYou can pick from two options in each category such as lighting and textures, Advanced and standard, advanced being the "Ultra" option.\n\nYou can go into full screen after selecting your resolution by either pressing LALT+ENTER or selecting the "Full Screen" option from the drop down. Note that the full screen is not an actual fullscreen, but rather a borderless fullscreen, so don't have any apps running that have a tendancy to be "always on top" since they will get in the way. You can change the settings in game by taking your mouse pointer to the top of the screen which will bring up the drop down menus again but in fullscreen.\n\nI would reccomend playing the game with a controller, since that is what the game is catering more towards and you can change whether the game shows Keyboard controls or gamepad controls, as this is not done automatically, but is an option in the settings menu of the game which I personally don't mind doing, since I only have to do it once as I am using a controller to play the game.\n\nBesides the whole always online thing this game looks and runs great, please please please take that off, otherwise I may be looking for a refund, probably the worst way to try and stop pirating, 'cos it didn't work. Don't deter your paying customers as well.\n\nFor now I reccomend this game, but I also reccomend waiting till they take out the steam cloud reliance.","December 11, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

While many people complain about the Time Limit it isn't even a big problem. With a bit knowladge about the enemies, a bit tactical skill in battles and patience not to use up your EP you're able to beat the game without any problems.\n\nI finished my first playthrough at Day 8 and skipped the last days to the 14th Day to finish my first run and start over on Hard Mode NG+. I must say yes I abused the EP Ability Chronotasis a lot but just because I always had enough EP to use it and also stay alive.\n\nThis game runs good, the only downside for many people is the DRM but for me that isn't a problem at all. You're just in need to be online to launch the game. After it's launched you don't need to be online. I got dc'ed once or twice while playing and the game didn't close so it's fine from my perspective.\n\nGameplay-wise it's a really nice system. If Final Fantasy 7 Remake get's a close-type of Battle system I'll love it. You might ask why, I'll tell you. Every enemy-type is different. Not just from the look, no and also a no to just from the elemental resistance. They also differ in the way you have to defeat them if you're not overpowering them. Some enemies need to be staggered to deal with them at the beginning and they just get shocked if you manage to attack their heads which sometimes is just possible if they attack you. Others instead need to be shocked first to weaken them, then you need to shock them once more to actually deal the real damage. There are also enemies which needs to be shocked while they are shocked to actually deal with them.\n\nAlso there are lots of sidequests. Actuall Side-Quests but also Missions from a Mission-Board which doesn't count towards the secret day. This game offers you a lot and I would buy it once again if I wouldn't have it already.","December 15, 2015","true","70.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This is a review for the game.\n\nI've played the game so far for 15.1 hours of writing this review and i am confident in saying that i have played my moneys worth - and i haven't even finished the game yet!  Much more to go.\n\nThe game works well, runs smoothly, has fantastic graphics, beautiful soundtrack and a very nice storyline. Easily one of the better PC ports of the Final Fantasy series.\n\nThis game does require internet to be played, but that doesn't bother me at all. The debate about requiring internet to play a single player game is split, and fair enough. It's all about the person who plays the game to give a care or not. I'm just one of those who don't mind.\n\nOverall, the game is much worth the price and is a current favourite in my game library. 8/10","December 13, 2015","true","15.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

SE has enjoyed quite a thorough shaming at the hands of its fans. now its our turn to return the favour and give them encouragement.\n\ni have changed my recommendation to recommend the game.\n\nHere is the plot synopsis if you dont mind a spoiler:\n\nTLDR: This game is the server reset after a long beta period basically.  some people will get a beta-test bonus if lightning manages to save them.  The rest were useless noobs who didn't send in feedback to the developers and won't get to carry over their beta characters.\n\nLong:\nActually.\n\neveryone dies in the end.  its one big crusade for Lightning to right wrongs until the last day.  and to try and save as many souls as possible.  Or to discover the ones worth saving, make them worth saving etc.\n\nIt's a bit weird in that respect.  As you approach the end of the game, it becomes clearer and clearer that this is the "final fantasy".  When the game ends, everyone and I mean EVERYONE dies.  They are gone forever.  Maybe to be reborn; who knows.  This pantheon of gods is quite  alien, they don't care much about the life they created except to gather data and see how things might occur.\n\nand as we saw in the previous games.. even their "demi gods" and "lesser gods" they created were flawed and needed to be deleted too.","December 11, 2015","true","17.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","21"

All major quests can be completed in any order you want, and the gameplay is a lot more involved than previous iterations. You don't level up in the tradional sense but instead, save people and complete quests for stats.\n\nThis game probably should have been the first in the series as it explains almost everything without using words like L'cie or Fal'cie, and if you've been paying very close attention to FF13's story, the plot will ruin itself.\n\nBut to sum it up, it goes full bayonetta.\n\nDefinitely worth the 20$ price tag, even more so if you can get it cheaper!\nSolid 8.5","December 13, 2015","true","20.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

However, none of it is really determental to the enjoyment of the game.\n\nThe graphics are 'good enough' for me to not be disapointed in how the game looks for being released two years ago. Still has the FF13 look and feel to the apearance of characters and abilities.\n\nCombat is fun, and the Garbs available make for interesting combos once you unlock more equipment. The more active style of the combat mechanics makes even simple fights a little more interesting. Yes, you could just spam your strongest skill all the time, but maybe you need to brush up on Guard timings. Easy enough to find weak badies and brush up on your own ability.\n\nMy only gripe with this game is part of the key mechanic of the game; 13 days and its game over. There is a constant, overbearing clock that is ticking down till the game ends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/recommended/345350/","klarden","Kain Klarden","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/","1232 products in account","If I have anything good to say about it, it's that Square Enix finally produced a rather good port of their in-house made game. Other than that, you will like this game only in case you: a) like Lightning as a model (not as a character) b) like what they done to the combat c) like fetch quests in MMOs.\n\nIf not, this game is an incredible dissapointment and probably the worst part of the XIII trilogy. The premise and ideas are absolutely fantastic - the world is ending, events of XIII and XIII-2 just postponed/lessened the impact of what the main antagonists were trying to do, but they essentially got what they wanted. People lived for 500 years stuck at the age they were when the ending of XIII-2 happened, no new people are being born. All that is left is that Lightning, as a Savior, saves the chosen souls to be reborn in the new world, where people can live, die and be born again. Sounds amazing, doesn't it? Sadly, the actual events to follow up on this are just horribly dumb.\n\nInstead of a brilliant dark but hopeful ending to the trilogy we get stupidly boring retread on the previously done stories. Story has flashes of brilliance in terms of ideas, but never seems to understand what to do with them. Cutscenes are horribly and sometimes amateurishly directed, dialogues (often monologues) are boring and often poitnless. mini-stories in side-quests are sometimes interesting, but tied to most boring fetch quests you can imagine with most intriguing and involved quests in the entire game being the very first one you get. Things often just happen, get dropped, kinda picked up by the end, but there's no unifying feel to any of it. Everything is just *there*.\n\nSame goes for the combat/RPG systems. Yes it is more involved and action-y than other XIII games, but it's still boring and often pointless. It's no Vagrant Story of Parasite Eve II. In terms of the soul saving, time restricted mechanics it's no Valkyrie Profile either, despite Tri-Ace working on the game. Also some features that could make first playthrough fights at least a bit less pointless are locked away until NG+ and some stay locked unless NG+ is played on Hard. Because reasons.\n\nIt's a game with a great premise that fails in devlivering on it. That has features and mechanics that have been used in much better and more fun games. That has an unsatisfying story, that could bring an interesting end to the trilogy, but instead goes for a "Lightning wet-fantasy fanfic" feel, that often reminds of Metroid: Other M in terms of how boring, self-indulgent, repetitive and stupid it is. Such a shame.","March 30","false","30.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"Do not turn off PS3 system while this icon is displayed" Apparently we are running a PS3 emulator. They have improved a bit, giving very basic graphics options for PC. The controls are for keyboard/mouse, even with Xbox controller plugged in and working. I can't for the life of me find the pre-emptive strike button on the controller. It has 2 types of control setups. That sucks. 1080p is max resolution. That sucks as well. I'm assuming you came here to know about the port. Well, 7/10 mediocre port, as expected. BUT MUCH BETTER than the previous two, it appears they are trying. The game itself? Love the FF13 trilogy, so great game here. The game is great, the port is not. That said, nothing major to complain about here, so for fans of FF you can muddle through it to experience a great game. Port/gameplay 7/10, game itself 9/10.\n\nEDIT: Seems to have an always online requirement for Steamworks. The game will not launch/play in offline mode.\n\nEDIT #2: Some people are getting massive framedrops in busier parts of cities, on a range of moderate to highend systems for both AMD and Nvidia.

Before I start, I just want to say that I never liked the XIII series, never liked XIII or XIII-2. Just to me the series was horrible, FFXIII's level designing and story was awesome and all but the battle system I had issues with, the fact that you had to switch to different modes to change what effected you or the enemy was horrible and unforgiving. So then XIII-2 came along and they fixed that but the battle system was the same, push random buttons and the battle system will choose the command for you, I hated that so much! It made the game feel boring. So when Lightning Returns came out the first time I never bought it or looked at gameplay, I just felt like it would be the same boring mess that it already was. So when I saw it came out on PC I decided to buy it. And if I hated, I would refund it. So I gave it a try and holy mother of Tetsuya Nomura did it fix a WHOLE bunch of things. The battle system was TOTALLY different and original and I LOVED it, it fixed things like the different modes and you can select the moves and each time it hits the enemy you feel succeded and that's an awesome feeling! The storyline was good as all the other Final Fantasy's are! In conclusion to this huge review I say that this is a good buy for those who disliked FFXIII and FFXIII-2 the way I did.","December 12, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

At 60fps/1080p not a bad deal at all with dynamic scenary and crystal clear graphics that are far better off than the one made for consoles. The video graphics customization is easier as well where you don't have to pause the game to tweek your settings, but instead you can tweak while you play to see your instant results which is better. Although every button or interaction that shows keyboard/mouse buttons don't be scared that this game only supports keyboard because it supports gamepads as well, but you may need time learning which button is which or if you played console versions its the same exact buttons you've used already used giving you a head start. I have not really seen any problems so far so thats actually good.

Good job finally, Square Enix!\n+ Lots of graphics options and graphics options are in-game without obtrusive launcher\n+ All DLC (excepting Aerith schemata due to licensing issues) included Day One\n+ Great story-line (this is IMO, but you either like it, love it or hate it)\n+ Very open world after first chapter and most quests can be completed in almost any order (if requirements are met)\n+ Many hours of game play and content\n+ Price is right\n\nCONS:\n- Not all resolutions supported beyond 1080P (I game on 1080P so not a deal breaker personally, but if you have Ultra Mega HD displays caveat emptor)\n- Always on-line Steam Cloud DRM (I am almost always on Wifi or tethered online on my mobile data so personally not a deal breaker, but if it is for you then don't buy the game)\n- Time limit system in game play\n\nOTHER THOUGHTS:\nLightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII (to be known as LR FFXIII from now on) is the odd duck in the trilogy, but with a highly satisfying ATB combat system, good PC optimization and in-game graphics options, breathtaking visuals and lots of content to be had, LR FFXIII is a must-play and a satisfying end to the FFXIII trilogy. 8.5/10\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDETAILED REVIEW:\n\nSo first off, let me preface this by saying that I overall have been a fan of the Final Fantasy XIII series, although I haven't finished many of the games within the trilogy for different reasons. FFXIII was hard to get through on Xbox 360 due to the linearity for about 2/3 of the game and when it re-released for PC I decided to give it a second try but found it nigh unplayable due to poor optimization and unstable frame rates. FFXIII-2 also owned on XB360, but just never got to playing due to huge backlog of games on my old XB360. Gave it a second chance on PC, but between backlog and reports of same issues that plagued the first PC release I shelved it. I own the final installment on PS3 and bought it digital when PSN had a sale for 50% off and played it some, but the PS3 version was just awful looking, played poorly and at the time I was turned off by the limited time game play mechanic in a RPG (which usually focus on exploration) before I understood the games mechanics. I didn't touch again until it came out on PC. Maybe I just have an Attention Deficit Disorder when it comes to games, but moving on...\n\nFirst off, despite my fears and misgivings after being burned on the other two PC releases and the poor ports they received, let me get this out of the way: LR FFXIII looks and plays amazing! There are quite a variety of graphics options and they are contained within the game through drop-down options (no ugly or obtrusive launcher). This is a big deal for me, because my HTPC is set up to launch automatically into a Big Picture Mode shell so it's really jarring when I have to set down my controller for other Square PC ports and mess with my wireless KB&M (first world problems, I know). There are some downsides to the graphics options. First, there's no slider or degrees of graphics options, just either Standard or Advanced (sometimes Off) which kind of sucks. Also, there's no actual AA option to speak of although it looks like there is some sort of filtering in the Scaling Display option that varies in IQ. Finally, to address one of the real glaring issues for many QHD and UHD and Ultra Mega HD display owners: only up to 1080p is officially supported. I don't see why a PC game or any application in this day and age can't query the OS for available resolutions and scale to that display. I only game on and own 1080p displays so not a personal deal breaker, but caveat emptor for those who want bleeding pixels to burn their retinas and own the high-res displays. Most importantly, this game plays very smooth at 1080p and 60FPS with modest hardware. My HTPC runs on i3-4160 and Nvidia GTX 960 and 8GB RAM and it runs constant 60FPS with all settings maxed. My laptop runs on a i7-4720HQ aand GTX 960M with 8GB RAM and all settings maxed with Display Scaling to Advanced (which seems to be less impact than Standard) and still 1080p60FPS with occasional dips to 45FPS (mostly in The Wildlands which is huge open world area so more to render) but still very playable. As far as other technical aspects, I must mention that this game requires an online connection and Steam Cloud enabled to play. I will make you aware of it, but there are some bashing the game solely on this alone and even starting "flame campaigns" against the game due to it. If it's a deal-breaker to you due to you can't always be online or you have issues with Steam Cloud, then don't buy it. If you didn't know about it and bought, then get a Steam refund. I am always online Wifi at home or tethered on the go, so nothing for me to lose sleep over. Moving on...\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, it's Day 2 in the in-game time and ~15 hours in real play time and I am loving it! The different areas to go through and explore are awesome. Combat is very deep and satisfying and requires pacing and timing between the various schemata. Schemata are outfits you equip your character with but aren't just for aesthetics: each schemata has custom abilities and enhancements, strengths and weaknesses. In addition, you can outfit your character with additional skills and attacks, weapons and shields that also have their own innate abilities and enhancements. You cannot button mash and you must think about your equip load out and attacks, especially with stronger enemies (not just bosses) are you will get you butt handed to you. There have been times where I have gone too aggressive or not watched my ATB gauge and paid the price for it, eating the full brunt of an attack. There's also a Stagger mechanic system that takes advantage of elemental weaknesses (for enemies who have them) and Perfect Guards, which is a properly timed guard right before moment of impact that encourages players to think about what skills and equipment is used in their load out along with timing of Guards. Staggering an enemy will halt their attack and make them more susceptible to attacks, both physical and elemental weaknesses. This encourages strategic and timed game play, as opposed to mindless button mashing. It honestly works very well for this game and the combat is one of my favorite things about the game, especially when you face off against an enormous, powerful foe and you still come through victorious through proper schemata and skill preparation and well-timed inputs (like the first time you fight a Reaver in the Wildlands). Now, the dreaded time limit aspect of the game. I must admit, when I first played the game on PS3 I didn't have a guide and I didn't understand the game's mechanics. The time limit was a big turnoff and I stopped playing it. First off, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND getting the guide for this game. If it isn't available in hard copy there's e-guides or PDF scans of the guide online. Second, there's a mechanic in the game called Chronostasis that allows you to temporarily halt time and eventually you get the ability to teleport or fast travel to locations you have been before, which consume EP which are earned as you defeat enemies, complete quests or are reset at certain points in the game. Get to understand these mechanics and use them to your advantage. It will make the game and the time limit aspect much more manageable. I use to sweat the time, but once I learned how to use and take advantage of Chronostasis, Teleport and EP management the game has become much more enjoyable. Give this game a second chance. I did and I'm loving it!","December 15, 2015","true","57.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Before I start, I just want to say that I never liked the XIII series, never liked XIII or XIII-2. Just to me the series was horrible, FFXIII's level designing and story was awesome and all but the battle system I had issues with, the fact that you had to switch to different modes to change what effected you or the enemy was horrible and unforgiving. So then XIII-2 came along and they fixed that but the battle system was the same, push random buttons and the battle system will choose the command for you, I hated that so much! It made the game feel boring. So when Lightning Returns came out the first time I never bought it or looked at gameplay, I just felt like it would be the same boring mess that it already was. So when I saw it came out on PC I decided to buy it. And if I hated, I would refund it. So I gave it a try and holy mother of Tetsuya Nomura did it fix a WHOLE bunch of things. The battle system was TOTALLY different and original and I LOVED it, it fixed things like the different modes and you can select the moves and each time it hits the enemy you feel succeded and that's an awesome feeling! The storyline was good as all the other Final Fantasy's are! In conclusion to this huge review I say that this is a good buy for those who disliked FFXIII and FFXIII-2 the way I did.","December 12, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's literally an entire game of fetch quests with a simple twist: there's a timer.  Every character and NPC is completely aware of this, and in an attempt at breaking the fourth wall, Lightning contually bemoans and begrudgingly accepts these countless tasks thrown her way under the guise of duty.  My biggest issue is the game could have at least TRIED to hide this!  Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING will work as follows: a person will tell you something they need, you will get that thing and take it to them, this with either complete the quest or simply lead you to the next person who tells you they need something.  While it could be argued many games work this way, in LRFFXIII there is no padding.  If you aren't fetching an item, you're looking for a person to fetch for.  I would have been shocked if a SINGLE character said, "I can help you, right this way!"  Spoiler alert: that will never happen.\n\nI'm guessing this is aimed at anyone who absolutely must know the conclusion to Lightning's story ... but this game is clearly tacked on the series.  Five centuries after XIII-2 the world is going to be destroyed in thirteen days and it's up to Lightning to get the band back together ... in heaven.  It might not be as dumb as it sounds except it's delivered almost exclusively through forced exposition that DOES. NOT. STOP.  You will different conversations spouting the same exposition often several times in a row!  Need a thing?  Don't worry, Hope will remind you every five minutes of that thing, even if it so happens you know what you need to do but you can't because the game runs on a clock.  Like the fetch quests, there is no deviation from the strict exposition-only policy.\n\nSo it's basically what it looks like, a cosplay fetch quest fantasy.  I'm not really sure what Square Enix was trying to create here but while I admit it has some charm and appeal, personally I found it too limited to put up with for more than my recorded play time.","March 15","false","6.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

This game is a load of stess.\n\nYou have 14 in game days till the game ends.  For every minute real time 'x' minutes pass in the game.  This time does not stop for menues, dialog, nor battles.  Missions are only avalible in a set time window inside those '14 days' and have requirments in them like 'find these 6 things and be at point Z at 7am sharp'   STRESS STRESS STRESS\n\nYou don't gain exp or levels from battles but from competing quests (saving souls) you do get gil (money) and items though, but overall battles are somethign to avoid.  So, again, stress.\n\nThere is a mechanic to 'pause time', for a time, but it's a finite resource in the game, only obtainable via completing more quests. In which you may be missing, or find yourself needing to use this finite resource to complete!\n\nI am curious who the desginers thought they where making this game for as so many central game mechincs run completly counter to so many who enjoy RPGs and past Final Fantasies.\n\nThe central time mechianic is by far my biggest reason to cautioning people from buying this game.  But there are plenty of other cons.\n\nDialog seems bad even by FF standards, graphics are quite poor, yes, certain things look pretty, but it seems like another step in what I feel like has been FF's direction of making certain things look good for screen shots, but everything else look terrible.  Such a large studio on such a large franchise should have everything looking much better then this.  So many just... boxs.  They may be skinned like other things, but they are a straight up polygon box.  Nothing is even bumb mapped. It's... really mind blowing for a game made past the ps2 era.\n\nBuggy.  If my controler turns off because I walked away for a while it reverts to keybaord/mouse controls and won't change back until you restart the game.\n\nLazy port. Menus literally tell you not to turn off your PLAYSTATION 3 when saving. uhg. Mouse curse floats over screen.\n\nSpent an hour just getting the setting set the way I wanted because not only do you have to relaunch the game for most of them, the 'main' setting page doesn't seem to affect existing saves.  Nope, have to load the save then open the menu and change those same settings there instead.\n\nHonestly, I have grown so disappointed in the franchise over the years.  I keep trying to like it again, maybe 'that one' just wasn't for me, trying to dawn some rose colored glasses of nostalgia for the franchise in which to grade it on a curve... but they dont' take.  Square failed on this.  This is a bad game.\n\nI would have used Valve's refund policy for the first time ever on this, but unfortunatly between the time I spent getting the settings right, walking laps in frustration, and getting far enough in to the game to get a reasonable feeling for what the game will ACTUALLY be like (which I probabaly didn't even get there, always takes a while in any Final Fantasy game) I had rung up 3 hours 'play time', one hour past the max allowed for a refund.\n\nJust skip this ones guys, Square really doesn't deserve the money. I'd go as far to say they should be ashamed, nothing contained within is deserving of the FF name. Nor a good review if it had been called something else and held at the standards any other game is.","December 14, 2015","false","3.6"," 38 of 80 people (48%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","48","38","80","4","4"

Buying this right now."\n\nWhen I first tried hitting new game, it complained about a corrupt save.\nThen once I managed to start the game, it got stuck at the loading screen after the first cut scene.\nWhen I finally managed to get in game, it turned out that the keyboard mapping was done by someone with 4 hands.\nSeriously.\nThe battle commands include comma, shift, and backspace.\nAnd one of the game keys is F1.\n\nI'm pretty sure they only released this port to remind us that they want us to only use the console releases. The very first screen I saw after finally getting to a new game, was a warning not to switch off my Playstation 3.\nWhich is good advice, as I'd be  better off playing it there.\n\n\nEdit: I was hoping that after remapping the keys, it'd become playable.\nAfter getting up the keyboard settings, it became very clear that this was never going to work when I saw that Cancel, Jump, and activate ability are all mapped to the same key.\n\nEdit 2: Managed to find a key mapping that was playable, if unergonomical and frustrating. Only to discover that the movement, menu and camera control keys are spread out across the entire keyboard. And (of course) there's no mouse support.\n\nEdit 3: I admit it. I was wrong all along. After finding my gamepad, it's still unplayable, as there's no option to remap gamepads. There are, however, two options under "Confirm Button Assignment". Bet you can't guess what that does, because I'm still not sure either as it has nothing to do with confirming anything, and certainly not button assignment.\n\nTL;DR: This isn't a port, it's an emulator. Bring your gamepad, and the entire PS3 with it.","December 12, 2015","false","6.1"," 35 of 74 people (47%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","47","35","74","8","0"

With 30fps and not-so-bad graphics at the time, the game was somewhat good. It ran smooth for the most part and never game me any issues. Square Enix then releases FF13 and 13-2 and they were both terribly ported. With LRFF13, I was hoping for much more with the huge delay they gave this port. It still seems they needed a significant amount of time to get this running perfect because it does not. Optimization is terrible. With an amd r9290x and an i7 4770k, This game should be nothing to run on high settings but it is VERY sluggish. Dropping the graphics down will fix it but it is a pretty bad eyesore to play when you had the settings on high. There are not very many graphics options either to get the best out of your experience. This game has many issues and I cannot recommend it to anyone until these issues are fixed.","January 2","false","3.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I've played this game on PS3 so here are some advice.\n- This game expects you to play it twice at least if you want 100%\n- Few Quests are permanently missable (may want to rely on guide for this) unless you consider new game+\n- Weapon upgrades unlocks after new game+\n- Do not sell your level one abilities.  It's better to upgrade it then to straight up buy higher level abilities.\n\nWell it's the last game to the saga and despite the beginning sounding all religious like with god this and god that, if you can get past that, I think the game is relatively fun.\n\nAlso play this game on a controller.  Playing this game with keyboard is cancerous imo.","December 10, 2015","true","12.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

For example if you put on Yuna's Summoner outfit the BGM will be the same as in FFX. There are also many kawaii decorations.\n\nThis time the battle system changes a little bit, it is more simultaneous.

Welp, too late now.\n\nTL;DR at the bottom.\n\n\nSo, Lightning Returns, the third installment of the notorious FFXIII trilogy. Well, first things first, the all-important question for us PC users. Does it run well? Well, yes, yes it does. Unlike the previous two titles, I'm able to get 30 fps for the most part..... I say for the most part because I find when I'm in menus it definitely dips here and there, but really, it's the menus. Also, there's the occasional spike here and there but it's not a real problem. There's no more launcher, if you run your mouse up the to the top of the screen, there's a unimmersive drop-down menu which has all the settings you desire. Well, not really. There's a bunch more options, but you choose between standard and advanced as far as I know. But regardless, it looks and plays better than it did on consoles. Some things to point out though, IT'S NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY WITHOUT A CONTROLLER. This time around, the nature of the gameplay means you'll need more buttons, and square obviously doesn't know how to make a keyboard button layout that actually makes any logical sense. It'd be much simpler if there was mouse support, but I think it may have occured to you something was up when I said you get the drop-down menu when you drag the mouse up to the top edge in-game. Yeah, there's no actual mouse support here, making it even more impractical to play with a keyboard. It's not even KB+M anymore, it's just KB. Oh, missed an important point, you need online connectivity to play. Yeah, that's brutal. Anyways, on the to the review.\n\n-----------\n\nUhhh, so basically a bunch of nonsense happens and the story of FFXIII-2 which overwrote the story in FFXIII, is overwritten again by the story in Lightning Returns FFXIII here. Welp, sure, whatever, no one's really expecting anything at this point. Anyway, bad stuff has happened various circumstances have made everyone still alive immortal. However, the world will end in 13 days and you, Lightning, obviously, have been chosen by the god Bhunivelze to save the souls of the worthy within the 13 days. And you know all the other characters show up, blah, blah, you defy fate because when do you not do that in these games. Bottom line, who really cares. I like the ending scenes though. The characters are still dull sacks of potatoes. Snow, whose was the energetic meathead, is kind of a dull sack of potatoes now. Hope, lmao whatever. Lumina, a new character, mysterious....mysterious and generic. Yes. So on and so forth. The characters are boring, that won't change no matter how many games you put out.\n\n\n-----------\n\nLet's talk about something more interesting. The combat system has been redesigned yet again and so we go from having a party of 3 in FFXIII, to a party of 2 in FFXIII-2 with 1 monster ally, to a party of 1 tsundere and her various costumes, er, schematas. You can now move in battles, albeit it's not that useful, and basically you switch between 3 schemata, each with it's own abilities and action bar. Essentially you play all 3 party members combined into one. There's realtime blocking now though. Now that all sounds great, real-time combat, moving and blocking, etc. But really, it's still arguably turn-based. You unload on the enemy with all your skills, then you save some points to dodge and block the enemies attacks. By that time some of your bars on your schematas will have refilled, signalling it's your turn again and you proceed to spam once more. It's TBS, without actually telling you it's TBS. Staggering is back of course, that's the name of the game no matter what enemy you happen to come across. Get a monster's stagger up, stagger it,unload spells, rinse and repeat. It's still fun though. This version comes with all the DLC schemata, except the Aeris one which I think is now available nowhere. So you can enjoy dressing up your Lightning for better combat efficiency or simply because you have waifu 4 laifu syndrome. Perfectly acceptable reasons.\n\n------------\n\nThe gameplay. So while FFXIII had linear everything until Gran Pulse opened up to you, which was essentially a never-ending bland field of shortgrass and rocks filled with more floating rocks that provided you with generic kill quests, FFXIII-2 had more open zones filled with gates for you to open, and places to throw your mog at for pointless collectables, LR decides to combine all those together, yay! Well, what you get are 4 open areas, some being linear city streets and other being more open plains and deserts. There's side quests and stuff to do everywhere, but the trick is, they don't appear all the time. Remember when I said 13 days, well it's really 13 days to play in these zones. Some things only appear on certain days, certain times per day, etc. Think Persona. But with 13 longer days (optional 14, hint hint). What to do when you missed something? New Game + (beating the game also unlocks hard mode) unlocked by clearing the game or getting a game over, meaning you wasted 13 days chasing chocobos...yeah, you can actually game over if you screw up the days. All the typical JRPG content is here, dungeon-type things, battle arena-type things, questing, talking to people, talking to people at different times, walking, running, yep, yep, yep. The 13 day system may feel a bit restrictive, which to some extent it is. Heck, if you flee a fight (unless you're on easy), you lose an hour of that day. But they attempted to balance it out with the multiple playthroughs. Why get it all in one long playthrough, when you could do it in multiple shorter playthroughs? I don't know, design choice, hit or miss. Some things are only obtainable on the unlockable hard mode, so multiple playthrough was encouraged by the devs for sure.\n\n-------------\n\nTL;DR = Fans and critics call this is the weakest of the series, but there's some bias considering the fact they even decided to make it is an automatic -2 points to a lot of people. Everyone believes milking the boring cow too many times only yields (insert witty phrase to make point). But this is a solid title without a doubt. It's not better, but it's not that much worse. What it is, is different. Slightly refreshing combat, larger areas with more content in each to mess with, collecting items, etc, it's got it all. Games like this, you used to be able to get them all the time. Like every week there'd be one. But now, not so much. LR:FFXIII is a little bit nostalgic, a little bit cringe-worthy here and there to be honest, but it's a content-packed JRPG with pretty aesthetics, an eargasmic soundtrack, and lots of potential for great gameplay.","December 10, 2015","true","8.7"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","12","28","2","0"

It's a decent port everybody!\n\nThis port doesn't use a launcher to start the game but instead just starts the game up from the get go and if you hover your mouse near the top of the window you will get a drop down consisting of a Quit and Reboot option, Graphical settings and a choice of 2 button layouts (where X and O (or A and B) get switched around).\nThe game supports 30 FPS (Fixed mode) or 60 FPS (Dynamic mode). It also has graphics options including: Shaders, Shadows, Bloom, Lighting and others but you can only choose from two options from each; Standard (For lower end PCs) and Advanced (For higher end PCs).\n\nI have never had a problem with the other two ports so I cannot talk from experience here but I have had no problems with this port of Lightning Returns and I have been playing it at its maximum graphic settings (that is until someone realeases graphical mods for it eventually).\nTo be honest the only problem I have had is a very, very tiny drop in FPS for about 1-2 seconds when walking into a crowded area but it goes back to 60 FPS before you can really make a comment about it.\n\nOverall it is a very well ported game in comparison to the other two FF13 games that have come to Steam and I am very happy with it.\nAnd to make it even better it comes with the majority of the DLC and it only costs £11! It's a steal not to buy it!\n\nSide Note: If you do experience problems with this port; please keep in mind that it *may* be your computer and not the game and also I am pretty sure there will eventually be solutions to issues in the community hub for this game!","December 10, 2015","true","9.5"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","9","22","0","1"

Now you can see the third terrible port, but at least Lightning is back! Figuring the new keybindings will be harder than monsters for your first hour, but by the time you start changing her clothing you will forget about that. Game starts about 500 years after the ending of the second game.\n\nI will consider you came from the previous ports so will only comment on what changed.\n\nBefore you want to kill yourself, hint: "." to access datalog etc (no longer TAB). You jump with "<= backspace"... don't ask me why, but you can change it.\n\nPROS\n+ Did I mention you play as Lightning? ok.\n+ Few more visual options, far from enough.\n+ A lot more RPG-like with more "free roaming" and side quests that actuall change someting\n+ There is a pressing time limit that ACTUALLY MATTERS (time passes as you play, you have to do stuff withing real time-frames, not like those games that say "hurry" and then you can walk around and sit because time doesn't really moves until you "trigger" the quest ... here, you can't idle, in fact there are skills to stop or slow down time so you can move/do stuff faster)\n+ You can dress her up, change her whole wear and customize colours. After you reach the Ark, go "buy" all the downloadable content (they are included free - alas they cost 0gil, but later you can sell them at huge amounds, kind of cheating if you ask me). You can even change her panties colour on some garbs if you are perv enough... over 80 garbs according ingame data. Also, weapons and shields are plentyful in both appearance and function.\n+ Lots of NPC's to talk to/with, and quests to succeed/fail\n+ ESC no longer freeze the game out of windows, but is an actual in-game pause/menu option, which is good (though at main menu, you need to alt-f4 to quit). Alt+Enter works like a charm to switch to fullscreen and back.\n+ You can save at any moment\n+ You can actually move Lightning around during battle with ASDW. No more watching your character die because randomly stood on the way of a massive attack like the other two games.\n+ You move the camera with IJKL. At first I thought it was weird and unplayable, but just sit your left hand on ASDW and the right at IJKL and every other shortcut come together. Specially good when you get how to use "u" (preemptive attack).\n+ Partial (see cons) KEYBINDING OPTIONS, change anything at your heart content (settings > keyboard settings").\n+ HP carries on between battles, so you have to take potions/avoid enemies if you win but are left with low HP.\n+ (if you like it) more action, less turn based\n\nCONS\n- Some "advanced" visual effects actually make the game look worst, might be due to video card/drivers but the other games looked nicer IMHO (most options I toggled back to "standard" because there was a noticiable FPS impact but very faint visual change)\n- Some FPS quick drops when the camera changes, specially when talking to NPC (mind you, I run the game from a SSD and my video card has 1Gb, shouldn't be texture loading ...)\n- Mouse camera movement is gone, only keyboard! Mouse is now totally useless.\n- This make fighting multiple enemies a annoying because you must also select target (arrow keys) and move the camera to see what they are doing. Best way to "mitigate" this is to keep zoomed out ("," key, you can default to zoomed out at the settings).\n- Limited potions (you start only able to carry 6)\n- Paradigm shift now is called schematas and is changed with E or U, which is very weird until you get used with the new keyboard layout, other than that, makes it more action based (no pausing)\n- While you can change keybindings, the use of some keys is the same and you can't change, for instance, "M" is the map while not in battle, and guard in battle ... changing the key binding changes both -_- ... even worse: Jump, Cancel and Attack are all the same "<= backspace" ... get used to jump with "<= backspace" or rebind to space and get used to cancel with ... space? wtf\n- If you accidentaly make the terrible choice to "Control Button Assignment Type 2", which makes confirmation the "<= backspace" instead of "enter", just move back to Type 1 ... yes, I don't get why they did this.\n- Screensaver is not turned off on fullscreen, be warned it will start during long cinematics -.-\n- Cannot reuse same garb/weapon/shield on different schematas\n- The REAL time constrain can make you rush when you wanted to explore sometimes ... not sure if a pro or con...\n- (if you don't like it) less turn based, more action\n- THE TERRIBLE AWFUL ENGLISH TRANSLATION IS BACK, if you know any shred of Japanese you will benefit a lot from using Japanese audio and english subs, so you actually get the slang or exclamations right. I will never understand why the english translation is so bad.\n\nTips:\n* To quickly back up from the enemy, use a magic skill\n* When you start and have no clue how to play, just hit "<= backspace" until the enemy dies, start learning from there ... most early enemies will die before you use all your ATB. When the ATB ends, like the other games, you can't attack or defend until it reloads, so just switch to another schemata ("E" or "U") and slash and hack again ... yes, as mentioned, more action, less turn based\n* Don't loose your time trying to control the camera in battle, just zoom out (set it as default), so you can forget the IJKL buttons and focus on the useful buttons\n* Stop staring at her panties, perv\n\nWill change review after some gameplay","December 10, 2015","true","51.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

AT LAST THE SAVIOUR HAS RETURNED FOR THE THIRTTEENTH TI- alright moving onwards.\n\nPROS:\n+Amazing Performance on a dated GPU, 670 with 2gigs of Vram, with every setting cranked up to the maximum gives me a solid 60 fps with the few drops here and there, but nothing game breaking\n+Amazing gameplay, the best kind of ATB in a Final Fantasy game and a stylish one to boot\n+Customization out the wazoo with a large variety of armor and weapons to switch between from, allows for very flexible gameplay\n+I can finally fulfill my dream of playing dressup with barbie dolls in a video game without people knowing about it\n+As for the game world, its open and decently sized, lots of quests, lots of dialogue, plenty of exploration.\n\nCONS:\n-Limited Resolution Options. For those few with 1080p+ monitors, you'll find no support here. Wait for a fix.\n-Limited graphics options - There's not even a launcher or ingame menu, its built into the top of the game window, just like an emulator.\n-The Story is absolute ♥♥♥. Seriously, the series isn't known for its great story or characters but they're literally being shoved into predictable archetypes and the story from what I've played so far is extremely limited and boring, but the story has never been core to the XIII series.\n-The in-game countdown clock may give some players majoras mask syndrome, thankfully there are ways around this but you're still racing a game clock.\n-Lightning's "assets" aren't defined enough and some of the costumes, specifically the crossover costumes, look very goofy and bizarre.\n\nI'd personally rank it above XIII and XIII-2. It's also half the size of both, only 14 gigs with both audio languages installed. For $20, this is a steal and I highly reccomend anyone who wants to support the Japanese game industry on steam, or just play one of Square's better efforts in recent years a try.

And boy is it something.  Those who didn't like the first game didn't like it because of the linear gameplay for most of the game and while this is true, it's pretty much the only aspect of the game that wasn't absolutely brilliant.  The story is fantastic, the characters are awesome, the music and graphics splendid and combat system unbelievable.  Then comes the second game.  It was still sort of linear (or at least as linear as you can make a game about time traveling), but a lot less so.  Despite losing one character in battles, the combat system was still somehow improved.  Story even better, graphics even better, music even better, characters even better.  Even the DLC were brilliant.\n\nFinally, the conclusion.  How could it get any better?  This time they threw linearity out of the window; you can do anything in any order.  Other than that, they again somehow managed to improve the combat despite removing yet another character.  It also manages to answer every question you might have gathered throughout the previous games, and delivers a story that's simply perfect and ends up with an ending that will just... blow your mind.\n\nTo recap, the XIII trilogy is a serie that quickly learned from its mistakes and steadily improved at an exponential rate before reaching perfection in its climactic ending.","December 18, 2015","true","35.7"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Mostly this is due to the focus put on time in this game.  After finishing the first day of thirteen, I can honestly say, I felt like I literally accomplished nothing.  The timing thing does away with what is, in my opinion, the stongest appeal of the FF franchise: I have as much time as I want to build up, explore the world... I can take my time and soak it in.  This game however, makes me feel like I have to skip through dialogue and not take time to learn about the world and the backstory.\n\nAdd to that the incessant talking by Hope telling you the same thing every fifteen seconds.... UGHHH...\n\nThe combat feels pointless as it doen't contribute to your experience as in other FF games and the enemies are absurdly hard (Schrodinger cat literally one-shot killed me; for something you can randomly run into in the middle of town, that is unforgivable), so I actually spent all my time avoiding combat -- again, the anithesis of what FF games are about.\n\nThis game is total head-scratcher to me.  I'm not sure why the developers would take everything that makes Final Fantasy what  it is and remove it?  Especially at the end of a trilogy!\n\nExtremely dissappointed with this game.

There doesn't seem to be a common factor yet which results in the lower framerate, with there even being people with the exact same specs getting very different results.\n\nI personally have an AMD FX6300 cpu and a GTX750ti which should be sufficient. However on the forums you can find posts of people with high end machines (both Intel and AMD) getting the same issues as I have, while some people with more modest systems can get a constant 60 fps.\n\nSo as a word of warning, know that you are taking a gamble if you pick this up.","December 11, 2015","false","4.3"," 36 of 81 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","36","81","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Natos72/recommended/345350/","Natos72","Natos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Natos72/","1611 products in account","Let me start by saying three things. First, this is a major step forward from Square on FF ports, i have nothing to complain about the port. Second, i've played almost every FF there is, but this one is probably the worst one, in every aspect. Third, this is only my opinion, it's not something written in stone.\n\nWhat i think is the worst aspect of the game is the combat. Some people might all it complex, others might say it has strategy, to me is just annoying and bad. The staggering system, that i think was best on FF XIII, is really annoying and takes away some freedom during battles, since the so called strategy is basically doing what you have to do to stagger that monster and then beat him up. Then you have the fact that most fight are useless, since you don't get any xp, potions, etc... you only get monster items and sometimes attacks or spells.\nThe enemies are also very few in variety, and you will find yourselves fighting the same enemy countless times, even on different zones.\nThe schemata is a downgrade of FF X-2 fighting style, in my opinion, and i found it way less fun.\n\nThen you have the story, god the aweful story. I really liked FF XIII story, and didn't dislike XIII-2 story even if basically had little to do with XIII, but this one, was a pain to sit through. In my opinion theys should have stop on XIII-2, and even that one was not necessary, because this game's story felt like somthing they tought on the spot. Serah was a more interesting character than Lightning is on this game. She's like bipolar, she's loosing human's emotions and only cares about saving her sister, but at the same time she cares for the people she's saving. She's a contradition. The only character that i enjoyed was Lumina, at least she was interesting.\n\nThe side quests are nice, and way more interesting than the main story, and that's kind of sad. When the optional content (here isn't much optional since it's where you'll get upgrades to your stats) is better than the main game you did something wrong.\n\nThe countdown is a nice touch and is not much of a pressure, but you will still keep an eye on the clock.\n\nI gotta be honest, i gave up on the last boss, not because is hard (i love Dark Souls, so i don't really mind hard bosses), but because i didn't find any motivation to keep trying.I didn't like the story, i hated the combat system and it was the only FF that i couldn't get 1 minute of joy to play, i was only playing it for the love i have for FF. But to me, this isn't a game i can enjoy playing, but as i said, it might be for other people.\n\n\nSo basically, in my opinion, this is a great port, way better than XIII or XIII-2 technically speaking, but it's a bad game having the story and the gameplay in consideration.","February 27","false","30.0"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

I got this for $15 at gmg but this is the last time I ever buy a Square game for PC, ever. The lag stuttering is bad and constantly distracts. It is hard core lag-slowdown-stuttering that is inexcusable but expected from Square. They are the bad port masters and this one buddy boy it shows it. It's wicked and angering. I should have known better than to buy this. Square has made me ill for years and this is just the last straw.

The 13 day time limit is not fun at all. It reminds me of Dead Rising 2 where if you fail to complete the main mission in time you can start over with your saved stats. I don't want to do that in any game, ever. I just feel very stressed and rushed while playing. Hopefully this is the last time they ever put a time limit in a FF game. I felt so incredibly rushed, especially with Hope chiming into my earpiece every couple minutes telling me to hurry up, that while on the first real main mission where you have to find the pass code symbols I got stuck and couldn't find the fourth one, which in itself is incredibly stupid mission gameplay for any game let alone a FF game. It was in no way fun at all. Without the help of a Youtube guide I would probably have never figured it out because I didn't know you could set the time to wake up at a inn to the next day. I thought if the day ended then you failed the mission, since earlier it had snapped me out of the mission to take me back to the main base when the day ended. It is confusing but i figured it out.\n\nEven more confusing is the gear system and discovering robots early on that have what feels like billions of hp and take me about 5 minutes to beat per battle doesn't help.

It says use lightning to stagger them but lightning, no matter how many times I cast it, won't stagger them. The schemata system is awkward to say the least.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/POTATOPARTY/recommended/345350/","POTATOPARTY","comrade POTATOES!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/POTATOPARTY/","191 products in account","Before reading my review, I want to make it known that my hours clocked in as recorded by steam is about 40 hours short of my actual play time, since I was playing in offline mode for most of the game. As proof, look at my achievements and youll see ive compelted the game.\n\nLightning returns, but not with a bang but with the liquid ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nHonestly, this game is terrible. Not in terms of optimization and configuration, because lets be honest here if you playing a port of a game a year or more older and from japan most of you probably dont expect much better than what the console release did. In that form it is surpisingly better, being able to give 60 fps during cutscenes and battles, higher resolutions than just 720 and 1080, and other settings for a better experience, however the frames take a marked hit while in the overworld. Apparently this was an issue even in the ps3 release since it was rushed out the door before the 8th gen consoles came around.\n\nThe gameplay however is just a complete, confused mess. The game has a doomsday clock feature where you have to complete objectives with in 13 days before the world ends. A minute in the doom clock is 3 seconds in real time, and by extension an hour goes by after 2 minutes. I didnt think this was a problem at first, but make no mistake, unless youre gifted with luck, you NEED a guide to be able to get everything done with in that time frame. Some quests are hidden, some are failable if not completed quick enough, others are missable and while in other rpg's it would normally just mean the loss of a weapon or item of some sort, in this game it means your weaker before the end game. This game does not have a level or exp system, instead growth is given from quests you do in the game, meaning that any quests you miss means your weaker when fighting a boss, or worse, the end game boss.\n\nThe doomsday clock also takes away from one of the bigger elements that rpg games usually have, that being exploration. Normally in other rpg's youd be able to explore areas, discover secrets, talk to npcs and discover things as you go along, however the clock makes the beautiful visuals impossible to take in, to the point that I have to read what npc's are saying as i run to the next objective. This relates to my earlier point about quests, since the limited time frame you have to complete objectives, yet are still expected to talk to npc's to start quests makes you have to plan out ever move you make before you begin each day in the game. Granted the one thing the game has to make completing quests easier is a feature called chronostasis, which pauses the clock for about 1 minue real time. This can be done so long as you have enough eradia points, which can be refilled by killing monsters.\n\nAbout fighting monsters however, that is where the game is the most dim. The battles use an active time battle (here on our called atb) system similar to the previous final fantasy 13 games where actions take up atb points, though the typical action such as guard or attack take up very little points. Its complicated by the fact that you have 3 atb guages. Each guage is linked to a schemata, that being a set up of 4 abilites, a garb, weapon and shield. A garb is the clothing lightning wears that also grants auto abilites but also locks one or two abilites, in practice similar to the job systems of previous final fantasy games. You switch between garbs in battle to have access to abilties you have set, such as an attack, a guard, a magic attack, etc. Though this could have been a fun way to shake things up, it only adds another layer of confusion to the gameplay. The atb guages fill rather slowly while in battle and at times you will standing waiting for the guages to to fill before making another move, that is unless you plan ahead and manage every action you take. When the enemies in this game are tanks that at times can take for ever to kill, it adds a pointless way of wasting time to a game that could otherwise move at a faster pace. Dont be surprised when a chunk of your hp was just taken when you meant to switch garbs and press the command button for guard, but accidentally switched to a different garb instead and used an abiltiy you would have otherwise wanted to save for later. Locked garb abilites for that matter means that abilites assigned to a button cannot be placed elsewhere on your list of commands, just to make it more difficulty for you muscle memory.\n\nThe game is further complicated by an ability system that makes it highly difficult to have a proper set up. Abilites come in different types, such as different attack abilites like heavy slash, elemental atacks, blitz attacks and the like, but also come in levels, from 1 to 5. Dont be surprised if later your ability list is swamped with loads of abilities that you dont know what to do with. The ui for the list is terible as well, even by sorting, it says alot that couldnt add a ui to sort by ability type. The ability system which could have been interesting like that used in kingdom hearts birth by sleep is made pointlessly difficult to understand and honestly quite a chore if not for the level system, since youre also expected to synthesize abilities, which require in game currency as well as a limited pool of items you get from killing enemies. For that matter, the garbs i mentioned earlier have locked abilities.\n\nAs for enemies, there are very few unique enemies in the game, There is less than 50 actually, including bosses, if you dont count last ones. Last ones are much stronger versions of 31 of the enemies in the game which appear after killing a certain number of that monster. After its killed, thats it, that monster will never appear again during your current playthrough. My biggest gripe with this is that such a complicated battle system, with an even more complicated ability system, seems wasted on such limited content.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, later enemies you fight can do hefty damage. In rpgs this is normally not an issue, just heal up and keep going. Actually scratch that, there is no cure spell other than curaga which uses your limited eradia points, and the only other two ways are using mediguard, an ability thay blocks attacks and reocovers hp at a snails pace, or by using recovery items which you have a very limited number of which you can hold at one time. Your supposed to be able to trade blows and do damage to tanky enemies through out the game yet some how still guard, which isnt perfect since residual damage will go through and slowly chip you bit by bit, and are expected to do this over the course of multiple battles as you complete quests or main objectives. For that matter i was at a loss at what to do when fighting the first boss. The first boss does way to damage, I did way to little and my guard ability didnt exactly do a good job of guarding. At this point I should mention perfect guarding, which a function of using the guard ability in which if I used the guard command right before the enemy attack connects, much more damage will be blocked while also possibly staggering the enemey. Staggering means the enemy will be be idle for a short amount of time and take more damage. The problem with this is that even on normal, the window for perfect blocking is small. VERY small. If youre a guarding master in dark souls, then this game will be a piece of cake for you. How ever for first time players new to the battle system, being expected to know how to perfect gaurd when im barely on the first boss its just to extreme. Perhaps if the window was bigger on normal difficulty and made smaller in hard, then i could appreciate it as a mechanic for people who want a challenge, but for now, if I wanted to play a clunkier dark souls, then ill just ♥♥♥♥ing play dark souls.\n\nThank god for easy mode","December 10, 2015","false","22.1"," 47 of 112 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","47","112","0","0"

But in this...Battle system is fantastic! I really like it. But the side quest dialogues are boring! It's fun to play and I enjoy the battles. But never ever I've got no bored with Final Fantasy series. This one is exception. You basically just run and kill and switch weapons and whatever in menu. Partially you can enjoy the main story. XIII-2 was better. Maybe this just repeats that too much?\n\nThe game actually forces you to go with boring side quests if you want develope your character.

I brought her a red doll. She started laughing hysterically and went insane. The game told me her soul was now lost forever.\n\n- main story is completely inane\n- pointless and annoying time limit\n- framerate is still terrible\n\nI'm really torn on this one.\n\nOn the one hand the gameplay is pretty decent and I would definitely lie if I said I didn't have fun with this game. Finding and changing between different costumes (surprisingly few of them are metal bikinis!) and weapon/ shield/ ability sets really motivated me to continue playing and exploring. Battles still mostly revolve around the stagger system which has a lot more depth this time around. More often than not you won't be able to dish out any meaningful damage on your opponents until you finally stagger them. However the conditions to do so vary from enemy to enemy. Sometimes you have to attack using a specific element, or use only physical or magical attacks respectively, other times you have to wait for them to attack you in a particular manner (like wait till they raise their weapon and stand on one leg) and then block/ dodge and counterattack or knock them over during the wind up. Part of me wishes they would have turned this into a proper action game (like Devil May Cry) or an action-RPG (like the Tales of series) because it certainly feels like those at times if it weren't for the lack of direct control. But, in the end, it's still fine the way it is.\nThe only thing I didn't like gameplaywise was the timelimit. In fact I absolutely hate the whole idea. It doesn't even make sense from a storytelling perspective. Because apparently ever since what happened in XIII-2 the world itself has been slowly dying over the span of hundreds of years. But only in the last 13 days God decides to bring back Lightning to collect some souls for him. Like, he really couldn't have done that a little bit sooner...?\nAnd now from a gameplay perspective, why would you ever design an open world RPG that more often than not asks you to run from one side of the map the other, and then limit the time you're allowed to explore all these areas? Even moreso when it's constantly shoved in our faces (Really. Hope never ever shuts up and reminds you - I think - every ingame hour which is about three minutes in real time that you're supposed to 'hurry up!').\nNow, what most people will tell you, though, is that the time limit hardly even matters. And that's completely true. But, you know what? That ultimately makes it even worse, in my opinion. Because when the game constantly prompts you to speedrun through the game, you're most likely going to hurry from plot marker to plot marker and NPC to NPC to finish as many story and side quests as you can before you "run out of time". But in doing so you inevitably run out of things to do about halfway through the game, which means you now actually have to purposely waste time until you reach the final day to trigger the final story quest. That's just bad game design and so unnecessary as it really doesn't add anything to the gameplay or the story.\n\nThen again, the story...\nWhat a pile of crap, honestly. What the hell were they thinking? It almost reaches fan fiction levels of disconnectivity. None of this has anything to do with the original XIII, yet for some barely explained reasons the entire main cast of XIII still plays a major part in LR's story, although they mostly just look like them and act completely differently. It really feels like this was supposed to be an entirely different game which had the FF XIII theme slapped on top of it.\nThe dialogue is pretty damn cringe worthy as well. Mainly because Lightning is probably the biggest edgelord in Final Fantasy history, surpassing even Squall, Sephiroth and Paine. I mean, come on, she can no longer FEEL anything!? She forgot how to be happy or sad? Why.............................................\nThis ties right into the ending which a GameFAQs user perfectly describes as "the most unbearably hammy, cheesy cheese filled cheese videogame ending I have ever witnessed in my 20+ years of gaming". It's a textbook happy ending if I've ever seen one, yet it doesn't explain jack sh*t, because apparently you'll have to read like 3 extra books to even understand half of the stuff that happened in this and the previous games. I think I'll pass...\n\nApart from the main story, the sidequests are kinda good though, I'll admit that. Maybe also a bit corny every now and then (Thank you Lightning, for showing me the mistakes of my past, so I can redeem myself!) but there are definitely some interesting side stories. You meet a lot of different characters and personalities, who will sometimes go out of their way to tell you their entire life story (another thing that kind of goes against the whole idea of hurrying up), but at least they actually have something meaningful to say. Some of the sidequests build upon each other in a way that you have to finish one person's quest and learn about their past in order to realize that this is the exact kind of person who can help with another character's problem. The game rarely points you directly to your destination and you kind of have to look for the relevant quest items or NPC yourself (while the time limit ticks down...).\n\nAll in all a solid experience. Out of the three XIII games it's the one with the best gameplay in my opinion, but also the weakest story.\n\nAs for the PC port. I personally didn't see any improvement over XIII-2 whatsoever. The graphic options are there, like on paper. But what does that even mean when I choose between 'standard' and 'advanced' color correction. I played around a little bit with all the different options, but excluding resolutions I didn't notice any difference. The framerate is still terrible, because it costantly jumps between 60 and 30 fps lock every time it loads a set of NPCs. But at least you can permanently lock it to 30 fps now (Yay...?). Battles ran at a perfect 60 frames per second for me (which was the same experience I had with XIII-2).","March 23","true","90.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Free dlc is free dlc so yes.\nStory = great\nFighting = great\nloads and loads of side quests, and even side quests side quests, Basically. What I am saying is, you have the average side quests " Canvas of prayers " where you just do the average stuff like collect stuff from killing monsters, you have the actual side quests where their are a ton of cut scenes and you go out and do something different, like saving moogles from tree things and then finding the lost moogles and literally chucking them in the air to get them home. Then you have the story, which raps up where ff13 2 left off. Overall, if you're a fan of Final Fantasy 13, its a must buy, If you are just a fan of Final Fantasy, then start with 13. If you love turn base combat, this game isn't for you, still has a Turn base LIKE combat, but it really make you think and what not, but not regular turn base. If you're just looking to buy a game, start with 13 2, since 13 is kinda,,,, well 13 is great to me, but some people didn't like how linear it was, but 13 2 / 13 3 is free to do as you please.

When I start playing this game I thought I just walk in stagger the enemy and then pound thier HP down like I did in earlier FFXIII series but it differents. Every enemy I face in the game have different way to stagger them and since I only have only 12 ability to work(3 schematas , 4 each) with instead of a lot of number like in the past and don't forget about guarding. Eevery enemy I face have at least one way or another to get a huge chunk of your HP if you don't guard against its attack. For example when I face nibblet in the first time I thought like "Oh what's a cute little monster" and then "thud" I have to say good bye to good chunk of my HP so that's what make this real time ATB system very interesting.\n\nFor side quest and farming. There are a ton of side quest to do to keep you occupied until the last day come for sure\nbut sometime it throw me off schedule sometime. Farming in this game is fun until the extinction system kick in. I think this is making farming very interesting since you can't just farming all day like old time because monster now can come to extinction so it make me have to come up with other plan when one monster come to extinction.\n\nSo far playing on the Hard mode NG+ now all I can say is This game was a blast.","January 22","true","78.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know how many of you care abot that, but I do. Unfortunately these drivers seem to forget they support controllers in any sort of stress or sleep, So I literally have to lean my remote on the sticks to get them to keep working. It's ugly, but if they're making an effort... Hopefully we'll see some actual success by the time 15 comes around.\n\nAlso, it may or may not run better, but there's way less going on on here than the older ones. So it's smooth, s nice, plays well and doesn't crash aside from the controllers.\n\nAs for the game... It's hard to take in, There's tons of things to do, and people to know, but no time. I switched to easy so I could stop time in infinite chains and actually get to enjoy the game. Though monsters like omega reaver make me want to flip out. also, even with dlc gear, it seems really hard to understand and You're literally building a party out of one person and stretching her thin. It's interesting and new, but I miss having other targets for enemies to hit... Hopefully the chocobo will play that role.\n\nOtherwise, great game so far. Can't really review it because it's a port.

Although my play time at the moment is very short I spent upwards of 80 hours on the Xbox 360 version.\n\nThe story is pretty good, I felt that it was a satisfying end to the trilogy. If you haven't played the other games or haven't paid attention to the story so far then it will be pretty hard to follow, so I recommend playing them first. Some of the dialogue is a little cheesy, but no more so than in the first two.\n\nThe combat system is very different in this installment. It is much more intense and fast paced and will probably appeal a lot more to those that had a problem with the combat system of the first two. The open world aspect offers a lot more to do and explore as well. You can do many parts of the story in whatever order you want, so the game feels a lot less restricted and linear.\n\nMany people are also wary of the clock aspect of this game, and I don't blame them. I generally hate being timed in games, the most notable exception for me being the clock in Majora's Mask. But after 80 hours I can safely add this game to the list. Its presence encourages you to plan out your quests, and the availability of certain events at certain times adds a fun layer of complexity. Part of the reason it works so well is that there really isn't a huge penalty for running out of time. Unlike Majora's Mask, the only thing you lose is your progress on the story. All quest completion will reset, but you get to keep all your items and abilities and whatnot. Plus it's pretty easy to beat all the main quests without running out of time. Completing quests also increases how much time you have left before the end of the world, and you can get up to 13 total in-game days. Don't let the presence of the clock be the factor that keeps you from trying out this game.\n\nOverall, I really loved this game. I spent a ton of time on it and even got all of the achievements. I haven't spent a ton of time on this particular port, but from what I've seen it's a significant improvement over the console versions and it has a ton of graphics options. More than likely if you didn't like the first two 13's then you probably won't like this one either, but this is also the one you are the most likely to enjoy out of the three. Take from that what you will.\n\n\nOld Review:\n\nI love this game. I played it on the Xbox 360 for upward of 80 hours and took the time to get all the achievements. I was really looking forward to getting it on here and I bought it as soon as it was available, but I just got finished requesting a refund. This game needlessly forces the user to be online and connected to the steam cloud, and I don't want to support that always online DRM practice. This is a single player game with no online features, I mean come on now. There was no reason to ruin this great port with this crap. I encourage everyone who feels the same way to also request a refund so we can get the message across.\n\nIf Square Enix fixes this, I will happily repurchase the game and change my review.","December 13, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","23"

I enjoyed this game so much that I completed 100% of the achievements just to ekk out every bit of game-play possible.\n\nIn this game you can upgrade your abilities (skills) and completely customize what schema you want to use.  I found that replicating what FF13/13-2 did worked out best for my gaming experience.  You can use three different groups; one as commander (melee), two as ravager (mage), and the third schema as sentinel (tank)/saboteur (debuffs) hybrid.    Following are my final set-ups that beat 99% of the game on normal mode, with the exception of a few switches to battle a couple of the final bosses.\n\nGarb Commander: Soldier of Peace\nWeapon: Masamune\nShield: Blasphemy\nAccessories: Tiger's Emblem, Dawn Gauntlets\nAdornment: Killer Shades\nAbilities: Shadownbind, Attack, Heavy Slash, Mediguard\nWhy use this Schema? Leveled up Heavy Slash turns Artemis's Pierce into a one turn killing machine.  Alternatively use Mediguard to life-up.\n\nGarb Ravager: Spira's Summoner\nWeapon: Chaos's Revenge\nShield: Summoner's Shield\nAccessories: Falcon Charm, Sniper's Gloves\nAdornment: White Mage's Hat\nAbilities: Elementa Lv. ★, Mediguard, Magnet, *\nWhy use this Schema? Elementa Lv. ★ will simply destroy 99% of the game. Alternatively use Mediguard to life-up.  Never found much else to use in the other two slots that was worth ATB Vs. Elementa, besides perhaps magnet and then something like fire or air depending on the enemy.\n\nGarb Sentinel/Saboteur: Guardian Corps\nWeapon: Blazefire Saber\nShield: Noblesse Veronique\nAccessories: Preta Hood, Runic Ring\nAdornment: Black Mage's Hood\nAbilities: Deshell, Deprotect, Imperil, Mediguard\nWhy use this Schema? Those accessories will make you immune to magic attacks.  This is my default garb, so when the battle starts you can cast Deshell and Imperil onto target then smash them with Elementa.  Cast Deprotect before hitting with Heavy Slash.  Mediguard for life-up.  Alternatively switch to Guard Glove & Ghostly Hood accessories when fighting heavy physical enemies.  Also switch Imperil with Poison for some bosses.\n\nSince the PC version of Lightning returns gives you all DLC for free (turn on DLC in the options and buy them for free in the rewards screen) most of these garbs are already available to you... starting out I did use Cloud's SOLDIER 1st Class in place of the commander's Soldier of Peace garb (along with his weapon/shield.)  The Guardian Corps and Blazefire Saber are unlocked for free also if you have a FF13 save file.","February 16","true","62.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is some choppiness from loading in some of the larger city areas, but battles and everything else runs fine for the most part. There's no need to worry about technical issues like there has been for FFXIII and FFXIII-2, previously.\n\nThe gameplay is action-oriented this time, with a focus on timing your attacks and blocks during battle that is new to the series. The game in general has an emphasis on keeping things moving, rather than taking your time to think and explore. I am an old-school turn-based RPG fan, and it wasn't so action-based that I couldn't enjoy playing. I haven't found a battle so far that required timing skills to succeed, as long as I have setup Lightning's equipment effectively before-hand so that I had enough HP to survive despite my poor hand-eye-coordination, for example.\n\nThe story is bonkers, but that's just how FF games are now.

Granted FFXIII is bland, the next game improved on the weak spots and this game sets a good ending to the series.\n\nMain points on this game are:\n-This is a great port from consoles. Supports tons of monitor resolutions.\n-Does support controllers, I used my xbox 360 one. Only thing that didn't work is vibration.\n-When you beat the game you can keep your items/skills and start New Game+ on hard.\n\nThe cons of this game are:\n-This game is hard and has a steep learning curve. If you start other games like this on normal, *START ON EASY*. You   NEED the ingame abilities and real life skills before going onto normal. Going from easy to newgame+ hard is doable.\n-The timer along with the ingame time zones make you feel rushed. This really isn't true because you can finish every quest and have a few days left over.\n\nThis is a overall good game and I would recommend it.","April 7","true","56.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishopmanny/recommended/345350/","bishopmanny","BishopManny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishopmanny/","15 products in account","The best game of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy! This conclusion to the trilogy has better, more fast-paced gameplay, more clothing, more accessories, and more lore than the first two games. Speaking of lore, the main quests and sidequests are a joy to do because they give you more insight into the world, and quite a few of them provide comic relief!\n\nThe name of the game in Lightning Returns is the Stagger gauge. Many enemies will be difficult (or impossible) to defeat unless staggered. Character development will quickly focus on builds (called "schemata") designed to stagger enemies and keep them that way.\n\nI strongly recommend starting the game in Easy mode, as in Normal mode you cannot regenerate HP and enemies are far more difficult to kill.\n\nThis game features a monster genocide option. If you kill enough of a certain species, you will permanently remove that monster from the game. This option makes it easier to explore areas, but I found the emptiness... disturbing.\n\nDo not worry about managing your time in this game, because it features New Game Plus. You will not only be able to finish the quests you couldn't, but do over every quest in the game if you so desire. This will allow you to reach apocalyptic levels of might as a one-woman army. Of course, you can use New Game Plus just to run around and take in the view!\n\nIf you have never played any game from the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, I strongly recommend Lightning Returns. Like the leading lady herself, this game stands on its own with its gorgeous graphics, beautiful music and rich story.","March 30","true","50.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not expect great things after FF13 and I bought this knowing it was very different gameplay-wise, but it was still surprising how incredible this game actually is. My only complaints are the quality of some of the models - see: dogs, cats - the odd way the game handles enemy distribution - rendering some enemies far too rare to find or only in very specific areas - and the manual movement in battle being so slow that I'm not sure it wasn't a last minute decision, making manual evasion - not guarding, actually getting out of the way of attacks - a chore and very unclear - by far, the best way to get away from an enemy is guard cancelling magic - and making use of attacks that require specific positioning - such as Blindside, which needs you to get behind enemies - very, very tough.\n\nI initially had some issues with how some places only open up at specific times or NPCs only show up at specific times, but these go away fairly quickly with how much time the game gives you, specially if you use a lot of Chronostasis - I'm done with all main quests, all but two NG+ sidequests and nearly every canvas of prayers' requests and I still have half of the time the game gives you.","January 11","true","54.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although my play time at the moment is very short I spent upwards of 80 hours on the Xbox 360 version.\n\nThe story is pretty good, I felt that it was a satisfying end to the trilogy. If you haven't played the other games or haven't paid attention to the story so far then it will be pretty hard to follow, so I recommend playing them first. Some of the dialogue is a little cheesy, but no more so than in the first two.\n\nThe combat system is very different in this installment. It is much more intense and fast paced and will probably appeal a lot more to those that had a problem with the combat system of the first two. The open world aspect offers a lot more to do and explore as well. You can do many parts of the story in whatever order you want, so the game feels a lot less restricted and linear.\n\nMany people are also wary of the clock aspect of this game, and I don't blame them. I generally hate being timed in games, the most notable exception for me being the clock in Majora's Mask. But after 80 hours I can safely add this game to the list. Its presence encourages you to plan out your quests, and the availability of certain events at certain times adds a fun layer of complexity. Part of the reason it works so well is that there really isn't a huge penalty for running out of time. Unlike Majora's Mask, the only thing you lose is your progress on the story. All quest completion will reset, but you get to keep all your items and abilities and whatnot. Plus it's pretty easy to beat all the main quests without running out of time. Completing quests also increases how much time you have left before the end of the world, and you can get up to 13 total in-game days. Don't let the presence of the clock be the factor that keeps you from trying out this game.\n\nOverall, I really loved this game. I spent a ton of time on it and even got all of the achievements. I haven't spent a ton of time on this particular port, but from what I've seen it's a significant improvement over the console versions and it has a ton of graphics options. More than likely if you didn't like the first two 13's then you probably won't like this one either, but this is also the one you are the most likely to enjoy out of the three. Take from that what you will.\n\n\nOld Review:\n\nI love this game. I played it on the Xbox 360 for upward of 80 hours and took the time to get all the achievements. I was really looking forward to getting it on here and I bought it as soon as it was available, but I just got finished requesting a refund. This game needlessly forces the user to be online and connected to the steam cloud, and I don't want to support that always online DRM practice. This is a single player game with no online features, I mean come on now. There was no reason to ruin this great port with this crap. I encourage everyone who feels the same way to also request a refund so we can get the message across.\n\nIf Square Enix fixes this, I will happily repurchase the game and change my review.","December 13, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","23"

Completing quests also increases how much time you have left before the end of the world, and you can get up to 13 total in-game days. Don't let the presence of the clock be the factor that keeps you from trying out this game.\n\nOverall, I really loved this game. I spent a ton of time on it and even got all of the achievements. I haven't spent a ton of time on this particular port, but from what I've seen it's a significant improvement over the console versions and it has a ton of graphics options. More than likely if you didn't like the first two 13's then you probably won't like this one either, but this is also the one you are the most likely to enjoy out of the three. Take from that what you will.\n\n\nOld Review:\n\nI love this game. I played it on the Xbox 360 for upward of 80 hours and took the time to get all the achievements. I was really looking forward to getting it on here and I bought it as soon as it was available, but I just got finished requesting a refund. This game needlessly forces the user to be online and connected to the steam cloud, and I don't want to support that always online DRM practice. This is a single player game with no online features, I mean come on now. There was no reason to ruin this great port with this crap. I encourage everyone who feels the same way to also request a refund so we can get the message across.\n\nIf Square Enix fixes this, I will happily repurchase the game and change my review.","December 13, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","23"

All the bad attitudes about FF nowadays is just silly. Not only does this feel like the old Final Fantasies like all of XIII, but they just keep improving the combat and refining their storytelling craft. LOVED THIS game and the other two. XIII-2 probably being one of my favorite JRPGs since Chrono Trigger. Now I can rest knowing this will be a full-on classic amongst fans. Just in case Square Enix is reading, I purchased this game at full price with the purpose of you realizing that there is a pc market for JRPGs of all kind, especially Final Fantasy. Just keep making the ports just as good as this or better...just don't forget the rumble next time.","December 30, 2015","true","88.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not to mention the weapon/shield diversity.\n\nBattle -\nI enjoyed every single monster encounter I had in this game, the battle musics are catchy and the ATB system certainly is different for me, at first it was somewhat confusing and yet frustrating, but once you get used to it you just enjoy it. The skill effects look amazing too.\n\nMain Story -\nSimple and straightforward. The game is mostly focused on questing than anything else. Unfortunately there's nothing much to mention in this, it IS good though.\n\nSub-quest -\nEven though most of them are quite bland with all the 'kill this' or 'gather this' that most generic RPGs have, the rewards actually make up for it. As an achiever, collecting items and prizes is one of the most rewarding things to me. I even got upset once when I realised that I have missed a quest and I cannot take it any longer.\n\nChallenges:\nBosses are quite challenging, you rather be well prepared or you have to know what you are actually doing in order to take them down. I haven't beaten the superbosses yet and I think I won't, I'm leaving that for the NG+, once I get geared enough.\n\n\nCONS:\n\nControls -\nI do not own a controller so I had to play on the keyboard and it's upsetting. The game has so many commands that it is impossible to reach all of them with ease during the gameplay, I have totally given up on using the camera movement one, for example.\n\nOverworld -\nI really expected the game to be actually bigger. Having only four different zones did not really satiate me.\n\n\n\nI have defeated the last boss once however I moved back to my previous save state to finish the remaining quests. I can say that having spent 60 hours over the first playthrough was enough time to enjoy what the game has to offer.\nRight now I'm at Medium difficulty and I'm totally salivating over the NG+ Hard difficulty. I'm also interested on getting the previous games as well.\n\n\nDo I recommend this game? TOTALLY.","December 30, 2015","true","71.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a conclusion to the trilogy it's very satisfying.

I enjoyed this game so much that I completed 100% of the achievements just to ekk out every bit of game-play possible.\n\nIn this game you can upgrade your abilities (skills) and completely customize what schema you want to use.  I found that replicating what FF13/13-2 did worked out best for my gaming experience.  You can use three different groups; one as commander (melee), two as ravager (mage), and the third schema as sentinel (tank)/saboteur (debuffs) hybrid.    Following are my final set-ups that beat 99% of the game on normal mode, with the exception of a few switches to battle a couple of the final bosses.\n\nGarb Commander: Soldier of Peace\nWeapon: Masamune\nShield: Blasphemy\nAccessories: Tiger's Emblem, Dawn Gauntlets\nAdornment: Killer Shades\nAbilities: Shadownbind, Attack, Heavy Slash, Mediguard\nWhy use this Schema? Leveled up Heavy Slash turns Artemis's Pierce into a one turn killing machine.  Alternatively use Mediguard to life-up.\n\nGarb Ravager: Spira's Summoner\nWeapon: Chaos's Revenge\nShield: Summoner's Shield\nAccessories: Falcon Charm, Sniper's Gloves\nAdornment: White Mage's Hat\nAbilities: Elementa Lv. ★, Mediguard, Magnet, *\nWhy use this Schema? Elementa Lv. ★ will simply destroy 99% of the game. Alternatively use Mediguard to life-up.  Never found much else to use in the other two slots that was worth ATB Vs. Elementa, besides perhaps magnet and then something like fire or air depending on the enemy.\n\nGarb Sentinel/Saboteur: Guardian Corps\nWeapon: Blazefire Saber\nShield: Noblesse Veronique\nAccessories: Preta Hood, Runic Ring\nAdornment: Black Mage's Hood\nAbilities: Deshell, Deprotect, Imperil, Mediguard\nWhy use this Schema? Those accessories will make you immune to magic attacks.  This is my default garb, so when the battle starts you can cast Deshell and Imperil onto target then smash them with Elementa.  Cast Deprotect before hitting with Heavy Slash.  Mediguard for life-up.  Alternatively switch to Guard Glove & Ghostly Hood accessories when fighting heavy physical enemies.  Also switch Imperil with Poison for some bosses.\n\nSince the PC version of Lightning returns gives you all DLC for free (turn on DLC in the options and buy them for free in the rewards screen) most of these garbs are already available to you... starting out I did use Cloud's SOLDIER 1st Class in place of the commander's Soldier of Peace garb (along with his weapon/shield.)  The Guardian Corps and Blazefire Saber are unlocked for free also if you have a FF13 save file.","February 16","true","62.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I start playing this game I thought I just walk in stagger the enemy and then pound thier HP down like I did in earlier FFXIII series but it differents. Every enemy I face in the game have different way to stagger them and since I only have only 12 ability to work(3 schematas , 4 each) with instead of a lot of number like in the past and don't forget about guarding. Eevery enemy I face have at least one way or another to get a huge chunk of your HP if you don't guard against its attack. For example when I face nibblet in the first time I thought like "Oh what's a cute little monster" and then "thud" I have to say good bye to good chunk of my HP so that's what make this real time ATB system very interesting.\n\nFor side quest and farming. There are a ton of side quest to do to keep you occupied until the last day come for sure\nbut sometime it throw me off schedule sometime. Farming in this game is fun until the extinction system kick in. I think this is making farming very interesting since you can't just farming all day like old time because monster now can come to extinction so it make me have to come up with other plan when one monster come to extinction.\n\nSo far playing on the Hard mode NG+ now all I can say is This game was a blast.","January 22","true","78.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What I am saying is, you have the average side quests " Canvas of prayers " where you just do the average stuff like collect stuff from killing monsters, you have the actual side quests where their are a ton of cut scenes and you go out and do something different, like saving moogles from tree things and then finding the lost moogles and literally chucking them in the air to get them home. Then you have the story, which raps up where ff13 2 left off. Overall, if you're a fan of Final Fantasy 13, its a must buy, If you are just a fan of Final Fantasy, then start with 13. If you love turn base combat, this game isn't for you, still has a Turn base LIKE combat, but it really make you think and what not, but not regular turn base. If you're just looking to buy a game, start with 13 2, since 13 is kinda,,,, well 13 is great to me, but some people didn't like how linear it was, but 13 2 / 13 3 is free to do as you please.

Yes. No question about it.\n\nI recommend playing the first two games, first. Story wise, you'll be hard pressed to find better if you have actually followed the entire series. Yes, you can read a synopsis in the datalogs, but experiencing the journey first hand, wins every time.\n\nGameplay is good. Initially, I preferred the FFXIII-2 combat system, but I will say that in the end I found this system to be gratifying in it's own unique way. And it does a good job at making you feel like Lighning is now capable of combat on an entirely diffent scale than her friends(and herself) were in their previous story lines.  I was not a big fan of the clock countdown in the beginning, as I hate feeling like I'm under a time constraint. However, after having completed the game, I can tell you that there is no real time constraint. In the end, I was sleeping days away at the Inn's, as I had completed all the side quests. So take your time, and enjoy the journey and the atmosphere of the game.\n\nI would recommend this game to all my friends irl, without any reservations.","December 28, 2015","true","224.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's nowhere near being a classic in the FF franchise but that's ok.\n\nAfter being pretty bummed out by the second game in the series, I was pretty happy with the way this game turned out. The voice acting/story/characters are still pretty low points but not much was going to change from the previous games. The gameplay changes were what interested me the most. The time limit mechanic actually being pretty cool and less invasive than one might think.\n\nFPS was also all over the place for me, along with some random crashes in certain areas. Annoying but workable.\n\nOverall I give this game a minor recommendation for those looking to finish off the FXIII series.","December 25, 2015","true","46.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first people said it was "too linear", and I tend to agree. I'll admit though, on my second time playing through I actually took my time and enjoyed the story a bit more (because I understood it better).  That being said there were a few parts in particular that could have been cut, like that hallway with an elevator at the end that takes you to a similar floor (repeat x10), but I digress as this isn't a review of XIII.\n\nXIII - 2 was good and certainly diverged from the "linear" aspect, and despite me not liking the characters (Noel and Sarah) in the beginning, by the end I was hooked and even bought into the (dissapointingly short) DLC. Oh, so they "ended" it like that huh? Okay I guess I wait for 3.\n\nI want to mention that for both XIII - 2 and Lightning Returns I waited until I got them for about $20, and I'm glad I did. Although both felt like their own games, I feel like they are significantly shorter than what is expected of the Final Fantasy franchise and XIII-2's story left off cliffhanging, and Lightning Returns seems to minimally patch things back together. I think that they probably should have been the same game, and that Squeenix was partially cashing out at this point T.T.\n\nHOWEVER! I'm glad I played both, and they were certainly worth $20. The cinimatics are beautiful as always and the combat is a refreshing change from the first 2. I'm glad I didn't grind out the "secret ending" and just looked it up on YouTube, sure it is a cute epilogue but the actual ending felt like Final Fantasy, and that was what I was looking for since the beginning.\n\nI would rate this series 7/10, I enjoyed it as a JRPG not really a FF, and am definitely not sorry to see it finished.","December 25, 2015","true","58.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is some choppiness from loading in some of the larger city areas, but battles and everything else runs fine for the most part. There's no need to worry about technical issues like there has been for FFXIII and FFXIII-2, previously.\n\nThe gameplay is action-oriented this time, with a focus on timing your attacks and blocks during battle that is new to the series. The game in general has an emphasis on keeping things moving, rather than taking your time to think and explore. I am an old-school turn-based RPG fan, and it wasn't so action-based that I couldn't enjoy playing. I haven't found a battle so far that required timing skills to succeed, as long as I have setup Lightning's equipment effectively before-hand so that I had enough HP to survive despite my poor hand-eye-coordination, for example.\n\nThe story is bonkers, but that's just how FF games are now.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishopmanny/recommended/345350/","bishopmanny","BishopManny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bishopmanny/","15 products in account","The best game of the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy! This conclusion to the trilogy has better, more fast-paced gameplay, more clothing, more accessories, and more lore than the first two games. Speaking of lore, the main quests and sidequests are a joy to do because they give you more insight into the world, and quite a few of them provide comic relief!\n\nThe name of the game in Lightning Returns is the Stagger gauge. Many enemies will be difficult (or impossible) to defeat unless staggered. Character development will quickly focus on builds (called "schemata") designed to stagger enemies and keep them that way.\n\nI strongly recommend starting the game in Easy mode, as in Normal mode you cannot regenerate HP and enemies are far more difficult to kill.\n\nThis game features a monster genocide option. If you kill enough of a certain species, you will permanently remove that monster from the game. This option makes it easier to explore areas, but I found the emptiness... disturbing.\n\nDo not worry about managing your time in this game, because it features New Game Plus. You will not only be able to finish the quests you couldn't, but do over every quest in the game if you so desire. This will allow you to reach apocalyptic levels of might as a one-woman army. Of course, you can use New Game Plus just to run around and take in the view!\n\nIf you have never played any game from the Final Fantasy 13 trilogy, I strongly recommend Lightning Returns.

Supports tons of monitor resolutions.\n-Does support controllers, I used my xbox 360 one. Only thing that didn't work is vibration.\n-When you beat the game you can keep your items/skills and start New Game+ on hard.\n\nThe cons of this game are:\n-This game is hard and has a steep learning curve. If you start other games like this on normal, *START ON EASY*. You   NEED the ingame abilities and real life skills before going onto normal. Going from easy to newgame+ hard is doable.\n-The timer along with the ingame time zones make you feel rushed.

By the time LR had been released I didn't think it looked very fun.  I really only wanted the story since this was the finale.  I built a good computer and found out that FF 13 was coming to steam.  So I replayed them on steam while waiting for the next one.  I never played LR until it came out on steam.\n\nThe story is split up from the start.  You get to pick where you want to start in terms of the story.  There are 4 different areas with 5 main storylines and a bunch of side quests.  Completing those main and side quest will reward you with base stats.  So you'll get stronger the more quests you complete.  The game is large so there is quite a bit of running around involved.\n\nUnlike the other two games this game is on a timer.  12 in game days which in my first playthrough was way more than enough to get through the entire main story and almost all side quests.  So don't be stressed about the timer.  Also if you don't happen to make the timer there is the option to new game plus.  You'll keep all the stats and non key items you've earned.\n\nI was very confused at first and frustrated trying to learn how exactly you are supposed to stagger enemies.  Not being able to see their stagger gauge unlike the previous games and just increasing the stagger gauge in general.  It took a while but once you learn the game is very fun.  It's basically the same as the previous games except increasing the gauge is different for every enemy.  Enemies stagger in levels, so basically after staggering an enemy once their condition changes.  They might be aplied debuffs such as deprotect or become vulnerable to certain debuffs and elements.  Some will stagger with a single perfect shield and some have to be staggered 4 times before you can even deal significant damage to them.\n\nOther than that the game can be challenging at times and pretty technical.  It requires a lot of learning to deal with enemies and their attacks.  Perfect shielding and retaliating correctly to stagger them is a lot harder in this game than it sounds.  Especially if you're still learning the basics.  Just stick to it and it'll be a fun game.","April 11","true","94.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not expect great things after FF13 and I bought this knowing it was very different gameplay-wise, but it was still surprising how incredible this game actually is. My only complaints are the quality of some of the models - see: dogs, cats - the odd way the game handles enemy distribution - rendering some enemies far too rare to find or only in very specific areas - and the manual movement in battle being so slow that I'm not sure it wasn't a last minute decision, making manual evasion - not guarding, actually getting out of the way of attacks - a chore and very unclear - by far, the best way to get away from an enemy is guard cancelling magic - and making use of attacks that require specific positioning - such as Blindside, which needs you to get behind enemies - very, very tough.\n\nI initially had some issues with how some places only open up at specific times or NPCs only show up at specific times, but these go away fairly quickly with how much time the game gives you, specially if you use a lot of Chronostasis - I'm done with all main quests, all but two NG+ sidequests and nearly every canvas of prayers' requests and I still have half of the time the game gives you.","January 11","true","54.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes. No question about it.\n\nI recommend playing the first two games, first. Story wise, you'll be hard pressed to find better if you have actually followed the entire series. Yes, you can read a synopsis in the datalogs, but experiencing the journey first hand, wins every time.\n\nGameplay is good. Initially, I preferred the FFXIII-2 combat system, but I will say that in the end I found this system to be gratifying in it's own unique way. And it does a good job at making you feel like Lighning is now capable of combat on an entirely diffent scale than her friends(and herself) were in their previous story lines.  I was not a big fan of the clock countdown in the beginning, as I hate feeling like I'm under a time constraint. However, after having completed the game, I can tell you that there is no real time constraint. In the end, I was sleeping days away at the Inn's, as I had completed all the side quests. So take your time, and enjoy the journey and the atmosphere of the game.\n\nI would recommend this game to all my friends irl, without any reservations.","December 28, 2015","true","224.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great improvements over the last two games. I won't say much but the game made me occupied for 70 hours, and I love every second of it.\n\nGameplay is totally different from the last with the combat system having a total overhaul. I love the new system where there is no more just pressing one button and the new introduction of guarding requires precise timing. It made me sit on the edge of my seat and focused on the battle.\n\nBut the game do has flaws. Expect A LOT of backtracking. There is a steep learning curve at every bosses (which, for me, is kind of good), voice acting somehow became worse than before, the combat feels cheap once you acquired some very good abilities while I find myself never using most of other abilities, same thing with schematics, and the game feels restrictive when it comes to playtstyle (you WILL end up using a defensive set up).\n\nBut the pros outweigh the cons. I absolutely love tons of side quests and bits of lore here and there. I feel connections with the NPCs when I finish the quests and I definitely love dressing Lightning up in cute and sexy outfits.\n\nFinal boss is kind of meh, XIII-2 has a better final boss. But hey!

Want to see out it ends? Hop in!

Aside from that, the game is a glorified single player MMO, fetch quest everywhere with a couple decent ones thrown in.\n\nSound: Lots of tracks from 13/13-2, some original other with sprinkles. Ambience tracks in towns felt good and almost no engrish rap/heavy metal songs. Once again, thumbs up for the japanese VA, I know little but just enough japanese to realise how deeply the translation changes (for the worse 100% of the time) the characters' persona.\n\nStory: (this space was intentionally left blank) But seriously, characters are no more than cameos, main story is bland and repetitive, side characters... what side characters? If you (like me and so many others, felt 13's writing was bad, you'll find they can, unfortunately, make it way worse.\n\nGraphics: They look GREAT, love Lighting's flowing hair, her giant head, her anorexic body, the fanservicy? bikini outfits, everything /s!

By the time LR had been released I didn't think it looked very fun.  I really only wanted the story since this was the finale.  I built a good computer and found out that FF 13 was coming to steam.  So I replayed them on steam while waiting for the next one.  I never played LR until it came out on steam.\n\nThe story is split up from the start.  You get to pick where you want to start in terms of the story.  There are 4 different areas with 5 main storylines and a bunch of side quests.  Completing those main and side quest will reward you with base stats.  So you'll get stronger the more quests you complete.  The game is large so there is quite a bit of running around involved.\n\nUnlike the other two games this game is on a timer.  12 in game days which in my first playthrough was way more than enough to get through the entire main story and almost all side quests.  So don't be stressed about the timer.  Also if you don't happen to make the timer there is the option to new game plus.  You'll keep all the stats and non key items you've earned.\n\nI was very confused at first and frustrated trying to learn how exactly you are supposed to stagger enemies.  Not being able to see their stagger gauge unlike the previous games and just increasing the stagger gauge in general.  It took a while but once you learn the game is very fun.  It's basically the same as the previous games except increasing the gauge is different for every enemy.  Enemies stagger in levels, so basically after staggering an enemy once their condition changes.  They might be aplied debuffs such as deprotect or become vulnerable to certain debuffs and elements.  Some will stagger with a single perfect shield and some have to be staggered 4 times before you can even deal significant damage to them.\n\nOther than that the game can be challenging at times and pretty technical.  It requires a lot of learning to deal with enemies and their attacks.  Perfect shielding and retaliating correctly to stagger them is a lot harder in this game than it sounds.  Especially if you're still learning the basics.  Just stick to it and it'll be a fun game.","April 11","true","94.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(This was my main concern before I decided to get it or not)\n\n2)You can save your game anywhere, anytime! (Maybe it's just me but you'll need to reach a savepoint back then in FF9 on PS1 ._.)\n\n3)You can build your own Lightning. Dress her, power her up with different schemetas with different skills up to your own discretion. You can even customize your own colours on the clothes.\n\n4)I like the new battle system where you can fully control Lightning, her movements, timing of skills etc. It's awesomely satisfying executing a perfect block or evading at the last minute.\n\n5)Good news Chocobo lovers, you can ride on your own Chocobo again in this game.\n\n6)You can kill monsters until they go extinct, that's kinda great when you dont run into mobs every few seconds.\n\n7)You can outrun monsters when you dont feel like fighting them or they aren't the mob that you are hunting for.\n\nCONS:\n1)There's a new time system on this series which many players will find it tedious and stressed to complete quests right at the beginning.\n\nBut the only thing I hate about it is that certain quests can only be done withing a certain time range, e.g 7pm -4am. Even if you talk to the npc by 1 min late, you'll have to come back the next day.\n\nTho i would say dont worry about time because Lightning has a skill called 'Chronostasis' which actually allows you to freeze time. When you are out in the field with alot of monsters or monsters which gives you alot of EP(which is needed to cast 'Chronostasis') you can basically freeze time until you decided to stop hunting. You can also cast it in town.\n\nI cleared every single main/side quests, killed every optional bosses/monsters and STILL can afford to afk a whole day away because there is basically nothing left to do except for the last boss fight.\n\nNOTE: In game time =/= Real time, every 1 min in-game = 3 seconds in real life.\n\n2)You will need to refer to online guides for some quests because you will waste alot of time figuring them out on your first try.\n\nEven though I cleared the game on my first try, I'm still looking forward to a new game+ on hard mode where I will retain my items and abilities.\n\nOverall I'll rate this game a 4/5* for keeping me entertained for the past month. :D","April 10","true","144.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best aspect of this game is definitely the combat system, mixing the XIII and XIII-2 style with a more action-RPG style, but being neither of those in the end. It's fun to play, but somewhat cluncky. You have 3 garbs in which you assign 4 abilities (for each face button), and using them consumes your ATB. You'll need to switch often (with the shoulder buttons) to ensure that you have actions to perform and don't get stuck without options. The garbs and abilities are highly customizable, which is a plus. The combat isn't great, but it's good. The rest of the game however, is mediocre. This time you have an open world to roam, but it's bland and you only have 3 settings: 2 cities, forest and desert with ruins. That's it. Sounds good, but in practice means little. And then there's the time limit mechanic. I hate it. I admit that the game gives you plenty of time to do all the main quests and plenty of side quests, but if you want to do everything then the time limit will freak you out. And speaking of side quests, that's how you get stronger this time. Fighting enemies gives you less rewards, and sometimes is a bad ideia to fight, making the new combat system less important. What i really hate about this game is the way it's designed: the game almost forces you to play multiple playthroughs, especially if you're a completionist. Even if there wasn't a time limit, you must replay the game at least 3 times to collect "everything" (it's very subjective here). Problem is, the game becomes boring after that. Getting "100%" in this game is a chore. Most of the side quests are boring. Travelling is boring. And it shouldn't be that way. The rest of the game isn't great either: the graphics are just OK, the music isn't memorable, and the story sucks. Like i said, playing the game once (and on easy difficulty) is OK. Replaying it isn't. The combat is good, but doesn't make up for the rest of it. I even prefered XIII over this one in the end. The PC port this time is actually decent, but i won't praise it because all PC games should be optimized in the first place. I recommend it on sale with caution for completionists.","May 28","true","128.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For me at least.\n\nIt's one of those "this one thing" is a non-starter for me, and that is, drumroll please badadadadadadada tss, lack of mouse support.\n\nSeriously gaming with two hands on the keyboard is something I have never done. I suppose with enough ,practice I could find the right flow, and it would come natural, but after 15 years of gamin, this is something I've only seen done when two dudes were playing a flash game together. What compounds this process is that when you change schematics, they come with abilities that are binded to their own button. So, you can have 3 schemes at a time, and switch between them. So i set guard as the F button on two, only it moves to space bar on the 3rd. I go to that one, hit F to guard and OOPS, hit in the face because I can't establish any kind of muscle memory for the controls. Believe me, I tried different configs, nothing feels natural, comfy, or something I could see myself getting used to without 40 hours of practice.\n\nSo the actual game. Time limit that is inconsequential with some basic understanding of an ability called cronofreeze. Lots of combat that looks flashy but feels hollow for some reason. Great art style, dialogue. Solid plot it would seem, and hollow world exploration. Everything just feels, kinda empty.\n\nShould you buy this game? Do you own a pad? Then maybe it'll be boatloads of fun, I dunno.

What's the issue with it?  It's drastically different from your other Final Fantasy titles.\n\nStoryline;\nThe end of the Lightning Saga, wrapping up the Fabula Nova Crystallis universe. And man, what an ending! The storyline is kind of spread thin; the bulk of the storyline is on the Final Day. In order to unlock the Final Day, you need to gain Eradia, the bulk of which is gained from saving the souls of some familiar friends. It's a very hit-or-miss storyline; I can see how people might not like it, but for me, it's one of my most favorite stories of all time.\n\nGameplay;\nThis is where the drastic changes come in. While the previous FF13 games were more relatable to turn-based games, Lightning Returns is more relatable to action games.  Some fights require you to move around the field in order to strike a specific part of an enemy.\n\nYou have 3 "schemata" each with their own ATB gauges. Using actions require different amounts of ATB, with your other schemata's ATB gauges recharing while they aren't currently in use.  There are some action elements, like Perfect Guards and Perfect Attacks, where you perform guards/attacks on a specific frame in order to reduce damage to 0/increase damage.\n\nAlmost immediately from the start, the game becomes open-world.  While you spend the first 15-20 minutes or so in Luxerion, you're soon given free reign over the 4 different regions; enemies are all relative in strength for the first 7 days.  After the 7th day, they get modifiers to their HP, Attack, and Magic stats.\n\nDifficulty;\nIt may just be because I'm terrible at action games, but even on normal mode, I found this to be the most challenging Final Fantasy game i've played.  One of the story bosses in The Wildlands means business, it took me an hour or two to find the right setup.\n\nThe superbosses are an insane challenge.  Aeronite in particular - you've got to take off 8-9m health within 3 minutes.  The first few times I attempted him, I was barely able to take off 3m before he took off.  I ended up completely cheesing it with a whole lot of ethers.\n\nMusic;\nI may not have been listening too closely, because I didn't catch much, if any, songs unique to Lightning Returns.  It uses a mix of music from FF13 and FF13-2.  Luckily only the good tracks from 13-2!","May 27","true","46.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
