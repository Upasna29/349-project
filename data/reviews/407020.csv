The attempt is there, it's a unique concept, but a far too expensive one with far too little content available.\n\nMy first impression from reading the description of the game was that there would be multiple roads to walk down, and it's ultimately left up to the player which roads to take. This is not the case. What you do is hold the right arrow key, continuously walk right, and stop whenever you hear music playing so that you can trigger events.\n\nThere are multiple ways to trigger events, and there are a total of 18 events to trigger; each one with their own achievement. However, in a mere 22 minutes I unlocked 14 of the 18 events. This game isn't very long at all, in 50 minutes I unlocked all of the events, and at an asking price of nearly $5.00 CAD it's just not worth it.\n\nI could defend the value of the game if the graphics were more than 'stylish' silhouettes with backgrounds that would've taken a couple hours tops to make in Photoshop. The fact that Star Sky has the same look and feel to it that any browser based Flash game does really doesn't help to push this game at its selling price, either.\n\nRating: 2.0/5.0  - It's not awful, but it's not great.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 25, 2015","false","0.8"," 67 of 78 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","67","78","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/407020/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Summary:Star Sky is an atmospheric walking simulator with doubtful outlines of a story. All you do is just moving forward, and stopping in a specific moment when you hear magical sounds. That causes some event to happen, which also gives you an achievement. And... that's all, folks!\n\nAll you do is just trying to find all the right combination of positions where to stop, to unlock all achievements through several playthroughs. This should be a relaxing experience but to be honest, I think I'd be better relaxed if I just played my favourite music and closed my eyes, than after a hour of playing (moving forward in) Star Sky.\n\nPros:- Nice atmosphere. All the effort goes there towards the visual style and ambient sounds.\n\nCons:- Boring. I like most walking simulator games, but this is just trying combinations of events to see a magical nonsense.\n- Short. Few minutes for those who will turn off and uninstall the game after the first playthrough. About an hour for those who want to get 100% achievements.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 10","false","3.9"," 38 of 47 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","38","47","2","0"

Kind of like Tai Chi. This is more of an experience than a game, as you walk through a lovely evening landscape, going through different experiences. Some of them are quite magical. The whole game is all about relaxing and not rushing. While it only takes an hour to accomplish everything there is, I know I'm going to be revisiting this one quite a bit for its aesthetics and its meditative qualities.","March 17","true","1.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","1"

There are a handful of different endings and a few different events that can happen within one nights play-through or many.\n\nGraphics: The one thing this game has to offer, if nothing else, is how pretty it is. It's so simplistically gorgeous and really sets a bar for how it should feel; atmospheric, magical and mysterious.\n\nSoundtrack: There isn't really much of one either. It's just the 'magical sound' that plays when you are close to a trigger event spot and honestly, it's trying a tad too hard to be whimsical and deep when it lacks a lot of content to be such.\n\nFinal Conclusion: It's a tad bit pretentious with its 'I'm Adele kind of deep' take on itself, because in reality, it would need a lot of work and a lot added to it to in fact.. Be deep. It's pretty, and has good ideas, but doesn't execute them in such a way that feels meaningful - It just leaves you in awe of a pretty thing for a minute or so.\n\nTrigger spots aren't distinct enough for them to stick within your memory - This is annoying simply because you can't step backwards, this means that even if you misstep once just outside of the trigger-zone, you have the replay the entire walk to find that spot/sequence of events to trigger and ending or scene. This would be fine to do if the environment changed substantially, or the events changed and it was just all random, but it isn't. It's the same thing over and over again that you have to reply to ~see all there is to offer~\n\nI understand the idea of what the game is trying to achieve in the "You can only move forwards" insinuation, as well as the making you patiently wait for your desired result, but even with those stretches it doesn't justify not being able to correct errors you may make a long the way. While you cannot erase them, you can fix them - the inability to walk backwards completely role-blocks that.\n\nAt the end of the day you really take what you want from it.\nIt is a pretty looking game, it won't cost you much to experience it, and despite all I have complained about, I'd still suggest you go play it for yourself.\n","January 25","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/407020/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","As the developer makes very clear, Star Sky is not a game for everyone.\n\nIn Star Sky you take control of a nameless man taking a walk through the countryside late at night. You walk from left to right, and your only controls are to walk, run, or stop; there is no way to go back. If you feel so inclined, you can simply run all the way through the game world in a couple of minutes flat, but that defeats the purpose of Star Sky entirely, which the developer states is to see everything there is to see -- to experience all of the game's events, in other words.\n\nEach of these events is either available every time you play the game, or is unlocked by past events, either in your current or a past play through. You can't see all of the events in a single play; I played through at least a dozen times before unlocking everything.\n\nBut the point is not to rush, or at least, that's what I took out of it. Instead, you should just walk along, enjoying the atmospheric sound effects and eye-soothing art, and letting the game guide you to each event. Try different combinations of events, and take hints from the names of the events, which you will see at the end of your first play through.\n\nThe sound, as already mentioned, is lovely. The graphics are very pretty, with everything shown in silhouette against the night sky, although I must say I wasn't too impressed with the character animations (apart from the woman when she runs, which seemed to me to be quite good).\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Star Sky as a unique experience, to relax and just think about things for a couple of hours in an evening. In my opinion it's not great value at full price, given the length of the game, but I'm still happy to recommend it to anyone wanting a mellow experience that's different to pretty much everything else on Steam.","January 30","true","1.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, it seems fo me that some developers are going too far in their attempt to create "artistic" games and are actually creating products that are entirely devoid of any significant experiencie to the player. Star Sky fits unfortunately in this category. It can barelly be called a game at all since the only playable aspect of the game is to move the character forward (he doesn't go other way), while standind still at some points of the screen which enables certain effects (as rain, for instance), and the different combinations of what you do produce differente effects that, in the end, unlocks achievements, but have very little inner significance to the player. Star Sky relies almost entirely on the interest of the player to unlock achievements since the "rewards" to the player's actions in the game are irrelevant. The interface the game presents could be potentially used to tell an interesting and engaging story, but Star Sky is not.","December 25, 2015","false","4.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The biggest pain in the ♥♥♥♥ is figuring out what to do and when. The developer has a walkthrough guide for all the achievements, which can be found here[www.jm-j.com]. Honestly, it took me so long to figure out how to get one achievement and usually, you have to do one full run through to get one achievement. This game is not worth it, if you're the type of person to play for the achievements.\n\nArt/Music/Sound\nThe art is actually so beautiful. It's really well done and it just makes you feel calm. Even the background you get from crafting the badges are beautiful. The music is kind of non-existent in this game because it's triggered by unlocking an event that coincides with the achievements. The game isn't silent though, because there's ambient night noises playing in the background, like crickets chirping and the occasional owl hoot. It's the kind of background noise you would study with, which is hit or miss, depending on the type of person you are.\n\nStory\nNon-existent. It's just a walking simulator. It's more about the exploration.\n\nTechnical Issues\nSteam overlay does not work if you Shift + Tab in game, which really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off for some reason. Controller support doesn't even work. I have an Xbox 360 controller and I could not, for the life of me, get it to work with the game. It's not like you need a controller because the only action you can do is move right, but it's annoying when a game uses the "Full Controller Support" tag and then the controller doesn't even work. I don't know if this is just an Xbox controller problem or just a controller problem in general. Nonetheless, if you were planning on playing with a controller, it won't work.\n\nVerdict\nI really thought the game would have been better. I'm glad I bought this on sale with the money I made off of the community market because it is not worth full price. It's way too short and it has many problems. The lack of story, confusing and often rage-enducing gameplay and really beautifully done art does not go together at all. Also, I did not spend over 9 hours playing this game. I played for the achievements and idled for the cards (which by the way, is a great market to get into because those cards cost a lot). It missed the mark so much. 3/10","January 30","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
