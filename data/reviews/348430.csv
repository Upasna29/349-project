This sequel takes to mechanics of the first game and adds a simple yet complex tweak to it. Controlling two (or more) droplets on the screen at the same time!\n\nThe game even has a few remixed versions of levels from the first game, but that you must solve in new and challenging ways! A few other mechanics have been implemented to allow for a greater variety of level designs.\n\nJust as polished as Quell, and with even more beautiful music, Quell Reflect is truly worth any price as a sequel, and is amazing even as a standalone game. I really recommend picking this up today!\n","May 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Perhaps play it when you're finished with the first and third games in the trilogy.\n\nIndeed, it feels like a direct follow-up to the first one, expects you to have played it, and ups difficulty a lot, mostly through the increased number of moves needed to finish most stages. It also lacks a bit in new mechanics.\n\nFinally, don't bother with achievements: getting perfect moves everywhere will take you too long, and get you nowhere.","May 30","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can start with this one.\nIf possible, though, I'd recommend playing the whole collection in the proper order: Quell, Quell Reflection and Quell Memento.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nCopy of my review for Quell, as it applies to this one:\n- The levels are well designed with a difficulty going from easy to hard (but not too hard) levels\n- No timer at all\n- You can play as as little as you want and continue where you left off or go back to previous levels to complete unfinished objectives\n- A few levels are hard to finish but a perfect number of moves but there's no penalty for retrying them (there's even an achievement for that!) so you can be persistent or use coins that you obtain by perfecting levels\n- Finding and getting the jewel in every level gives you a different objective\n- Not a huge number of puzzles but more than adequate for the price\n\nIt's very well done too:\n- Graphics, music and sound are nice and polished\n- Graphic options work as the should (several fixed resolutions, full screen, windowed mode)\n- Music and sounds can be muted separately\n- Movement can be controlled with keyboard\n- Resetting a level or going to the next one can also be done with keyboard","April 22","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game introduces some new mechanics from the first game but they fit in nicely and add some nice variety. Like the first game its not too challanging unless you're going for the perfect solution. I would reccomend buying the whole Quell collection.","April 14","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Much of the same is presented but of course there are brand new puzzles to lament over. Take the break every now and then with Quell Reflect in your mind and soul.","December 14, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StephenStrange/recommended/348430/","StephenStrange","Dr. Strange","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StephenStrange/","677 products in account","I love simple puzzle games.  By "simple"  I mean sparse game rules or elemnts and deep logic or thinking to solve them.  I also appreciate progress that is measured by number of moves or thinking and not high speed or split second button pushes.  So, some of my favorites are, Bejeweled Twist, Gyromancer, Cogs, KAMI, LYNE, Zen Bound 2 and so on.\nQuell: Reflect fits right in with those.\n\nI have never played the other Quell games before.  But I will now.\nI did get this game on a great sale, but it is well worth the full price.\nThe puzzles are seemingly simplistic in design, but very challenging.  I have to be careful how long I play because the time will pass very quickly while doing so.\nFinally, the visual design is very interesting and well done.  I enjoy the overall theme of the game graphics and colors that are chosen.  The experience is very relaxing and definitely not boring.\n\nIf you appreciate the type of puzzle games I described or like any of the ones I named above, then I would give it a closer look and see what you think.","January 30","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
