I'll be honest, I went into this game expecting to hate it.  I'm happy that I was wrong and I offer my sincere apologies to '11-Bit Studios' for doubting you! A respectful bow and a tip of the hat to you! :)\n\nThis gem flew under the radar for lots of people. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll not be disappointed! The UI is very slick looking and responsive. It's also easy to pick-up and play thanks to a simple control scheme and well-done tutorial system. You can feel the passion, time, and quality, that the developers poured into this game. The production values alone are impressive. If you're just looking to have a good time and kick-back with a genre you know and love, stay the course! But If you've got a wii-touch of Sadism inside you that craves a seemingly unfair situation, like me, then the game has plenty of challenges to quench that hunger, too. Especially during that last couple of Campaign Missions.\n\nThat isn't to say, the game has no flaws. There are moments during the story, that are cliche and can be seen coming a mile away. While having a fully voiced cast can add a lot to a game experience, it only takes one person to ruin it. Certain cutscenes (seems like the unskippable ones?) move your camera/focus towards a scene on the other side of the map, without pausing the action. I've lost count of how many units have fallen in the line of cutscene-fire. A dislike of mine that probably doesn't bother anybody else, is the Commander's skill-set. The skills themselves are fine. It's the fact that the Commander is unable to offer any regular(gun) damage of his own. Even if it's just a tiny amount...every little bit, counts.\n\nSince I don't wanna end this review on a sour note, I definatly recommend this game","April 19, 2015","true","4.3"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","0"

Its a top down somewhat tower defense game... only in reverse. You lead a squad of vehicles that must take clear cut streets through enemy defenses, but you select the route and your caravan just keeps following the path you set for them. So imagine a train that cannot stop on a tracks with multiple paths. If something blocks your train track, you divert your train at the next intersection by going to a tactical route map and just clicking on the intersection to point their next direction to head in. Its really as easy as that. You don't control the vehicles so much as just point out the route to take. You do have a player character to control. There is a 'speed up / turbo' button to make the game go faster.\n\nSince you're going through a warzone, the enemy has turrets, and other defenses setup to slow you down. So this is like you play the part of a GPS and they'll do the fighting as they come upon enemies. You can buy more vehicles for your caravan, upgrade current vehicles (for the same price as buying them new) and assign their formations. Like do you select a less defensive more offensive vehicle to go first or do you select a more defensive less offensive vehicle? Another thing to consider is range of attack. The 'attack crawler' vehicle has a longer range, but it is considerably weaker than the 'defender APCs.' Eventually you'll get shielders that will provide a shield for the vehicles directly in front and in back of them in the caravan train. There are also tanks that you will unlock later. In all the game's player vehicles seem limited in diversity.\n\nAs a commander, you have abilities that you collect. The first is to repair your vehicles in a radius of where it is used for a specific time as the train keeps rolling. Your player character isn't limited to staying with the caravan, he can go out and wander to find things. This is a very simple yet engaging. The only downside is the controls could be better. A lot of times my commander was accidentally walking all over the place when I wanted him to repair things. Just because you hit the abilities menu, then select the ability with the mouse. Well when you use the mouse it makes your player character walk. The other abilities are, smoke screens that will cover vehicles in a radius preventing some cannons from hitting them and then decoys that will attract larger cannons that would otherwise accurately hit your vehicles in a smoke screen. Finally, there is a bomb target to bluntly bomb enemies. It might seem cheap, but it is useful for wide beam cannons that keep streaming a draining vehicles.\n\nEventually the challenge outweighs the fun just gets too much on even the normal difficulty. When you have limited resources, money and enemies keep getting more and more powerful, such as giving enemies a damage radius to every bullet and enemies that ressurect destroyed towers. Once one of your vehicles is destroyed, I find myself wanting restart from the last checkpoint, because I know that one vehicle down will make my train too weak to beat later levels.\n\nEach level seems healthy time wise and you get to select your level of difficulty. It is definitely worth a play. Good instructions, good voice work explaining everything in a simple manner.","June 26, 2013","true","18.2"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","31","35","0","0"

You command your forces to destroy the enemy tower machine in your way. You will need to pick the best units combination then choose the best route for your troops to attack the enemy and then complete your objectives, but you can't just let your units attack alone like a rambo, your units are not in unlimited supply, you need to look after them. You can use some ability to help your troops destroy the enemy and survive the mission, like repair damaged units or call in airstrikes. Without these ability, your troops will surely get killed and you will fail, so keep an eye on them.\n\nThe graphics of Anomaly: Warzone Earth is beautiful, not so advanced, but very pleasing on the eye, perfectly crafted. From the UI to the battlefield, they're all good. This also comes with great performances.\n\nThis is one of the best tower-defense game I ever played.

I was incredibly impressed.  The menu and UI is slick, the control scheme is well thought out and plays almost entirely with the mouse right out of the box.  It has controller support and touch control support (mobile game) and the backgrounds and models are beautifully rendered and look high quality.  The gameplay is interesting too - it's kind of a reverse tower defense.  I found it refreshing and fun, and the difficulty really ramps up in the later levels.  I played on Casual, if you turn it up to really hard I'm sure it would knock your socks off.  There are also online leaderboards and automatic ranking notifications, challenge modes, and it's fully voice acted.  Everything in the game screams care and quality.  No corners were cut and you could tell the developers spent the time to make sure things were done *right*.\n\nAnomaly is good for pick up and play gaming, but I think grinding it out would get tedious after awhile - it's great for mobile gaming and to kill time a level at a time on the PC.  I'd recommend picking it up if you're looking for something to play intermitantly or giving it a shot if you picked it up in an indie bundle and have it sitting in your library.

You're in control of "invading" units in pre-built maps. At the beginning of each stage, you select your squad based on money you have. You can set/change route of your squad any time you want, change their formation, upgrade their abilities, sell/buy units during mission. You'll have different goals like getting to the end point, destroying some towers along the route, escorting safely some unit to the end, etc. Enemy towers doesn't respawn (in most levels), nor upgrade, so you can plan your strategy ahead.\n\nBesides your squad "on rails", you control the commander - unit which can freely roam the field. His mission is to provide help to your squad with healing, diversions and air strike. He can also be killed, but he respawns after several seconds, unlike other units. Commander is equally important as your other units, so you must learn to use him wisely.\n\nOnce you get familiar with game mechanics, you can finish this game with almost same unit formation every time on any difficulty, but nevertheless, game is addictive and very fun to play. I highly recommend playing in combination with steam achievements which adds interesting tasks to do during missions (which also makes the game more difficult).\n\nOverall, if you like tower defense games, you probably won't regret getting this game.","December 27, 2015","true","38.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

But was I wrong! This is actually surprisingly well made and fun for the most part of it!\n\nFor the main game there is 14 missions and 3 side (Bonus?) missions. Now don't get me wrong that sounds like a small number but there is pleanty of awesome gameplay and things to do to keep you interested for hours! Hence, here is my thoughts on it:\n\nPros:\n‚ô¶ Great Graphics\n‚ô¶ Amazing Voice Overs (Every game needs high quality voice overs like this one)\n‚ô¶ Awesome Gameplay that is challenging at times and will take you hours to finish (It took me 12.5hours to get all but 2 achievements)\n‚ô¶ Medals per level make the game that little bit more fun and challenging (This is an awesome concept that makes you want to keep playing to get them all)\n‚ô¶ 44 Achievements with achievements per level (This is epic as there is not only gold medals to achieve but individual achievements per level for doing certain challenge type things unrelated to the levels main objects which keeps the levels interesting for a longer time)\n‚ô¶ 3 difficulties per level (These add an even more challenging and fun aspect to the game)\n‚ô¶ Steam Trading Cards\n‚ô¶ Leaderboards (Even though some of the scores seem impossible to get, this is a nice addition as each level is ranked individually and you can compare your score to friends and the global Steam users which adds a nice competitive aspect to the game)\n\nCons:\n‚ô¶ Bonus levels Baghdad Mayhem and Tokyo Raid seem repetitive (This is bad as they are wave based and just seems like the levels were last minute as every wave is the same)\n‚ô¶ Bonus levels are numbered weirdly (Levels 1 and 3 are in Baghdad Mayhem and 2 is in Tokyo Raid. IMO they should have made them seperate from each other as they pretty much are)\n‚ô¶ Tokyo Raid's highscores seem unreachable (I destroyed almost every tower bar like 3 and was nowhere near number 1 highscore)\n‚ô¶ The way you unlock some Medals seems unconsistant (For example Directiveness in one level may be really straight forward and then you do the same the same things you did in the next level to get the directiveness medal and it doesn't unlock which is really annoying)\n‚ô¶ Story could have been better (Seemed kind of lame to me, some may enjoy it though)\n‚ô¶ Some Cutscenes seemingly don't pause the game which is annoying as I've come back to the game to find my unit die due to the timing of the cutscene (Really annoying as you only have limited money per level!!).\n\nOverall, for a Reverse Tower defense where you control the units the game is on par with many hours of fun, challenging and competitive gameplay to be had. Despite the repetitiveness of the Bonus levels and the bad Storyline the game is interesting, has many achievements and you will enjoy playing it and coming back to better your score or beat your difficulty or even beat your highscore or your friends! Well worth buying and playing if you are appealed by the concept of Reverse Tower Defense!\n\n","April 23, 2015","true","12.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

There are several different enemy towers, and each one can pose a serious threat if you don't approach it with good strategy. And in addition to encountering various tower setups, the game often throws other challenges your way too, such as needing to get across a bridge in the area before it gets destroyed, or having to evade powerful area artillery strikes from the enemy, and so on.\n\nThe game is really fun if you like tactical gameplay, but it's also pretty relentless and hard, even on Casual difficulty. If you're looking for a casual, relaxing game, you won't find it here. But if you're seeking a challenge, you'll be right at home. Unfortunately the game's checkpoint system can sometimes work against you. If you happened to reach a chekpoint when you're low on ability supplies and your vehicles are in poor shape, you might find yourself unable to make progress past the next area, and returning back to the previous section becomes impossible after a checkpoint. These times could cause you having to restart the whole level from the beginning.\n\nIn addition to the 14 campaign missions, you also get some bonus challenges (Baghdad Mayhem and Tokyo Raid) which you can try out, where you're given a series of tasks (not related to the story) in an area and you must complete them. Overall, the presentation is pretty good. Great visuals, adrenaline-pumping music, and nice voice acting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/91200/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","The premise behind Anomaly: Warzone Earth is that of reverse tower defense. Instead of setting up your defense towers in lanes and waiting for the enemy to attack, your job is to attack towers that have been set up by aliens through various campaign missions. While this may sound like it makes the tower  defense genre more interesting, and provides a much needed change in a fairly strict genre, the truth is, it does not. Graphically, it's serviceable. The developers did a decent job porting the game from mobile devices, even though there aren't that many options besides resolution. The artwork varies from creatively rendered post-apocalyptic cities around the world, to alien structures and weaponry. Voice acting is below average, but it isn't too bad. The British accent in particular sounds fake and over the top. As for the plot, it's your below average teenage action science fiction with very little substance and grossly lacking in twists. Overall,  Anomaly: Warzone Earth is predictable from beginning to end, if you can stomach finishing the game. From its presentation, to the mechanics, to the storyline, there isn't anything that rewards the player, or provides a sense of accomplishment and value. Playing the game feels more like an annoyance. It also suffers from a severe lack of depth and range. There are only four unit types, six enemy types, and only four commander abilities that can only be activated if you pick up their ability icons that are dropped on the map by supply planes. There is very little variation from mission to mission, and even though upgrading your units is an option, there is very little reason to do so, as you will need to get more units on the field instead. Having only one or two upgraded units go through the lanes is guaranteed suicide. Another very serious problem with Anomaly: Warzone Earth is the difficulty. Even at the easiest setting, there will be some more advanced campaign missions that are nearly impossible to beat unless you do exactly what the developers wanted you to by design. There is no choice to be made. Finishing those artificially difficult missions is not due to skill or through learned strategies, but by saving and repeating the same abilities you have been abusing of throughout the entire campaign. There is no strategy nor skill involved. You simply repeat the same steps over and over, for every mission. It doesn't really matter what enemies you are facing, or what the pointless mission objective is. The game gives you a false sense of decision making, and a false sense of strategy. It feels like all actions being done in-game are worthless and with no consequences. It's almost like the game plays itself. Only needing you to click a bit, instead of looking stupid as you poke your phone or your tablet, if you were playing on the game's original mobile platform. There are many other tower defense games that provide the player with actual choice of action and strategy. Anomaly: Warzone Earth does nothing to make the tower defense genre better. In fact, it makes it worse.\n\nAnomaly: Warzone Earth is mediocre.","March 20, 2014","false","5.4"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

It will not give you many ways to accomplish missions, most of the times the scripted events are so obvious that you will know for sure when an ''anomaly'' hits the short route you decided to take, giving you only the choice to switch to the longer, more risky route.\nDespite of these scripted events and a bit of failed voice acting from every character, this is a very good game. It's refreshing an old, almost lost genre.\n\nPros:\n+ Tower defense at its best, plus somethig more\n+ Suspanse at every corner, especially on higher difficulties\n+ The AI is surprisingly good for an almost indie game\n+ Nice and simple leaderboards display, depending on the difficulty you play\n\nCons:\n- Short campaign; tiny fast-paced levels\n- Scripted events will become obvious before they even happen, after 1h of gameplay\n- The buy/sell/upgrade function is simple.

What started out as fun turned into annoying and micro. If you want to be any kind of efficient at the game you have to micro your units order to keep the damage off of them. Adding to that you have annoying missions. I just completed an escort one, I mean what is that doing in this kind of game? I just couldn't keep myself playing, felt more like I was forcing myself to beat it rather then enjoy it. I won't finish.\n\n(Old review based mostly on Demo) : Great twist on the tower defense genre by reversing it. Instead of building towers to defend you are maneuverings to destroy them. The strategy elements are there in the tactical view where you tell the units what path to take. However you only directly control a single unit which has four abilities to support the units on the field. Add to the the ability to change the order of the units  as well as upgrade them and you have a fun addicting game.","December 27, 2011","false","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The player controls an armor column, pushing forward against a massively-defended objective: Tower Defense in reverse. Additionally, you control the commander for the attacking column, distributing health packs, decoys, and smokescreens for your wounded tanks.\n\nThe game itself is a bit thin. The basic strategy is to maneuver through the streets in such a way that you bite off a few towers at a time. Take on too many at once and you quickly find yourself overwhelmed, burning through your allotted health and decoy upgrades.\n\nDespite thin gameplay, the game's presentation is excellent.

Game mechanics are simple with 6 unit types vs 6 tower types. The story introduces new game elements at a perfect pace. Achievements are mostly easy. The Advanced difficulty ones are clever and put a twist on each of the 14 missions similar to Starcraft 2's Hard Story achievements. Further replayability is there with the contrasting gold medals forcing you to play each mission differently.

Additionally, with 'Baghdad Mayhem' and 'Tokyo Raid' the game also features some challenging time-attack- and survival-like game modes.\n\nAlso, with lots of Steam achievements and online leaderboards long-term motivation is guaranteed.

The goal is to escort your troops through city streets filled with alien turrets. The player can buy/sell and upgrade the available vehicles (APC, tanks with rocket launchers, shield generators, ...) so they have increased armor, damage output, ... etc. The player can also repair vehicles, deploy smokescreens and create decoys to get your troops safe from point A to B. While escorting the player also has to change routes of the vehicles so they take the path with the least resistance etc. Very nice and fun gameplay.

However, it is not a game for everybody. In the simplest terms, it is indeed a "Tower Offense" game. You play the creeps blowing up enemy towers.\n\nI played the entire game on medium difficulty, and I'd say it gave me a pretty good challenge. Some battles do last for upwards of an hour. With 15 main missions and a few bonus stages, it will keep you occupied, though having gone through the entire campaign, I feltlike I want more stages.\n\nThe story starts off okay, but pretty quickly becomes bland, which annoys me because I feel they could have easily made a few changes to make it stand out.\n\nOne particular fault of the game, and the reason why it's not for everybody, is that your creeps can and will die in seconds (on medium and hard, anyway. I haven't tried casual). Money is a scarce resource, so the best course of action is to reload at the last save if you lose even one guy. And so to save everyone you need to micromanage. A lot. Every second. Quickly.\n\nRecommended.","May 25, 2012","true","21.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/91200/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","TLDR: Anomaly Warzone Earth is a ‚Äúreverse tower defense‚Äù game where you control a convoy trying to get through the mazes of enemy tower placements in an urban setting. Mix up your unit loadout and upgrade your units on the fly as you run alongside them using ‚Äúspecial powers.‚Äù\n\nAccording to the game‚Äôs opening cinematic, in the not too distant future a bunch of mysterious objects fall from the sky, and end up encasing themselves is massive domes that the military call anomalies. You play a military commander tasked with infiltrating the anomalies and eliminating the alien menace inside.\n\nThe game‚Äôs single player campaign has 14 discrete levels, where you control not only the commander on the field, but the convoy of vehicles which you need to guide through the level. It‚Äôs your choice whether to avoid or engage the alien towers that are set up all over the maps by manipulating the routes they take, similar to switching train tracks on railroads. Generally you should choose to find and destroy them since you earn money with which to upgrade or purchase more units. You get access to about half a dozen different unit types by the end of the game but it‚Äôs likely that you‚Äôll stick to your favorites and just upgrade rather than having a large group of weak units. The vehicles are autonomous, you don‚Äôt choose who they fire at, just which direction they take through the cities. The ‚Äúskill‚Äù portion of the game is in how you use your special powers in the field. Your little commander unit doesn‚Äôt have guns of his own, but he can ‚Äúcast spells‚Äù such as repair, smoke screen, or decoy that make all the difference when your convoy is under fire. By the last level, you‚Äôll be a spell casting fiend, just firing off your skills left and right as you‚Äôre bombarded by an overwhelming number (and variety) of enemy towers.\n\nPros:\n+The game‚Äôs story is engaging and frames each level so you don‚Äôt just have 14 maps to play, you‚Äôre actually advancing the story, exploring the anomalies and the aliens‚Äô plans.\n+The variety of units you can use and enemy towers is surprisingly complex. Some of the enemy towers are a major pain in the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, like the one that absorbs energy if you use a special power within its line of sight.\n\nCons:\n-The game is quite difficult at times, despite the ‚Äúcasual‚Äù difficulty setting. I tried replaying the game recently after about a year, just to experience the story again‚Ä¶ and I couldn‚Äôt finish it again. It was fun the first playthrough, but the replayability value of the game just isn‚Äôt that high.\n\nOverall, the game is enjoyable and challenging, and the download size is under a gigabyte so go ahead and give it a try. I ended up not playing the different game modes though, like survival and mayhem. I guess I was just burnt out by the end.\n","August 24, 2015","true","8.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The opening intro video made me curious to play the game and see what was going on.\n\n\nI always liked Tower Defenses, but this one as a story within, beautiful graphics and some nice animations.\nYou are not defending, you are attaking. You can choose your paths and change whenever you want, to make strategic plans yourself. Your skills will help you survive and the ability to change the speed of the troops is veryuseful at some points.\n\n\nThe voice acting makes the game enjoyable and I really hope that the sequel implements a multiplayer feature.\n\nSo if you love Tower Defense, in the attacking side and love a "Aliens Invade the modern Earth" story (like Falling Skies or even War of the Worlds) then I would definitely recommend you to try this game.\n\nThe only I would add or change in this game is the mouse pointer, which sometimes makes me confused when there's a lot of action going on. I can't seem to see where is it and sometimes I have to make the character move to realize where is the mouse pointer.\n\n\nOther than the mouse problem:\n9/10","September 2, 2014","true","44.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I'd periodically lose my little guy on the screen from all the action and it made moving/scrolling a nuissance at times as my guy would be stuck on the backside of building or something and not moving.

You command a single infantry unit to lead a convoy of vehicles through the game's 14 missions. The story mode is pretty short and you should be able to complete it under 6 hours.

Very smooth framerate.\n\nSound: The voice activng is pretty bad and the music is repetetive, but it doesn't take away much from gameplay.\n\nGameplay: 3 modes (Casual, Advanced and Hardcore) makes Anomaly quite fun and challenging...if you want it to be. Very easy to grasp and smooth difficulty scaling. Very polished game.\n\nConclusion: If you are looking for a game with a good story, this isn't it.

It's a game where you build and upgrade towers to defeat waves of enemies and, later on, bosses trying to destroy your [insert something random here like a base or village]. If you've seen one of them you've seen pretty much all of them. Not this one though. This one is different. It's a reverse-tower defense title, meaning you have to run with an actual character and guide your tanks across a city. Along the way alien towers spawn on the sides of the road and it's up to you to change your formation, help them out yourself with dropping small nukes and smoke bombs and create a safe path using a virtual map of the city. It's actually quite refreshing and I suggest to anyone who loves TD games (like I do) to buy and try.\n\n[Rating: 85/100]","June 12, 2011","true","6.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike the mobile campaign, you actually get to run around as the commander, the main interactions you have are:\n1)	Buying and upgrading tanks. The main choices being heavy armour, high firepower or support (like a shield tank). Upgrading is very simple with no branching upgrade paths.\n2)	Choosing which way your tanks navigate around the map, to either avoid clusters of towers or to go after the currency to buy more tanks.\n3)	Deploying power ups. These are plentiful and the main way of keeping your tanks alive, by repairing them, deploying smoke or decoys to divert the attention of the towers.\n\nOther than some poor voice acting, the game is well presented. It‚Äôs not the most in depth game, but it‚Äôs easy to get into repetitive (almost the opposite of Gratuitous Tank Battles, another take on tower offence).

Though with Anomaly, the entire process is in reverse. Now you play as the attacking forces fighting through the enemies towers to complete the mission. The story here is nothing to brag about which is fine since you're not playing a Tower Defense for a story, right? To sum it up, alien machines invade and set up shop in Baghad along with Toyoko. You're 14th Battalion a bunch of british accented grunts about to go through hell and back. It's a simple game that anyone can hop into assuming you know the basics of tactics and how tower defense works. The game is also great for gamers who want to play a challenging but easy to use game as the entire game can be played with only the mouse. Leaving one hand open for a cold beer. A solid tower defense with clear signs that the developers are fans of the genre as well. 5/5 "It's ok" -IGN","January 1, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a great game. And this time I really didn't know what to expect at all from the game when I bought it. I just found the artstyle so appealing. I thought this would be another modern RTS game, this time with really stylish graphics that I'd enjoy to look at but never really gonna like to play ... but man was I wrong ...\n\nAt it's core Anomaly is a Tower Defense game. Only this time you're not playing the defending but the offending forces. So this time around you are playing a commander of a motorised squad that will attack the towers but can't be controlled directly by you. You can offcourse set the routes for your squad and you have some special abilities like repairing, laying smoke curtains to hide or placing decoys to protect your units and so on.\n\nThe style of the graphics, the sound, the music, the voice overs event the menus ... everything is blended perfectly alltogether to give a pretty unique gameplay experience of a sort I personally haven't encountered before.\n\nThis game sucks you right in from the first minute because of its very unique style and easy accessibility featuring perfect XBox 360 controller support. Even the story is nicely spread out through the campaign. On top of that it seems to feature a good portion of replayability by offering a ton of missions: First there is the story mode, then there are two campaigns based on locations from the story mode and after that you can still play on in some bonus missions with extra difficulty and slight twitches to the original gameplay mechanics.\n\nI liked very much what I've seen unti now and I can wholeheartedly recommend you to buy this game, exspecially when it's on sale. But I must say (and I don't say this often) this game is even worth it's full price. So go on and get it if you're in for some thrilling action strategy sort of game you haven't seen anywhere else before.\n\n@ngel","October 6, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not only does it manage to mix up and innovate one of the most boring and limited genres ( 'Tower Defense') but excellent design and a top notch presentation give it that proper game feel you rarely expect from a "mobile phone"-title.\n\nAdding much needed excitement by turning you into a walking cursor and switching your role on the battlefield from defender to attacker is genius. It's Tower Defense-y enough for fans of the genre I guess, but far from being as tedious and slow.\n\nWhen the action gets hot, positioning and multitasking become key and the game does a splendid job at making you feel awesome about blowing up cityblock-sized holes into the enemy defense line.

The voice acting is good as well, other than the HORRIBLE fake Japanese accents. How hard is it to find someone with an actual Japanese accent?\n\nSuperficial stuff aside, the gameplay is really solid. It's a blast having to manage your team, forming a good balance between offense and defense, planning your route strategically, all while using your commander to jump into the fray to heal units or call in strikes without getting him killed. It's really a welcome layer of strategy on top of the (what I consider to be) tedious tower defense genre.\n\nWhat didn't work so much for me was how the game seems to demand perfection. Granted, that's pretty much the tower defense genre anyway, but I was hoping this game would take a step backwards in that regard. If you lose even one of your units, not only will you most likely not have the resources needed to replace it, but you will be facing a DRASTICALLY harder battle. Borderline impossible, on any difficulty other than casual.\n\nUnfortunately, that means you will be doomed to replay the same mission over and over until you find the perfect formula for success.\n\nI am not a fan of games that devolve that way, but I genuinely enjoyed this one. I didn't play any of the extra modes though, as I was mostly done with it by the time I replayed the final mission for the 2-dozenth time.\n\nMy suggestion is to give a rating to the tower defense genre as a whole on a scale of 1-100 and add 20 points to it. If you like/love tower defense games, you will enjoy this. If you are meh about them, you will still probably enjoy this. If you have never found a tower defense game that you really liked, then only pick this up in a massive sale.","February 15, 2013","true","4.7"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Using your commander you have to use given toolkits to either repair and shield your units from enemy towers attacks when needed. The story seems rather uncompeling - some aliens came to Earth and you have to check the anomaly they created and shut it down. Although the concept looks good, it is poorly executed. Personally I can imagine seing some RPG elements implemented between choosing missions, like experience points or star system like in Kingdom Rush, to push the player to try do the given mission better or harder. Leaderboards are not the way to do this.\n\nThe player is also throughoutly fed military jargon, but in such manner that it feels it tries so hard to sound good but fails. I would advise to get a real soldiers from warzone and talk to them when creating similar game to create a good feel that you care about the situation.","January 5, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/91200/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","I got really excited when I frist heard about this "reverse tower defense" or "tower offense" game. I played the first few levels and then it took me YEARS between then and ever feeling motivated to play the game again. I finally did and finished it and to my surprise it's only a couple hours long. Even doing everything I wanted to (bonus missions, mission-specific achievements, etc.) did not add that much time.\n\nBut I'm thankful for the short length, because I did not enjoy it.\n\nThe game's concept is great, but the execution is not good. Despite the fact that the game keeps introducing new enemies and units right up through the last mission - which actually sucked because you never had the full system figured out until the very end - I found myself oscillating between two very undesirable points.\n\nThe first was more common: most levels were so easy as to be boring, even on higher difficulties. The second was shear frustration: getting stuck. The checkpoint system is totally inconsistent, as in some levels it will repeatedly reward you the same check point an infinite number of times, so that you can just get it as many times as you want, even every 10 seconds. But in other levels you'll go 15 minutes of gameplay without one and then have to reload. Frustraing. Annoying. And because of the set paths and limited resources if you do get a checkpoint late in a hard level where you don't have much money or health or abilities it might actually be impossible to finish the level and you have to restart. Accepting that is a painful process, but in some cases it's the only way forward.\n\nSo for such a short game with a cool concept I feel like I got disproportionately frustrated and annoyed.\n\nThe icing on the cake is that the story and the dialogue are abysmal.","February 13, 2015","false","15.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

If you hate escort missions or any game where you have a companion that keeps taking all the aggro and its your job to stand by and keep them alive... well you are going to hate this game.\n\nI think it is a creative take with a good design.

It's two big flaws though are that the difficulty spikes badly: missions 1-9 = too easy, mission 10 = insanely hard. And timed missions. They are horrible, as they are in most games. Trust me, game developers, nobody wants ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing timed missions in games, nobody. They aren't fun, just stressful.\nI didn't plan on buying Anomaly 2, but I bought the sequel anyway because I stupidly based my purchase on a hope and prayer that they would remove timed missions and fix the difficulty spike. I am sure that neither of those things will happen, so it's basically yet again a waste of $15 on Steam because I have a Steam buying addiction.","May 7, 2013","false","11.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I like the idea of being able to be on the other side of the tower wall for once. Sadly... I'm not really into the play style that much. It's not bad, it's just not what I\ thought it would beo. I was hoping for something like the old WarCraft 3 custom map, Stronghold v3.4 (which most of you probably haven't played). This, of course is completely different. It's a good time waster, something to do when you have nothing else to do. Or maybe, this looks like something you can't wait to play! Either way, if it looks interesting to you, I'd recommend you check it out.","October 5, 2014","true","0.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

You plan your route carefully with planning and thought, after you get to choose the loadout of vehicles you wish, after you try and survive the terrors of the Alien lifeforms which has taken over Baghdad and other ares round that part. Overall it makes me feel like I am playing a tower defense game, but instead of planning to defend whatever I need, I am actually moving through, while the Alien lifeforms is planning its way on defending either its power cores or just trying to ruin your day by just shooting you non-stop. Overall the graphics and music are great, the voice acting is good and the story is actually quite a good story, kinda weird as I was just expecting soldiers trying to move their way through either a group of terrorists or shooting their way through to get out of Baghdad, like Jagged Alliance or Doorkickers.\n\nThe game is great, short, but challenging as you may die a lot for poor planning, but thankfully their is a good checkpoint system where if you die or want to start over again, you can just start from the checkpoint. A great first game from 11 Bit Studios!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)","June 7, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, the missions were challenging enough ‚Äì I had to restart two of them from the beginning. However, once you find small ‚Äútricks‚Äù to keep units alive and maximize profits, the levels become much easier.

Basically you control the tanks that enter the map to attach the towers.  You tell them to turn at intersections to turn and give the tanks power ups so they can navigate and destroy the towers towards the goal.  The game is fast pace but not overly difficult.  There is about 14 missions in story mode that took roughly 4-5 hours.\n\nYou control a guy on the battle field that can run around and  deploy power ups and pick them up.  You can also somewhat distract guns and drop air strikes.\n\nI would really recommend this game to those that enjoy tower defense style games, but want to experience it from the other side of the battlefield.\n\n","November 29, 2011","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well actually just Baghdad and Tokyo.\n\nThis is definitely a conspiracy by the way.\n>Platoon 14\n>14 Stages\n>Successor has 14 Screenshots on steam, this 7 (14/2)\n>14 inverted is 41 which is just 1 below 42\n>1. of April (4) is April‚Äôs Fools Day\n>The moment I‚Äôm writing this it has 1337 user submissions, which is never meaning any good at all.\n\nAnyway this game's a total hell of a fun to play and took me about 6 hours to complete on advanced difficulty. Though actually, especially in the first 10 or so stages, it ain‚Äôt anything near advanced. I was pelted with gold medals these stages.\n\nIn the game you're controlling a single infantry unit, the commander, with whom you can run around the map, collect power-ups from fallen towers, or use them on towers or your units. Beneath this you can give your up to 6 military units orders where to go, searching the best routes through the battlefield. The enemy's towers consist of 6 different models, with unique abilities that make the game never get boring.\n\n‚Äî Gameplay 9/10\n\n\nThe story, however, is nothing special. Earth forces against Alien forces with a spice of ‚ÄúWe have got an alien spy in our rows‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Story 3/10\n\nAdditionally annoying is your supervisor-kinda guy. He's such a Military personnel stereotype that can't pronounce a sentence without showing how ‚Äúmanly‚Äù he is, saying stuff like ‚Äúkick their asses‚Äù and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Makes me hate anything military even more. Aside of that the atmosphere being brought in by the music and most importantly the environment  is beautiful. You‚Äôre seriously feeling threatened seeing all the towers in almost totally destroyed cities.\n\n‚Äî Atmosphere 8/10\n\n\nThis is making a constant 7.5/10 for me. I can definitely recommend this game for anyone even just a little into RTS. You‚Äôre gonna have a good time with this.\nCan‚Äôt wait to play Anomaly 2!\n\n\nSide note: I played this on Arch Linux and had no big problems doing so. Just one total crash and I‚Äôm recommending no to switch out of the game because it will freeze and let you restart all over.","June 10, 2013","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game from HIB bundle and I give it a shot. It was impressive. Great soundtrack, great graphics for an Indies, and original "Tower Offense" gameplay. Although the voice acting kinda awkward.\n\nFor hardcore gamers, the first levels might be a cakewalk but the challenge continues to more thicken in later levels. Not to mention new tough enemies keep being added in some levels. For me it takes average 30 mins to beat 1 level.\n\nI'd like to recommend this game for strategy fans out there.

Just a twist in the tower defense concept, but a great twist.\n\nNow you are the force trying to pass through. You have to set routes, set the squad, the formation and give them support by fixing units, placing smoke screens or calling air strikes. You may think it's just "set tactics and see what happens", but it is definitely not. Sometimes it becomes a really frantic game in which you will need to be extremely fast thinking and acting to make it.\n\nGraphics are good, mood is well set, there's a little story and lots of voice acting (really good IMO). Difficulty is well adjusted (easy at the beginning, hard at the end).\n\nReally entetaining game.

In addition, the whole game comes off as rather unsatisfying, whether because of the rigidity, or the core concept itself... tower defense games just scratch a certain itch when you are slaughtering wave after wave of enemies with your perfect setup, however this game just leaves me infuriatingly itchy and unsatisfied.\n\nThat said it has good production values.

An alien invasion has taken over the planet and this select British team is here to save the world. The player controls a commander who is on foot and escorts a squad of up to six vehicles and helps defend them while taking out the enemy. The vehicles are the primary offense against the horde of alien turrets blocking their path. The commander can utilize four different abilities which include a decoy, smokescreen, healing, and an air strike, however you must collect tokens to enable those abilities and are typically given a small stash before each mission begins. The abilities are stackable so you can place as many as you want provided you have enough tokens. He can also purchase additional vehicles using money collected by destroying turrets or shooting crystals. Vehicle position and route planning are vital and can be managed while the action is paused. Each vehicle also has three upgrade points that cost money which give it more offensive punch plus additional armor.\n\nIt is a short game of about 4-5 hours. It offers two primary campaigns and a final boss battle. There are also a couple extra missions beyond the story mode. It is a solid game that doesn't offer a whole lot of depth, but it's simplicity is one of it's major strengths. It's a nice spin on the traditional tower defense genre that could open the door for better games of this type in the future.","December 21, 2012","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are good and the gameplay ideas are unique enough that it stands out.\n\nThat said, the gameplay still has room for improvement. The biggest frustration I had while playing is how little control you have over your units. Sure, you can adjust their order and their route but that's about it. You can't tell them to stop (or even slow down), the best you can do is have them circle the block. You also can't adjust your unit's targetting priorities which means they always shoot at the nearest tower which frequently gets them killed in later levels.\n\nThis lack of control makes this a tentative recommendation, it's worth a playthrough but be prepared to be frustrated sometimes with how stupid your units can be.

That is, the game is uncomplicated enough that you can easily see the results of your choices: Maybe you need a unit with longer range? Maybe a different path through the environment would help? Maybe trading some firepower for a shield unit really is the way to go? Maybe the shortest path isn't actually the best one?\n\nIn all cases, the feedback loop between your choices and game outcomes is short, easy to parse, and fun. When you do make a fatal mistake, the punishment is rarely so high that you become frustrated. Also, the game's "macro" pacing seems excellent. There's always a new tower or new twist to adapt to, and yet there's also always time to get a handle on the new problem. The game beautifully manages to act as its own tutorial without giving you the feeling that it's all strange or forced.\n\nFrom my perspective, the developers show real genius in their ability to polish and present a "low budget" concept.

Also, there are a couple of bonus scenarios that will prove a real test to your skill, if the main campaign isnt enough.

The first tower OFFENSE game I've seen, you control a set of units and can set and adjust their path through a city street grid. Goals change from level to level, but for the most part you have to take out the towers or certain key structures. Picking units and the order in which they parade through the gauntlet is critical. Time is sometimes the enemy, and the route planning screen will read out the ETA for each point on your path. You are also in control of an avatar that can deploy AOE abilities like healing, smokescreens and tactical strikes.\n\nDon't be thrown off because of the generic sounding name, this is a special game and should not be missed. A long campaign and several challenge modes with a few map variances should give you plenty to do in this unique strategy game.

Well actually just Baghdad and Tokyo.\n\nThis is definitely a conspiracy by the way.\n>Platoon 14\n>14 Stages\n>Successor has 14 Screenshots on steam, this 7 (14/2)\n>14 inverted is 41 which is just 1 below 42\n>1. of April (4) is April‚Äôs Fools Day\n>The moment I‚Äôm writing this it has 1337 user submissions, which is never meaning any good at all.\n\nAnyway this game's a total hell of a fun to play and took me about 6 hours to complete on advanced difficulty. Though actually, especially in the first 10 or so stages, it ain‚Äôt anything near advanced. I was pelted with gold medals these stages.\n\nIn the game you're controlling a single infantry unit, the commander, with whom you can run around the map, collect power-ups from fallen towers, or use them on towers or your units. Beneath this you can give your up to 6 military units orders where to go, searching the best routes through the battlefield. The enemy's towers consist of 6 different models, with unique abilities that make the game never get boring.\n\n‚Äî Gameplay 9/10\n\n\nThe story, however, is nothing special. Earth forces against Alien forces with a spice of ‚ÄúWe have got an alien spy in our rows‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Story 3/10\n\nAdditionally annoying is your supervisor-kinda guy. He's such a Military personnel stereotype that can't pronounce a sentence without showing how ‚Äúmanly‚Äù he is, saying stuff like ‚Äúkick their asses‚Äù and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Makes me hate anything military even more. Aside of that the atmosphere being brought in by the music and most importantly the environment  is beautiful. You‚Äôre seriously feeling threatened seeing all the towers in almost totally destroyed cities.\n\n‚Äî Atmosphere 8/10\n\n\nThis is making a constant 7.5/10 for me. I can definitely recommend this game for anyone even just a little into RTS. You‚Äôre gonna have a good time with this.\nCan‚Äôt wait to play Anomaly 2!\n\n\nSide note: I played this on Arch Linux and had no big problems doing so. Just one total crash and I‚Äôm recommending no to switch out of the game because it will freeze and let you restart all over.","June 10, 2013","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game from HIB bundle and I give it a shot. It was impressive. Great soundtrack, great graphics for an Indies, and original "Tower Offense" gameplay. Although the voice acting kinda awkward.\n\nFor hardcore gamers, the first levels might be a cakewalk but the challenge continues to more thicken in later levels. Not to mention new tough enemies keep being added in some levels. For me it takes average 30 mins to beat 1 level.\n\nI'd like to recommend this game for strategy fans out there.

Just a twist in the tower defense concept, but a great twist.\n\nNow you are the force trying to pass through. You have to set routes, set the squad, the formation and give them support by fixing units, placing smoke screens or calling air strikes. You may think it's just "set tactics and see what happens", but it is definitely not. Sometimes it becomes a really frantic game in which you will need to be extremely fast thinking and acting to make it.\n\nGraphics are good, mood is well set, there's a little story and lots of voice acting (really good IMO). Difficulty is well adjusted (easy at the beginning, hard at the end).\n\nReally entetaining game. Campaign lasts for about 7 hours (maybe around 5 if you play it on easy or do it perfect on first try).

Basically you control the tanks that enter the map to attach the towers.  You tell them to turn at intersections to turn and give the tanks power ups so they can navigate and destroy the towers towards the goal.  The game is fast pace but not overly difficult.  There is about 14 missions in story mode that took roughly 4-5 hours.\n\nYou control a guy on the battle field that can run around and  deploy power ups and pick them up.  You can also somewhat distract guns and drop air strikes.\n\nI would really recommend this game to those that enjoy tower defense style games, but want to experience it from the other side of the battlefield.\n\n","November 29, 2011","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well actually just Baghdad and Tokyo.\n\nThis is definitely a conspiracy by the way.\n>Platoon 14\n>14 Stages\n>Successor has 14 Screenshots on steam, this 7 (14/2)\n>14 inverted is 41 which is just 1 below 42\n>1. of April (4) is April‚Äôs Fools Day\n>The moment I‚Äôm writing this it has 1337 user submissions, which is never meaning any good at all.\n\nAnyway this game's a total hell of a fun to play and took me about 6 hours to complete on advanced difficulty. Though actually, especially in the first 10 or so stages, it ain‚Äôt anything near advanced. I was pelted with gold medals these stages.\n\nIn the game you're controlling a single infantry unit, the commander, with whom you can run around the map, collect power-ups from fallen towers, or use them on towers or your units. Beneath this you can give your up to 6 military units orders where to go, searching the best routes through the battlefield. The enemy's towers consist of 6 different models, with unique abilities that make the game never get boring.\n\n‚Äî Gameplay 9/10\n\n\nThe story, however, is nothing special. Earth forces against Alien forces with a spice of ‚ÄúWe have got an alien spy in our rows‚Äù\n\n‚Äî Story 3/10\n\nAdditionally annoying is your supervisor-kinda guy. He's such a Military personnel stereotype that can't pronounce a sentence without showing how ‚Äúmanly‚Äù he is, saying stuff like ‚Äúkick their asses‚Äù and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Makes me hate anything military even more. Aside of that the atmosphere being brought in by the music and most importantly the environment  is beautiful. You‚Äôre seriously feeling threatened seeing all the towers in almost totally destroyed cities.\n\n‚Äî Atmosphere 8/10\n\n\nThis is making a constant 7.5/10 for me. I can definitely recommend this game for anyone even just a little into RTS. You‚Äôre gonna have a good time with this.\nCan‚Äôt wait to play Anomaly 2!\n\n\nSide note: I played this on Arch Linux and had no big problems doing so. Just one total crash and I‚Äôm recommending no to switch out of the game because it will freeze and let you restart all over.","June 10, 2013","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this game from HIB bundle and I give it a shot. It was impressive. Great soundtrack, great graphics for an Indies, and original "Tower Offense" gameplay. Although the voice acting kinda awkward.\n\nFor hardcore gamers, the first levels might be a cakewalk but the challenge continues to more thicken in later levels. Not to mention new tough enemies keep being added in some levels. For me it takes average 30 mins to beat 1 level.\n\nI'd like to recommend this game for strategy fans out there.

Just a twist in the tower defense concept, but a great twist.\n\nNow you are the force trying to pass through. You have to set routes, set the squad, the formation and give them support by fixing units, placing smoke screens or calling air strikes. You may think it's just "set tactics and see what happens", but it is definitely not. Sometimes it becomes a really frantic game in which you will need to be extremely fast thinking and acting to make it.\n\nGraphics are good, mood is well set, there's a little story and lots of voice acting (really good IMO). Difficulty is well adjusted (easy at the beginning, hard at the end).\n\nReally entetaining game.

In addition, the whole game comes off as rather unsatisfying, whether because of the rigidity, or the core concept itself... tower defense games just scratch a certain itch when you are slaughtering wave after wave of enemies with your perfect setup, however this game just leaves me infuriatingly itchy and unsatisfied.\n\nThat said it has good production values.

You play as a character who can run anywhere you want, your job is to guide the vehicles along a path that will complete multiple objectives. You choose what path they take, choose wisely because you may find yourself sending those vehicles to their doom.\nEach type of vehicle has a different ability, some shield other vehicles, others are for light attack towers and others are for heavy ones. There may be more but it's been a while since I played this.\n\nIt's a very nice game and it's a very welcome change to how tower defence games are made. I found myself enjoying this game more than most tower defence games I've played.\nSo if you want to give it a go, buy it. You won't be disappointed, unless you don't like tower defence games.

Controlling your troops and strategizing your path on-the-fly makes it seem more of an RTS, and that's really, really good. The enemies and their abilities, as well as your troops and abilities, are quite varied and can present a challenge for even the best of strategy gamers.

It is tower defense, but with an extreme twist. It is reversed! You are the one attacking, while the enemy towers await you. You can choose what units you bring into the mission, you can upgrade them and change their route of movement on the fly. A big extra is that you have a commando in a high tech suit at your disposal; he is very fast and agile, and with him you can place repair zones, smoke screens, decoys and airstrikes. The game is pretty simple and also very complex at the same time, this makes it highly enjoyable. It contains a slightly difficult campaign and a skirmish type assault mode as well. It looks very crips and clear, the graphics are really good; the music and the voice acting - despite being cheesy - are also quality work.

It keeps you having to constantly think ahead and plan the best path possible to victory.\n\nIf you're an avid RTS player and haven't tried this one yet, I would defiantly suggest it and even recommend it to non-RTS game players as it offers something different.","September 30, 2013","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a character who can run anywhere you want, your job is to guide the vehicles along a path that will complete multiple objectives. You choose what path they take, choose wisely because you may find yourself sending those vehicles to their doom.\nEach type of vehicle has a different ability, some shield other vehicles, others are for light attack towers and others are for heavy ones. There may be more but it's been a while since I played this.\n\nIt's a very nice game and it's a very welcome change to how tower defence games are made. I found myself enjoying this game more than most tower defence games I've played.\nSo if you want to give it a go, buy it. You won't be disappointed, unless you don't like tower defence games. But then again, you might like this because it's DIFFERENT!\n\nI recommend this game, check it out on YouTube if you're still unsure, or check out other reviews that go into more detail.\nI enjoyed it, perhaps you will too.\n","December 27, 2013","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's do some castle offense! This is the very first game to introduce such a concept to me; before getting Warzone Earth for free through a promotion elsewhere, I hadn't even thought of the idea! But Anomaly shows that the idea is a very good one, and it makes it a ton of fun. Controlling your troops and strategizing your path on-the-fly makes it seem more of an RTS, and that's really, really good. The enemies and their abilities, as well as your troops and abilities, are quite varied and can present a challenge for even the best of strategy gamers. The ability to change the game's difficulty adds onto that as well. For anyone looking for something truly different, I believe Anomaly: Warzone Earth offers that very difference.","December 27, 2013","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not about how to beat wave after wave , placing turrets and hastily switching from one edge of the map to another, plugging leaky defense space. The game gives you a feel for what it is - controlled by the flow, which in the usual Tower Defense have to save .\n\nAnd what is that? Yes terribly easy and even fun at first . Advance is always more interesting than defend. Mechanic A: WE is that entrusted us detachment is not uncontrolled Zerg- mass, which , as is usually the case , the amount of strengthening power presses .\n\nSo, combat unit , which includes only wheeled vehicles can be composed of the following elements . There BTR - rapid-fire , causing damage to small, but sturdy. It is best to put first. There is a rocket launcher - has a much stronger, but deteriorates quickly. In order to somehow reduce the chance that the basic combat unit is destroyed , it should be her armor " reinforce " special energy field generator . It "covers" only two nearby object in the chain. Later you will meet more Japanese tanks and other self-propelled flamethrowers .\n\nBall rule you - Crank in the combat suit, in which health is regenerated at a speed of mating rabbits. The protagonist - the original extended version of " Ghost " of Starcraft 2 . He is able to produce not only an artillery support , but is unique and irreplaceable marker for the entire convoy. Our main duty - to ensure its unhindered smelters from point A to point B. Hedges on the way there will be many . And almost all of them - defensive turrets of various stripes , size and rate of fire.\n\nThe tactic of " rush " does not work here - kill the first collision with three guns. Come to the aid of additional features. Let's say you need to distract attention Plazmometov to overcome part of the road . You mark the desired area and operates a deceptive trick - appear on the map fake unit , which switches on the elimination of one turret . And entrusted squad safely quietly moving toward the goal .\n\nAnother situation - fighters living creatures around too much , and the same " fake raccoon " at all just is not enough . Click on the icon call support , which is responsible for the activation of the conditional , if I may say so , a smokescreen (because no animation is not in sight - only one light colored circle area ) , and the entire convoy moves freely under the cover of the invisible camouflage.\n\nIf your wards enemy fire still hooked activate similarly repaired area - and all who pass through it , automatically improve their "health ."\n\nHere we describe the main elements of the local game mechanics . It's simple. On normal difficulty levels A: WE presents no difficulties - you can safely clamped Shift to speed just to keep up to arrange protection.\n\nIf you think that A: WE story - not the most important , and a hot topic , you'll be right. On duty, we must tell you about it . The game takes quite cute nonsense about a sudden threat . It all starts in Baghdad. Group of peacekeepers from the United Kingdom was sent to monitor and track , imagine an alien invasion . Vast expanses of space to earth sent capsules that at autopsy razrozhdalis those same turrets ...\n\nSubject campaign is divided into two stages. First, we measured jump into the unknown anomalies and disable reactors recharge regularly forfeiting all acquired during the transition to the next level . The situation is somehow corrected when the action moves to Tokyo. Mission there and more fun - like tracking downed plane or crossing the bridge on time. Squad reassembled also not necessary - it is now carefully preserved from job to job , introducing a new framework for passage.\n\nIn A: WE happen even talks on the radio . Specifically , the entire dialog portion of which consists of. For real people here do not see (except in controlled shorty superkostyume ) . Budget restrictions have an effect , but we almost did not get offended . But his ability to make fun of a writers lacking. They alone can squeeze out of yourself predictable gags about Japan and sushi or "get that gizmo " larger than " my aunt's boobs ." Comes , particularly unbelievable to direct quoting " Apocalypse Now " by Francis Ford Coppola . What phrase remembered syuzhetopisateli A: WE, not difficult to guess .\n\nThe game ends quickly. You get used to uncomfortable top view , tactical map without the "Zoom" and trying to be polite sometimes even read the subtitles ... With its main obligation - no time to get bored - the project does well . Monotonically killing monotony stretched for hours , suffer many representatives of the genre Tower Defense.\n\n***\nTower Defense on the contrary - it is entertaining . Occur in most cases more interesting than defensive. Anomaly: Warzone Earth is quick and painless. Show her serious claims meaningless - for its class , it is very bad, but given the lack of fresh ideas in a genre altogether commendable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampireStrike/recommended/91200/","VampireStrike","VampireStrike!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VampireStrike/","312 products in account","A brilliant spin on the tower defense genre. The first tower OFFENSE game I've seen, you control a set of units and can set and adjust their path through a city street grid. Goals change from level to level, but for the most part you have to take out the towers or certain key structures. Picking units and the order in which they parade through the gauntlet is critical. Time is sometimes the enemy, and the route planning screen will read out the ETA for each point on your path. You are also in control of an avatar that can deploy AOE abilities like healing, smokescreens and tactical strikes.\n\nDon't be thrown off because of the generic sounding name, this is a special game and should not be missed. A long campaign and several challenge modes with a few map variances should give you plenty to do in this unique strategy game.

Also, there are a couple of bonus scenarios that will prove a real test to your skill, if the main campaign isnt enough. Collecting medals itself is enough to go for if u ever want to start the game over again.\n\nOnly major flaw this game has is poor diversity of abilities you can deploy on battlefield; it gets a bit repetitive over time.","February 22, 2014","true","20.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The concept is "Reverse tower defense". You control a squad and choose the optimal route on the fly to bypass and/or kill the "tower-like" aliens.

It is tower defense, but with an extreme twist. It is reversed! You are the one attacking, while the enemy towers await you. You can choose what units you bring into the mission, you can upgrade them and change their route of movement on the fly. A big extra is that you have a commando in a high tech suit at your disposal; he is very fast and agile, and with him you can place repair zones, smoke screens, decoys and airstrikes. The game is pretty simple and also very complex at the same time, this makes it highly enjoyable. It contains a slightly difficult campaign and a skirmish type assault mode as well. It looks very crips and clear, the graphics are really good; the music and the voice acting - despite being cheesy - are also quality work. All in all, it's an excellent indie game.","December 12, 2011","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

High production values don't hurt one bit.. it looks good and polished, although I did get frustrated couple of times because of the sudden illogical difficulty spike. Having said that, play it on HARDCORE from the start (don't bother with the two easier settings) and get around 10 hours of gameplay in story mode only.
