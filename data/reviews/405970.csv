It’s an amazing looking game and very well made. The game starts off very interestingly with a pretty nice story going on.  Basically the world has these 6 magical jewels which have sealed the evil that is “3D” away and now a thief is trying to steal these magical jewels and in the process he also kidnaps the princess. The world is becoming 3D from the usual 2D and the animals and even the trees/plants are freaking out and going berserk.  Our hero Flat must go and stop the thief.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game features gorgeous looking 2d graphics sort of like Paper Mario. The art style is very unique and pleasing to the eyes. The enemies look very well made and the scenery is awesome as well. There aren’t many options in the graphics menu other than the ratio adjustment (for me only 16:9 and 16:10 were available) and full screen on/off. The game ran at a smooth 60FPS for me.\n\nSound:\n\nThe game has very good soundtrack. It really suits the theme and visuals of the game. The soundtrack has that ‘charm’ of a beautiful game. I really like the sound bits as well. No complaints there in the music/sound department.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game features our hero who can turn into different shapes. All the shapes give him different abilities. There’s square shape which makes him heavy and he can push objects, break wooden platforms and kill certain enemies. The circle one allows him to double jump and kill certain types of enemies. The triangle is his last shape which allows him to run fast, pop objects with the pointy triangle end and kill certain types of enemies.\n\nAll enemies have a weakness to a shape and you must figure that out either via trial and error or by making educated guesses e.g. the pointy/beaked enemies will get killed by the heavy square shape.  The platforming also requires you to change in to the correct shapes to get past obstacles. There are underwater parts of level too which can be accessed via the square shape as the heavy shape sinks and you can use that with the circle shape to navigate the waters.\n\nThe controls are not the best part of the game if you’re playing with a keyboard. The keys are cannot be custom mapped and in my opinion the default mappings are not so good, so a controller is highly recommended. Even the game developer recommends using a controller as you start the game this is the first thing you’ll see.\n\nYou can collect coins throughout the world and buy extra hearts with them which will help you. The game is not very difficult, the boss battles can be interesting and fun. The checkpoints are generous. The levels are long and plenty. There are hidden sections with coins, scrolls etc. and plenty of achievements, so the game’s replay value is also pretty good. A short video of the gameplay can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=691283257\n\nFrustrations/annoying things: Please note I’ll be adding this section to my reviews regularly. This can make people aware of the flaws of the game as I don’t usually review the games I don’t like. Most of the games that I review also come with some flaws so I’ll be using a separate section to address these flaws/frustrations/annoying things.\n\nThis game really frustrated me with the controls as I much prefer to use keyboard. I had to use a controller to play this game as the keys cannot be remapped and the default mappings are horrible in my opinion. Other than that I found no frustrating part in the game.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nSound/Music: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nI highly recommend this game due to its cute charm and awesome art style. The story is pretty good and the idea of different shapes having different abilities is quite good and unique. The soundtrack is also pretty nice. The game is cheap and will give you quite a few hours of fun. The children will also love this game and if you’re a parent looking for a nice cute game for their kids, this game fits the bill pretty good.","May 25","true","6.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","15","15","3","1"

Quite amusing idea for a story! I prefer 2D platformers over 3D ones where I get confused easily, so I was ready to take control of Flat, the cute ball of a protagonist of the game and go on an adventure!\n\nThe game presents itself as a light hearted platformer with a simple story, simple mechanics and offers a good amount of replayability. I really enjoyed the laid back nature of this game, the overall difficulty was on the lower side, so that made it a nice and relaxing experience.\n\nThe signature mechanic of the game is shapeshifting between a circle, triangle and a square. Each of these forms get additional abilities to use to overcome any obstacles. This makes for some very interesting problem solving and unique methods for defeating enemies. If you need one reason to play this game, then this is definitely it, I really enjoyed the platforming combined with trying to figure out how to approach and defeat any opposition!\n\nThe story and art style looks more appealing to the younger audiences, but not necessarily limited to that. The typical "Oh no some evil person does something that will destroy our world" story is simple enough, but as you play through the game you'll reveal extra story bits as you discover secrets. Backtracking as you get new abilities in addition to the standard ones adds that wonderful buzzing replay value :D Gotta catch em all coins!\n\nSo far there were only a few issues I had with the game that I hope they will be addressed in the future.\n* First, there were some spots where the jumping was too pixel perfect. It's possible to jump up those high platforms, sure, but requires way too much time.\n* Second issue was the controls. I've already messaged regarding the PS3 controller support but even the default button mapping seems a little off. I would definitely like to see an option to remap the controls.\n* Third point for critique is for a few sections where you (are very likely) expected to speed through with the Triangle. I would love to do that, but the character moves so much forwards that I have almost no time to react and need to memorize.\n* And finally, some of the checkpoints are pretty far distanced. It adds a little to the difficulty, which I don't mind actually, but there were some stages with segments that slow down the pace, so going back took a long time.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game. If you like Kirby games, then this is surely gonna interest you. At least give the demo a try and see how you like the whole concept of shapeshifting. Shapeshifting, platforming, backtracking sounds interesting? Go for it! A pick up and play game to relax and chuckle at the cuteness? Go for it!","April 13","true","20.0"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherlock_van_helsing/recommended/405970/","sherlock_van_helsing","Sherlock Van Helsing","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sherlock_van_helsing/","638 products in account","Product received for free\n\nhttps://youtu.be/wAuyhYdFAPo\nGame: Flat Kingdom\nGenre: 2D Platformer\nDeveloper: Fat Panda Games\nPublisher: Games Starter\nCopy supplied by PCGN\n\nFlat Kingdom is a 2D platformer developed by Fat Panda Games and published by Games Starter. It has been a while since I last played a platformer: when I was very little they were the primary genre that I played, especially the movie-licensed Disney games.\n\nSTORYThe Flat Kingdom is a beautiful and peaceful 2D land, but now it’s threatened by an evil thief and becoming 3D! The only who can stop the chaos is Flat, a little hero able to change into a circle, triangle or square.\nThe story is very fun, and it gets more complex the more you play it. But by the time you reach the ending, it is very clear that this was supposed to be a family friendly game, and I did enjoy following our hero on his journey through the Flat Kingdom. The characters that you interact with have some really short but funny lines, and they sure cheered me up.\n\nGRAPHICSI fell in love with the art style! While it certainly isn't mind-blowing, seeing a 2D world made entirely by circles, squares and triangles transforming into a 3D one is a marvel to watch. The animations and character design are very cute, and the 51 enemies and bosses that you fight are all varied.\nEach part of the kingdom feels different from the other, and each level has been design very well: you rarely get lost, and there are always hidden secrets that expand the lore.\n\nGAMEPLAYI played the game with a controller since the keyboard controls didn't feel very intuitive.\nYou have at your disposal four buttons: one to jump, one to turn into a circle, one to turn into a square, and one to turn into a triangle. As a circle, you can double jump. As a square, you move slowly but can move heavy objects around. As a triangle, you move fast. The further you go into the game, the more abilities you unlock to beat different puzzles.\nI found the combat to be very original: since everything in the Flat Kingdom has a shape, you have to change shape in order to kill enemies. Square beats triangle, triangle beats circle, circle beats square. All you have to do is just to change shape and walk into the enemy.\nThe bosses that you encounter are very fun to beat, and a couple of them were starting to get very frustrating. Nevertheless, it is very fun to play and the controls are very smooth, making me fall in love for platformers once again.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game might be family-friendly, but it sure isn't easy. All of the puzzles revolve around finding an object or pushing buttons, and they are never too hard. The real challenge is in the combat: when you are fighting enemies of multiple shapes, it isn't always easy to remember which shape to use. The boss fights are also very challenging, but after understanding the weak spot of an enemy, you can easily exploit your strategy.\n\nSOUNDThe soundtrack is very cheerful and it will definitely appeal to younger players. The sound effects are pretty standard, and the voice acting is fine.\n\nREPLAYABILITYIn each level there are hidden scrolls to find, and multiple coins to collect. There is also a secret ending unlocked at 100% completion, and 48 Steam achievements to unlock.\n\nOverall, Flat Kingdom is a very good platformer with effective gameplay, fun story, charming art style and great challenge. A must buy for fans of the genre.\n\nStory: 7.5\nGraphics: 8.5\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 8.5\nSound: 7.5\nReplayability: 7.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 8\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\nJoin my Steam group","May 7","true","7.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I had a few complaints with the way the game played and the occasional odd design choise, but Fat Panda Games' latest update fixed almost every issue I had.\n\nThe music goes perfectly with this well crafted world and was actually one of the things I was looking forward to. As much as I was excited to find out where I'd be going next, I was also equally as excited to hear the next theme, since the soundtrack is pretty great!\n\nThe levels are fun, the bosses are clever, the final world is phenominal! I didn't know what I would be getting into, but I can say that I immensely enjoyed my time with this game, and I'm definitely up for revisiting it in the future!\n\nI initially gave it a 7/10. But the amount they improved easily earned them an extra point.\nThis game deserves an 8/10.\n\nThank you, Fat Panda Games! I look forward to the next one! :)","April 16","true","11.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingCypher/recommended/405970/","GamingCypher","GamingCypher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingCypher/","30 products in account","Gameplay in Flat Kingdom revolves around Flat transforming between his three shapes, Circle, Triangle, and Square in order to solve puzzles and defeat enemies throughout the level. All the shapes have different attributes, and eventually, different abilities. Overall, Flat Kingdom was an enjoyable experience, with cute and unique graphics and simple controls. The starting tutorial does a good job in teaching the basic controls and abilities for Flat. The level designs overall are very good, with an enjoyable soundtrack, colorful graphics, and filled with enough enemies and obstacles. There are special music tracks for different areas as well as for different bosses, a nice way of keeping the game “fresh.” The bosses are definitely a highlight in Flat Kingdom, exploring various mechanisms and strategies. There are bosses you can physically fight and damage, while others take up the entire screen and can be only damaged by the environment.\nOne lackluster portion of the game is the development of the story. The story fells very cliché, with a very typical development which can only be reinforced by hidden “pages” throughout the game. The cut scenes following the defeat of a boss felt repetitive, with almost the same dialogues. Certain areas feels slow, or forces the player to painstaking grind through a bunch of easy obstacles. Besides for solving the puzzles and the weak story, there are not any mechanisms that prompt further gameplay. Other areas involve a huge jump in difficulty, with either pixel or frame perfect jumps up ledges or a complex series of jumps. For example, the only way to make a jump across a chasm requires a transformation mid-air from Triangle to Circle, then utilizing the remaining double jump to make it up the ledge.\n\nOverall, I would rate Flat Kingdom  a 7 / 10, as there are definitely areas in the story and gameplay that can be improved.\nYou can read the full review here http://www.gamingcypher.com/pc-review-flat-kingdom/\nHan Song","April 15","true","0.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/405970/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Flat Kingdom is the Steam debut of talented Mexican developers Fat Panda Games. The team hail from the region of Yucatán which includes the city of Merida. Their mission is to deliver games that are fun and feature balanced gameplay and great graphics. They are inspired by great games of the past but have a desire to put unique personality into their games. Prior to being known as Fat Panda Games the team created mobile games under the banner of Ghost Apocalypse teaming with RCK Games and Lobo with Shotguns. The team intends to port Flat Kingdom to PlayStation 4.\n\nThe first thing that I gained a deep sense of prior to the game beginning was that the game was developed around a level of lore not usually seen in many platforming games. It is clear that the story and the world really meant a lot to the developers as they were building their game. It appears that every decision is based upon this lore and as a consequence one of the game’s greatest strengths is its cohesion.\n\nOne of the aspects of the game that I have enjoyed most to date is the papercraft art. Thanks to games such as Tearaway this art style has become increasingly popular in games and great artists have been able to create beautifully vivid games with the technology available to them. It’s a lot of work but when it pays off it does so in a dramatic fashion. The game is colorful and bright and is a real joy to watch as you play throughout the game. Another aspect of the presentation that I thoroughly appreciated was the soundtrack of the game. I’m a big fan of Manami Matsumae who created the soundtrack to games such as Mega Man and Shovel Knight.\n\nOne of the things that I wasn’t such a huge fan of – and that’s purely because of my own viewpoint – was that the game was a little more challenging in parts than what I would have liked. For example, some of the double jumps require absolute precision as it is super easy to fall just short of the mark. You wont necessarily die as a consequence but you can get stuck in places for an inordinate amount of time. I’d argue that the controls aren’t quite as tight as what they could be but that may just be subjective. In regards to the controls this is another game that is at the mercy of the Xbox One controller and Unity engine conflict with the game forcing me to roll back my drivers to a much earlier version in order to play. I wish that this was an issue that would be repaired by the Unity developers because it is a source of constant aggravation with their engine.\n\nA review of the game would be remiss if I failed to mention just how much gameplay there is in the game and how many hidden pathways there are that often lead to lucrative awards in the shape of coins that enable the player to purchase things such as additional hearts (life) from the storekeeper that you can find before each level.\n\nA very reasonable platformer and a game that I am quite happy to recommend. The game has a ten percent discount until April 23rd on the Steam store.","May 2","true","8.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

This is my favorite part of the game. It is Crisp. No missplaced pixels anywhere. You can tell they spent alot of time making it gorgeous looking.\n\nControls: Ok here is the only slightly down side. The controls are so on point and tight that at times they get in the way of each other. Trying to transistion from each shape can get you into more trouble then you want. Since every shape does something different. The small window to make the change is made even smaller by the fact the controls are so tight.\n\nI looked and looked for a huge glaring problem and I couldnt find one.\n\nI highly suggest getting this game for anyone who is an old school platform player . You can get past the tightness of the controls to enjoy a very good game.\n\nI give the game a very solid 9/10 and literally the only reason not a 10 is the controls at times.","May 3","true","2.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

As expected from most reasonably priced indie platformers, there are of course some minor issues with pacing and a lack of any story until the very end of the game. But story aside, it has a great mechanic pushing it forward as well as some surprising enemy design. The bosses are definitely the main draw as each one has a unique mechanic you'll have to overcome.\n\nTL;DR I played the game on hard, no opinion on other difficulties.

This means that certain encounters, puzzles and bosses may take a while to figure out, however you get to try again fairly soon after failing the first (few) time(s).\n\nOverall I believe this game to be on par with legendary games such as: The Lost Vikings (Blizzard Entertainment, 1992), Trine (Frozenbyte, 2009) and Trine 2 (Frozenbyte, 2011) and so on.\n\nAll the best,\n\nMike","April 26","true","11.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Flat Kingdom is an unashamed 2D platformer that proudly boasts its straightforwardness. The plot is even about a princess of a fantasy kingdom being kidnapped, and some magic crystals being stolen – which would’ve been standard storyline fare back in the eighties. The protagonist of the tale – if anything – further reinforces Flat Kingdom’s unpretentiousness: it’s a little grey creature called Flat, who is capable of transforming into a circle, a triangle or a square. Don’t expect any labored monologues about a painful backstory from our hero! As soon as a weeping King instructs you to rescue the princess and retrieve the crystals, Flat scurries off to do the first tutorial, leaving you in no doubt about the sort of game you’re in for..."\n\nRead full review here: http://www.heypoorplayer.com/2016/05/07/flat-kingdom-review/","May 12","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As you progress, you get a broader sense of the diversity of situations that Fat Panda, the developers of the game, created and all the references to many game old-school and modern classics. You can notice influences from Metroid, Megaman, Castlevania, Demon's Crest, Kirby series, Donkey Kong Country, Shovel Knight, Guacamelee, FEZ, Super Meat Boy and even The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.\n\nCannot forget to remark the huge, challenging and beautifully animated boss battles and to do a special mention to the soundtrack, by the hand of the legendary composer Manami Matsumae (Megaman, Shovel Knight, among others). If you are a fan of at least a couple of the games I cited before, jump into this papercraft world and start your way into the art of the shape shifting!","April 26","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/virus610/recommended/405970/","virus610","Virus610","http://steamcommunity.com/id/virus610/","568 products in account","Flat Kingdom was pretty fun. Sort of rock-paper-scissorsy combat, but you can tell which one your opponent is ahead of time, and just need to react. Playtime: About 5 hours for 89% completion.\n\nSolid platforming and metroidvania aspects made for a pretty fun time.\n\nThere are a couple of drawbacks, though. Moving through water is a slog, and given there's an entire water world, you end up moving through the world at a snail's pace. Also, almost all of the bosses follow the same formula: Bunch of random attacks, then one attack that exposes a vulnerability, repeat x3. This isn't the worst thing in the world, but it can mean a LOT of just waiting around.\n\nIf you don't mind kind of tedious, and only occasionally engaging boss fights, and if you can bear with a whole world of really slowly swimming, this game's not bad. I don't intend to 100% the game, though, because I'm not really interested in going through those water stages for a couple of missing coins.","April 10","true","5.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But oh no, the Flat Kingdom is popping out and becoming (dramatic musical key) three dimensional! It’s up to a small, nameless critter that has the power to change shape to save the day.\n\nThe main objective of Flat Kingdom’s adventure is to stop a master thief from taking several jewels in the kingdom (that keep it flat) and, for good measure, save the princess. Our little see-through blob can transform from a circle to either a triangle or a square. This works for tackling various obstacles within a beautifully colourful world and even used as a method of combat. Flat Kingdom has a neat concept at its core and one that attempts to elevate it into a more dynamic adventure game.\n\nChanging shape plays an important part when interacting with objects. For example, our blob can push heavy items as the square and charge up a powerful dash attack as the triangle. This opens a vast amount of interactions that often rely on lateral thinking and good memory. It plays more strongly in combat where players will have to examine the shape of the NPC and use the right transformation to attack them. It’s a novel idea for combat but sadly it’s one that is too often infuriating. For most encounters it’s easy to determine the shape of the enemy but other NPCs make the whole process such an ordeal. You can’t always tell they’re made up of several shapes and don’t represent an overall particular structure. This becomes annoying when it comes to other factors in the game, namely the difficulty.\n\nAs mentioned, the game world is very colourful with a great variation of places to explore while accompanied by a beautifully melodic soundtrack. What ends up being problematic more often than not is the length of certain levels and the lack of checkpoints. So encountering enemies becomes a needless and unfair grind. Not including the various restrictions onscreen that blocks your view or won’t allow you to see ahead of your path when you’re sprinting as the tringle. The difficulty only becomes even more of an issue with little health pickups and when you’re presented with some tedious boss battles. There were moments I enjoyed, such as the giant spider, yet at the same time I was bugged out by the pin perfect projectiles it threw at me.\n\nFlat Kingdom is, and will always be to the player, unfair. I felt as though most of the traps, projectiles and movements of the enemies were so pin-point perfect, that the game was two steps ahead of me and did so to make up for a short length of playtime.\n\nDon’t get me wrong, Flat Kingdom is still an enjoyable experience, with some great platforming, clever puzzles that utilise the shape transformation and some fun boss encounters. Even with a short playtime it has good replay value when you go back to explore certain areas further with new powers and perks, just adding more to the overall adventure. It’s fun but also unfairly difficult at times and for smaller children, this might not be the best game for them. Worth checking out but only for those looking for a colourful and slightly less demeaning experience than Dark Souls 3.\n\n+ Colourful and bright visuals\n+ Dynamic and simple mechanics\n+ Some fun plat-forming sections and boss battles\n\n- Painfully difficult in some areas\n- Unbalanced attacks and unfair factors against the player\n- Overall game time is fairly short\n\nA Steam key of Flat Kingdom was provided by the Publisher for the purpose of the review\n","April 25","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The developers/publisher were kind enough to give me a copy to play through and my feelings for this game grew even more. The art style is very reminiscent of Paper Mario and the combat mechanic is a perfect fit. Not to mention the music in this game was highly enjoyable. While I'm unsure if I'll attempt a 100% run, I had lots of fun playing through the game with an 84% completion rate.
