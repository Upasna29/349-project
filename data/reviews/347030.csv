Seeing it is a fraction of what I paid for the game back when it came out in the 80s, I snapped it up.\n\nField battles\n=========\nThe controls are very strange on the PC, and doesn't feel as fluid as when I played it on the Atari ST all those years ago. In fact the controls during the land battles is odd, as in this version you select your unit (cannon, calvary or infantry) and then select an enemy unit and then let it "psuedo" auto attack.... you maintain full control over the movement of your last unit you clicked but you can not manually attack with it, it has to auto attack the enemy unit you clicked on if it is in range.\n\nTrain Highjacking/Defence\n==================\nThis seems to be changed slightly, instead of jumping onto the train and running along the top to get to the engine, you now stay on a horse, riding along side the train shooting the defenders on the train and ducking under trees or jumping over rocks.\n\nFort Defence/Attack\n=============\nThey changed this entirely, no longer is it the platform game where you ran along the walls of the fort beating the defenders, it's a shooting range where you have to shoot a number of targets to win. These targets will duck in and out of cover.\n\nOverall\n=====\nFor back in the day when computer power was limited this was a good game for its' day... however given the advancements in strategy and action games over the last three decades. The gameplay in this is very simple compared to what we have available in recent years. It would probably be something you give to a young child to play or introduce to strategy games rather than throw them in the deep end with something like civilization.\n\nAlthough nice to be reminded of childhood games and be able to play them once again, this version leaves me just wanting to get an emulator and run that version instead.\n\nAnd yeah it left out all the goofy music too!","February 3, 2015","false","2.9"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/recommended/347030/","aurumlamina","Aurumlamina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aurumlamina/","1108 products in account","A modern retouching of the game North & South.  The original came out around the time that I was born and I remember playing it often with my dad and uncles when I was very young.  Much of the gameplay is very similar, though a few aspects have been modified or added to the game.\n\nThe most obvious change is the graphic quality of the game.  As it was always a game based on humor, the new graphics work well and do not detract from the game in any way.\n\nThe economic system still works mostly the same as it used to, owning two separate train stations allows a train to go between them at the end of your turn to generate gold for your treasury.  However, now instead of acquiring a new unit after filling your safe, you have a store that you can purchase from.  This store includes new units (half the price that they were in the original), protection from Indian and Mexican attacks, protection from storms, and additional ammunition for your cannons in battle.\n\nCombat seems to have been overhauled and simplified, however, which is my main complaint with the game.  No longer do you bounce between using direct control over your units trying to outmaneuver your opponent, now it's simply giving commands with the mouse as if it were an RTS.  This removes a significant amount of the skill that played a massive role in the original.  Taking a fort has changed as well.  Instead of, for lack of a better term, playing a 2D platformer beat-em-up to get from one side of the  fort to the other to raise your flag, you now sit in a single position hiding behind cover and popping up to shoot enemies until none of them are left.  These systems are not neccessarily bad, but may steal a little bit of the nostalgia from the old game if that's why you picked it up.\n\nAll in all, the game is a simple, board game like game that can be played locally against a friend. I recommend it as a fun, casual experience, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for something hardcore.","March 22, 2015","true","0.2"," 30 of 39 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","30","39","0","0"

I had much higher hopes about this game...\n\nBut I must warn you before you buy it.\nThe difficulty is easy enough for a two year old to continue winning... There's no competition what so ever. :/\nAnd the length of this game... Wow... Don't get me started. A game lasts about 3 min, unless you decide to give the enemy a chance, and drag the game out. But what's the point?\n\nI could've spend my money much better this time.\n\nI hope they do implement some more features, to maybe make the game abit harder, and maybe make a game last just a tad longer. Because this is ridiculous.\n\nEitherway, it's a bit like the old Amiga "North and South" game. Although it's much shorter, much easier and well... The mini games isn't really that fun.\n\nI wouldn't recommend the game, but then again.. If you don't know the old North and South, and like this type of games, then buy it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/347030/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","I have this game only for a reason. I grew up with The Bluecoats ("Les Tuniques Bleues") because it was published in my country. The comic is narrating the story of Chesterfield, a sergeant who is fighting in the cavalry for the Union (and whose cousins chose to fight for the Confederates), Blutch, a corporal that searches to avoid the fights and the best friend of Chesterfield, Stark, the mad captain whose war cry is well known ("Chaaaaaaaargez"), etc..\n\nSet in a comedy mode, this game is a strategy one, like I don't like them: a map where you're moving your units. Here, the aim is clearly for children. Because there are no real parameters to take into accounts apart random attacks from Mexicans or Native Americans, the thunderstorm moving from a state to another - and you can disable them. Some states have forts, linked by railways. When you connect two forts between each other, a train with gold will travel. Thanks to that gold, you can add units or use other items.\n\nFor a battle, you're in control of your calvary, infantry and artillery: it's up to you to destroy or frighten the enemy... or to be destroyed or to retreat. If you have to capture/defend a fort, you have to shoot enemies hiding and aiming at you, in a shooter mode. And if the train has to get through an enemy state (whether it's the South Train in one of your state or your train going into enemy territory), you have to reach the steam wagon to steal the gold if it's the enemy train, by avoiding obstacles or shooting bad guys and if you have to defend the train, you just click on the arrows to make your guys jump on the enemy.\n\nYou can choose your difficulty and the AI one. You can also choose a year: the map will be different. And also, the two players mode can allow you to play on the same computer. But well, I use this mode to train too.\n\nAnyway, it's a perfect game for a kid... well, make sure to set the AI to the easy difficulty. If I understood well other players, it seems that the AI is quite the "cheater". I can attest that at a moment, despite being the strong one, I thought that it was the end for me. Thanks god, I've managed well with the minigames.","August 25, 2015","true","3.0"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

Mit meinem besten Kumpel damals. Stunden voller Spass.\nDann dieses Remake. Voller Hoffnung und noch mehr Vorfreude.......und nach 10 Minuten die totale Enttäuschung.\nWie kann man einen Klassiker so zugrunderichten?\nDie Steuerung ist eigentlich nur noch der blanke Horror. Auf der Strategiekarte kann man seine Armeen nicht bewegen solange man im Vollbildmodus ist. Das ist echt kein Scherz.  Man muss in den Fenstermodus wechseln um seine Armeen bewegen zu können. Traurig, einfach nur traurig. Aber kommt noch besser.\nDer taktische Kampf......seufz....wie kann man nur....heul.\nHier mal ein kleiner Tatsachenbericht von einem Gefecht:\nKampf beginnt. Tastatursteuerung? Fehlanzeige. Alles mit der Maus. Also Einheiten anklicken, aufs Ziel klicken, rest machen sie automatisch.........Ja, sollten sie zumindest. Ich nehme meine Infaterie, klicke auf den Punkt wo sie hinsollen. Wähle dann meine Kavallerie und geb ihnen die feindlichen Kanonen als Ziel. Will wieder zu meiner Infanterie wechseln da sie gleich einem Angriff ausgesetzt sind durch die gegnerischen Infanterie. Also draufgeklickt und....nichts. Meine noch immer ausgewählte Kavallerie bewegt sich plötzlich in Richtung meiner Infanterie, die grad niedergemetzelt wird durch den Beschuss der feindlichen Infanterie. Meine zurückballern? Häh, wieso auch.....pazifismus yeah! Meine Kavallerie fällt dem Kanonendonner zum Opfer und meine Geschütze wurden eh gleich niedergeschossen. Alles in allem hat das Gefecht nicht mal ne Minute gedauert.\n\nVorbei die Zeiten wo man beim original Klassiker die Cursortasten nutzen durfte um seine Soldaten selber zu steuern nur um dann die Leertaste zu vergewaltigen. Achja, was waren das noch für herrliche Zeiten wo Spiele genauso funktionierten wie sie sollten.\n\nSelbst für 50 Cent würd ich das Spiel nicht mehr weiterempfehlen. Behaltet lieber die Erinnerungen an das Original, als sich die Hoffnung auf ein gutes Remake mit diesem Mist zu versauen. Der Name eines guten Spieles wurde mit diesem DING regelrecht durch die ♥♥♥♥e gezocken.

First things that annoyed the heck out of me were the battles. They were a tad unbalanced and hard to control due to them being way too fast. Just horrible I'd say. After one game like that I switched to autobattles, and pretty much all fights I had with that I lost, except one. Just one. One. I think... And on third game it went for me like this: few turns, first lost battle, indians take fresh army down, next turn, indians take another army down. And I was doomed. Is it me or RNGsus favors Red? Oh and taking over forts manually is a pain as cover seems to work only when you actually click the cover button (correct me if I'm wrong).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nusensei/recommended/347030/","nusensei","nusensei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nusensei/","342 products in account","This is one of those classic games that most would be glad to see again. When you launch the game, you see the familiar title screen inspired by the original, and indeed, most of the game is heavily influenced by the original North vs South. The principle of the game is the same - you select either the Union or Confederates and play through a strategic map, where you buy units and send them to capture territories. Battles are real-time and involve switching between cavalry, infantry and artillery. Mini-games are used to capture and defend forts and rob trains – though the side-scrolling fort stage from the original has been replaced by a point-and-click Cabal-style shooting level. If you’ve played the original, these elements will all be familiar, but with updated cartoony graphics.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is nowhere near as fun. Firstly, it’s blatantly obvious that this is a mobile port, and it’s a poor one. There is no keyboard control; everything is done with the mouse. And this is very clumsy. Battles are no longer the tactical decision making and charge-fire shots from the original, but point-and-click affairs. And while there is an element of strategy, it’s hampered by clumsy selection and unit switching. Units overlap, making it frustrating to give orders to the right unit, and making you really, really want to have at least one button on the keyboard that allows you to switch units.\n\nThe mobile platform is more evident in the shooting minigames. The action buttons are pleased on the left side of the screen – typical of a tablet layout – while the action takes place in the middle and right of the screen. The fort shooting level is terribly frustrating for those reasons. Enemies pop up behind cover in a whack-a-mole manner, but they’re spread so far apart that it’s agonising to use the mouse. To make things worse, sometimes two enemies pop up at once and shoot you, and it is impossible to hit both with the mouse. It’s easy with a touch-screen mobile, but forget doing it with the mouse. And since you need to capture forts to win the game, you may find that you’ve wiped out all the enemy armies and stopped their supply, but struggle to end the campaign due to the frustrating fort level.\n\nEven so, the game is disastrously short. A “campaign” will typically last 3 turns. In short, this isn’t worth the $2.50 sale price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Czx9kcIMwaM","March 31, 2015","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The updated missions are fun as well however great job guys!","February 2, 2015","true","1.0"," 8 of 28 people (29%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","29","8","28","4","0"

However, the graphics are definitly lacking, the music is poor and there isn't too much expansion on the original NES game. Only buy this if you're nostalgic for the NES game.","December 10, 2015","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Nostalgia is NOT PRESENT! The game is CRAP compared to the original. I have no recommendation for whether you should purchase if you have no recollection of the original.
