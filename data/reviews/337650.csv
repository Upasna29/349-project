It's a bullet hell like no other; a game where you don't shoot your enemies but try to get close enough to touch them without getting shot. And you do it by controlling two snakes at once, one with each hand.\n\nGetting good at Soft Body is like a form of meditation. As you start to get better at it, you stop focusing on controlling one snake at a time, and you wind up controlling both simultaneously, not looking at either one. Then the game starts to throw challenges at you where you need to be moving and dodging and attacking with both of them at once.\n\nThis is a bigger game than people sometimes realize - Hard Mode isn't just a difficulty tweak, it's a whole new set of levels and mechanics.\n\nDisclosure - I contributed testing and feedback in an unpaid capacity.","May 17","true","144.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","1"

Simmons ; this is not specific to this review, it makes all the reviews better *\n\n\nSoft Body is an amazing fast-restarting bullet-dodging block-painting world-changing mind-bending shape-popping piece of the smoothest velvet gameplay that's legally available out there at the moment! It'll make you hear colours, touch sounds and see silky worms do things you would have never thought possible.\n\nI'll start with the disclosure: I did the French localisation for this game, and provided a bit of feedback and a few bug reports on the way. Didn't get money for it, in case it matters.\n\nIn order to get a good feel for how to name things, especially when literal translations didn't fit, I played through all of the levels, finished some of them quite easily, died a few times in a few more, spent a couple of hours on a couple of difficult ones, and had to give up on the toughest ones because it was 3am and I needed sleep.\n\nThe whole experience was thoroughly enjoyable. I have played a few fast-restart games, and some other slower ones where you die a lot too, and I usually get super frustrated after a while. Play the same level twenty thousand times without making it past the bloody chainsaw or something, that'll make anybody want to gouge their own eyes out with their controller. Not Soft Body! I kept on restarting. Over and over again. Dying in the most stupid ways time and time again. And I enjoyed all of it. I'm sure you will too!\n\nAnd there's a good chance that learning to control your two snakes at the same time independently is good training for a whole bunch of stuff, like attention distribution, hand decoordination, multitasking, team-working, leadership, etc.\n\nOh, and the music's out of this world. Literally. There was a tear in the fabric of space-time, and it came through along with the tight controls. Can't prove me wrong, might as well believe it.\n\nBy the way, if you want to play it on Linux, you can! Maybe! I could, anyway. Works fine through Wine, but you may have to add an xinput dll file if Wine doesn't find your controller by itself.\n\nAlso, I want it on record that I was the first person in the world to draw a P***$ with that line thingy between the chapters.\n\nAre we allowed to say P***$ on Steam?\n\nAnyway, this game's great, go get it!","May 17","true","11.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"
