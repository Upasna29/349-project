It is indeed a genre-redefining experience. And by genre-redefining I mean the type of "Skyrim is a First Person Shooter". Yes, it has two aspects of Rogue-likes: You can fight monsters and you get loot and experience for it. But there is no such thing as dungeon maps to go through, nothing you would commonly associate with the name Rogue. Or with its likes.\nBut at least it is in the Dark Eye universe, right? Well, technically yes, since they mention a few names of that universe like Praios. Otherwise it could be in any generic fantasy universe and it would not matter.\n\nSo what IS Skilltree Saga?\n\nWell, Skilltree Saga is a simplistic fighting game. You have 21 skills to choose from and each fighting round consists of six attacks by each side where each skill can be used only once. If after a fighting round the enemy is dead, you go to the next enemy. If after a fighting round the enemy is alive, you can use items and continue the fight against him, or you can retreat. It is all animated, but the graphics are not really spectacular. It is too good for a Flash game in that regard, and only in that regard.\nYou fight your way through three dungeons, and win when you beat them all. You gain experience after battles and level up unless the enemies are more than ten levels below you. The level ups give you increased stats, but don't really feel like Dark Eye, especially since you don't have the classical complicated level system.\nThe first dungeon has 30 floors, the second dungeon has 50 floors and the final dungeon has 100 floors. What sounds like an awful lot becomes much much less if you learn that each floor consists only of one fight and absolutely nothing to explore. The enemies are mostly randomly generated, but it doesn't really make a difference since there are very few of them. After half an hour I lost the fun in the game and after two hours I am in the grindy endgame where I try to level up for the final dungeon.\nThe sound is nothing spectacular, but not bad either, so at least it doesn't disturb you from clicking the same few buttons - and that is what it comes down to at the end - over and over, every now and then trying to get some good deal at a merchant or just selling your items that fit in the limited but cheaply expandable inventory space. You need diamonds for some items including inventory space that you get by paying gold, defeating bosses, getting achievements or randomly finding in the dungeon. At least there are no real money purchases.\n\nOverall I can not recommend that game unless you - like me - get it from a bundle in which case you might want to try it just for the few minutes of casual fun it can give you.\n\nRecommended: Only from a bundle or very cheap","January 8, 2015","false","5.0"," 235 of 246 people (96%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","96","235","246","6","9"

As other reviewers have noted, it feels like a mobile game.\n\nThe storyline is extremely sparce; you're rescuing some girl from some monster or other, some stranger suddenly decides to train you in magic, and off you go. You'll perform the same battles countless times, marginally increasing your stats and abilities, slowly looting or buying your armor and weapons, and crawlingly moving through the three maps in the game.\n\nThe first map has 30 stages, and in order to clear it, you must beat all 30 stages in one go. You won't be able to do that for a while. You have to keep grinding. And that's when you discover the game is a massive grind-fest. You'll keep slogging through, hoping for random healing fountains to heal you so you can keep pushing on without returning to town, because you will return to town a lot. You hope you'll loot useful equipment or find for free the expensive potions you can buy in the game. You won't be able to clear those 30 levels at once. Not by a long shot.\n\nAnd when you get to the next area? Oh, it has 60 levels. The last area? 100. You will perform the same tasks hundreds of time with little variation, trying to manage your tiny and expensive pool of resources to hopefully clear the entire area in one sitting. Sound fun? It's really not.\n\nThe game isn't available on mobile devices, which surprises me, because it feels like it was aiming for mobile and somehow missed, landed on Steam, and tried to put its best face forward, pretending all the while it was entirely unaware of its hampered design.","January 23, 2015","false","4.8"," 101 of 106 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","101","106","2","0"

Your character is immortal, and if you are defeated in combat you get a tiny slap on the wrist (which may not be anything at all, depending on how many items you found on that particular adventure).\n\nSpeaking of "adventure," the game has only one mechanic: click to start the fight. Each fight is automatic, with zero input from you. All you have to do is decide whether to fight the next enemy or to run back to town and heal. That is the entire game. I have played far more complex high-school coded flash games.\n\nThe list of reasons not to play does not end there, though. The enemy design and "animations" are exceptionally poor. English language errors appear on nearly every sentence (this was NOT proofread), Sound frequently swaps left/right channels. A skill which purports to do damage does not do damage.\n\nI have no idea how such a one-dimensional, thoughtless, sophomoric title got the Dark Eye name behind it, but your time and money are far better spent elsewhere.","December 5, 2014","false","2.7"," 107 of 123 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","107","123","0","4"

Why?  Well, there is almost no story to speak of, and the game seems to be only superficially related to the world of Aventuria as far as I can tell, but the main problem with this game is the excessive degree of grinding required to reach the end.  By level 50 or so, you have to literally fight dozens upon dozens of battles which don't give you ANY experience (enemies 10 levels below your character don't offer experience), which wouldn't be so game-breaking if you the shopkeeper offered weapons that were anywhere near as good as the ones you find along the way.  You essentially have no way to improve your chances for later battles.\n\nI can't count how many times I've fought through over 80 enemies (none of them giving me XP) only to face one or two that DO give XP and then die shortly thereafter to begin the grind again.  On my last run, I fought over 300 enemies without gaining experience!  This is unforgivable game design in my book.  It wouldn't be so bad if you could skip past the many experince-less battles to the enemies that you are "on par" with (who are all MUCH stronger than you), or if varying your strategy actually made a discernable different to the outcomes of battles.  I only held out as long as I did in hopes of getting the last achievement for Steam...\n\nAs much as I wanted to enjoy this, I can't recommend it.  Maybe if it's on sale for a huge discount and you're extremely bored...","March 23, 2015","false","18.0"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","37","39","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/recommended/315320/","nourl1","Two Clicks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nourl1/","547 products in account","VERDICT: Skilltree Saga is a basic side-on combat encounter grinder.  You take control of a warrior (Human, Elf or Dwarf).  Fight numerous battles across four arenas against a variety of enemies and bosses.  Use attacks and spells to defeat opponents and rescue the kidnapped princess.  Progress is rewarded with gold, diamonds, potions and new equipment.  Experience points level characters unlocking new skills/spells from the skilltree.  Fail and lose any progress or newly found equipment.\n\nGameplay is limited and the skilltree is rigid with the same twenty-one skills for all characters.  The real challenge is focused on gaining (read grinding) the necessary, equipment and spells to defeat each opponent to reach the end of each arena.  This can only be done by learning how to defeat each opponent.\n\nOverall its a nice little game.  Casual for the most part until you get towards the end of the hardest dungeon.  Gameplay is very repetitive.  Sound is basic but the artwork is probably its best feature. I would only recommend this game if want a cheap combat simulator with quick-fire sessions, or if you dont mind alot of grinding or repetitive gameplay. You will die - alot. If spending twice as much time as it took to get all but one achievement to finally get the last one bothers you, then look elsewhere.\n\nFor the most part I enjoyed playing Skilltree Saga.  It delivers a fair amount simplistic fun and enjoyment but ultimately becomes a souless grind.\n\n\n... More info below ...\n\n\n01. GENRE: Side-on view combat encounter generator.  Not an RPG.\n\n02. SETTING: Combat encounters take place in the fantasy land of Aventria - in the world of The Dark Eye, a German role-playing game.\n\n03. STORY/BACKGROUND: Its as cliche as it gets.  Bad monsters attack a region and kidnap the local rulers daughter.  Step forward a hero to save the day.\n\n04. GAME MODES: Single-player is the only game mode.  The campaign consists of four arenas with the first one being a very easy tutorial.  Each arena consists of a series of encounters(levels) that number from (tutorial) ten to (hardest) a hundred levels.  In each encounter one monster, creature or humanoid is fought and must be defeated.  To keep things interesting at every ten levels you will face a boss opponent.\n\n05. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: Basic gameplay consists of alot of sequential combat encounters bound to a particular arena based on difficulty. Encounters can be defined as: Fight.  Kill. Win. Loot.  Receive reward: money, potions, diamonds, article of armor or a weapon.\n\nAs you gain experience and skills (read spells) you overcome the opponents that would have defeated you before.  Sometimes between encounters you can discover additional treasure, meet a travelling trader to sell surplus items or stumble on a healing fountain to fully recover health and mana.\n\nYour character has seven stats: Strength for melee damage, Cleverness for mana spent on spells, Courage otherwise known as initiative, Constitution or health, Defense or armor rating, Resistance against enemy spells and Weapon damage.  Levelling increases these stats but equipment also boosts them if worn across six slots.  The best equipment will boost multiple stats with items affecting four stats by 30+ points for each.\n\nThe skilltree has twenty-one spells/skills to choose from.  It starts with one universal skill and branches into eight sub-groups.  Each skill must be levelled to its max level of four before the one(s) after it can be selected.\n\nCombat is where most of the action takes place.  Six action placeholders available for you to choose which spells or  attacks you will use and the order they will be used against the current opponent.  Choose your options carefully as once the round starts you will not be able to make changes until all actions are performed.  That is if you and your opponent are still alive.  Between combat rounds you will be able to take potions to boost health and mana and review which actions or the order they are performed in.  Equipment can also be changed.\n\n06. ENEMIES: A decent mix of monster, creature and humanoid classes with several models in each class scaling up in abilities and difficulty.  The bosses are souped up versions of the standard enemies.\n\n07. LEVEL DESIGN: Encounters are grouped into arenas (dungeons).  There are four; a tutorial arena and three divided by difficulty: easy, medium and hard.  The tutorial has ten encounters.  Hard has one hundred encounters.  Levels in each of the four arenas are rigid.  The difficulty level of each ten waves is hard-wired, so the opponent class tends to remain the same. Randomness only affects the actual opponent faced at each level sometimes being different.\n\n08. A.I: Very basic.  Every opponent has its own set of co-ordinated attacks which change very rarely.  This depends on the spells (boosts) currently in play and attacks being used by the player.  It does what it needs to.\n\n09. INTERFACE & CONTROLS: Basic mouse click and select and drag.  The interface is well designed except for the ability to re-order selected skills on the fly.  You have to delve into the skilltree to do this and doing this alot slows down the pace of games.\n\n10. GRAPHICS: They consist of a fair amount of 2D backdrops which are gorgeously drawn out.  Character and enemies are also well drawn if nothing spectacular.\n\n11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: Basic if apt for the setting.\n\n12. VOICE ACTING: Minimal.  The game is about combat with little back-story.  So no surprises.\n\n13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Each arena scales in difficulty.  None of the first three should present much of a problem.  But the final arena has 100 encounters 10 of which are bosses, with opponents that can one hit kill.  It is a real challenge to complete and will require some grinding/loot farming.\n\n14. PROBLEMS: I had no issues running the game.  One thing that is missing is the ability to redistribute skill points if you make a mistake.  So dont make a mistake in allocating skill points.  Plan your strategy in advance for what skills you will take and to what level you want them to reach.\n\n15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Well designed with a good mix consisting of: log in x times, learn t skills, defeat y bosses, kill z enemies, defeat n enemy type, loot m gold, completing x levels without dying or fleeing.  Completing the hardest arena that is the hardest achievement.\n\n16. DLC: None.  No more planned.\n\n17. PLAYTIME: Typical playthroughs: Short arena 5 mins, Med arena: 20 mins, Long Arena: 30+mins.  You will be playing and replaying runs through the hardest two arenas a lot.  Especially the hardest.  Expect to put in 15-20h for all arenas except the last half of the hardest one.  Then around  the same again to complete the final levels of that arena.\n\n18. LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: You could play this three times.  Once with each character but Leaderboards indicate that there some players who play this more.  A hellava lot!  However replaying with different characters will not appeal to anyone who expects to see a variation in the skilltree for each one.  Im afraid the skilltree is the same for each character.  The only difference would come from upgrading different skills to their max. threshold.\n\n19. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: For those of you who do not like repetitive gameplay this is one to avoid. For me it was fun for the first twenty hours.  But grinding out the last few levels in the final arena was painful.  It definitely put me of trying out the other characters and going for different skills.\n\n20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Definitely only one to consider when on sale.  Only played through with one character.  Unless you enjoy grinding or repeat play.  I cant escape the feeling the design was intened for a mobile game.","October 7, 2015","true","50.9"," 43 of 52 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","43","52","2","0"

This should be a The Dark Eye (TDE) game?\n\nI play TDE (pen n paper) for over 20 years now.  So even though the genre (roguelike) is not really my thing, I needed to have this game.  Happely I bought it in a sale and didn't spent too much money on it.  Still, it was a waste of good money.\nThere are very good TDE games out there.  This however, is *not* one of them.\n\nApart from hardly being a game, this has absolutely nothing to do with TDE.  It could be set in any setting.\nIt is a game about grinding.  It gets even worse there.  You need to grind to be able to ... grind.  What I mean by that is that you need to get money, experience, diamonds, equipment  and poitions to get further and further in the dungeons.\nBut don't expect walking around in an actual dungeon.  You will get fight after fight after fight.  Every 10 fights you get a boss-fight (which is a little harder).  You cannot rest.  Only retreat (or use poitions) when low on health.  When you retreat you start over again with fight 1,  (You'll keep XP, money, and if you weren't defeated, you'll keep the equipment as well.)  So you fight your way through the same dungeon over and over and over again.\nAs you proceed into the dungeons, the fights get thougher.  At a certain point, the crits at the beginning of the dungeon won't give you anymore XP (loot is still there).  So to raise your XP, you need to get far in the dungeon.  (Grinding to be able to grind...)\n\nThe fights themself are not really impressive.  You have 6 slots.  You can place a skill in each slot (or leave it empty for a normal attack).  Once set, press the fight-button and watch the screen until the fight is over.  Nothing else, that's it.\n\nPlacing and removing the skills from the slot is exhausting.  An interface which doesn't react very fast and an awfully lot of buttons and icons to press, all over your screen.\nThere is no way to save the skill-order you have chosen.  So even if it is the 100th time you try to kill the same boss, you still need to set the skills ... again.\n\nPositive\n+ Cheap (if you buy it on sale)\n+ runs stable\n\nNegative\n- Grinding\n- Even more grinding\n- No TDE world\n- Annoying\n- Feels more like occupational therapy then an actual game\n- Even if you bought it in a sale, it costs still too much.\n- No save for a skill-config (only the last set config sticks)\n\nRecommendation:\nBuy Drakensang (the first one) for a fun RPG, Blackguards (the first one) for a fun grid-based turn-based battle game or Chains of Satinav for an fun adventure.  And even though they are old, the Realms of Arkania are still fun to play cRPGs (specially the last onme, Shadows Over Riva).","December 26, 2015","false","13.0"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","29","34","2","0"

Whenever I hear the word “Rogue” my heart skips a beat, and right on the Steam page it advertises itself as such. If done right, it could be an extremely immersive experience. There isn’t a thing in the world I love more than dwarves and magic. I’ve sung the virtues of scraping stats on many occasions. Those new pants aren’t just shiny, they’re soaked in endorphins. It’s not as gross as it sounds. Well, it is. But at least it feels good. Erm, anyway… Skilltree Saga capitalizes on this mechanic relatively well. Unfortunately, this alone was not enough to hold me for an extended period. While some people may enjoy the grind, I found progress extremely arduous. There is much to praise, but also quite a bit of honest criticism. Let’s check out Skilltree Saga.\n\nThe soundtrack in the game has an extremely massive feel to it. I found the sound effects are also quite good, if not a bit repetitive. Repetition is a recurring theme in this game. I’ll say it again. Repetition is a recurring theme in this game. The background and animations during combat are nice, but unfortunately there is no exploration. Each floor only contains one monster, and you don’t have to look for him. I feel the three character models are nicely rendered, however none of the armor you equip will change their appearance. What you see is what you get. Meanwhile, the enemy models vary widely. The wolves and hornets look nice, while the elementals look almost like a placeholder model. It clashes pretty hard, and breaks the aesthetic in my book. The story is quite serious, revolving around The Dark Eye board games, so being attacked by a bug-eyed golem or a teddy bear doesn’t do it any favors.\n\nThe combat in the game is round-based. You can set up to six skills which will be used during the combat round. Once the round starts, it will take six turns before you’re able to drink a potion or flee. This is quite confusing in the tutorial, as you only have one skill and generally only make it to the second or third turn. During the tutorial I was under the impression that you weren’t able to do anything in combat except for start the fight. It wasn’t until about 45 minutes in that I actually started seeing the round combat screen. This breaks the flow of the game terribly and requires some looking into, as I would not have spent 45 minutes to figure this out if I weren’t writing a review. Diamonds are used instead of gold to buy potions, to keep you from going too far too fast, but in a game where progress feels this slow a little extra speed would be a welcome addition.\n\nSkilltree Saga needs a bit of help before I’d encourage people to drop $10 on it. The death animations don’t always execute. UI doesn’t seem thought out, as you can get to your inventory from the shop menu but getting back to the shop screen requires closing out to the main menu. The grind is quite lengthy, and progress seems based more on levels than on gear. Some enemies have attack patterns that can be countered with skills, which seems engaging until you have them all memorized. The spiders in the jungle act just like the reskinned spiders in the cave. There are multiple ways to replay through the game though, changing your race or picking different spells. If you enjoy a casual grind I’d recommend you catch it on sale.\n\nSummary: Casual RPG featuring a round-based combat system and a tremendous soundtrack.\nFinal Score: 5/10 for sound and replayability.\n\nFull review text/photos: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-skilltree-saga/\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1hJCpTb_jU","January 30, 2015","false","2.2"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","28","39","3","0"

When you have a encounter you can change your skills, press the fight button, and you and said monster go head to head in a 6 turn battle, in which you take turns, attacking, and doing skills and spells, There is various status anomalies, and skills, lots of loot, including gold, weapons, and armor. You can choose from three races, each with their own advantages, but then you cannot choose your class, you are alway's a Elemental Knight, still, there is customizable options for your character, there are elite monsters (Harder versions of the regular monsters) and boss monsters,just about everything you want from a RPG, but alas, still it plays like a free Flash RPG. It's not bad though, quite a fun time waster, but nothing Rogue like about it, except random encounters, and loot. The Boss Monsters are the only exception to the rule of randomness, they are always the same, and always on the same level. In the end a good game, and worht buying if it sounds like your kind of thing, on sale, maybe, but at 9.99 it's just to hard to reccomend this game.","January 8, 2015","false","3.7"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","20","25","0","0"

It was also on steam sale so very cheep.\n\nPros:Simple flash game\nEasy fun, play it with a pen and paper to write down the combos that work for each mob\nShort to play though\nSome interesting ways to deal with mobs based on the skills you have\nCons:Item drops are mostly useless, all upgrades come from the shop (which you can "farm" by reloading your profile in game)\nIt can get grindy if you build your hero's stats wrong and need to farm the shop for the right items.\nSpoliers:Their is no cap to your iventory (I got mine to 355 out of curiosity)\nLeveling up increses the stat that is your races more than the others, makeing dwarves probably the worst race as constitution is almost useless, when you are pushing your lvl cap if you get hit you die anyway even with stacked defense and resistance.\nAlso Blitz and Windbreak are OP, both are must haves for the final","June 24, 2015","true","13.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

In this games instance however it isn’t entirely truthful.\n\nSkilltree Sega seems as if something that would work better as an iOS game rather than a PC game. You play as a warrior and go through different environments and fight randomly generated enemies to level up, learn new powers and progress further. Now as far as the game play for doing all that though goes, there really isn’t any. Battles are turn based and preplayed. You simply view the fight going on. Between fights you simply click the next button or change gear / skills. In no way, shape, or form do you do anything during battle.\n\nThe so called “Rogue Like” element is that if you don’t make it to the end of the stage (either 20, 50, or 100 fights without dying) you lose all gear that you looted during that session. Between fights you do have the option to retreat keeping all gear you have earned.\n\nWhat the main problem is with this game however is the lack of actual game play. After a short amount of time you quickly find that you are just grinding through weaker enemies gaining little to no XP only to try and fight through the later stages. This game almost just serves as a learning guide for someone who is coming into the RPG genre and shows them how to run a skill tree which even then isn’t gone that great.\n\nOverall while the game isn’t horrible after a short amount of time I found myself becoming bored with little desire to continue on grinding to see what happens in the end. If you can catch this on sale for a few dollars it’ll keep you busy for a few hours but other than that there are other games of a similar nature out there that does this better.\n\n\n\nScore :\n\n3.5/10\n\nhttp://apocalypticdemise.com/2015/01/24/skilltree-saga-review/","May 31, 2015","false","2.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

You will find yourself sitting down for a decent 6-10 hours just to finish the last map alone depending on what class you choose.  The name itself is deceptive, in that the skills in the skill tree are very limited and there are only a few core abilities worth using out of the entire selection, adding to the already evident lack of balance in the end-game.\nDespite it's flaws, Skilltree Saga is still a fun game, but I would recommend waiting for it to go down to around $5 before purchasing it in its current state.","December 4, 2014","true","7.8"," 32 of 60 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","32","60","3","4"

You level a human, elf or dwarf by entering dungeons with randomly generated encounters. Leaving a dungeon without dying means you get to keep the loot you earned, so fleeing to fight another day is a good idea. The goal is to complete all dungeons and rescue the local baron's daughter from the villain. Kind of a classic theme and gives you something to work towards aside from filling up your skillset and upgrading your gear. Gear seems to be also randomly generated, so you get different combinations like elven sword of the bear or leather cap of the owl, depending on makeup and enchantment.\n\nYou definitely feel the progression, even if you have to go into a dungeon multiple times to kind of grind levels, because everytime you enter a dungeon it gets a little easier, and you get a little farther. I'm just about to take down the spider boss of the forest dungeon after it handed me my butt last time. For a simplistic dungeon crawler there is a lot of rich dialog and story atmosphere. Definitely addictive. You want to keep getting strong and getting farther, and it doesn't suck away a lot of your time so you can  power through or play it in short sessions casually.","December 4, 2014","true","0.8"," 46 of 88 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","46","88","2","1"

Whatever you do, DO NOT click on "Options" and then "Profiles" if you have NOT made a profile yet.  See the picture below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435057768\n\nYou might be able to "Exit" the game from the "Options" menu and it might ask you to save, but if you accidentally go into the "Profiles" menu without first making a profile, you are out of luck! Now that I made a new character profile, the game boots directly into the "Profiles" menu so you can either create a new profile or load an existing one. This should have been the default for the very first time you play!\n\nI lost over 100 minutes and my first character by doing this. Once you enter the "Profiles" menu, there is NO way to exit it without either creating a new character or loading your previous character which didn't exist for me yet. If you do not make a character profile first and save your game, you risk losing all of your progress! All of your hard work might be lost!\n\nMy advice to the developer(s), make it so the first thing you do is create a freaking profile and save file! Also make it so the "Escape" key exits out of the "Profiles" menu without having to make any choices. How did you NOT think of this? Terrible, lazy programming IMO. What were you thinking? Or maybe you weren't thinking… Please fix the profile problem!!!\n\nSkilltree Saga is a pure character builder and a major grind-fest, which is okay with me! I WAS having a pretty good time! As you level up, you feel stronger as you progress with every level and new items. The fighting does take some strategy, but only arranging your skills in what order they will be used. All fighting after that is automatic. As with many RPG type games, the fun is in leveling up and finding new gear & loot! This game does that well, but the fighting aspect will turn off most gamers.\n\nI cannot recommend this game until the profile problem is fixed! I am not sure why no one else has complained about this. I assume if you "Exit" the game from the "Options" menu, it will ask you to save the game. I don't know for sure though. It now boots into the "Profiles" menu at startup so I can start a new game or load a previous one. Again, why isn't the game setup like this the first time you play dev's???\n\nI had to force quit the game and lost everything. I couldn't get out of the "Profiles" menu and my only other choice was to create a new profile stating it would wipe out my previous progress anyway! I force quit hoping there was a save file somewhere that would load the next time I started the game. There wasn't. So, I lost everything I did in the first 100+ minutes! :-(\n\nHere are my system specifications: Apple iMac, i5 Quad-Core Intel processor 3.1GHZ, AMD Radeon HD 6970M with 1GB dedicated video RAM, 4GB system RAM, 1TB hard drive running OS X version 10.6.8, Journaled HFS+ Extended file system, Logitech optical mouse.\n\nEdit: I started a new character "Profile" and saved it! Now I am in the second of the three areas having fun again. As I said, Skilltree Saga is strictly a character builder. There is not much of a story and all the battles are 1 vs 1. It's like a game you might see on something like FaceBook, minus the IAP micro-transactions. It looks like it would be very easy to include IAP though, and at some point it might.\n\nAnyway, it is a "very" casual game that requires just a few mouse clicks and not much brain power to play. I like it because it is a character builder with random encounters. weapons and items. There are Elite and Boss fights throughout, which ramp up the battles. That is about as much Rogue-Like (or Lite) as this game gets. There is no perma-death. If you lose a battle, you just end up back in town, but you do lose the items you found during that dungeon run... You do get to keep the experience that you earned though, so you do keep leveling up even if you keep losing the battles.\n\nI give it 5/10 for effort... And because I'm still playing it after 7+ hours... :-)\n\nI still cannot recommend this game to everyone. Most people will disagree with me already! Maybe at $5 or less...  If you like building characters and don't mind the "mindless" gameplay, then check it out on sale ONLY!!!\n\nEdit:  I am still playing this game after 8+ hours strait and plan on playing some more, so I guess I like it! lol","April 30, 2015","false","27.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Fine. The trouble came from when I quit the game and then decided to open it again and reload, only to find my game didn't save because the first time I ran it, it went straight to the tutorial and DID NOT let me pick a save slot. Time wasted.\n\nNext, on OS X, the achievements don't unlock. This is rather annoying and disappointing, since it shows the game isn't polished as it should be, and that there are still bugs abound! While this isn't a major issue for some people, I enjoy collecting achievements, and being denied them as advertised is frustrating.\n\nAnd on the game itself?\n\nCould be better. Very much better.\nI'm not hating on it, and I think the way they had the whole 'plan out your turn beforehand' battle system was okay; what was frustrating was how slow it goes by, and how there's no 'skip' function and you have to sit through all the animations (especially when you're grinding). This is usually made bearable by the imagery, but the graphics look awkward and stiff; again, it does not look polished!\n\nI'd advise you against this game, even from a bundle, unless you know you like this kind of gameplay and are willing to look past the (many) lackings of the current build for the sake of it.","August 5, 2015","false","1.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Essentially, you'll choose your race (human, elf, or dwarf) and embark on a mission to level up your character by picking a dungeon, get as far as you can, and retreat back to town to heal up and buy/equip new loot.  You don't have control during combat...rather, you can assign skills from your skill tree into a que and the system will rotate through this que in sequential order.  It's not a bad game, though the player won't have a lot of choices to make and the menus/screens can be cumbersome and disorganized at times.  I'd wait for a 50% off sale, but that's just my personal opinion.  This game falls under the "Average" category and unfortunately Steam doesn't have a "Meh" button.  To that end, I'll give it a positive recommend with the understanding that I believe the game to be simply mediocre based on the current asking price.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2H4sIUXxL4","December 5, 2014","true","0.6"," 21 of 43 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","21","43","0","0"

The story is quite unremarkable (if even existent), the whole gamemechanics don't share much but a few keywords with the TDE-world, and if you played some of the other titles of this developer, you realize where many of the graphic ressources come from, and why they don't really seem to fit to the games proclaimed universe..\n\nBasicaly the monsters from the Grotesque-World seem to make holiday in Aventuria.\nYes, right. Mushrooms, Mosquitos, Spiders and Blobs, just to name a few, aparently where taken completly from Grotesque Tactics 2. Of course thats something, that doesn't fit well into this actual setting.\nMost of the music I heard, in the few hours I played so far, seems to be reused from Grotesque as well. And apparently Rukel has a sidejob as merchant in Greifenfurt these days.\n\nApart from that, its mainly a game about the adjustment of the various skills you can get, to fit 6 rounds of battle with various opponent types. Also you gotta grind some levels and find equipment to rise some basic stats. Go into the wood/dungeon until you find an enemy(-type) you can't defeat, return to town and repeat the grind until you leveled enough to defeat them and/or found adequate equipment.\n\nNo, sorry, as much as I like the other titles of Silent Dreams so far, there is no way I could rate this one positive.\nIf you are looking for a real roleplay-experience in the deep and atmospherical world of TDE you are better off to find Drakensang or one of its successors for the same price in a budget pyramid. Or maybe you find the good old northland trilogy.","July 14, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The result is unsurprisingly bad. At least they had the common sense to not include microtransactions in the Steam version.\n\nThe gameplay is not fun once the gimmick wears off (which happens quickly). The progression is a pointless, horrible grind even by my standards (and know that I grew up on, and enjoy asian MMOs). Itemization is boring. In the graphical department, backgrounds are good, character models are mediocre, but animations are terrible. Music is passable, sound effects are awkward. Supposedly this game is based on some well-established German fantasy IP, but it's hard to tell because there is next to no story, and the few bits of dialogue that do appear are completely generic. Speaking of German, the translation to English is spotty with some words eyeballed by the translator because "they're probably close enough". The interface is poorly ported from touch controls to mouse and some areas of menu navigation are cumbersome.\n\nAre there any positives? The biggest that I can think of is that the game writes its "savegames" to the Windows Registry in plaintext. This allows for a... more freeform experience and resolves some issues with the grind. And, admittedly, the gameplay felt a bit addictive - just a bit. I actually considered giving this a positive review for a moment, despite everything listed above. However, the standard asking price of 10 euro was the last straw. If you can catch this at an extreme discount (90% or more) then get it for the achievements.

Some game designer evidently concluded that gamers love managing their equipment and progressing up a skill tree so much that the sensible thing to do would be to offer a game that strips away all the other elements of an RPG, and makes the player responsible for inventory and skill-progression management of a character who is otherwise a complete automaton, progressing from one randomly selected monster to the next, and battling them entirely without your input.  It's boring and tedious.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are pretty and the background music is pleasant, although the sound of "your" character and the monsters he fights endlessly making the same repetitive grunts at each other gets aggravating quickly.  The English translation is rather weak, too.\n\nBottom line, Skilltree Saga removes too much autonomy from the player, resulting in a pseudo-RPG that's a very small step removed from being a clicker game.  If that's the experience you're seeking, you're probably better off just playing a clicker in the first place.","January 10","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
