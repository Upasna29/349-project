"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/209520/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Mini Moto Racing EVO is a game that ought to be more fun than it is. A isometric arcade racer in the vein of Rock ‘n’ Roll Racing and Micro Machines, from the outside looking in it would appear the stars had aligned for a brilliant modern take on the genre. The art style is adorable and bursting with charm and personality, it features an absurd amount of content, and the online multiplayer and track editor are just the icing on the cake to ensure you never run out of stuff to do. What’s so terribly unfortunate though, is all these good feelings evaporate once you get behind the wheel.\n\nMini Moto is designed to be extremely accessible, from the light as air physics to the quick and simple to navigate courses, which makes for an enjoyable first hour or so as you get your feet wet and start blowing through courses. After that point, the experience begins to sour. Races grow repetitive, often simply reversing the track or changing the lighting and camera angle slightly, and end in an extremely unsatisfying manner. Simply continuing on with them quickly becomes a grind, as you’re given such little reason to do so and the racing itself is far too shallow to sustain the game on its own.\n\nExpounding the grind is the leveling system, which I would go so far as to say fundamentally breaks the game. Every car you drive can be upgraded with cash earned from races, but instead of scaling to your car’s specs your competitors just continue to upgrade their own vehicles the more races you partake in, presumably with the expectation you’d have similar upgrades of your own. What this means is that you are either stuck putting all your cash into one car for the duration of the championship mode, removing much of the fun out of having such a variety of vehicles to choose from, or forced to grind through the same races in order to have enough to upgrade another car to switch to without having to start again at square one. It’s supremely monotonous and a poor design decision for the sort of game the developers created.\n\nWithout a doubt my biggest grievance with Mini Moto though, is the astonishingly bad AI of the computer racers. They crash into each other even to their own detriment, fire nitros at the worst possible time, and in general act like an idiotic band of monkeys that somehow got ahold of dozens of vehicles. The lack of any decent reward for winning races is bad enough, but when you do so against some of the worst AI racers I’ve ever seen in a game it just becomes a chore to do so. The online MP could fix this in theory, but unless you have several friends to play with you’ll be entirely out of luck as nobody else is playing the online mode anymore.\n\nIt’s really a huge shame that so many elements of EVO are a product of poor design decisions, because there are a lot of genuinely fantastic parts to it that deserve a better racing experience. The art style for the cars and tracks is fantastic, with tons of color and some great off-brand recreations of classic and novelty vehicles. The track editor is surprisingly expansive and easy to use, which could have allowed for some great user generated content if people cared enough to put the time into making something original.\n\nBut regardless of its presentation or feature list, a racing game with poor racing is impossible to recommend. I put a lot of time into Mini Moto Racing EVO, more than I should have, but regardless of how long I played or what races I chose I wasn’t having fun with any of it. There’s something mind numbingly addictive about the way EVO is structured, pushing me through race after race no matter how little I got out of it, or how much I wanted to just call it quits because it was sucking me dry. I don’t want to say I hate the game, but it’s one I’m forcing myself to uninstall.\n\nIt’s like a bad relationship, giving me nothing but keeping me trapped until I finally come to my senses and realize I need to get out.","May 31, 2014","false","5.6"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","43","56","0","2"

The title is apt and descriptive, because you're driving around in miniature vehicles. Its a beautiful game with a lot of diverse locales, fitting music, fun and challenge all rolled into one. Its tough to get anything more into this package, but Mini Motor goes the extra mile with a map editor and online or network multiplayer. Its also a game that uses its licenses admirably from games like Team Fortress 2, Portal 2 and to my amazement Fruit Ninja.\n\nThe game has two major control schemes, both of which play excellent with a controller or keyboard and mouse. The first controller feels alien, yet its so right. Point the analog stick the way you want to go, much like non racing games. They still have a more typical control scheme of left and right to steer, but pointing the stick plays a lot better, there's no overshooting your vehicle's angle.\n\nThe driving does take a bit of time to get used to. Your vehicle can turn on a dime, and often you're going so fast that you'll leave skid marks with every turn. Letting off the accelerator will put you at a dead stop almost immediately. There is no momentum in this game, unless you're pushing the gas. There's also no reverse, but that's the side effect of being able to turn your car without hitting the gas.\n\nLike the majority of racing games, you also have a nitro button and in this game, it feels a lot different. You have blocks of nitro. Press the nitro button once to use a block and this nitro cannons you forward at a reckless pace. Its total risk or reward with this nitro boost and you'll need it to overtake other vehicles that outmatch yours. Nitro canisters always appear on the track at random to give you an extra nitro block as long as you're under your maximum. You can also pick up cash on the track as well.\n\nMini Motor Racing has three difficulty campaigns. You start on easy and then after a few cups, you'll unlock the next difficulty. These difficulties have a series of cups, each cup has four races. When you come in third place or higher of all races in the cup, it will unlock the next cup for you. Of course some cups can last twelve races, so its not limited to four. The cups transition smooth from one to the next and you can play any previous race.\n\nAs for the races themselves, they're brief on closed circuit courses that are only around a minute for three or four laps. I say brief, because they're still a quick shot of fun and never overstays its welcome. The races do get longer as you proceed further into what feels like it could be a long game. At two hours in, I haven't completed all of the easy beginners championship races. You race against five other cars for most of the game, but you do start out against one, two then three competitors and so on. With more aggressive racers, it can become hazardous to even start a race. Faster vehicles can ram into you and turn you around before the first turn.\n\nThe cars feel heavy, you can ram someone and push them around. While the game hardly has realistic physics, the dirty play physics are great.  Ramming someone out of your way or spinning them with such tight quarters is always a joy that other racing games have forgotten about. With the racers being mini, it becomes a feat to spin someone around rather than just pushing them. That can come back to haunt you. Any pile of cars becomes dangerous as they push right into you rather than dodge you. This is geared for the arcade, rather than realism. Its tough to avoid pile ups at the first turn.\n\nThese races all have themed environments and music. Vernice city streets near waterways. A port full of shipping containers. The wilds of Africa through a river next to hippos. Racing on a Mayan temple. At a yellow sand beach across a bridge that dips into the water. Its all bright, colorful, eye catching and makes the game more fun.The soundtrack is diverse and good even if its generic, its all still fitting. Its rare, but tracks can go indoors or under bridges where the overlying areas become transparent. The developers made the game dynamic, eclectic and shows the effort put in.\n\nTo get longevity out of the courses, you will be racing on a lot of the courses a few times, but with a twist. Some races reverse the track. Other events are at night, or at dusk. The largest twist when you do the same race in a different cup is a literal one. The game will shift the perspective of the track. It helps to keep things interesting on what would otherwise be the same race for the forth time. The mini map stays the same, so what is north on the mini map could be southeast on the track itself. There are a few objects to bump into on each track. You can run down cones, knock over tire stacks and it all feels good to interact and mess up the course a little.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 and Portal 2 tracks are a big appeal of the game and they do make good uses of their respective franchises. You have Helen's voice in the Team Fortress 2 and the sentries voice from Portal 2. Portal 2's level has a big portal at the end to bridge a gap from the end to the finish. The Team Fortress 2 map has a lot of indoor areas and I can best describe it as the race version of Badlands. I only encountered each track once, but the Fruit Ninja track is everywhere.\n\nThere is a large variety of vehicles. I keep calling them vehicles, because there are more than typical stock cars, derby cars, muscle cars and race cars, because in Mini Motor, you can drive as a police car, school bus, jeep and even an ambulance. The big buses can be dangerous with their top speed. It gives the game a lot of character and flare to be driving what you want.You'll find plenty of vehicles unlocked from the start and they're all free. The vehicles all have different skins to chose from, so you can even play as Herby the Love Bug.\n\nEach of the vehicles has their own stats for acceleration, top speed, nitro and handling. These stats can be upgraded to a certain extent by purchasing upgrades with your race winnings. The higher the tier of upgrade, the more it will cost and you'll need these upgrades to keep competing with higher levels of competition. The unfortunate part is that if you switch vehicles to one that you haven't spent thousands on upgrading, there's no way to be competitive in further races. At least you can take your cash earned from one vehicle and carry it over to a new vehicle. You can downgrade as well if you need to.\n\nUpgrading never felt like I could instantly win, it always felt like a competitive challenge. Sure there are races where some cars are just geared toward that terrain and those curves, but for the most part everything was good enjoyable, neck and neck fun once I was past the first initial races.\n\nThere are quick race modes with all of the tracks you've unlocked and ones from Steam Workshop. You even have a track designer. I never expect much from a budget game's level designers, but this is easy to use and you can create something good to play in a short amount of time, albeit dull and lacking from the main game. Clicking your mouse on angles and dragging the road to make the precise curve or angle you want. Investing more time would probably yield great results if you spend the time to place props down.\n\nYou can download tracks from the Steam Workshop, but what I really want is entire cups worth of tracks or the ability to make my own cups on top of tracks. A single racetrack is just too quick. Its the bread stick rather than a complete meal.\n\nMini Motor Racing EVO is a fantastic game for a dirt cheap price. Its a game for any fan of the overhead racing genre and a fun, enjoyable experience with challenge. At $5 its tough to argue with the price for a game with so much fun and content.","September 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.\n\nWhile enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.\n\nThe physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.\n\nAt the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.\n\nIt's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track.","January 29, 2014","false","10.9"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","49","68","0","0"

I keep the accellerator on, keep bumping in everything, turn too much or not enough, or not in the right direction. And the whole macho street racing, girls in tank tops, alpha male fast and furious coating that many of the games seem to be aiming for really turns me off. When it came to this game it was like playing with my childhood's toy cars. Sure I sucked, but I didnt mind because the tracks were super simple, the presentation was clean and crisp, the gameplay worked well, the other cars - although they kept beating me - also did stupid stuff like I did, even if you lose all the time you get a small amount of money to put into upgrading your cars at the garage, and there are lots of cars. This game is super cute, and would easily appeal to people of a younger age or casual gamers and people who are not into racing. And if pricepoint matters to you five dollards and with a sale... You could do a lot worse than picking this up.

Most of my play time was spent racing with a friend in 1v1 races which were generally decided by how the physics treated the player.  In some occasions a vehicle could get flipped on its side seemingly randomly and on a lot  of occasions an agressive side-swipe at my opponent would leave me in a worse off situation than him!  There seemed to be no realism or accuracy in the physics therefore removing any type of skill factor in the driving and racing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PBu8tufUp4\n\nNow the game looks really nice and fun.  It almost seems criminal to me to make a top-down racing game appear so nice and colorful to look at but then get let down by such a major game-breaking factor!\n\nThere's a large array of cars to choose from and an even more impressive track selection with day and night variants.  I learned today that the game also has Steam Workshop for creating and sharing your own track designs!!\n\nYou have an option of two different systems to control your vehicle.  The first type is the more conventional method of rotate/steer the car clockwise/anti-clockwise and the second type is to push in the direction you want to travel.  Now the second method of pusing in the desired direction of travel sounds awful to me but I actually found it a more efficient way to play this game.  You still have to accelerate and brake the same with both methods.  It's worth testing them both out with an open mind and seeing which works best for you.\n\nThere is no local co-op feature but the online multiplayer works fine.  I'm not sure about the playerbase but I managed to find my steam friend to play with without any problems and our games ran smoothly.\n\nSo many positive points about this game let down by a lack of fine-tuning in the physics.  The game boasts "cross-platform multiplayer" so possibly the physics were acceptable on a mobile platform.  I think on the PC platform we expect a bit more from our game.\n\nIf you can put up with the clunky physics and have a friend or three to play with then you could have some fun for sure.  For me though, it removed almost all competiveness and thus removed the fun and motivation to race further.","March 26","false","3.7"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","22","30","3","0"

The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.  You'll need more than just a couple of afternoons to make it to the end, and every time you make it past that one difficult course, it feels just great.

This game makes pretty much every mistake an arcade racer can make. The first couple of races are just fine, but later on the issues this game has start ruining it to such an extend it is no longer fun to play.\n\nThe AI: Probably the biggest issue. They are not on the track to win. They are there to make sure you don't win. Without hesitation they will boost into you from every possible angle in order to slow you down or flip you over. When the best strategy in a racing game involves restarting the race so many times until you manage to make a clean getaway instead of actually racing your opponents, you know things are not as they should be.\n\nWonky car handling: It's an arcade racer, so realistic car handling is not to be expected. But the cars in this game behave very vague and inconsistent, making for a very frustrating experience. Good examples of the weird car physics are slopes or ramps. You can drive onto them in the exact same spot for 5 laps and everything's just fine and on lap 6 it suddenly spins your car around on the spot and brings you to a dead stop (after which 9 times out of 10 an AI boosts into you to finish the job). And don't even think about driving off or onto a slope while steering as it will make you spin out of control instantly.\n\nInvisible objects: A lot of the tracks are plagued with invisible objects and walls on the corners. In some corners the cars can pretty much clip through objects without issue, and on other corners you find yourself smashing into an invisible wall that is sticking out into the track.\n\nPrize money too low: With the very low amounts of prize money you get, it becomes a real grind in order to fully upgrade a 2nd, let alone a 3rd car. And you absolutely want multiple cars in the later cups in order to use their individual strengths and weaknesses for different tracks.\n\nIt's a shame really, as the general design of this game is very good. Graphics, track design, music and car design are all very nicely done, but it's the actual gameplay that ruins it. If you're looking for a good micro machines-style racer, then look at Bang Bang Racing instead. While that game also has it's issues it is much more enjoyable then this one.","June 23, 2014","false","21.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The AI isn't as bad as everyone seems to be saying it is.  Playing on anything higher than easy greatly improves the AI experience, and makes the game a real challenge.  The bumper car-style gameplay goes away once you ramp up the difficulty.\n\nThe graphics are that of a very high end mobile game, and it shows that it is actually a mobile game.  The controls are actually a very good port of touch based controls, from the mobile game.  It includes all the DLC mobile maps that you originally had to shell out money for, and does so in style.  It's a true proper mobile to PC port, removing all the bad bits of mobile ports and keeping the good.  The good being very fun 15 minutes at a time game sessions.\n\nRacing wise, the handling can get a little sloppy on a few maps.  There are some bumps that just shouldn't exist, and can cause you to fly off the map.  However some might say those are simply skill challenges and you need to slow down.  Outside of getting air handling is very tight and well done.  You don't drive on ice like in GTA, instead you drive tight turns when you mean to, and wide turns when you mean to.  It's very easy to control, probably due to it's extremely sloppy control background on mobile games.  Seriously, touch racing is impossible.\n\nThere is a variety of maps, and quite a lot of cars.  A truly endless amount if you include the workshop.  There is also a map editor for you to make maps for your friends, or to upload to the workshop.\n\nWhich leads to the next thing...  Multiplayer.  It's very well implemented and not at all laggy.  It's very fun to race and bash you're buddies, just like in any other game.\n\n\nI picked the game up on a whim of liking cute RC racers, and I don't regret it one bit.  If you're the same, go ahead and grab it.  If you're looking for a captivating, serious racer, look elsewhere.","February 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

The tracks are fun. But is it a good game?\nNo! The AI drivers behave like they're alone on track, constantly bumping into each other and the player. And as if that's not enough the smallest collisions slow you down to a crawl, spin your car around and thus make you vulnerable for yet more AI drivers to crash into you, repeating the cycle. But if you manage to get a good start and survive the first 10 seconds the AI drivers will take each other out every too often and it's too easy to drive home a win. Unless you get screwed by lapped cars, of which there are way too many for these small grids and 1-2 minute races.\n\nA lot of good games lack the polish.

The difficulty is insane. This certainly ain't a game for the kiddies, I'll tell ya' that now. There are two problems that factor in together for this.\n\nThe first is that the physics are very aggravating at times. It is borderline inconceivable to maintain any sort of speed when attempting to corner. You will either end up having to slow down to a crawl or letting off the acceleration for a brief second and doing subtle taps in order to turn but that still annihiliates your speed. It may be easier with an analog control such as a joystick, wheel or a game pad but I haven't tried this.\n\nThe second is that the AI opponents are EXTREMELY brutal and relentless. They WILL shunt you at any opportunity they get and you WILL eventually get spun out and there is nothing you can do. Simple as that. If you do get spun out, you lose, good luck catching up afterwards. Get used to it. You could still try by saving your nitros but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nThis game is actually quite a lot of fun but you'd either have to be extremely lucky, have a lot of patience or just like losing races every now and then in order to enjoy this. For a game that you would play for about 20 minutes each time, it shouldn't be this difficult.","December 12, 2013","false","0.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/209520/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Mini Moto Racing EVO is a game that ought to be more fun than it is. A isometric arcade racer in the vein of Rock ‘n’ Roll Racing and Micro Machines, from the outside looking in it would appear the stars had aligned for a brilliant modern take on the genre. The art style is adorable and bursting with charm and personality, it features an absurd amount of content, and the online multiplayer and track editor are just the icing on the cake to ensure you never run out of stuff to do. What’s so terribly unfortunate though, is all these good feelings evaporate once you get behind the wheel.\n\nMini Moto is designed to be extremely accessible, from the light as air physics to the quick and simple to navigate courses, which makes for an enjoyable first hour or so as you get your feet wet and start blowing through courses. After that point, the experience begins to sour. Races grow repetitive, often simply reversing the track or changing the lighting and camera angle slightly, and end in an extremely unsatisfying manner. Simply continuing on with them quickly becomes a grind, as you’re given such little reason to do so and the racing itself is far too shallow to sustain the game on its own.\n\nExpounding the grind is the leveling system, which I would go so far as to say fundamentally breaks the game. Every car you drive can be upgraded with cash earned from races, but instead of scaling to your car’s specs your competitors just continue to upgrade their own vehicles the more races you partake in, presumably with the expectation you’d have similar upgrades of your own. What this means is that you are either stuck putting all your cash into one car for the duration of the championship mode, removing much of the fun out of having such a variety of vehicles to choose from, or forced to grind through the same races in order to have enough to upgrade another car to switch to without having to start again at square one. It’s supremely monotonous and a poor design decision for the sort of game the developers created.\n\nWithout a doubt my biggest grievance with Mini Moto though, is the astonishingly bad AI of the computer racers. They crash into each other even to their own detriment, fire nitros at the worst possible time, and in general act like an idiotic band of monkeys that somehow got ahold of dozens of vehicles. The lack of any decent reward for winning races is bad enough, but when you do so against some of the worst AI racers I’ve ever seen in a game it just becomes a chore to do so. The online MP could fix this in theory, but unless you have several friends to play with you’ll be entirely out of luck as nobody else is playing the online mode anymore.\n\nIt’s really a huge shame that so many elements of EVO are a product of poor design decisions, because there are a lot of genuinely fantastic parts to it that deserve a better racing experience. The art style for the cars and tracks is fantastic, with tons of color and some great off-brand recreations of classic and novelty vehicles. The track editor is surprisingly expansive and easy to use, which could have allowed for some great user generated content if people cared enough to put the time into making something original.\n\nBut regardless of its presentation or feature list, a racing game with poor racing is impossible to recommend. I put a lot of time into Mini Moto Racing EVO, more than I should have, but regardless of how long I played or what races I chose I wasn’t having fun with any of it. There’s something mind numbingly addictive about the way EVO is structured, pushing me through race after race no matter how little I got out of it, or how much I wanted to just call it quits because it was sucking me dry. I don’t want to say I hate the game, but it’s one I’m forcing myself to uninstall.\n\nIt’s like a bad relationship, giving me nothing but keeping me trapped until I finally come to my senses and realize I need to get out.","May 31, 2014","false","5.6"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","43","56","0","2"

The title is apt and descriptive, because you're driving around in miniature vehicles. Its a beautiful game with a lot of diverse locales, fitting music, fun and challenge all rolled into one. Its tough to get anything more into this package, but Mini Motor goes the extra mile with a map editor and online or network multiplayer. Its also a game that uses its licenses admirably from games like Team Fortress 2, Portal 2 and to my amazement Fruit Ninja.\n\nThe game has two major control schemes, both of which play excellent with a controller or keyboard and mouse. The first controller feels alien, yet its so right. Point the analog stick the way you want to go, much like non racing games. They still have a more typical control scheme of left and right to steer, but pointing the stick plays a lot better, there's no overshooting your vehicle's angle.\n\nThe driving does take a bit of time to get used to. Your vehicle can turn on a dime, and often you're going so fast that you'll leave skid marks with every turn. Letting off the accelerator will put you at a dead stop almost immediately. There is no momentum in this game, unless you're pushing the gas. There's also no reverse, but that's the side effect of being able to turn your car without hitting the gas.\n\nLike the majority of racing games, you also have a nitro button and in this game, it feels a lot different. You have blocks of nitro. Press the nitro button once to use a block and this nitro cannons you forward at a reckless pace. Its total risk or reward with this nitro boost and you'll need it to overtake other vehicles that outmatch yours. Nitro canisters always appear on the track at random to give you an extra nitro block as long as you're under your maximum. You can also pick up cash on the track as well.\n\nMini Motor Racing has three difficulty campaigns. You start on easy and then after a few cups, you'll unlock the next difficulty. These difficulties have a series of cups, each cup has four races. When you come in third place or higher of all races in the cup, it will unlock the next cup for you. Of course some cups can last twelve races, so its not limited to four. The cups transition smooth from one to the next and you can play any previous race.\n\nAs for the races themselves, they're brief on closed circuit courses that are only around a minute for three or four laps. I say brief, because they're still a quick shot of fun and never overstays its welcome. The races do get longer as you proceed further into what feels like it could be a long game. At two hours in, I haven't completed all of the easy beginners championship races. You race against five other cars for most of the game, but you do start out against one, two then three competitors and so on. With more aggressive racers, it can become hazardous to even start a race. Faster vehicles can ram into you and turn you around before the first turn.\n\nThe cars feel heavy, you can ram someone and push them around. While the game hardly has realistic physics, the dirty play physics are great.  Ramming someone out of your way or spinning them with such tight quarters is always a joy that other racing games have forgotten about. With the racers being mini, it becomes a feat to spin someone around rather than just pushing them. That can come back to haunt you. Any pile of cars becomes dangerous as they push right into you rather than dodge you. This is geared for the arcade, rather than realism. Its tough to avoid pile ups at the first turn.\n\nThese races all have themed environments and music. Vernice city streets near waterways. A port full of shipping containers. The wilds of Africa through a river next to hippos. Racing on a Mayan temple. At a yellow sand beach across a bridge that dips into the water. Its all bright, colorful, eye catching and makes the game more fun.The soundtrack is diverse and good even if its generic, its all still fitting. Its rare, but tracks can go indoors or under bridges where the overlying areas become transparent. The developers made the game dynamic, eclectic and shows the effort put in.\n\nTo get longevity out of the courses, you will be racing on a lot of the courses a few times, but with a twist. Some races reverse the track. Other events are at night, or at dusk. The largest twist when you do the same race in a different cup is a literal one. The game will shift the perspective of the track. It helps to keep things interesting on what would otherwise be the same race for the forth time. The mini map stays the same, so what is north on the mini map could be southeast on the track itself. There are a few objects to bump into on each track. You can run down cones, knock over tire stacks and it all feels good to interact and mess up the course a little.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 and Portal 2 tracks are a big appeal of the game and they do make good uses of their respective franchises. You have Helen's voice in the Team Fortress 2 and the sentries voice from Portal 2. Portal 2's level has a big portal at the end to bridge a gap from the end to the finish. The Team Fortress 2 map has a lot of indoor areas and I can best describe it as the race version of Badlands. I only encountered each track once, but the Fruit Ninja track is everywhere.\n\nThere is a large variety of vehicles. I keep calling them vehicles, because there are more than typical stock cars, derby cars, muscle cars and race cars, because in Mini Motor, you can drive as a police car, school bus, jeep and even an ambulance. The big buses can be dangerous with their top speed. It gives the game a lot of character and flare to be driving what you want.You'll find plenty of vehicles unlocked from the start and they're all free. The vehicles all have different skins to chose from, so you can even play as Herby the Love Bug.\n\nEach of the vehicles has their own stats for acceleration, top speed, nitro and handling. These stats can be upgraded to a certain extent by purchasing upgrades with your race winnings. The higher the tier of upgrade, the more it will cost and you'll need these upgrades to keep competing with higher levels of competition. The unfortunate part is that if you switch vehicles to one that you haven't spent thousands on upgrading, there's no way to be competitive in further races. At least you can take your cash earned from one vehicle and carry it over to a new vehicle. You can downgrade as well if you need to.\n\nUpgrading never felt like I could instantly win, it always felt like a competitive challenge. Sure there are races where some cars are just geared toward that terrain and those curves, but for the most part everything was good enjoyable, neck and neck fun once I was past the first initial races.\n\nThere are quick race modes with all of the tracks you've unlocked and ones from Steam Workshop. You even have a track designer. I never expect much from a budget game's level designers, but this is easy to use and you can create something good to play in a short amount of time, albeit dull and lacking from the main game. Clicking your mouse on angles and dragging the road to make the precise curve or angle you want. Investing more time would probably yield great results if you spend the time to place props down.\n\nYou can download tracks from the Steam Workshop, but what I really want is entire cups worth of tracks or the ability to make my own cups on top of tracks. A single racetrack is just too quick. Its the bread stick rather than a complete meal.\n\nMini Motor Racing EVO is a fantastic game for a dirt cheap price. Its a game for any fan of the overhead racing genre and a fun, enjoyable experience with challenge. At $5 its tough to argue with the price for a game with so much fun and content.","September 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.\n\nWhile enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.\n\nThe physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.\n\nAt the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.\n\nIt's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track.","January 29, 2014","false","10.9"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","49","68","0","0"

Most of my play time was spent racing with a friend in 1v1 races which were generally decided by how the physics treated the player.  In some occasions a vehicle could get flipped on its side seemingly randomly and on a lot  of occasions an agressive side-swipe at my opponent would leave me in a worse off situation than him!  There seemed to be no realism or accuracy in the physics therefore removing any type of skill factor in the driving and racing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PBu8tufUp4\n\nNow the game looks really nice and fun.  It almost seems criminal to me to make a top-down racing game appear so nice and colorful to look at but then get let down by such a major game-breaking factor!\n\nThere's a large array of cars to choose from and an even more impressive track selection with day and night variants.  I learned today that the game also has Steam Workshop for creating and sharing your own track designs!!\n\nYou have an option of two different systems to control your vehicle.  The first type is the more conventional method of rotate/steer the car clockwise/anti-clockwise and the second type is to push in the direction you want to travel.  Now the second method of pusing in the desired direction of travel sounds awful to me but I actually found it a more efficient way to play this game.  You still have to accelerate and brake the same with both methods.  It's worth testing them both out with an open mind and seeing which works best for you.\n\nThere is no local co-op feature but the online multiplayer works fine.  I'm not sure about the playerbase but I managed to find my steam friend to play with without any problems and our games ran smoothly.\n\nSo many positive points about this game let down by a lack of fine-tuning in the physics.  The game boasts "cross-platform multiplayer" so possibly the physics were acceptable on a mobile platform.  I think on the PC platform we expect a bit more from our game.\n\nIf you can put up with the clunky physics and have a friend or three to play with then you could have some fun for sure.  For me though, it removed almost all competiveness and thus removed the fun and motivation to race further.","March 26","false","3.7"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","22","30","3","0"

The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.  You'll need more than just a couple of afternoons to make it to the end, and every time you make it past that one difficult course, it feels just great.  A worthwhile purchase if you like small, classic racers.","April 23, 2014","true","30.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

This game makes pretty much every mistake an arcade racer can make. The first couple of races are just fine, but later on the issues this game has start ruining it to such an extend it is no longer fun to play.\n\nThe AI: Probably the biggest issue. They are not on the track to win. They are there to make sure you don't win. Without hesitation they will boost into you from every possible angle in order to slow you down or flip you over. When the best strategy in a racing game involves restarting the race so many times until you manage to make a clean getaway instead of actually racing your opponents, you know things are not as they should be.\n\nWonky car handling: It's an arcade racer, so realistic car handling is not to be expected. But the cars in this game behave very vague and inconsistent, making for a very frustrating experience. Good examples of the weird car physics are slopes or ramps. You can drive onto them in the exact same spot for 5 laps and everything's just fine and on lap 6 it suddenly spins your car around on the spot and brings you to a dead stop (after which 9 times out of 10 an AI boosts into you to finish the job). And don't even think about driving off or onto a slope while steering as it will make you spin out of control instantly.\n\nInvisible objects: A lot of the tracks are plagued with invisible objects and walls on the corners. In some corners the cars can pretty much clip through objects without issue, and on other corners you find yourself smashing into an invisible wall that is sticking out into the track.\n\nPrize money too low: With the very low amounts of prize money you get, it becomes a real grind in order to fully upgrade a 2nd, let alone a 3rd car. And you absolutely want multiple cars in the later cups in order to use their individual strengths and weaknesses for different tracks.\n\nIt's a shame really, as the general design of this game is very good. Graphics, track design, music and car design are all very nicely done, but it's the actual gameplay that ruins it. If you're looking for a good micro machines-style racer, then look at Bang Bang Racing instead. While that game also has it's issues it is much more enjoyable then this one.","June 23, 2014","false","21.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/XDeadzX/recommended/209520/","XDeadzX","XDeadzX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/XDeadzX/","784 products in account","The game is a very quirky and cute RC car racer.  The AI isn't as bad as everyone seems to be saying it is.  Playing on anything higher than easy greatly improves the AI experience, and makes the game a real challenge.  The bumper car-style gameplay goes away once you ramp up the difficulty.\n\nThe graphics are that of a very high end mobile game, and it shows that it is actually a mobile game.  The controls are actually a very good port of touch based controls, from the mobile game.  It includes all the DLC mobile maps that you originally had to shell out money for, and does so in style.  It's a true proper mobile to PC port, removing all the bad bits of mobile ports and keeping the good.  The good being very fun 15 minutes at a time game sessions.\n\nRacing wise, the handling can get a little sloppy on a few maps.  There are some bumps that just shouldn't exist, and can cause you to fly off the map.  However some might say those are simply skill challenges and you need to slow down.  Outside of getting air handling is very tight and well done.  You don't drive on ice like in GTA, instead you drive tight turns when you mean to, and wide turns when you mean to.  It's very easy to control, probably due to it's extremely sloppy control background on mobile games.  Seriously, touch racing is impossible.\n\nThere is a variety of maps, and quite a lot of cars.  A truly endless amount if you include the workshop.  There is also a map editor for you to make maps for your friends, or to upload to the workshop.\n\nWhich leads to the next thing...  Multiplayer.  It's very well implemented and not at all laggy.  It's very fun to race and bash you're buddies, just like in any other game.\n\n\nI picked the game up on a whim of liking cute RC racers, and I don't regret it one bit.  If you're the same, go ahead and grab it.  If you're looking for a captivating, serious racer, look elsewhere.","February 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Then there's the handling, it takes a while to get used to but the majority of cars will still handle like crap, making the game virtually unplayable with the lower-handling vehicles. The optimizatin is also relatively poor for what's easily considered a phone game, since the framerate can drop on the night tracks while it's near a consistent 60 on day tracks.","March 23, 2014","false","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have no idea why I played all the way through the expert championship.\n\nThe AI sucks and pretty much just plows through whatever's in its way, which is frequently you. The physics suck, so when the AI plows through you there's no telling which way you'll be facing or how long it will take until your car is upright again.\n\nWhen I say "the physics suck," I mean your car handles like a balloon. Except when it handles like a plastic bag. It's the floatiest racer I've ever played.\n\nAbout half of the tracks suck, and the ones that don't will feel like they suck because your field of view is limited and the angle at which the track is presented is arbitrary. (I really do mean "arbitrary." Sometimes the same track will be presented from a different direction for no good reason. Often the chosen direction maximizes the extent to which you can't actually see your car or the track on some turns.)\n\nBy the time you've upgraded your car, you can lap more than half the other racers by the end of the second lap. Except the guy in second will pass you once you're forced to pass the clowns in the bottom slots again, because it's very difficult to pass an AI that pretends you're not there unless you're also an AI, which the guy in second is.\n\nOh, right, and all the music is at best boring. Some of it is actually irritating.\n\nRemember how annoying the yellow car was in RC Pro Am? I'd rather play that game any day of the week.","July 6, 2014","false","9.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The colors are vibrant and the tracks vary in environment. It's a top down racer and brings back nostalgic feelings of arcade games of old. It's fun overall most of the time. The game is not too easy in that you will not blow through this with ease. Some tracks you will be racing as aggressive as possible just to come in the top 3 to get some decent money. There is a Multiplayer option.\n\nCons: It's fun MOST of the time. The other time that it's not fun is due to the punishing AI and questionable framerate issues. I was running this with an overclocked HD4650 and had framerate issues even when the settings were set to Low or Off on everything. ***(Upgrading to a HD7850 corrected these issues)***\n\nThere are times that you will race right through the map and respawn as other cars race ahead of you. At times you will end up upside down and as long as you are moving, you won't respawn right side up to continue the race. In other words, prepare to yell at the screen as you are sliding on your side at 5mph as everyone races past you or hits you and continues the slide to your defeat.\n\nBinary Mill states that my settings were enough to run the game, but not enough for it to run decently to actually play apparently. Developer needs to give better System Requirements for this game. The AI are downright brutal and will often try to wreck you right into a wall or sandwich you into other people like an adult flick. There is a Multiplayer option (see above). Only thing is that Binary Mill's servers are down and according to the forums (and how far this issue goes back), that will not change anytime soon or possibly ever.\n\nIf you buy this game, don't expect multiplayer.","January 13, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You can make good races against faster cars on harder cups - if you are a good driver -  later buying upgrades ensures that you will eventualy start to catch up AI opponents if you dont make it in the races with a inferior car.. i.e. the game is tilted in the beginning so that your car is slow but as you become beter driver and get more upgrades you start to own the opposition one way or the other. 'No driver left behind' -policy i guess you can call it. :)\n\nd) related to part c. there will always be a challenge left for you. tons of races and cups and AI will (literaly) push you hard around.\n\nAnd should you think that races get too easy? well you can switch the car but the catch is that upgrades are always tied to certain cars so if you want something else or unlock a new car then you need to start over.","August 28, 2013","true","14.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a fun game to play however, I would strongly recommend using an external source of control such as an Xbox controller or the controls can be fairly difficult. The whole game is very simple and easy to get into, the AI isn't great but sometimes provides a good challenge. I finished first in every race within about 6 hours.\n\nTo expand gameplay beyond the single player experience, the developers have included a multiplayer option, The only downside to this is that I have never found anyone to play against because only about ten people actually play this game. There is a map builder option which is very fun and the mobile version lacks. The maps can be shared via the Steam workshop and you can download and play maps that the community have created for free. I do recommend this game however, purchase it for your Smartphone/Tablet instead where is is a fraction of the price and works much better for what it is. That is of course unless you would like the extra features and achievements.","May 29, 2014","true","16.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It doesn't feel like a micromachines / childhood mini cars experience. I rushed to buy the game but then I was dissapointed (there were no steam refunds at the time, 2013).\n\nI have had controller issues since day one. Have tried with different controllers and all of them feels different, work or don't and have to configure them every time. Even when controls are mapped, the game plays awful. Physics will make sure you get in the last place. Forget about using turbo, you'll ruin your hard earned place. If you manage to be in 1st place for the first 15 seconds then you have a chance of winning the race but if your opponent is 10 seconds away from you in a better place then just restart the race, it is impossible to catch up.\n\nI did however managed to run the game when I recently purchased it with one controller (it worked and felt really well) and this is when I could play the game (and used to recommend it as a casual racer) but very little time then the controller died on me and had to rely on mouse or keyboard (mouse is the best alternative so far but keyboard is too laggy). I've been struggling with the game ever since, trying different controllers every now and then but none of them seem to work like the first one, maybe it is the latest patch that brought like a new controller backend but instead it messed it up.\n\nThe level editor is really good though, have spent many hours building custom tracks.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a good casual racing game if you are tolerant to frustration but it is not a game for you if you do not like to lose.","December 5, 2015","false","13.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In this game you drive smaller versions of bigger cars on small tracks, kind of like child sized. There are quite a variety of cars to choose from, each somewhat different than the other.  The game has 40 tracks as it says on the store page, and there are night and day versions of each.  Each version also has their own song.\n\nThe point of the game is to go through championships, and gain money to upgrade your car.  Now each car can be upgraded, but be careful where you spend your money as early on it is hard to make money.  Swapping from car to car giving each of them upgrades would cause you to have no money and bad cars.  The unlockable cars are pretty nice, you get one for completing a championship and completing certain races for the portal team fortress and fruit ninja cars.  Though I never used them because I wouldn't be able to afford to upgrade them.\n\nThe Achievements in this game are rather easy to get except the last achievement which is the money bags one.  It requires you to have 100,000$ cash on hand at once, which is impossible because you upgrade your cars, and that costs a lot of money.\n\nOne downfall of the game is the repetitiveness.  Each track is recycled over and over again, so by the time you finish the game you've played each track 20 times both day and night, so it does get boring after a while.  The AI is absolutely idiotic and does not improve over time, all that makes the game harder later on is that all the AI's cars are upgraded, and the races are more laps.  Near the end the races are so long and take nearly 2 minutes each, and since there is a 100 races in the master cup it's insanely time consuming, and unfortunately it becomes boring.  The controls for me were quite easy to figure out but they might cause a problem for some people.\n\nOverall I did enjoy the game because of the music mostly, the tracks were ok, and AI annoyed me at times.  For 5$ I'd say there are better games but it's ok.","August 26, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of the issues I had with it was the random falling through the maps which got annoying at times when you would fly really high off a jump. The others are just small ones like when you turn on your side it feels like forever before it puts you back on your wheels. The AI in this game aren't the best of drivers and run into you alot so try to brake from the packs and get to first place fast. The multiplayer achievements are easy to get, just create a private game alone and set it up to one lap, win it, then you will get the multiplayer achievements. I never played the game with friends but I could imagine it would be fun. This is a must play with a Xbox 360 controller, it would be crazy annoying to play this with keyboard and mouse.\n\nWith each track it shakes things up with different angles and changes every time to almost make the track seem new but once you learn the tracks then you should be fine since it repeats alot of tracks.

Unfortunately, it is held back by grindy type progression, pure repitition in the races, and the fact that it takes an absurd amount of luck to win.\n\nBasically, the whole game revolves around escaping the pack. If a computer controlled car crashes into you, you will always lose regardless of the positions. If you get stuck in the pack it is almost impossible to escape. The best strategy is to simply restart the races until you're able to start off with a large enough lead to succeed.","November 6, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The models and tracks are really cool to look at and fun to play, though the A.I. really likes to box you into corners you can't get out of. On some levels, this isn't a huge problem, but on others it means you've already lost. The cars themselves are cute and some of the paint schemes and models are references to pop culture (like the Scooby van and DeLorean look-alikes).\n\nThe level editor is ultimately disappointing, because you can only buld flat tracks. So while the pre-built levels wow you with verticality and variety, you're stuck with novice-level custom options.  Since this game hasn't been updated since 2013, I'm guessing this won't be changing anytime soon.\n\nOverall, I'd say pick it up when it's on sale.

The control scheme has a small learning curve if you've never played this type of game before -- the car moves similarly to how a vehicle in a twin-shooter moves. Once you've got the controls figured out, it feels very natural and satisfying, and powerslides come easily.\n\nOverall, the game is very good-looking and polished. There are a couple of cars and tracks based on TF2 and Portal 2. Not surprisingly for a mobile port, the variety is lacking and the game quickly wears out its welcome. The various cups just consist of the same tracks used over and over again, sometimes run in reverse or at nighttime or with varying numbers of laps.

Taking a top-down camera angle, it evokes an arcade-like feel which adds to the game's charm.  There is a good variety of tracks, which include typical racing circuits, downtown cities, deserts, and even three tracks inspired by the Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, and Fruit Ninja universes, and there are even unlockable vehicles to match those franchises.  Speaking of vehicles, there are plenty to choose from, with many others waiting to be unlocked.  The actual racing is fun and even addicting at first; the controls are responsive for the most part, the pace is quick, and the races are short enough to be fun and competitive but not so short as to finish literally seconds after the green light.\n\nIssues with the game include some occasional overly-aggressive AI that seems more focused on taking you out than on actually racing, colliding with computer-controlled vehicles 9 times out of 10 ends up with you spinning out instead of them, and that most vehicles take a lot of time and money to upgrade them to match the mobility of the AI in later races, but none of these problems are not and should not be considered deal-breakers.

Basically your car moves in the direction of the stick; left and right are not relative to how your car is pointing.  Thankfully the digital pad works in a more traditional manner and once I realized this it was a total joy to play.\n\n2) Physics: You have to play the tracks a bit to get the hang of where the walls are and where you can shortcut.  Your car rotates on it's center (not the front) meaning you can turn on a dime and spin out if you aren't a bit gentle with the controls during turns.  The physics are also wonky when your in midair and turn your tires prematurely before you land; instant wipeout.\n\n3) Tracks: So EVERY racing game reuses tracks, makes it a differnt type of day, reverses the driving direction; no big deal.  However, this game added the challenge of also changing the orientation of the camera on repeat use of a track.  This actually makes it super challenging to revisit a track as your brain says "this turn is here" but on screen the turn is actually THIS OTHER WAY since the camera is now in a different position.\n\nOther things of note:\n\n1) Graphics: Very pretty.  I love the feel of the game and how smooth it flows on the screen.\n\n2) Sound/Music: Very enjoyable.\n\n3) Difficulty: Starts off easy enough; you learn when to use your 'nitro' to boost away from the pack of crazy cars and they become a non-issue.  By the 20th or so track however, the AI is competant and WILL whoop your butt.  Car upgrades are a must!\n\nOverall I've enjoyed it quite a bit and plan on treking to the end of the game.","September 7, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difficulty is insane. This certainly ain't a game for the kiddies, I'll tell ya' that now. There are two problems that factor in together for this.\n\nThe first is that the physics are very aggravating at times. It is borderline inconceivable to maintain any sort of speed when attempting to corner. You will either end up having to slow down to a crawl or letting off the acceleration for a brief second and doing subtle taps in order to turn but that still annihiliates your speed. It may be easier with an analog control such as a joystick, wheel or a game pad but I haven't tried this.\n\nThe second is that the AI opponents are EXTREMELY brutal and relentless. They WILL shunt you at any opportunity they get and you WILL eventually get spun out and there is nothing you can do. Simple as that. If you do get spun out, you lose, good luck catching up afterwards. Get used to it. You could still try by saving your nitros but I wouldn't count on it.\n\nThis game is actually quite a lot of fun but you'd either have to be extremely lucky, have a lot of patience or just like losing races every now and then in order to enjoy this. For a game that you would play for about 20 minutes each time, it shouldn't be this difficult.","December 12, 2013","false","0.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

AI is awful. Want to know how to get 1st place every time? Restart until you get lucky enough for those idiots to crash into each other instead of you. That works well until you start to lap them and they all try to sabotage you. Feels more like a 1v5 race instead of a 6 person race.\n\n2. Repetitive maps. They re-use the same maps over and over, putting different spins on them (race backwards! now race at night!) and some of the camera angles cause you to completely not be able to see your car. Here's the #1 thing I want from a racing game: TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY CAR\n\n3. A bunch of cars with little difference between them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/209520/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Mini Moto Racing EVO is a game that ought to be more fun than it is. A isometric arcade racer in the vein of Rock ‘n’ Roll Racing and Micro Machines, from the outside looking in it would appear the stars had aligned for a brilliant modern take on the genre. The art style is adorable and bursting with charm and personality, it features an absurd amount of content, and the online multiplayer and track editor are just the icing on the cake to ensure you never run out of stuff to do. What’s so terribly unfortunate though, is all these good feelings evaporate once you get behind the wheel.\n\nMini Moto is designed to be extremely accessible, from the light as air physics to the quick and simple to navigate courses, which makes for an enjoyable first hour or so as you get your feet wet and start blowing through courses. After that point, the experience begins to sour. Races grow repetitive, often simply reversing the track or changing the lighting and camera angle slightly, and end in an extremely unsatisfying manner. Simply continuing on with them quickly becomes a grind, as you’re given such little reason to do so and the racing itself is far too shallow to sustain the game on its own.\n\nExpounding the grind is the leveling system, which I would go so far as to say fundamentally breaks the game. Every car you drive can be upgraded with cash earned from races, but instead of scaling to your car’s specs your competitors just continue to upgrade their own vehicles the more races you partake in, presumably with the expectation you’d have similar upgrades of your own. What this means is that you are either stuck putting all your cash into one car for the duration of the championship mode, removing much of the fun out of having such a variety of vehicles to choose from, or forced to grind through the same races in order to have enough to upgrade another car to switch to without having to start again at square one. It’s supremely monotonous and a poor design decision for the sort of game the developers created.\n\nWithout a doubt my biggest grievance with Mini Moto though, is the astonishingly bad AI of the computer racers. They crash into each other even to their own detriment, fire nitros at the worst possible time, and in general act like an idiotic band of monkeys that somehow got ahold of dozens of vehicles. The lack of any decent reward for winning races is bad enough, but when you do so against some of the worst AI racers I’ve ever seen in a game it just becomes a chore to do so. The online MP could fix this in theory, but unless you have several friends to play with you’ll be entirely out of luck as nobody else is playing the online mode anymore.\n\nIt’s really a huge shame that so many elements of EVO are a product of poor design decisions, because there are a lot of genuinely fantastic parts to it that deserve a better racing experience. The art style for the cars and tracks is fantastic, with tons of color and some great off-brand recreations of classic and novelty vehicles. The track editor is surprisingly expansive and easy to use, which could have allowed for some great user generated content if people cared enough to put the time into making something original.\n\nBut regardless of its presentation or feature list, a racing game with poor racing is impossible to recommend. I put a lot of time into Mini Moto Racing EVO, more than I should have, but regardless of how long I played or what races I chose I wasn’t having fun with any of it. There’s something mind numbingly addictive about the way EVO is structured, pushing me through race after race no matter how little I got out of it, or how much I wanted to just call it quits because it was sucking me dry. I don’t want to say I hate the game, but it’s one I’m forcing myself to uninstall.\n\nIt’s like a bad relationship, giving me nothing but keeping me trapped until I finally come to my senses and realize I need to get out.","May 31, 2014","false","5.6"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","43","56","0","2"

The title is apt and descriptive, because you're driving around in miniature vehicles. Its a beautiful game with a lot of diverse locales, fitting music, fun and challenge all rolled into one. Its tough to get anything more into this package, but Mini Motor goes the extra mile with a map editor and online or network multiplayer. Its also a game that uses its licenses admirably from games like Team Fortress 2, Portal 2 and to my amazement Fruit Ninja.\n\nThe game has two major control schemes, both of which play excellent with a controller or keyboard and mouse. The first controller feels alien, yet its so right. Point the analog stick the way you want to go, much like non racing games. They still have a more typical control scheme of left and right to steer, but pointing the stick plays a lot better, there's no overshooting your vehicle's angle.\n\nThe driving does take a bit of time to get used to. Your vehicle can turn on a dime, and often you're going so fast that you'll leave skid marks with every turn. Letting off the accelerator will put you at a dead stop almost immediately. There is no momentum in this game, unless you're pushing the gas. There's also no reverse, but that's the side effect of being able to turn your car without hitting the gas.\n\nLike the majority of racing games, you also have a nitro button and in this game, it feels a lot different. You have blocks of nitro. Press the nitro button once to use a block and this nitro cannons you forward at a reckless pace. Its total risk or reward with this nitro boost and you'll need it to overtake other vehicles that outmatch yours. Nitro canisters always appear on the track at random to give you an extra nitro block as long as you're under your maximum. You can also pick up cash on the track as well.\n\nMini Motor Racing has three difficulty campaigns. You start on easy and then after a few cups, you'll unlock the next difficulty. These difficulties have a series of cups, each cup has four races. When you come in third place or higher of all races in the cup, it will unlock the next cup for you. Of course some cups can last twelve races, so its not limited to four. The cups transition smooth from one to the next and you can play any previous race.\n\nAs for the races themselves, they're brief on closed circuit courses that are only around a minute for three or four laps. I say brief, because they're still a quick shot of fun and never overstays its welcome. The races do get longer as you proceed further into what feels like it could be a long game. At two hours in, I haven't completed all of the easy beginners championship races. You race against five other cars for most of the game, but you do start out against one, two then three competitors and so on. With more aggressive racers, it can become hazardous to even start a race. Faster vehicles can ram into you and turn you around before the first turn.\n\nThe cars feel heavy, you can ram someone and push them around. While the game hardly has realistic physics, the dirty play physics are great.  Ramming someone out of your way or spinning them with such tight quarters is always a joy that other racing games have forgotten about. With the racers being mini, it becomes a feat to spin someone around rather than just pushing them. That can come back to haunt you. Any pile of cars becomes dangerous as they push right into you rather than dodge you. This is geared for the arcade, rather than realism. Its tough to avoid pile ups at the first turn.\n\nThese races all have themed environments and music. Vernice city streets near waterways. A port full of shipping containers. The wilds of Africa through a river next to hippos. Racing on a Mayan temple. At a yellow sand beach across a bridge that dips into the water. Its all bright, colorful, eye catching and makes the game more fun.The soundtrack is diverse and good even if its generic, its all still fitting. Its rare, but tracks can go indoors or under bridges where the overlying areas become transparent. The developers made the game dynamic, eclectic and shows the effort put in.\n\nTo get longevity out of the courses, you will be racing on a lot of the courses a few times, but with a twist. Some races reverse the track. Other events are at night, or at dusk. The largest twist when you do the same race in a different cup is a literal one. The game will shift the perspective of the track. It helps to keep things interesting on what would otherwise be the same race for the forth time. The mini map stays the same, so what is north on the mini map could be southeast on the track itself. There are a few objects to bump into on each track. You can run down cones, knock over tire stacks and it all feels good to interact and mess up the course a little.\n\nTeam Fortress 2 and Portal 2 tracks are a big appeal of the game and they do make good uses of their respective franchises. You have Helen's voice in the Team Fortress 2 and the sentries voice from Portal 2. Portal 2's level has a big portal at the end to bridge a gap from the end to the finish. The Team Fortress 2 map has a lot of indoor areas and I can best describe it as the race version of Badlands. I only encountered each track once, but the Fruit Ninja track is everywhere.\n\nThere is a large variety of vehicles. I keep calling them vehicles, because there are more than typical stock cars, derby cars, muscle cars and race cars, because in Mini Motor, you can drive as a police car, school bus, jeep and even an ambulance. The big buses can be dangerous with their top speed. It gives the game a lot of character and flare to be driving what you want.You'll find plenty of vehicles unlocked from the start and they're all free. The vehicles all have different skins to chose from, so you can even play as Herby the Love Bug.\n\nEach of the vehicles has their own stats for acceleration, top speed, nitro and handling. These stats can be upgraded to a certain extent by purchasing upgrades with your race winnings. The higher the tier of upgrade, the more it will cost and you'll need these upgrades to keep competing with higher levels of competition. The unfortunate part is that if you switch vehicles to one that you haven't spent thousands on upgrading, there's no way to be competitive in further races. At least you can take your cash earned from one vehicle and carry it over to a new vehicle. You can downgrade as well if you need to.\n\nUpgrading never felt like I could instantly win, it always felt like a competitive challenge. Sure there are races where some cars are just geared toward that terrain and those curves, but for the most part everything was good enjoyable, neck and neck fun once I was past the first initial races.\n\nThere are quick race modes with all of the tracks you've unlocked and ones from Steam Workshop. You even have a track designer. I never expect much from a budget game's level designers, but this is easy to use and you can create something good to play in a short amount of time, albeit dull and lacking from the main game. Clicking your mouse on angles and dragging the road to make the precise curve or angle you want. Investing more time would probably yield great results if you spend the time to place props down.\n\nYou can download tracks from the Steam Workshop, but what I really want is entire cups worth of tracks or the ability to make my own cups on top of tracks. A single racetrack is just too quick. Its the bread stick rather than a complete meal.\n\nMini Motor Racing EVO is a fantastic game for a dirt cheap price. Its a game for any fan of the overhead racing genre and a fun, enjoyable experience with challenge. At $5 its tough to argue with the price for a game with so much fun and content.","September 19, 2015","true","2.4"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

There is also an ingame editor linked to the Steam Workshop to create, share and download other tracks which is very simple to do.\n\nWhile enjoyable to zip around the tracks and drift around corners, the AI opposition rarely put up any challenge at all (the exception being a couple of maps where you could do with a speed upgrade, that is easily passed the moment you have acquired it or a higher top speed vehicle). It also appears the AI Drivers have been drinking...while it's nice that they don't always perform the perfect lap, they will frequently slam into corners or boost directly into a wall.\n\nThe physics in the game can cause frustration, as you slap to a halt after performing a jump or snag on a slightly uphill piece of track.  There is also an oddity that before a race gets underway you get a glimpse of the tablet UI for the game, but that doesn't impact the experience in any meaningful way.\n\nAt the time of writing, there were no active multiplayer servers.\n\nIt's very hard to recommend Mini Motor Racing EVO except for the extremely casual gamer who's unfamiliar with racing titles and just wants a little fun zipping around a track.","January 29, 2014","false","10.9"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","49","68","0","0"

Sure I sucked, but I didnt mind because the tracks were super simple, the presentation was clean and crisp, the gameplay worked well, the other cars - although they kept beating me - also did stupid stuff like I did, even if you lose all the time you get a small amount of money to put into upgrading your cars at the garage, and there are lots of cars. This game is super cute, and would easily appeal to people of a younger age or casual gamers and people who are not into racing. And if pricepoint matters to you five dollards and with a sale...

Most of my play time was spent racing with a friend in 1v1 races which were generally decided by how the physics treated the player.  In some occasions a vehicle could get flipped on its side seemingly randomly and on a lot  of occasions an agressive side-swipe at my opponent would leave me in a worse off situation than him!  There seemed to be no realism or accuracy in the physics therefore removing any type of skill factor in the driving and racing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PBu8tufUp4\n\nNow the game looks really nice and fun.  It almost seems criminal to me to make a top-down racing game appear so nice and colorful to look at but then get let down by such a major game-breaking factor!\n\nThere's a large array of cars to choose from and an even more impressive track selection with day and night variants.  I learned today that the game also has Steam Workshop for creating and sharing your own track designs!!\n\nYou have an option of two different systems to control your vehicle.  The first type is the more conventional method of rotate/steer the car clockwise/anti-clockwise and the second type is to push in the direction you want to travel.  Now the second method of pusing in the desired direction of travel sounds awful to me but I actually found it a more efficient way to play this game.  You still have to accelerate and brake the same with both methods.  It's worth testing them both out with an open mind and seeing which works best for you.\n\nThere is no local co-op feature but the online multiplayer works fine.  I'm not sure about the playerbase but I managed to find my steam friend to play with without any problems and our games ran smoothly.\n\nSo many positive points about this game let down by a lack of fine-tuning in the physics.  The game boasts "cross-platform multiplayer" so possibly the physics were acceptable on a mobile platform.  I think on the PC platform we expect a bit more from our game.\n\nIf you can put up with the clunky physics and have a friend or three to play with then you could have some fun for sure.  For me though, it removed almost all competiveness and thus removed the fun and motivation to race further.","March 26","false","3.7"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","22","30","3","0"

The two major frustrating elements are the collisions that almost always favour the AI racers, and also the lack of progress syncing in between races.  You'd better quit and restart on your own every few races to save your races and your money, because a game or a system crash will obliterate any progress from that session.\n\nAs for the game itself, it is a satisfying combination of good driving, tactics, and upgrades that will see you to the finish line.

This game makes pretty much every mistake an arcade racer can make. The first couple of races are just fine, but later on the issues this game has start ruining it to such an extend it is no longer fun to play.\n\nThe AI: Probably the biggest issue. They are not on the track to win. They are there to make sure you don't win. Without hesitation they will boost into you from every possible angle in order to slow you down or flip you over. When the best strategy in a racing game involves restarting the race so many times until you manage to make a clean getaway instead of actually racing your opponents, you know things are not as they should be.\n\nWonky car handling: It's an arcade racer, so realistic car handling is not to be expected. But the cars in this game behave very vague and inconsistent, making for a very frustrating experience. Good examples of the weird car physics are slopes or ramps. You can drive onto them in the exact same spot for 5 laps and everything's just fine and on lap 6 it suddenly spins your car around on the spot and brings you to a dead stop (after which 9 times out of 10 an AI boosts into you to finish the job). And don't even think about driving off or onto a slope while steering as it will make you spin out of control instantly.\n\nInvisible objects: A lot of the tracks are plagued with invisible objects and walls on the corners. In some corners the cars can pretty much clip through objects without issue, and on other corners you find yourself smashing into an invisible wall that is sticking out into the track.\n\nPrize money too low: With the very low amounts of prize money you get, it becomes a real grind in order to fully upgrade a 2nd, let alone a 3rd car. And you absolutely want multiple cars in the later cups in order to use their individual strengths and weaknesses for different tracks.\n\nIt's a shame really, as the general design of this game is very good. Graphics, track design, music and car design are all very nicely done, but it's the actual gameplay that ruins it. If you're looking for a good micro machines-style racer, then look at Bang Bang Racing instead. While that game also has it's issues it is much more enjoyable then this one.","June 23, 2014","false","21.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

The AI isn't as bad as everyone seems to be saying it is.  Playing on anything higher than easy greatly improves the AI experience, and makes the game a real challenge.  The bumper car-style gameplay goes away once you ramp up the difficulty.\n\nThe graphics are that of a very high end mobile game, and it shows that it is actually a mobile game.  The controls are actually a very good port of touch based controls, from the mobile game.  It includes all the DLC mobile maps that you originally had to shell out money for, and does so in style.  It's a true proper mobile to PC port, removing all the bad bits of mobile ports and keeping the good.  The good being very fun 15 minutes at a time game sessions.\n\nRacing wise, the handling can get a little sloppy on a few maps.  There are some bumps that just shouldn't exist, and can cause you to fly off the map.  However some might say those are simply skill challenges and you need to slow down.  Outside of getting air handling is very tight and well done.  You don't drive on ice like in GTA, instead you drive tight turns when you mean to, and wide turns when you mean to.  It's very easy to control, probably due to it's extremely sloppy control background on mobile games.  Seriously, touch racing is impossible.\n\nThere is a variety of maps, and quite a lot of cars.  A truly endless amount if you include the workshop.  There is also a map editor for you to make maps for your friends, or to upload to the workshop.\n\nWhich leads to the next thing...  Multiplayer.  It's very well implemented and not at all laggy.  It's very fun to race and bash you're buddies, just like in any other game.\n\n\nI picked the game up on a whim of liking cute RC racers, and I don't regret it one bit.  If you're the same, go ahead and grab it.  If you're looking for a captivating, serious racer, look elsewhere.","February 2, 2014","true","1.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

The difficulty is insane. This certainly ain't a game for the kiddies, I'll tell ya' that now. There are two problems that factor in together for this.\n\nThe first is that the physics are very aggravating at times. It is borderline inconceivable to maintain any sort of speed when attempting to corner. You will either end up having to slow down to a crawl or letting off the acceleration for a brief second and doing subtle taps in order to turn but that still annihiliates your speed. It may be easier with an analog control such as a joystick, wheel or a game pad but I haven't tried this.\n\nThe second is that the AI opponents are EXTREMELY brutal and relentless. They WILL shunt you at any opportunity they get and you WILL eventually get spun out and there is nothing you can do. Simple as that. If you do get spun out, you lose, good luck catching up afterwards. Get used to it.

AI is awful. Want to know how to get 1st place every time? Restart until you get lucky enough for those idiots to crash into each other instead of you. That works well until you start to lap them and they all try to sabotage you. Feels more like a 1v5 race instead of a 6 person race.\n\n2. Repetitive maps. They re-use the same maps over and over, putting different spins on them (race backwards! now race at night!) and some of the camera angles cause you to completely not be able to see your car. Here's the #1 thing I want from a racing game: TO BE ABLE TO SEE MY CAR\n\n3. A bunch of cars with little difference between them. Just take the starting car and use it until you unlock the car you get for finishing the beginner cup and then upgrade that and you win the game.\n\nOn the bright side, it has some cool TF2 and Portal 2 levels and it has Workshop support. I can't help but to think the Workshop support is just there because the developers didn't feel like making many tracks of their own.","December 24, 2013","false","2.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Cars, with seeming similar stats, can prove to handle quite differently from track to track. Some cars are better at tight corners, some better off-road. This type of gameplay definitely encourages upgrading multiple cars rather than sticking to just one. Sometimes the AI can be super frustrating and uneven surfaces can make your car handle unpredictably, but overall this is a game worth checking out.

I have no idea why I played all the way through the expert championship.\n\nThe AI sucks and pretty much just plows through whatever's in its way, which is frequently you. The physics suck, so when the AI plows through you there's no telling which way you'll be facing or how long it will take until your car is upright again.\n\nWhen I say "the physics suck," I mean your car handles like a balloon. Except when it handles like a plastic bag. It's the floatiest racer I've ever played.\n\nAbout half of the tracks suck, and the ones that don't will feel like they suck because your field of view is limited and the angle at which the track is presented is arbitrary. (I really do mean "arbitrary." Sometimes the same track will be presented from a different direction for no good reason. Often the chosen direction maximizes the extent to which you can't actually see your car or the track on some turns.)\n\nBy the time you've upgraded your car, you can lap more than half the other racers by the end of the second lap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skeletorssack/recommended/209520/","skeletorssack","Skeletors Sack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skeletorssack/","200 products in account","Pros: The game handles great with a Xbox 360 controller joystick once you understand how it works. The colors are vibrant and the tracks vary in environment. It's a top down racer and brings back nostalgic feelings of arcade games of old. It's fun overall most of the time. The game is not too easy in that you will not blow through this with ease. Some tracks you will be racing as aggressive as possible just to come in the top 3 to get some decent money. There is a Multiplayer option.\n\nCons: It's fun MOST of the time. The other time that it's not fun is due to the punishing AI and questionable framerate issues. I was running this with an overclocked HD4650 and had framerate issues even when the settings were set to Low or Off on everything. ***(Upgrading to a HD7850 corrected these issues)***\n\nThere are times that you will race right through the map and respawn as other cars race ahead of you. At times you will end up upside down and as long as you are moving, you won't respawn right side up to continue the race. In other words, prepare to yell at the screen as you are sliding on your side at 5mph as everyone races past you or hits you and continues the slide to your defeat.\n\nBinary Mill states that my settings were enough to run the game, but not enough for it to run decently to actually play apparently. Developer needs to give better System Requirements for this game. The AI are downright brutal and will often try to wreck you right into a wall or sandwich you into other people like an adult flick. There is a Multiplayer option (see above). Only thing is that Binary Mill's servers are down and according to the forums (and how far this issue goes back), that will not change anytime soon or possibly ever.\n\nIf you buy this game, don't expect multiplayer.","January 13, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have no idea why I played all the way through the expert championship.\n\nThe AI sucks and pretty much just plows through whatever's in its way, which is frequently you. The physics suck, so when the AI plows through you there's no telling which way you'll be facing or how long it will take until your car is upright again.\n\nWhen I say "the physics suck," I mean your car handles like a balloon. Except when it handles like a plastic bag. It's the floatiest racer I've ever played.\n\nAbout half of the tracks suck, and the ones that don't will feel like they suck because your field of view is limited and the angle at which the track is presented is arbitrary. (I really do mean "arbitrary." Sometimes the same track will be presented from a different direction for no good reason. Often the chosen direction maximizes the extent to which you can't actually see your car or the track on some turns.)\n\nBy the time you've upgraded your car, you can lap more than half the other racers by the end of the second lap. Except the guy in second will pass you once you're forced to pass the clowns in the bottom slots again, because it's very difficult to pass an AI that pretends you're not there unless you're also an AI, which the guy in second is.\n\nOh, right, and all the music is at best boring.

There is a map builder option which is very fun and the mobile version lacks. The maps can be shared via the Steam workshop and you can download and play maps that the community have created for free.

Have tried with different controllers and all of them feels different, work or don't and have to configure them every time. Even when controls are mapped, the game plays awful. Physics will make sure you get in the last place. Forget about using turbo, you'll ruin your hard earned place. If you manage to be in 1st place for the first 15 seconds then you have a chance of winning the race but if your opponent is 10 seconds away from you in a better place then just restart the race, it is impossible to catch up.\n\nI did however managed to run the game when I recently purchased it with one controller (it worked and felt really well) and this is when I could play the game (and used to recommend it as a casual racer) but very little time then the controller died on me and had to rely on mouse or keyboard (mouse is the best alternative so far but keyboard is too laggy). I've been struggling with the game ever since, trying different controllers every now and then but none of them seem to work like the first one, maybe it is the latest patch that brought like a new controller backend but instead it messed it up.\n\nThe level editor is really good though, have spent many hours building custom tracks.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a good casual racing game if you are tolerant to frustration but it is not a game for you if you do not like to lose.","December 5, 2015","false","13.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In this game you drive smaller versions of bigger cars on small tracks, kind of like child sized. There are quite a variety of cars to choose from, each somewhat different than the other.  The game has 40 tracks as it says on the store page, and there are night and day versions of each.  Each version also has their own song.\n\nThe point of the game is to go through championships, and gain money to upgrade your car.  Now each car can be upgraded, but be careful where you spend your money as early on it is hard to make money.  Swapping from car to car giving each of them upgrades would cause you to have no money and bad cars.  The unlockable cars are pretty nice, you get one for completing a championship and completing certain races for the portal team fortress and fruit ninja cars.  Though I never used them because I wouldn't be able to afford to upgrade them.\n\nThe Achievements in this game are rather easy to get except the last achievement which is the money bags one.  It requires you to have 100,000$ cash on hand at once, which is impossible because you upgrade your cars, and that costs a lot of money.\n\nOne downfall of the game is the repetitiveness.  Each track is recycled over and over again, so by the time you finish the game you've played each track 20 times both day and night, so it does get boring after a while.  The AI is absolutely idiotic and does not improve over time, all that makes the game harder later on is that all the AI's cars are upgraded, and the races are more laps.  Near the end the races are so long and take nearly 2 minutes each, and since there is a 100 races in the master cup it's insanely time consuming, and unfortunately it becomes boring.  The controls for me were quite easy to figure out but they might cause a problem for some people.\n\nOverall I did enjoy the game because of the music mostly, the tracks were ok, and AI annoyed me at times.

In this game you drive smaller versions of bigger cars on small tracks, kind of like child sized. There are quite a variety of cars to choose from, each somewhat different than the other.  The game has 40 tracks as it says on the store page, and there are night and day versions of each.  Each version also has their own song.\n\nThe point of the game is to go through championships, and gain money to upgrade your car.  Now each car can be upgraded, but be careful where you spend your money as early on it is hard to make money.  Swapping from car to car giving each of them upgrades would cause you to have no money and bad cars.  The unlockable cars are pretty nice, you get one for completing a championship and completing certain races for the portal team fortress and fruit ninja cars.  Though I never used them because I wouldn't be able to afford to upgrade them.\n\nThe Achievements in this game are rather easy to get except the last achievement which is the money bags one.  It requires you to have 100,000$ cash on hand at once, which is impossible because you upgrade your cars, and that costs a lot of money.\n\nOne downfall of the game is the repetitiveness.  Each track is recycled over and over again, so by the time you finish the game you've played each track 20 times both day and night, so it does get boring after a while.

Unfortunately, it is held back by grindy type progression, pure repitition in the races, and the fact that it takes an absurd amount of luck to win.\n\nBasically, the whole game revolves around escaping the pack. If a computer controlled car crashes into you, you will always lose regardless of the positions. If you get stuck in the pack it is almost impossible to escape. The best strategy is to simply restart the races until you're able to start off with a large enough lead to succeed.","November 6, 2014","false","2.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I dont know if am a bad at this game, or the AI was programed to make you life really bad. Its like : "Ow, you want the first place? You REALLY want it? SCREW YOU!!! You can't have it!"\nThe 3 race tracks i hate the most is Ghost Town, Ruins and other track that reminds me a italian place.

The road surface affects grip and some adaptation of driving style is required to succeed.\n\nThere is a decent roster of cars to choose from and unlock - and they can be upgraded as you proceed through career mode. I've only really used one, though (Gulf liveried sports racer), and I suspect that using one of the others now (in career mode) would mean starting from base-specs and having to grind my way through leveling up again - a shame you can't port your progress over to a different vehicle.\n\nAs with the three games I referenced, the AI is pretty wild. They basically do their own thing, and if you are in their way they try to drive through you. I've seen a number of reviewers suggest that the AI tries to "take out" the player, but I've seen no evidence of this.\n\nOverall, a fun game - though no classic.","January 14, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dont know if am a bad at this game, or the AI was programed to make you life really bad. Its like : "Ow, you want the first place? You REALLY want it? SCREW YOU!!!

The cars themselves are cute and some of the paint schemes and models are references to pop culture (like the Scooby van and DeLorean look-alikes).\n\nThe level editor is ultimately disappointing, because you can only buld flat tracks. So while the pre-built levels wow you with verticality and variety, you're stuck with novice-level custom options.  Since this game hasn't been updated since 2013, I'm guessing this won't be changing anytime soon.\n\nOverall, I'd say pick it up when it's on sale.

Once you've got the controls figured out, it feels very natural and satisfying, and powerslides come easily.\n\nOverall, the game is very good-looking and polished. There are a couple of cars and tracks based on TF2 and Portal 2. Not surprisingly for a mobile port, the variety is lacking and the game quickly wears out its welcome. The various cups just consist of the same tracks used over and over again, sometimes run in reverse or at nighttime or with varying numbers of laps.

Taking a top-down camera angle, it evokes an arcade-like feel which adds to the game's charm.  There is a good variety of tracks, which include typical racing circuits, downtown cities, deserts, and even three tracks inspired by the Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, and Fruit Ninja universes, and there are even unlockable vehicles to match those franchises.  Speaking of vehicles, there are plenty to choose from, with many others waiting to be unlocked.  The actual racing is fun and even addicting at first; the controls are responsive for the most part, the pace is quick, and the races are short enough to be fun and competitive but not so short as to finish literally seconds after the green light.\n\nIssues with the game include some occasional overly-aggressive AI that seems more focused on taking you out than on actually racing, colliding with computer-controlled vehicles 9 times out of 10 ends up with you spinning out instead of them, and that most vehicles take a lot of time and money to upgrade them to match the mobility of the AI in later races, but none of these problems are not and should not be considered deal-breakers.

Basically your car moves in the direction of the stick; left and right are not relative to how your car is pointing.  Thankfully the digital pad works in a more traditional manner and once I realized this it was a total joy to play.\n\n2) Physics: You have to play the tracks a bit to get the hang of where the walls are and where you can shortcut.  Your car rotates on it's center (not the front) meaning you can turn on a dime and spin out if you aren't a bit gentle with the controls during turns.  The physics are also wonky when your in midair and turn your tires prematurely before you land; instant wipeout.\n\n3) Tracks: So EVERY racing game reuses tracks, makes it a differnt type of day, reverses the driving direction; no big deal.  However, this game added the challenge of also changing the orientation of the camera on repeat use of a track.  This actually makes it super challenging to revisit a track as your brain says "this turn is here" but on screen the turn is actually THIS OTHER WAY since the camera is now in a different position.\n\nOther things of note:\n\n1) Graphics: Very pretty.  I love the feel of the game and how smooth it flows on the screen.\n\n2) Sound/Music: Very enjoyable.\n\n3) Difficulty: Starts off easy enough; you learn when to use your 'nitro' to boost away from the pack of crazy cars and they become a non-issue.  By the 20th or so track however, the AI is competant and WILL whoop your butt.  Car upgrades are a must!\n\nOverall I've enjoyed it quite a bit and plan on treking to the end of the game.","September 7, 2015","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a game which I found a lot of fun to play and quite addictive!! If you're looking for a racing game which doesn't take itself too seriously, then give this one some consideration. If you're a big kid like me, then you'll probably love this. Definitely one which both younger and more mature players can enjoy IMHO! Plus, I haven't noticed any major bugs/glitches (yet!!).\n\nControls were a tad light/floaty for my liking, but like I said just now, it's a great game for what it is.

If complaints continue, perhaps this isn't the kind of game for you; everything from the physics down to the aesthetic makes this a heavily arcade-style racing game, and the handling of vehicles is therefore going to be suitably wacky.\n\nAreas of improvement such as your car's reaction when bumped into another car or even just clipping a wall need to be addressed.\n\nI got this for 79p in a bundle, but I could see this being worth £4.

Each track, even with 5 laps on, is only about a minute and a half or so. I played the game with my friends and we could barely have fun, as inning only relied on who was the last to crash into a wall. We were able to play EVERY TRACK in under 20 minutes, as all the rest of the maps are just a different time of day version of the original. The track editor was also bland as you can't make jumps or bridges, making every track completely flat.

I wish the new cars you unlock had more distinction in terms of performance. The music gets old, so I disabled it and that's when I noticed an audio glitch whenever a car respawns near you. There's a clear difference in the level of difficulty from some tracks vs others which can sometimes be very frustrating, but i think it evens itself out. The game could definitely be expanded to include selectable driver perspective, or vehicle damage, or demolition derby mode for instance. The multiplayer aspect seems to be nonfunctional due to some kind of server communication problem. Overall though I think this game is a great value for the price and I would recommend it for some quick entertainment.","May 24, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
