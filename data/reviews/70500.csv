"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/recommended/70500/","taylort210","Wagglesworth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taylort210/","3057 products in account","I didn’t really know what to expect with Diamond Dan. For whatever reason, this game always caught my eye whenever it became discounted during the big steam sales. So I finally picked it up. Lo and behold, the game isn’t terrible. It’s not even half bad. It may be one of the uglier ducklings of the bunch, but underneath a lacking appearance is a surprisingly entertaining puzzle-lite platformer.\n\nEach level is comprised of a cubic tower, itself filled with constantly shifting cubes that you must traverse to reach the bottom. You have the option of two playable characters, the first being able to move nearby blocks, whilst the other can outright destroy them at the expense of losing the ability to double-jump. While the beginning levels contain little challenge, further levels become longer, and introduce new types of traps that become increasingly difficult to avoid, both due to your own incompetence and slow transitioning speed of the screen while you transfer between the different sides of each tower.\n\nThe platforming itself is tight, and it’s satisfying leaping between booby trapped walls and floors. There is no time limit to each level, and your performance in each is based on how many jewels and coins you can collect, all of which add to your end score. Activating and narrowly escaping traps goes towards earning a score multiplier, though aside from leaderboard and achievement junkies, there’s no real incentive to pursue higher scores beyond personal gratification. However, there are higher difficulties, and beating each earns you a shinier medal, so that provides some longevity for those who enjoy a challenge.\n\nI’ve actually enjoyed what I’ve played of DD. Visually, it can be pretty unappealing, especially the character models, though the in-game aesthetic looks alright, if a bit dated. One thing I am fond of is the menu; it’s all set up at a desk, with each option being one of a series of items lying on it. Your view follows your cursor, so it’s almost like you’re actually sitting at the desk, and it’s neat to see things added to it after you complete each level. It’s a nice touch, and it adds a bit of charm to the experience.\n\nDiamond Dan is surprisingly alright, given its budget price and lack of fanfare. It may be lacking visually, but the gameplay is tight and even challenging in later levels and on higher difficulties. It’s not terribly long, and can likely be beaten in several short hours, either on a lazy afternoon, or as a break between larger adventures. I wouldn’t call it a diamond in the rough, but after a few strokes from a shirt sleeve, even this jewel shows off a modest gleam.","June 30, 2014","true","1.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/recommended/70500/","xelios","Xelios","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xelios/","4978 products in account","Diamond Dan is a puzzle platformer based more on quick reflexes than logic.  You must descend towers of ever-shifting blocks to find a map at the bottom and escape.  Sounds simple, but you can be crushed or thrown from the tower, and many of the blocks contain traps such as water or spike pits, projectiles, or enemies living inside the walls who will pull you to your death. Checkpoints are created by opening shortcuts with keys.\n\nTraps can be triggered without harming yourself, if you do it quickly, and doing so rewards you by increasing your multiplier, which adds to the value of any treasure you pick up. Your score at the end of the level is then multiplied based on the difficulty you're playing on.  Difficulty affects density of traps and how quickly the blocks shift (it can get insane) and can be changed at will for any level.\n\nYou can play as Dan (pushes blocks) or Ann (shatters blocks) on any level and there are separate leaderboards for each.  Friend and global leaderboards and tons of achievements.","January 8, 2012","true","25.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

That was quite a time ago when I've completed this game. It was fun. And you know what makes it fun? Achievements! Yeah, I stress it. Achievements make this game. No, for sure it is as fun as it seems - you dig down through the temples, you loot treasures and try not to be killed. Fast action (on later levels), good graphics (IMHO) and music. But the raisin in a pie is Achievement section. How many times should I write "achievements" word? :D You hunt for multipliers, you climb down without getting any block destroyed. It doesn't make sense writing all this stuff. Just try it yourself.","June 22, 2014","true","12.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Got it during a huge Steam sale, but there's a lot of content for $10. It took me about 4-5 hours to beat on medium difficulty. The game involves reaching the bottom of the cave or whatever it is while collecting treasure and avoiding different traps. You traverse square blocks that move around. Basically, it was fun to play while I had no internet. Not a great game, but if you want something different than shooting everything that moves, I recommend it.","April 8, 2011","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
