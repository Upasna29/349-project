So I don't know how this one holds up to GalCiv II. But on its own merits, it's a good game.\n\nIn Galactic Civilizations, you start out as ruler of united Earth. The various alien races, having gotten the secret of hyperdrive from the humans, have turned off their massive wormhole portals and scrapped them for hyper-capable colony ships. The real space race has begun, and it's up to you to determine the path you want humanity to take.\n\nMadcap conquest is definitely an option, but if that either doesn't sound appealing or isn't practical, you can turn to other means - being a technocrat and staying ahead by selling and leaking techs; buddying up to the top dog; making everyone's economies dependant on your trade; or amass cultural influence by convincing the aliens how awesome Hollywood, Nike and Coca-Cola are. In practice, most games tend to involve a combination of all the above - the alien races tend to be more receptive to your diplomacy if you have a lot of ships with big guns, or if a significant chunk of their economy is powered by trade with you. And being ahead in tech is useful for keeping a welfare economy afloat by selling techs to other empires, or to prop up an enemy of an enemy without going to war directly. Conversely, rolling in dough means being able to bribe your rivals, buy state-of-the-art warships from a militarist friend, and ramp up domestic spending (including research and social projects).\n\nAlong the way, you get to decide whether to be an evil empire, a benevolent federation or any combination and variation of them. A sprawling but sparsely populated expansionist nation, or a handful of highly-developed star systems? Military juggernaut or trade linchpin of the galaxy? Underhand arms dealer or open warmonger? Your answer to these questions is often simply "yes". It's telling that a game that allows you to build aphrodisiacs and massive theme parks also give you the option of building propaganda machines and pseudo-Death Stars - often at the same time (who says star-killing not-moons can't have fun water slides?).\n\nThe alien civilizations all have distinct personalities - by default some are good, some are neutral, some are evil, but fiddle with their alignment setting at the start of the game and they change accordingly - a civilization that originally extended a friendly hand will now threaten to exterminate you at the slightest excuse, and vice versa. They will gloat when they're winning a war, grovel when they're beaten; extort you when they're much more powerful and don't like you, give you periodic gifts with mincing courtesy when you're the powerhouse.\n\nThough a thoroughly old game by now, this game has plenty of charm and solid mechanics underpinning them. I'm sure nostalgia only affects my verdict -that is still amazingly fun- only a little.","July 16, 2014","true","142.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

The game was developed in the year 1994, and it can't directly evaluated against MOO1 that apeared one year earlier.\n\nFor that age the game still feels quite crisp with the options regarding this game, I still have my old boxed set in my archive and I was quite happy to see the game apear on Steam.\n\nAnd had to take note, that the Hype that the game caused some time, was really a blown bubble. I was reminded why the game was a weak contemporary of MOO, MOM, CIV and other Games that were the rage at that time.\n\nFurthermore you will have a lot of trouble getting this game started at all! Especially on modern machines, it will run only on my older Notebook with an Windows XP Op, and only with a lot of tweaking to do. Still it does crash regulary and at most unopportune times.\n\nYou might of course give it a try, but only when you are experienced in getting games tweaked for running, and you have a rather high frustration threshold.\n\nThis said, I really can't recomend the game. Sadly as it is, some games better remain in the past, even though they might still feel fresh and crisp - all this "retro" also digs up some of the real underdogs and rotten tomatoes of that time, because I still do remember the issues we had with the first appearance of the game and the trouble that ships couldn't be customized. You had to buy an add on to do that - later in a more viable option the game had some more stuff added as standard contents.\n\nAddendum: The game will actually run on higher end machines, but not with the Steam overlay active... So it still can be used...","April 10, 2015","false","2.4"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

It freezes in the worst was so you can't even make Alt-Tab or invoke Task Manager, and only way to unfreeze it is hard reset. And it'll mess with your display settings - after running it I had my working display resolution 1280x960 to disappear from the list suggested by video card and still can't make it back!","January 22, 2014","false","0.6"," 9 of 30 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","9","30","0","0"

Very dated, low-brow graphics, and no tutorial rounds to get you involved with the gameplay in an intuitive way.  Possibly only of interest to anyone who played it originally, many years ago, and are stuck in nostalgia mode.","May 20","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
