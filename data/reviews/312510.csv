The game boasts 5 characters, with unique stats, and 4 distinct worlds each containing 4 levels.\n\nMultiplayer is local only.\n\nControls are tight, working with an XBox 360 pad right out of the box without issue. Movement feels good, just slightly floaty in a way that I personally enjoy and the jump is spot on with just enough Mario in it to seem familiar right out of the gate.\n\nEach level asks the player to collect an ever increasing amount of coins and deliver them safely to the piggy bank. To aid in accomplishing this the player is given an arsenal of moves and weapons to over come obstacles and enemies including a multi-direction charge ability that clears enemies and blocks, assault rifles and rocket launchers to dispatch baddies and coin magnets and spawners to help you hit your goal and fill your bank.\n\nI enjoyed this game immensely and recommend it on the strength of the graphics, music and single player experience alone.\n\nCheck out my first impression video below for more thoughts on Mega Coin Squad:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkNlHthn6yk","August 12, 2014","true","5.0"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","31","42","0","0"

Quite a challenging game, with a retro arcade style feel, and an awesome sound track.\n\nThere are 5 characters to choose from, each having their own strengths and weaknesses. You  get rewarded with diamonds each level in three ways:\n\n(1) If you bank all your coins in one bankingi\n\n(2) If you lose no lives(you get 3 each round)\n\n(3) If you beat the clock.\n\nI LPd this game live at www.twitch.tv/zombspawn, and the people in chat were really liking what they saw. Those people now want this game.\n\nOf course, I am a noob, but I accept this challenging game, and will beat it. I plan on playing it through it's entirety in a future LP. My hand and eye coordination is not like it used to be, but having grown up on platformers, this is really an awesome one.\n\nThe intuitive controls are easy to master, and are best played with an Xbox 360 controller. I am not sure if other controller brands world, but I am guessing they will.\n\nThe overworld is similar to Mario games, where you travel from stage to stage.\n\nMy only wish is that there was an option for a certain ammount of continues. Losing in one round, can set you back to the begining round of that stage.\n\nNonetheless, I give this game a Mega Recommendtion, and encourage everyone to buy this game when it is released on August 15, 2014. :-)\n\nI rate this game at a 4/5","August 11, 2014","true","1.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

My wife has always been funny about collecting all of the coins if we play a Mario game so I thought the way this game goes over the top with it would be enjoyable. The first world is pretty simple to do but the next ones are significantly more challenging. The game is definetely simple but I wouldn't call it easy!\n\nWe tried out the 4 player multiplayer last night and it worked really well, I don't see anything balance wise that needs to change. No problems with controller support, you can do everything in the game from a controller. The only thing you can't do with a controller is exit the game - you have to push the escape key on the PC, but that's not really a big deal.\n\nThe power-ups are of varying usefulness from what I can tell at this time. Invincibility is the only one that I think could use some work- it is not terribly obvious that you are invincible and I found it hard to tell when it was going to run out. The grenade launcher and 'drill cannon' shoot in an arc which can be annoying if you want to hit something directly in front of you - I have found myself avoiding using them. The machine gun, when upgraded, is the best power up in my opinion.\n\nAlso regarding upgrades, I have found that an upgraded fireball will go through solid walls which can be helpful when trying to kill enemies in the later stages.\n\nIn the end, I think this is a great game well worth the money. I know it is selling for $15 now, I think I bought it on the initial sale for $12 or something like that. The single player is enjoyable and is definetely challenging and the multiplayer works great. As I continue to play with friends I will update if I notice anything I think needs to change.","August 25, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main purpose of the single player campaign is to try and get through the 4 worlds in as fast a time as possible. You can pick one of five characters to play through the game with, all of which have different stats, and track their game progress and game completion time separately.\n\nEach world consists of 3 normal stages and 1 boss stage. In the normal stages you are given a coin quota to meet and will have to meet it without getting hit 3 times, lest you be sent back to the beginning of the world. Getting hit will cause you to drop all of your coins as well, but you can turn in the coins early to make sure you don't lose them. Each stage has it's own basic features and traps, but the main part of each stage is the constant generation of randomly selected, premade segments that contain coins, items, enemies and blocks. The game also encourages excelling at these stages, providing you with diamonds to spend on leveling up/unlocking abilities and items for beating it within a certain time, turning in all of your quota in one fell swoop, and never getting hit. The boss stages, however, are far less interesting. There are no diamonds to reward excellence or speed, don't get remotely difficult until world 4, and the fast and frantic search for coins is replaced with having to defeat a few waves of enemies. They almost feel out of place/tacked on.\n\nOverall though, I can easily recommend this game to anybody who likes optimizing and improving times, completionists, or people who enjoy setting challenges for themselves (like no continues, or all diamonds). However, if you're the kind of guy who plays games solely to play it once and not touch it again, you might want to pass up on this game/wait for a sale, as you'll likely only get about 2-3 hours out of it.","August 19, 2014","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
