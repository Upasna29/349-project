"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascilon/recommended/38170/","rascilon","Rascilon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rascilon/","2159 products in account","Cradle of Rome is a challenging puzzle game with a simple premise, match three objects in a row to destroy the blocks. Where it becomes complicated however, is that each of these matches contributes to a pool of resources that you use as currency to buy more buildings between stages. Each purchased building adds an object that can be matched, often with a powerful power-up that can be unleashed to help the player defeat the puzzle. Taken together, Cradle of Rome is both unique and refreshing and offers hours of puzzle fun for any casual gamer. I highly recommend this game.","August 27, 2012","true","20.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Fun while you build out your Rome, but the later levels are uber monotonous.  Great if you can get the entire Cradle series on sale.  Forgettable though in the long run.","October 13, 2012","true","3.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
