Although I'll end up with a negative review I think this is a more justified review. The final decision to not recommended Eternity reflects my personal experience about the original Dungeon Defenders.\n\nLet's talk about the most false and improper negative reviews I've read. They include one or more of following statements:\nThis game is advertised as 'definitive' but it is an 'Early Access'\nA lot of people use the word 'definitive' in a wrong context. Eternity is just the definitive version of Dungeon Defenders 1. It is the final product they made based on DD1 and there will be no other version anymore which is based on DD1 (so close). Nor it implies that all content known from DD1 is included in Eternity neither everything is accessible right now.\n\nThe store page of Eternity is incorrect\nThat's simply wrong. Anyone who has read the store page carefully will agree here. Every single statement came true. Trendy has even tweaked the store page to describe things in-depth for whose who were confused for any particular reason. We could only debate if they did their job well.\n\nThis game is 'Pay2Win' since micro-transactions are implemented\nMeanwhile micro-transactions are implemented the shop only provides cosmetic items. Cosmetic items doesn't affect the gameplay in any way.\n\nThis game is a mobile port\nNo, it isn't. They designed the game for multiple platforms (mainly PC) with the focus to keep the GUI (Graphical User Interface) for all platforms equally. Not a bad move at all. Though there is a lot room for improvements.\nNow, let's talk about my reason.\nIt was clear to me that Eternity will have bugs, glitches and exploits like every other PC game but I never mocked about it like others because it was obvious that Trendy will work on fixes. A lot of users were complaining about the broken stat progression after Trendy has fixed an exploit which has given way overpowered gear. I appreciated the fix since I was still able to reach 2k and higher stats in order to beat the game easily. People were just too lazy to invest time to build a set and to upgrade their stuff. The game was still fine and I liked it a lot.\n\nThen they released Content Update #1 and 'Nightmare' difficulty. I still was able to beat most content with gear which I've collected during the 'broken stat progression' but even on Deepers Well on Nightmare difficulty (the easiest - first map) were dropping stuff with stats way better than mine.\n\nThe hardest part of the game now is to reach the required Hero Level to be able to equip this stuff in order to get 4k+ points in multiple stats. Makes the whole game pointless - DD was about grinding - take it away and there are no goals anymore. You are able to reach up to 10k points in a very short time to cover huge maps with a single aura stack and a Buff Beam and you still beat the map without any further defenses. (In the meanwhile they have added enemies which are immune to elemental damage regardless of using a Strength Drain Aura, so you have to put up some more defenses now.) 'Nightmare' turns into 'Laughable easy'.\n\nScreenshots of fresh farmed armor sets: #1, #2, #3, #4\n\nScreenshots of broken gear of the second exploit: #1[i.imgur.com], #2[i.imgur.com], #3[i.imgur.com] (in the meanwhile this exploit got fixed, so instead of 50k points we are back at 10k points)\n\nSad, that Trendy had to nerf stats on a previous update to (quoting) 'not letting stats out-of-control'. Even more sad they haven't fixed this ridiculous inflation with Content Update #2. [sarcasm]At least they made the new Hardcore mode easier with CU#2.[/sarcasm]\n\nSo the question is; Are you a casual player? If so then Eternity is definitely entertaining you. For all other players, who are not scared to invest a bit more time (not like me several thousand hours but still an enjoyable amount ^^) , I strongly advise to play the original Dungeon Defenders (preferably on a windows machine). It's also frequently on sale.\n\nI hope this review was more helpful and informative than others.\n\nTL;DR:\nDDE is made for casual players.\nDD1 is made for players who like this genre.\n\nEdits:\nOctober 6th - typos\nOctober 14th - added screenshots of broken gear\nOctober 26th - the exploit which caused up to 50k points got fixed\nDecember 9th - added screenshots of fresh farmed NM gear","October 6, 2014","false","228.2"," 455 of 512 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","455","512","6","13"

Seems the community moved back to the original anyway for the most part, as Eternity was just a pointless rebuild of a game that was fine to begin with. If you're going to play, I'd bet on the original game being the one with staying power. Don't invest in this one.\n\nYou can read this to understand the difference between the games, besides just the UI:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=290092757\n\nYes, it does seem like Eternity has more content overall. Maybe someday someone can port some of it down to the original. Until then, it seems like people are willing to live without it. I just checked the player counts right now. The original has 825 and Eternity has 53. It will only become more lopsided in the future.","May 9, 2015","false","6.3"," 94 of 106 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","94","106","3","0"

Public Tavern = People everywhere whining and asking things like, "How do you play?" and "Why does this game suck so much?" And there is always a hoard around the forge and tavern-keep that makes walking around hard.\n\n2. Requires constant internet connection = All file are on their servers, not your computer. This means if your internet goes out, you can't do a thing. And it means long wait screens while it downloads the map you just tried to enter. If you have slow internet or frequent outages, this game is not for you.\n\n3. Summoner = The Summoner no longer uses his own pool of Defense Unit points (Minion Units). Instead, he draws from the same DU as everyone else. This makes him a character that is now a builder like any other except that he can't attack. Two pets doesn't really make up for this and minions are not good at being the only thing on the field. He is most pointless now that he costs other builders their points.\n\n4. Costumes = Completely pointless. Armor is visible and that cannot be turned off. So what you look like under all the cool little helmets and masks and shields seems almost pointless by the end of even the first level.\n\n5. Eternia Crystals = The crystal is now no longer customizable. Only look it has is the default look. Sad. Really, really sad.\n\n6. In Game Store = Yes, there is a store in the game that costs real money. Yes, it is just for cosmetic items when you are playing on Steam. Yes, it still stinks. In-game stores that use real money on a game you already paid real money to buy is dumb. It's tied on annoying level with Release-Day DLCs for me. I already gave you money to buy the game and now it's "Oh, wait, you wanted the entire game? That'll be an extra $20."\n\n7. Perma-Death = Perma-Death in Hardcore??? Why? Just why? Never playing that mode.\n\n8. Two friend systems = o.O If you play on Steam, please note that there are two social systems in the game: Steam and Playverse. This gets confusing fast... "Wait, I just added that person, how do I have a friend request from them. Oh, this is Steam that is Playverse." "Why aren't they showing up in my friends or this group?..." Etc.\n\n9. Tooltips = There are none. Happy button-guessing folks!\n\n10. Tutorial = My sister had not a clue what to do as a first time player and I had to show her everything. A tutorial to do that would have been really nice...\n\n11. No Split-screen = I used this all the time on the old game and I have actually already missed it. Please patch it in.\n\n12. Box System = They made it worse. I didn't know that was even possible. It's like an apps touchsreen now with a bad PC overlay on it.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Single or Multiplayer Missions = I can play with random people or just my friends. A welcome early patch that was really, really needed. Works great now.\n\n2. Visible Armor = This is awesome. Sure, for most of the game you will look like you covered yourself in hotglue and rolled around in a junkyard... But once you hit max and get a real set of armor that all matches: You will look awesome.\n\n3. Dyes = They now sell dyes of different colors at the Tavern-keep's place. And most items have 5 to 6 dye slots for colors on it you can change. Yes, for people who like micromanaging every little detail of your character (aka: people like me), this is awesome. They are low in price so you can change colors a lot. :)\n\n4. Pet hatching = You get eggs and weight for them to hatch as you run around and do things. AKA: Pokemon eggs. It is actually quite fun to see what will pop out of each egg. Awesome system.\n\n5. Coins = MANA IS NO LONGER MONEY!!! You no longer have to try and use Mana for everything and worry about lost Mana all over the map. Gold coins enemies drop last longer than Mana and you don't have to feel bad burning through thousands of Mana a battle in the later stages with you skills.\n\n6. All DLCs built in = ...need I even say why this is nice and awesome?\n\n7.  Dashing = You can dash! ...four times... ...than your meter needs to recharge over-time...\n\n8. Two weapon slots = Switch out to a different weapon quickly when they are resistant to your main one. Very, very nice.\n\n9. Graphics = Slow to load, but once they do, they are awesome!\n\n10. Fun = The first Dungeon Defender was fun, this one is fun. They are the same game though.\n\n11. Co-Op Awesomeness = Grab a few friends and go to town. Just plain more fun with more friends.\n\n12. Loot system = Fewer drops of better quality? Individual loot? Both very nice.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThis really just seems to be you paying money to help them test PlayVerse...\n\nNot seeing enough new content here to warrant a re-release of the same game. I guess the balancing issues and hacking are reasons they are saying that this came out, but I see no real reason to buy this if you own the original with all DLCs. Dungeon Defenders (Original version) was and is a great game... Stick to it if you own it. Though if you don't own it, this might be a great one to pick up.\n\nOnly reason I like this game over the original? You can put shiny armor on and dye it a bunch of different ways.","July 25, 2014","false","13.6"," 679 of 989 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","679","989","0","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amoliski/recommended/302270/","amoliski","Amoliski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amoliski/","345 products in account","As someone who's put hundreds of hours into the base DD game, all of the negative reviews of this one were very concerning to me. I decided to go for it anyway, and I've been pleasantly surprised. I've put several more hours into the game since my first review, and I figured I'd update it a bit with what I've observed now that I've made it to 60 on a few characters. I've come across a few annoyances, and there's definitely a few more cons, however my final verdict is still a 'recommend.'\n\nAside from the general pros, this review assumes you're familiar with the first DD game. If not, watch a few let's plays on Youtube to get a feel for the gameplay; it's a combination of tower defense and action game, and it's hard to describe in words what is way easier to show on video.\n\nGeneral Pros:\n+ Very fun mix of strategic and action based gameplay.\n\n+ Good character/gameplay variety (8 classes, multiple character build options in each class)\n\n+ Great to play with friends\n\n+ Leveling up and finding new gear is very satisfying. Finally perfecting a map build is insanely satisfying.\n\nPros vs. the Original Dungeon Defenders game:\n+ The game is VERY MUCH Dungeon Defenders 1.9, lots of little things that make the game more enjoyable.\n\n+ Everyone gets their own drops. No more people running around stealing all of the drops while you keep the defenses running!\n\n+ The four slot amulet/consumable system where you can add four extra abilities to your character- instantly heal a tower, amplify elemental damage, heal other players, curse enemies, summon a giant storm, etc... It definitely makes you feel like you have more options and allows for some cool new character builds (like a 4 tower repair amulet + hero speed + hero health to quickly run around the map healing defenses).\n\n+Pets now have uniqe abilities and drop as eggs that you equip in your amulet slots to hatch over time. You can see the stats before you hatch them\n\n+There are consumable items that let you boost exp, loot quantity, loot quality, and loot rarity. Especially useful on survival runs to get some great gear\n\n+ Items, Maps, and Hero are balanced much better\n\n+ Item value is tied to the rarity, not the stats; crazy weapons don't sell for an insane amount any more\n\n+ Currency and Mana are separated. It's very satisfying to run around picking up huge amounts of gold.\n\n+ All of  the DLC Maps, Characters, and Costumes are unlocked for free. There's some new maps that aren't in the original game\n\n\n\n--\nCons:\n\n-Rollbacks. This is almost enough to not recommend the game. Three times now I've completed a survival game only to return to the tavern and find all of my items/exp/money reset. Extremely frustrating and totally unacceptable. It happend twice after Trendy claimed it was fixed, but it HASN'T happened since the latest patch. I'll take this one off the list if I go a few more days without another rollback.\n\n-Game UI: The UI is awful. When I say awful, I mean really, really, really bad. The item box is clunky and other than the ability to filter by rarity and item type, there's no sorting or ability to rearrange items at all. Folders are clunky. The only way to check an item's stats is to hover over it (why not a table view that shows each item on a row along with its stats?). There are random numbers and symbols everywhere with no explanation. Crafting is incomprehensible until you actually start finding blueprints and realize that it takes blueprints.\n\n- Playverse UI: Stupid Javascript/Twitter Bootstrap overlay that's used to make parties and... I guess stream to twitch? There's a buch of useless buttons on that thing, and it feels totally out of place. Definitely needs to be replaced with ingame menus that acutally fit with the rest of the game. Right now if feels like they just copy+pasted a web page as an overlay and called it a day.\n\n- Server Lag/Always Online: I understand why they went to server-side only, and I'm mostly happy about it. However there is occasional lag and rubberbanding. I'd rather than then hacked items, though, so it's not a huge deal for me. If you have an unstable internet connection, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.\n\n- Bugs: Summoners are broken, some towers are broken, Dark Elf Warrior Ninja ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are broken. This stuff can all be fixed with patches, but it's still a pain in the butt. The Dark Elf Warriors will oneshot you on insane, then turn around and wreck your defenses. I refuse to believe that the insanity of the DEWs on endless spires on insane during the last wave are NOT bugged.\n\n- UI: I know I said this one already, but seriously, the UI really sucks.\n\nMisconceptions:\nCash shop: Now that I've played more, I realized that the cash shop is literally JUST emotes (at the moment.) It's not even outfits, it's just an animation that you can buy for a dollar. The concerning thing is that the infrastructure exists if they decide to sell more than just cosmetics, but they promised to keep the cash items cosmetic only.\n\n'Mobile Game Port': Yeah, there's a dungeon defenders game for Android that's very close to the PC version, but I'd call that an exceptionally good Android game, not an exceptionally bad PC game. Controls are fine, video options are fine, gameplay is fine. I'm never in a place where I say "Wow, if this wasn't a mobile game port, X would be easier/better." If I never played the android version, I wouldn't beleive the game could even be ported to android and still work the way it does on PC.\n\nIn the end, I'd contine to state that if you like DD, you'll like DDE, especially if/when they fix the remaining bugs.\n\n\n---\nOriginal Review: 20Hrs in\n---\nAs someone who's put hundreds of hours into the base DD game, all of the negative reviews of this one were very concerning to me. Even then, I got enough enjoyment out of the base game that I didn't mind supporting the devs a bit more.\n\nI don't know if I'm playing the same game as the people who played for .2 hours before downvoting it, but I'm beginning to think I'm not. From what I've played so far, it looks  like they took major steps towards fixing a lot of little annoyances from the base game- mana is no longer currency, everyone gets their own chests and gear drop, and hardcore mode is actually scary (when you die you lose all of your levels and gear!) They added consumables, new pet abilities, two weapon slots, and it looks like all of the paid map DLC from the base game is unlocked for everyone.\n\nA big problem with the first game was hacked in items, a problem that appears, for the moment, to be solved.\n\nI'm going to address a few concerns I've seen brought up.\n\nIn App Purchases: From what I'm seeing, the ONLY thing bought with real money is costumes which are purely cosmetic. I have no problem with that model, and usually nobody else does either.\n\nBlurry Textures: If the reviewer played for more than a few minutes or read the on screen tips, he would have seen that the game downloads super low res textures to get you playing, and then continues the download of the rest of the assets in the background.\n\nMobile game port: I'm not sure if the game started out as a port from a mobile device, but it feels like a full featured PC game: tons of remappable keyboard shortcuts, graphics options, and controls that work well.\n\nUI: This is the only place where I see problems. Creating a private match was simple enough, but the friends system took a little while to get used to. It appears to be a (Twitter Bootstrap Based) Javascript/HTML overlay that you get at by hovering over the top right corner. It feels really disjointed from the rest of the game's menus.\n\nThe bottom line is that if you like the original Dungeon Defenders PC game, you'll like this too. I feel like a ton of the negative reviews are by people that haven't put any time into actually playing the game.","July 22, 2014","true","163.1"," 690 of 1,092 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","690","1","0","32"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/recommended/302270/","astralchaos","Falem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astralchaos/","1065 products in account","Summary\nDungeon Defenders Eternity is a tower defense game  made by Nom Nom Games. It is essentially a remake of the first game with a few additional maps and polished content. With a attempt at fixing the balances issues the original had and adding new features.\n\nPro’s and Con’s - in comparison to first game\n\nPlayverse\n+ No hackers\n+ Persistant Party System\n+ Private Taverns\n\n- Always Online (DRM)\n- Cannot import characters from DD1\n\nYou will have to add friends to playverse in order to party with them. When a player attempts to start a map it gives everyone in the party the option to accept or reject following them. This allows players to avoid being interrupted if they are in the middle of looting, crafting, equipping, or simply changing heroes.\n\nA party on playverse is persistant unless you leave it, meaning that if you disconnect for whatever reason, you can rejoin and get back to your friends unless the room becomes full.\n\nSome of my friends have reported that the service was slow for them, now that they are able to download the whole game it redeems this problem though it still takes them a few hours to download the 1.6 GB.\n\nVisuals\n+ Improved visual variety (Gear is noticeable, and items look sharper)\n+ Better Shop UI (Shop has categories)\n\n- Downgraded Character UI (No Categories to separate the icons)\n- No Splitscreen co-op\n\nVisual Fix Update: They have added the ability for you to download the whole game if you wait on the update screen. This will stop textures from having to be streamed to you, which results in enjoying a blur-free experience without having to wait to constantly download a map.\n\nIcons  for skills Missing? Answer here: Been missing my icons all day and realized that you could just drag and drop the icons onto the hotbar on the bottom left back.\n\nMechanics\n+ Crafter (Find Blueprints, components to craft superior gear)\n+ Relics (Give Permanent stat boosts that is not a grind)\n+ Amulets(Spend mana to cast different quality spells)\n+ Pickups are independent( Everyone gets their own drops,chests, and pets)\n+ Chests matter (Ingredients and gems can be gained)\n+ Micro-Transactions(Only cosmetics, currently emotions)\n+ Steam Workshop\n\n- Minons use defense points(Minons got buffed, but use DU instead of their own points)\n- Minon AI(Currently Glitches, the ogres seem to move on their own sometimes)\n\nAmulets are a great addition, it allows players to have various additional useful abilities for any class they like. Amulets are set at lower levels than other gear, which allows players to equip them on their alternate characters, to give them that extra edge they need. Tower heals amulets are efficient at repairing multiple buildings at once which becomes more potent with defense power. Characters have their skills changed to defense and offense power in order to be applied to both the character personal skills, and their amulets.\n\nMonk's tower damage skill gets stronger from defense power just like tower heals which results him not just increasing the damage of towers by more but also being able to heal for a higher % of the tower hp. Curse runs on offense power just like how your DPS skills, which means not only can you slow down ogres, make them weaker and increase your damage but you also have increased your own skill damage. The summoner can use amulets in astral form, allowing him to actually cast storm spells that damage an area of enemies.\n\nYou can hatch pets, by equipping them in a amulet slot while fighting against enemies. I am not sure why  they added a entire extra step to using pets though its easy enough to not be an issue. They also added pet active skills, turning orcs into cakes is always a good time.\n\nRelics can be found on challenges or bosses. There is 5 relics since each difficulty gives you 1. If you do nightmare and beat it you get all 5. Since getting the relics under it are automatic. This is a nice way to increase your stats in general.\n\nBoosters can be found during waves and are common expect for the exp booster, that you can use increase quality,quantity,rarity and magic items you find. The icing on the cake is that only one person in the party needs to apply it! Every time you apply a booster it will last 5 more waves, however since survival counts as one big wave for an hour its most efficent to use it for that.\n\nThe ogres sometimes suddenly move about and is currently a glitch, though i suspect this will be patched soon. This AI glitch alongside the fact minon points got removed really nerfed the summoner, now I see some summoners use them with DPS pets or other methods to try to make him viable.\n\nGame Changes\n+ Survival Feels Endless (1 Hour timed, instead of waves)\n+ Hardcore Mode (Perma Death & Better Rewards)\n+ Total Package (Contains most DLC of original game, it has all characters)\n+ 4 Campaign Maps\n\n- Lowered Level Cap 100 to 60 (Not sure how stats will suffer in comparison to first game)\n- Dungeon Defenders 2 Across corner not sure if this was wise timing to allocate resources to make this.\n\nSurvival is fun but there is an issue,  the developers need to add a level display to the session playlist. When people look for a session to play and see only map, game mode, and difficulty they are not aware that the game mode of survival pumps up the difficulty greatly even on normal to the point where I could not possibly survive without better gear.\n\nSurvival has been patched, now you are able to switch heroes any time during the hour at the forge. Gold also will not replace items anymore, and items will not disappear in your face quickly as a result.\n\nI recommend those who are curious about it wait at least till your around level 20.\n\nThe Backlash\nWhen the game first released on steam, it did not have single player, achivements and other things as promised by the store page. Hence why many were angered by the broken promises and when those promises were removed from the page it did not help their case.\n\nThe other part of the backlash stems from them going full DRM, which resulted in people always having to be online to play. Some people just want the ability to play without having to worry about the service disconnecting or other issues that comes from playing online. Since they went for a system that streams the content to your computer it takes a while for the textures to fully load and get the graphics that you were expecting coming in. I admit the graphics are simply darker than DD 1 but I would by no means call them inferior\n\nThe Likes\nMost people who gave this game a chance saw many nice additions to a game they liked with better balancing. While they acknowledged that there is flaws they should address, they think it has potential to be a better game if you give them enough time to patch it up a bit. Most of them see the blacklash while warranted a bit too overboard.","July 23, 2014","true","268.4"," 360 of 569 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","360","569","0","21"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/recommended/302270/","VultureBike","Ernie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VultureBike/","240 products in account","TL;DR Man, I had hope for this game being a considerably better version of Dungeon Defenders 1, especially considering the large amount of changes done, but it ended up being a huge disappointment. I invested a reasonable amount of hours, and even persuaded my friends that were playing the game that things would get better because Trendy was listening. Things didn't get better, but Trendy kept listening. In short, I'd advise against getting the game, at least for now. While I've sort of relinquished my affection for the game, I do still look at updates and hope things get better.\n\n\nSo this is Dungeon Defenders 1.5. Basically, it serves to help be the middle ground between Dungeon Defenders 2 and Dungeon Defenders 1 (I think). If you've played Dungeon Defenders, then you know what this game is about. Dungeon Defenders is a game where you pick a champion (or all of them, because that's an option) and your goal is to defend the Etheria crystals from the mobs trying to break them. I think them breaking means the end of the world or something. Let's go with that.\n\nWhile Dungeon Defenders 1 had 4 heroes by default and the other 3 were DLC-only, Dungeon Defenders Eternity has all heroes available at the start. Also, much like the heroes, it has many of the previous maps also available at the start. Some maps haven't transitioned into Dungeon Defenders Eternity, but there is still potential for them to be added in the future as Trendy has decided that they intend to update the game with a content update MONTHLY. Currently, they've gone through 3 content updates. (The game came ou in July, so they're on pace) Each update has so far come with a new map. Also, to go along with the monthly "big update," they also do smaller weekly updates to the game.\n\nGameplay is identical to the first with few exceptions. Some towers have had some tweaking and, perhaps the most controversial change, Minion Units from Dungeon Defenders 1 has been replaced by adding on Defense Units to maps that warranted it. Also, the game comes with 4 additional maps to the campaign, 3 inside of the missions leading to Eternia Shards maps, and 1 after Crystalline Dimension.\n\nThe way items upgrade has also been reworked. Previously they costed mana which was all but abundant in the game, and only an exceptional few items took one's entire inventory's worth of mana to fully upgrade, but now they function on the new Gold resource that has replaced Mana. Mana now only interacts with towers and doesn't influence anything outside of a given map. Gold though, as you might imagine, is noticably harder to come by. Whereas in the past it wasn't too difficult to find a 2000 mana Mana Token, now you'd be hard pressed to find even a 50 gold Gold Coin. Fortunately, items cost an almost proportionally amount less gold to upgrade and this seems to serve as to limit a player's ability to just upgrade their gear to obscene levels early on and just rush through the game with that gear. Maybe.\n\nSo, I'm going to level with you. I spent 800 hours in Dungeon Defenders 1 and I only played for about 4 months. The game got really solved and that made me kind of furstrated, so I gave away what I had and just left the game. Games like these are intended to encourage you to farm for gear that gives you beetter stats so you have an easier time with the endgame, right? Well, that's fine and you can get to that level hilariously easy in Dungeon Defenders 1 by means of Tinkerer's Lab  Assault NMHC. At around 3000 stats in Dungeon Defenders 1 (fully upgraded), you are pretty comfortable with every map. Eternity, on the other hand, while it doesn't have Tinkerer's Lab Assault, it does have something far worse.\n\nSomething to note is that in Dungeon Defenders 1, it was pretty difficult to find an item with 400 in a stat. There was even a cap on the more obscene Obsidian Weapons at 999 in a stat. That was basically the highest you'd see at all in the game and it was tremendously rare to find anything not a Clava with those stats.\n\nUnfortunately, Eternity decided numbers get players or something, so you can find as high as 600 base stats on an item. Remember how I mentioned items upgrade differently? Well not only do they use gold, but they upgrade 10% of the base. Imagine you found an elusive 600 stat weapon in the game and it came with 16 upgrades (highest from the past. I'm not sure if it was implemented to have items with 16 upgrades anymore). Well, that would mean that you could get 60 stats per upgrade, 15 more times giving you 900 extra stats. That would mean 1500 stats on, potentially, one stat from an item. I mean, all of the stats could have rolled with 600, so you could have something obscene like 600/1050/1050/600 on an item or something. Or ytou could have a waller with just 1500 in tower Health because that's a thing. Sure, the formulas scale a bit differently from Dungeon Defenders 1, but it just doesn't make sense.\n\nThat said, you don't need anywhere close to the maximum theoretical stats achieveable to clear maps. I've had friends that broke into nightmare, clearing Tavern Defense with meager 800s in a stat. Not even in the thousands. Sure, you might suggest that some other maps require higher stats, but those stats are pretty easily achievable. I mean, it's not like you'd be spending hours and hours trying to clear The Deeper Well (first map in the game) on Nightmare (current highest difficulty in the game) with the Hardcore modifier (makes the mobs harder and you get better drops) or anything. That really detracts from how fun the game is.\n\nWith games like these with the amoutn of diversity in characters, there's also much to be said about balance. If you've played Dungeon Defenders 1, you know that there were really only 4 builders in that game (at least in end-game): Huntress, Monk(Initiate), Summoner(Demoness) and Series EV. What of that changed in Dungeon Defenders Eternity? Well, the Huntress is nearly not even a class. Changes that were made to her include having all towers default to 15s recharge time, making her gas trap nearly unusable. Also, inferno trap doesn't scale with rate as one might hope. Instead, it will tick every second for forever. Rate just affects the recharge of the trap. Fortunately, her Darkness trap has an added feature that will also give mobs a chance to "miss" a target, effectively acting as a secondary Strength Drain within a limited area.\n\nMonk's Enrage Aura also is/was brokenly overpowered. It's still an AoE mind control tower ('cause those are always balanced in Tower Defense games), but it also debuffs mobs so that they die faster too. In previous patches it was even more brokenly overpowered by being able to tick faster and harder.\n\nSummoner, because Minion Units stripped from the game, was given an unwarranted buff to its units. Mages, for example, can now heal all towers within range, not just minions. Because, in case you were worried about having to play the game, the game has to be put back in gaminess.\n\nSeries EV's utility towers are just as potent as before, but Buff Beam has seen a considerable buff to it scaling. No longer does it "soft-cap" at ~3000 stats, but it goes on forever. Because every Tower Defense game needs an AoE buff tower that can reach absurd levels, right?\n\nUgh. Ok, so I know my tone hasn't been the best, but this game is frustrating. Not because of the game per-se, but beacuse of the game... Yeah, ok, words are hard. The gameplay itself ultimately isn't any different from Dungeon Defenders 1. Ultimately, I guess that's my fault for being a challenge I thought I'd have to overcome. I mean, Dungeon Defenders 1 was just so stale after a point, so I was hoping Eternity would breathe new life into the game. I honestly was defending the game to my friends because I was certain the game would get better and be a better experience. It's almost embarassing to me.\n\nAnyway, character cap. This game is a huge let-down","November 4, 2014","false","361.0"," 109 of 160 people (68%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","68","109","160","5","0"

Now they are going to come out with Dungeon Defenders 2. Dungeon Defenders Eternity (DDE) has recently had a patch. This patch messed things up. Whether or not it is intentional  is not for certain. I do however know that several of my friends that play it have reported the issue and had no response to their inquiry. I posted on the forums and no response either. I even looked on the known issues section of the forums, nothing there either. The 2 most played maps (cause of the good loot and gold ammount) are unplayable. So I now feel like I've thrown away my money in this game. I'm not 100% sure but I'm starting to believe this is a marketing strategy to get players to quit DDE and go back to DD1 or even get DD2, their new baby. Either way I wouldn't buy this unless it gets fixed since other maps don't give as good loot/gold as those 2. This makes me upset and I may even take my money and gaming time elsewhere. Who knows they may make DD3 and do the same to the other DD's. DON'T BUY THIS!!! At least not till they fix it.","March 18, 2015","false","266.1"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","43","56","2","0"

The game might become better after all these updates, but they have already lost my interest. There is a big chance that this review will be outdated soon, and i wont be updating it anymore. I reccomend taking some time to do some research before you buy this game.\n\nEDIT: For older players who dont have a team and used to play a lot of survival: They changed survival to be one endless wave that lasts an hour. This sounds like a good change, until you realise you cant swich classes once you begin, making late game solo survival play almost impossible. and the fact that you cant "host" an instance anymore and cant kick people will make public survival runs a pain.\nprepare for trolls who sell all the towers at the 5 minutes remaining mark!\n\n(Wall of text review incoming)\n\nThis game is great for:\n-People that want more of the same, the new additions and dont really care about UI or bugginess.\n-People that play with a 4 man team of friends, online. (no more splitscreen)\n\n\nThis game could be annoying/frustrating for:\n-Most of the old dungeon defenders players\n-People that played for the trophies\n-People that havent played the original dungeon defenders.\n\nI reccomend the original dungeon defenders for new players.\n\nWhat i have written down below is mostly my opinions and problems with this game.\n\nI honestly feel like this remake is unfinished and has some really poor design choices.\nThe game still has a lot of glitches and bugs, i feel like im playing a beta sometimes.\nSo far the game has been more of the same with some little differences.\nBut its the little things that bother me the most, such as:\n\n-Forced online taverns: I liked being able to relax in my own tavern, managing my gear, chatting with the other people i might have just played with, looking through my trophies, being able to change the music playing in the tavern ect, ect.\n\nThe new taverns are just chaotic and laggy, filled with usually 20 people in a small space.\nI dont mind the option of public taverns, but i think the 4 man personally hosted taverns should still be available.\n\n-Playverse: I know playverse isnt done yet, but it can be really buggy at times. There have been plenty of times the matchmaking servers havent been working or offline. And you need the matchmaking servers to be placed in a tavern. Which you need to be in to play solo.\n\n-Glitchy: This game is advertised as a full finished game on steam, yet there are so many bugs and glitches and the general feeling of unfinishedness that the original didnt suffer from. If you are remaking a game you'd better make sure it works better then the original. Mostly the movement in multiplayer can glitch out pretty badly, the general collision between players and mobs feel wrong, not even talking about how much you can glitch the game when you start jumping.\n\n-UI: Tower stats are now shown much better. Other than that most of the UI feels clunky and unclear. At least the original had a small tutorial explaining things. This one doesnt.\nThe moment you click play in the menu you are thrown into a tavern with no explaination whatsoever.\nI had a lot of trouble finding out how the new dye system and crafting works, i cant imagine how confusing it will be for new players.\n\n-small stuff i dislike: The 2 minute timer at the end of a map. I like staying a bit to collect mana/coins and chat a bit with people. But now you are brutely ripped away from it. You wont even end up in the same tavern as the people you were playing with. Also hardcore mode has changed to the degree where noone will risk it late game (if you die your character is deleted, rather then if you die you just dont respawn for the duration of the wave). Survival has also changed in such a way that it becomes a pain in the butt without a solid premade team.\n\nBut this rant has been long enough. I appologize for possibly butchering the english language, its my second laguage and thank you for letting me get this off my chest.","July 27, 2014","false","26.7"," 115 of 178 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","115","178","0","1"

Long review so if you want to skip to the results then click READ MORE and scroll all the way to the bottom.\n\nFirst of all DDE was made by Nom Nom Games. NOT by Trendy Entertainment. I'm not going to go beyond the line and say Nom Nom ruined Dungeon Defenders but in my honest opinion they did more bad than good. Someone said that Nom Nom Games is apart of Trendy but I don't know. All I know is that the main team that worked on DD1 did not work on DDE. Lets start out what DDE brought to the table.\n\nSecure Dedicated Servers for anti-hacking protection: This means always online play, even in singleplayer. No more hosting games from your computer. Everyone has to connect to the servers and that means DELAY. if you log on to DD1 and do a map and switch to DDE and do the same map you will feel a major difference. In DD1 I barely saw any hackers and if i did I would kick them immediately.\n\nCharacter Dye's: You could change the color of your character in the first game. Probably not on the level of DDE but it was still in there. This also ties into new Visible Armor.\n\nCrafting System: While leveling I barely used the crafting system. Crafted items are slightly better than drops but it doesn't really add anything to the game. Really not that different from drops except you need random drops from mana chests in order to craft the item. If you get a good recipe you could probably craft and sell it to other players.\n\nPet Hatching/Growth System/active abilities: I really didn't care less about the Hatching/growth system. The active abilities seemed neat at first then I forgot about them and never used them. *shrug*\n\nDashing and mantling systems for better mobility: Dashing was a cool concept that i'm 50/50 on. More mobility but with the laggy servers its hard to use it. Also i didn't even know there was a mantling system... Never used it.\n\nWeapon Swapping between two weapon sets: Didn't use this one either, i'm guessing it works just like how Series E.V. works where she has 2 weapons and you click your button and it switches to another weapon. The old DD UI was fine with swapping gear/weapons. Maybe its a little bit more convenient but I didn't use it.\n\nCommunity Tavern: Forcing players to be social isn't always the greatest thing. I would much rather have my own tavern that showcases all my trophy's and items that I want to drop on the floor than have a big community tavern with random people that i've never met before and barely talk in chat.\n\nQuickmatch: I never used this in DD1 and never used it in here. I play DD with people on my friends list and so I never had a use for it. I dont know why this is a "new feature" because DD1 had it as well.\n\nNew currency, Gold coins. Instead of using mana to upgrade and buy gear from other players and the innkeeper, it is now gold.\n\nYatta yatta yatta Cross platform play, *shrug* One DD account and that means you keep your progression on your android devices so that can be kinda cool if you have an Android device and you play DDE on there. 34 new equipable emotes that you have to purchase for REAL MONEY.\n\nThey seem to take away a lot more content from the first DD and then put in less content. I didn't get a chance to try the new content so I don't have anything to say on the new maps. New Rebalanced missions, I actually failed on Alchemical Laboratory on Normal with my countess but I played again and comepleted the mission.\n\nRebalanced stat system for a greater effect on late game, didn't get a chance to see this one either.\n\nSurvival Mode was revised and its shorter play times, constantly running around looking at loot drops because they disappear more frequently than DD1 and that can get you killed easily which means if you are playing on Hardcore, good luck. The shorter play times can be a bonus to some players but i loved going for long gaming sessions with friends, seeing how far we can get on a certain map.\n\nHardcore mode has better rewards but has Perma-Death. I can see it being fun but for a game like DD where you need to try different builds and see what works and what doesn't, i'm a bit iffy on that. I think they're reworking Hardcore so take this part with a grain of salt.\n\nYou do get all 12 Heroes, (Squire,Huntress,Apprentice,Monk,Countess,Hunter,Adept,Initiate,Barbarian,Series E.V.,Jester,Summoner. the original campaign including Lost Eternity Shards and 7 challenge missions, 5 bonus missions (Glitterhelm, Karathiki, Tavern Siege, City In The Cliffs, Tinkerer’s Lab) and Akatit Jungle, Palantir. and then the original DD costumes.\n\nUI feels clunky and difficult to learn. DD1 had a much better UI and it felt more responsive and it was very easy to get the hang of it. Playverse, I just hate. Its just like Uplay. I don't need another thing between me and my game. I have steam and I love steam and I don't want anyone to get in the way of something that already works really well. You bring up Playverse by clicking F11 so it just feels disconnected from everything. Its difficult to invite friends and to join them and even talk to them. It feels clunky and id much rather use the steam overlay.\n\n-------Results-------\n\nI give Dungeon Defenders Eternity a 6/10. DDE wasn't needed at all in the first place and I bought it because it had Dungeon Defenders in the title, after playing and realising that it wasn't developed by Trendy, I felt cheated. Some of the new features are nice but there are more bad than good. For $15 you are getting a lot more content then if you bought Dungeon Defenders for the same price. However, if you are willing to spend a little extra for DLC please consider buying Dungeon Defenders, you will get a better gaming experience than if you would if you bought DDE.\n\nHopefully you found my review helpful and if you need more information feel free to add me and I will do the best I can to answer your question.","July 29, 2014","false","6.4"," 80 of 124 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","80","124","0","1"

However, after trying to install and messing around a little, I cannot possibly recommend this. To me, it seems like a expensive patch and if it is indeed an expansion to the first game, then it should be linked to the first game and not its own application.\n\nAlso, the lack of solo capability and the online DRM is just not worth it. Sure its pretty. Yes, some of the animations do look cool.  But this release was not necessary and to be honest I feel the first game is good enough.\n\nI cant wait for DD2 to come out but am disappointed with this unnecessary release.\n\nEDIT: Single Player is now available. This makes up for some of the disappointment but I still feel that the original DD is better and that this is a step down. There are still no private taverns.\n\nSECOND EDIT: So I gave the game a chance and played all the way to the crystaline dimension level . The reward for beating it was absolutely nothing except for being able to play the new map. While many say this is DD remastered, its a step back because so much is missing from the original DD that I loved. You have all the skins unlocked (some are missing from DD1). No customizable crystal. There is no unique weapon rewards from challenges. Many challenges are not in the game anymore like lab assault. Tavern defense no longer has its 3 bosses and many of the holiday maps are gone. While we gain cool features with armor and a new map, the loss outweighs the gain and thus I recommend sticking with DD1 and waiting for DD2 instead of buying this game.","July 22, 2014","false","77.6"," 164 of 270 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","164","270","0","9"

MOST THINGS THAT WERE POINTED OUT WERE FIXED WITHIN THE FIRST DAY OF LAUNCH.\n\nAnyways for my review I believe this game is actually a step up from DD1. Yes there is no private taverns anymore but honestly, all the frusterating thing from DD1 have been fixed in this version of the game. No more cheaters to worry about, real economy, and one of my favorite things, ARMOUR SHOWS ON YOUR CHARACTER. I know, it's a little weird to be excited for that but honestly, it's something i've wanted for a very long time. This shows a preview of some of the game mechanics that are going to be in DD2 and the new playerverse system isn't half bad. It's a little confusing at first but you get the hang of it pretty fast.\n\nSome things to be noted are the TEMPORARY blurry textures when you first load into the game. They are blurry simply because they take time to load in. The game slowly downloads while your playing which I don't think as a con, simply because it allows you to play the game faster.\n\nOn another note, you get Most the DLC from DD1 excluding the holiday maps, which in my opnion weren't as fun as the others anyways. All characters are included and all DLC storylines, including a bonus story line with added in campaign missions. This game is very enjoyable and deserves a chance. I understand a lot of people were probably frusterated by the launch, because I know that I was, but once they updated it to version 2.0 all those problems faded away. I would probably give this game a solid 8/10. It's enjoyable and gives a fresh view to the DD experience and a good preview of what DD2 has to offer.","July 22, 2014","true","20.3"," 305 of 541 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","305","541","0","0"

Is it what it is made out to be? No, well at least not yet. There is still always online ,there is still no splitscreen and there is still microtransactions (although they are only pointless emotes so really no need to buy them) but give it time and this game will get better. However it should really not have been released in the state it was with singleplayer blocked off. Also one thing to note is that although you may play dungeons on your own or just with friends, you still have to share a tavern with many other people, this can be annoying as players block your path making it difficult to talk to npcs (tavernkeeper etc) when lots of people are grouped around them. So my final verdict is that it is alot of fun but still needs changes to reach its full potential.

Constant server problems, connection problems, terrible menus, half of its features disabled, horrible balance problems.\n\nGood things:\nSome anti-hack protection finally. DD1 was a terrible piece of hacking trash.\n\nThat's pretty much all good things I found while playing.\n\nBad things:\nHalf of the classes nerfed do the ground.\nSummoner... just forget about his minions. Its no longer uses its own defense units and its units is terrible now compared to harpoons. Only viable thing about summoner is... full pet damage spec. Which is actually pretty good.\nMonk has its auras radius completely nerfed and because of only that they are very weak waste of defense units until you get insane gear.\nEV - physical walls still viable. Reflect is very useful. Buffs got nerfed completely. Forget about them until you get 5-6k ALL stats, better 8-9 thousands. Until then they are complete trash. And the last proton beam is still dumpter, no changes here.\nTERRIBLE balance issues:\n1) DPS heroes - while physical damage is total crap, towers do about 100k dps at level 60 (which is max level now by the way), elemental damage heroes can do... 2 million dps at level 20. Yeah...\nIt seems now its been nerfed to more or less sane digits.\n2) Survival - developers decided to rebalance it by... making it a single wave, so you cant swap heroes. Complete trash mode which also has no pet rewards. So one of the nice features of DD1 - combining different defenses, just got removed.\nIn 3.3 every mana problems is fixed, but you still cant swap hero after start. At least you can build stuff now.\n3) Bosses - completely not tested and impossible to kill sometimes.\n4) Crafting - you get this blueprints dropped occasionally. Which require some crafting parts to craft that drops from chests. And from what I've played I never saw a single one item that worth wasting them. Its like a regular dumpster drop that just requires you to waste some materials to be able to get it. Complete worthless addition to the game.\n5) Challenges - no point of doing them now. No rewards, no drops, not even experience from mobs. Nice change trendy, nice change indeed.\n6) Vywerns is a nightmare now. If it started to hit crystal/tower, its invincible to half of your towers because they just cant hit it.\n7) Dark elves warriors - not affected by slow auras, ignore towers, they will kill you and then kill your towers from behind. Good luck loosing the map because one elve just destroyed all the towers.\n8) FIXED in 3.3. Solo players got punch in the face. No mana doesnt allows you to complete most of the levels on insane until you get insane DPS hero that will oneshot ogres. Survival is pretty much impossible on insane.\n9) Loot boosters is REQUIRED to get decent gear. You CAN NOT get any of it because there is a loot quality boost that is simple multiplier of stats. Without it you can forget about loot.\n10) Loot still disappearing. In fact, it MUCH, MUCH worse now. It can disappear even before it hits the ground. It falls into oblivion. Complete dumpster stays on the ground forever, upgrades disappears before you even see them.\n11) COINS. The ♥♥♥♥en coins is completely untested and ruin all fun of playing. Created as the way to punish afk people, it dont achieved anything, only made things worse. This new crap value counts as DROP, so map filled with coins will prevent ANY ITEMS TO DROP. So you are FORCED to run around EVERY MAP like a ♥♥♥♥en HORSE ON A TRACK, collecting this bloody coins over, and over, and over the ♥♥♥♥ again and again and again, every single damn map because otherwise you get no drops at all. Very often if you play some hard maps on insane, you just have to defend one place. Imagine what happens at the end of the wave? All map filled with coins, and all drop you get is ♥♥♥♥en dye and worthless amulets.\n12) Artifacts. They are just worthless. Missleading tips, complete dumpster bonuses. Forget about them.\n13) No kick option. Yeah. Almost every public game is filled with complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Level 10 in an insane palantir run. Level 60 naked people. Idiots that dont upgrade anything. Afk people. People with no builder chars that wasted mana god knows on what and waiting for miracle. And you cant do anything about it.\n\nNo nightmare, no challenges, no hardcore/pure strategy/mix mode, no enjoyable survival, no levels past 60, complete rebalance of gear that feels terrible and unbalanced right now, no steam achiements that was an additional motivation to play.\n\nOld bugs with mob stuck still dont fixed. New bugs appeared. Mob spawn doors sometimes dont even opens, leaving all mobs behind them invincible for all towers and ranged attacks (every wave at lab assault). Palantir, tavern defence, akatiti has very often (if not everytime) mob stuck, sometimes vywerns stuck the way they completely out of reach for everything. Some units completely ignore defences and attack crystal (archers for the most).\n\nFirst couple of days game had no single player. Now it has no private tavern and solo player is completely loosing to multi player, because with every other player has its own mana chests and can actually use other hero, wow!\n\nGame performance is terrible. New shadows make game have 15-20 fps on my i7-4770k/16 GB/GTX660 PC.\n\nServers is constantly lagging. If you played Path of Exile - you find something very very similar here. Client-server desynchronization. Constantly. Servers can be offline, you cant launch the game, you cant join tavern, you cant load level, you cant even start the level sometimes. If you are actually playing it - consider yourself lucky. Or not, because you wasted your money on this dumpster game that should be tested for another year before the release.\n\nAnd after all this crap, you decided to play this game. Level your character, finish survival level and get some nice drops. Do you think you deserve them? Haha, nope. Get ROLLBACKED. Loose your progress and all the loot acquired. Multiple fixes - nothing changes. It gets even worse. How about... LOOSING ALL YOUR CHARACTERS AND STASH? This happened to couple hundreds people, and nothing was restored for them.\n\nThe only hope left is patches. I suggest you to wait for a year and try this game later. Maybe developers will fix this horrible problems so the game will actually be playable.","July 22, 2014","false","218.3"," 64 of 112 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","64","112","0","4"

It isn't a bad thing at all, its a remake with good changes (Even though there's a couple of bad changes, the good outweighs)\n\nGood\n-Rebalanced the enemies and classes. It does not feel like there is an exact meta unlike the first game (Harpoons, Minions, EV Buffs, etc etc). You're more free to mix and match with the defenses among several classes.\n-Better chance of no hackers. It was a major problem in the first game, but with the playverse feature, it defintely has a much better defense against hackers.\n-Game feeling more like a co-op game. Some things made it to where its harder to solo, but thats not bad due to this being a co-op game. Example, survival is one big wave instead of multiple, it requires a builder to stay as that character while others need to DPS to help or even a 2nd builder!\n-New gameplay additions. The amulets give useful spells to help with the defense further, even builders can do more than just repair if they didn't spec any hero damage! The dashing mechanic helps slow characters like Squire move across the map with greater ease while it can help some DPS characters dodge attacks that would hurt a lot.\n-Not P2W! The only thing that is paid for is the game itself and just some cosmetic taunts. Trendy declared that they would not charge money for new maps! Heck, even the loot and XP boosters are DROPS instead of paid for!\n\nBad\n-Summoner. They tried to make it less relied on compared to the first game, but they went too far to making him near complete useless. Sure you can still try using him like RTS with some improved minions, but lack of MU makes it hard when you have to share DU.\n-DPS Balance. UPDATED! They listened to the problem with elemental weapons! Although they're still a bit powerful, they did give a serious nerf to the elemental amulet. (Still listed as a negative due to elemental weapons still being clearly much better than regular damage)\n-No local co-op or private taverns. Another issue that is very known, but it would be nice to be given these options!\n-No tutorial. Getting friends into this game who haven't played the first is a bit tricky at first, it would be nice to have an actual tutorial.\n\nOverall\nI recommend this game to those who liked the first game as well as people who just love tower defense games! It is a remake, and there are somethings not added in yet, but its defintely worth checking out!\n\n(Review made 7/29/2014)\n(Review updated last 8/1/2014)","July 29, 2014","true","114.9"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","28","48","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MythicalPolarbears/recommended/302270/","MythicalPolarbears","Mythical☪","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MythicalPolarbears/","75 products in account","Dungeon Defenders Eternity - For those new to the franchise, a fresh slate, this game is really not bad. I would dare to say fun.\n\nUnfortunately, I am not new to the franchise. I - Long ago was very much into the original Dungeon Defenders. A game that focused on team work, strategy and growth. Before I can review the game let me explain what this game is. Dungeon Defenders Eternity Is a combineded game of Dungeon Defenders, and all its DLC. It includes rebalancing of loot, minions, bosses and characters. They have added a few new items, aswell as crafting and cosmetic upgrades to the game's customization. In addition it is a client side game hosted by Play Verse with a seperate friends list and party system not linked with steam.\n\nThis description is a description for what the final version of this "definitive" game is supposed to be. However currently it is missing serveral stuff aswell as added some annoying things which I will list.\n\n-Not All DLC, Game-modes and Difficulties have been added\n-Character are not by any means balance (Squire is a requirement, and Summoner has no building use)\n-Loot was bugged, spawning Epicly over powered stats. A patch has came and nerfed all loot, messing up everything further\n-Chance on getting decent loot is absurdly unlikely. Long Long hours of grinding is necessary. (No feeling of growth)\n-Play Verse is tacky, and not well optimised\n-Matchmaking is buggy and constantly doesn't let you join games.\n-Private Taverns have been changed to public, achievements no longer visible\n-Cosmentics cool but unnecessary\n-Crafting, not really crafting. No really gameplay. Just play enough till your able to craft the item you want.\n-A few maps are unplayable due to inbalanced gear.\n\nThese are just some of the issues with Dungeon Defenders Eternity. If you want to see more, I would recommend you check out the Forums.\n\nDungeon Defenders Eternity claims to be a "Definitive" version, meaning complete, perfected, fixed. Instead we have scraps of features to be added to Dungeon Defenders 2, portions of Dungeon Defenders 1 and a whole lot of bugs. For the sake of the sequel I want to recommend this game, but I can't because it feels like a beta. It really would not give justice to the original in anyway. Dungeon Defenders Eternity is a hollowed out version of the original. This game is getting patched but nothing more then quick fixes. The reason for this is because, they dont care about this game. It is a quick cash operation to help fund the sequel. The shame is 90% of the people who bought this game were the people who would have bought Dungeon Defenders 2. If you have never played the original, for the sake of saving money, it might be worth a buy. If you have played the original, do not get this. It will leave you full of disappointment, and disgust for Trendy.","August 16, 2014","false","142.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","3"

Probably my favorite thing about the new version.\n\n+ Amulets. I found a lightning storm amulet for my barbarian, which provides the AoE that the class just doesn't have. The amulets make up gaps for classes and feel great customization wise. Of course they have mana costs. The combo potential is incredible though. Drop a monk electric aura and then use the lightning storm amulet to stun everything inside the aura, forcing them to sit in it.\n\n+Consumables. Nice option, Respec'ing your hero is very, very cheap which personally I love. However I know this'll be personal taste. Playing a slow class? Carry some speed potions. It's another nice way to make up for a flaw in a certain area.\n\n+Hardcore mode option. Not something I would play, however the option is a massive plus for alot of people.\n\n+Hacking is fixed for now and should stay that way thanks to always on DRM. Of course the DRM itself is a major negative.\n\n+Pets now have an ability on a cooldown that you may use. More options! Great.\n\nNegatives:\n\n-Shared Tavern and to my knowledge, you may not turn off chat.\n\n-35second wait time when forming your own game.\n\n-No local option. Massive negative.\n\n-Dodgy second client that must be used.\n\n-Emotes are included as micro transaction. Not good particularly, but nothing new either.\nIt's 1 dollar per emote. A bit on the expensive side.\n\nLets talk price:\n\nI see people calling this a cash grab and I have to respectively disagree with them. If someone didn't own the game already, this is a bargain. If someone owned the base game without the mountain of DLC, this is still a bargain. If you owned every single piece of DLC then it's less of a bargain, but in my opinion it's still a cheap upgrade for alot of added extras.\n\nPersonally I was missing the summoner, EV and barbarian classes as well as some mission packs. It cost me £4.50. To buy only those classes would of cost double..\n\nFor the amount they added to this game, releasing it as a £5 DLC would of been a bargain.\n\nAmulets\nPet abilities\nArmor being visible\n4 new missions\nHardcore Mode\nConsumables\n\nThe game streams the levels as you go, which of course..positives and negatives. So far it's not been too bad though, however I do strongly believe that a download all option should be made available. Slow internet could cause serious load times.\n\nIt comes down to are you willing to deal with the second party client and can you cope with no local option? If so and you loved dungeon defenders or want to try it out, now is the chance. If you ignore the always on DRM, this is the best version of the game without a doubt.","July 23, 2014","true","368.3"," 30 of 55 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","30","55","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sperovita/recommended/302270/","sperovita","Spero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sperovita/","246 products in account","(My recommendation of this game is conditional, read the conclusion at the bottom)\n\nThis is basically a tweaked version of Dungeon Defenders with a new infrastructure for online play called Playverse. So what’s good about it?\n\nThe Good:\nThere are some cool new features like Dash, Extra Spells from Items, Armor Asthetics, etc. All of these features are very much welcomed and are pretty fun. I do enjoy dropping down a lightning storm on a large group of minions that are knocking at the walls from an amulet I picked up. You can check out the features on the DD Eternity Website.\nPlayverse seems to add more tools for online play. Also it’s probably the main reason for Eternity as it’s what Trendy plans to use for cross platform play, which seems pretty cool.\nAt the time of this review I have only played to level 15, so I can’t speak too much for balance and security, but according to Trendy the items and are more balanced and the game has more protection from hacking (Most likely since it’s ran through Playverse).\n\nThe Bad:\nAs many have said, “No solo play”, at least I can’t find it. Trendy should realize some people like to test their skills solo and not be bothered by people using up all the defense points in poor ways or just getting in the way.\nTooltips, Tooltips, Tooltips. How something so simple and prevalent in modern software seems to have eluded Trendy. There are tooltips but a lot of the new UI and the Playverse are missing these for a number of things.\nThis leads me to documentation. There’s no help or anything explaining all the new things like Crafting, Dyes, Why do I start with 4 characters I did not create with numbers in their names, etc.\nYou can't hide armor, or at least I can't find the option. There are some pretty cool costumes and it kind of sucks that you can't hide some ugly helmet with good stats that covers up a cool visor from your costume.\nWhen an inventory screen(like merchant or forge) and your mouse is over an item to read the description, if somebody walks past your mouse the description goes away and you have to move the mouse back and forth to get it back. Maybe a minor gripe, but something they should fix since taverns can be a bit chaotic.\n\nNotes:\nThere are Micro-Transactions, though they are for aesthetic items only. Currently there are some problems with joining games, though Trendy is aware of it and working on it. Only happened once to me, I just retried once and it worked. The tavern is not private, which doesn't bother me, but may bother some. It's probably like that to make the game more social. This is basically treated as a new game, so you will be starting from scratch with a new hero. Previous dungeon defender one heroes will not be available.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want to play Dungeon Defenders online, with more balance, security, some interesting new features and the above listed limitations (mostly no solo play, hopefully they’ll add itThey Did!) then I’d pick this up on a good sale. Otherwise wait for Dungeon Defenders 2 and play the previous one.\n\nEdit:\nTrendy has now enabled private sessions  . When starting a level you can now select host private session. Also through the Playverse overlay (F11) you can then invite people to it.","July 22, 2014","true","22.7"," 96 of 184 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","96","184","0","1"

Just get the DLC for the first one if you want it and stick with that.  Two out of three days I couldn't login; so good luck playing the game.  Once your in the game you can't  get a match to load because more problems connecting to server.  This also applies to the new private match option they added.

That is my biggest disappointment on this game. Note to Trendy: When you use the marketing word "Definitive" it will lead people to believe that it doesn't lack any of the original features. I think local co-op was a core feature in the original Dungeon Defenders. I now know that the store page doesn't specifically say the game has "local co-op" but that's something sort of like finding the hidden fine print. I feel duped in that sense.\n\nNevertheless, the game does offer a lot of interesting changes compared to the original game. I'm going to assume a lot here but based on what I can tell so far, the online multiplayer isn't via peer-to-peer connections anymore but rather each user connects to the playverse servers. I used to lag frequently when connecting to other people's games in the original dungeon defenders. But now I'm not. I can't confirm this at the moment though.\n\nWith those two things being pointed out, I'd conclude that this game is heavily focused for online play and you should only buy the game if you enjoyed playing online with other people in the original DD. If you are like me and enjoyed playing this game on local co-op with your family, YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. All of the other new and neat features just wouldn't matter because you can't play with the people that matter.\n\nPLEASE TRENDY.

They aren't. you have to wait indefinently for people to want to join your game so you can actually play, and it depends on luck that there are people like that. You can't start a game with less than 3 people. Absolutely ridiculous considering how many options of maps there are. It's messy and also overloads my videocard (intel integrated D 4600) with mediocre graphics, when I can play games with better graphics in a smoother experience and with higher resolution. Thank god I bought this on sale.\n\nEDIT: They fixed the private matches so you can actually play now. Still, you can't customize your game too much. I finally got to play and the game is terribly glitchy. When I won my first match, I was stuck in the loading screen back to the tavern for hours. The original DD was much better and still is.\n\nEDIT2: So, they've started a weekly patch program as a response to the fans' feedback. To be fair, I'll try and keep the review up do date to the patches, since so many people are using these as reference to buying the game or not.

But the reason is not because of the game itself, but the actions that trendy have taken. I'll try to remain as unbiased as possible with my opinion on what trendy is trying to do.\n\nIt just seems like a cash grab to me, I've already bought all of the dlc in the old game, then they go and release a "definitive version" with all of the dlc making my purchases worthless.\n\nOn the issue of hacking, the thing about the original dungeon defenders is that you really don't notice the hacking unless your actively searching for it, if you get into a hacked lobby (never happens anymore) you can always just back out and go on your way. The only noticable measurement of hacking was the amount of Companion cubes (pseudo curreny) because of duplication, but that was it for the most part, and didn't have a noticeable impact on the game.\n\nIf trendy really cared about hacking, then they should have patched the original game of the duplication bugs, or been more proactive about banning hackers themselves. Not release a completely new game, this is why I think they're just trying to milk money off of the name.\n\nThere is also the fact that I spent that many hours getting my characters geared with decent gear so i can run nmhc, I'd really rather not have to start COMPLETELY over from the previous game, It's one thing if FPS's like COD do this because it's relatively easy to do well. But You can't really do that with Huge RPG's that people have spent a ton of time getting stronger in. If I felt like playing dungeon defenders I'd play the original, not this Mobile port knockoff.\n\n\nI'm not saying the game itself is bad, in fact he game itself might be decent, BUT I do feel that Trendynet is just trying to grab as much money as possible, neglecting the pre-existing community of the original game who have already bought all the dlc.\n\nThis game was just unneeded, should have patched the original in my opinion.

It left a bad taste in my mouth to be honest. It was fun, I'll give it that; but for 20 bucks, I expected it to have alot more content and actually extend the gameplay with higher levels. Instead, like stated, alot was changed, and alot was restricted. It doesn't feel fun to have restrictions on a coop game. This feels more like a F2P prototype for the first DD.\n\nPositives, negatives, and in the middle of the two:\n\n+ A few new maps, some from the community.\n\n+ New currency system. This is one of the few good ideas they had to be honest.\n\n+ Gear is phsyical. Equip it and it shows. You can make it invisible if you want, you just need to buy the ridiculously cheap invisible armor from the tavern keeper.\n\n+ Ability to dye items. This is good since you can make the weapon fit with your overall look.\n\n+ Physical dye. Work towards making your character unique!\n\n+ All classes and characters unlocked. Well that's nice. Another good idea.\n\n- No steam workshop for mods. Just microtransaction ideas for items people submit. Sad thing? No one submits anything. That's . . . Just sad. Why did they think people would help with this if they hate it so much?\n\n- No local multiplayer with a controler, and a rather dumbed down singleplayer thats nearly impossible.\n\n- Microtransactions for emotes and hats. I think this is a slap to the face since they wanted it to be like TF2 or any other social game we see with a vanity system.\n\n- Difficult to level. Extremely slow leveling speed.\n\n- Level 60 cap.\n\n- Gear is divided into levels of 8. Honestly, did they REALLY just think that was a feature that was a good idea? Now it's even HARDER to get past the easy maps. It's now nearly a REQUIREMENT to jump on a survival game built by a high level. God.\n\n- Skins are all unlocked at the beginning. All of them. Even ones that were unlocked by getting an achievment.\n\n- Pets given at the start include the cube everyone used as advanced currency before . . . Big slap to the face again. It stings that none of the starting pets can be upgraded or even be useful.\n\n- Very low enchantment/upgrade limit. 16 upgrades max?! That's insanely dumbed down, making it EVEN MORE IMPOSSIBLE for new players! Now they can't upgrade their low level gear with the gold they EARN.\n\n- No more minion units. ♥♥♥♥ing. Genius. I mean, theres no real reason we needed those, right?\nExcept for building survival builds. And every other build. Yeah, good job Trendy, you ♥♥♥♥ed us over on that one. Now the summoner is useless as a builder; he used to be able to just decimate from using these minion units, now he's just basically a wimpy downgrade to any class.\n\n= New system that involves the requirement to have played that map or unlocked it in order to play a server with it.\n\nNow the rant. Oh boy.:\n\n. . . Why did I think this game was good when I was playing it, is the question. I mean, I played it because it's DD and I can't afford every single DLC and content pack for the original. I hoped this was going to be the same or at least like it, but it turned out I'm not the only one upset that it's entirely different. Oh no, it turns out, everyone agrees. It's sad to see that 'Mixed' score on DDE, then look at DD1+DD2, and see 'Very Positive' on both. Just utterly sad; the people who remade DD were probably entirely different devs than the people who made it. Otherwise, the qaulity check is long overdue and Trendy needs to try to seriously reconsider the 'rebalanced' idea.\n\nIn a game about coop set in a rpg, is rebalancing things really needed? Furthermore, are tower defense games supposed to be neccesarily 'balanced'? Doesn't it take away the fun to survive onslaught after onslaught of orcs, goblins, and ogres with your friends as you both become stronger? Yes. Trendy, remove the balancing. If anything, we need to bring back the DD1 core experience back if we want this community to survive. It's a good game, don't get me wrong, but unless it's reverted to its golden days of DD1 in terms of experience, it's going to be dead like DRM games usually are.","May 4, 2015","false","21.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Seems like they are preparing for DD2 with this game, would be right if this was free, like DD2 will be. Or at least free for DD1 owners. I don't think milking your community is the right way of building steady bridges and trust.\n\nIt is a far better experience than DD1, but I just don't think charging for this is not right IMHO.","July 25, 2014","true","132.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","7"

This is simply an extension of that game and it has essentially been rebuilt from the ground up in a manner that could provide a better and more secure environment.\n\nOriginally Eternity did not release with single player mode enabled however this has been changed. They were appologetic about the decision and admitted that it was a mistake. Here's a part of that blog:\n\n"\nSingle player and private sessions now available\nBlog - July 22, 2014 - By Brad Logston, Senior Producer of the Dungeon Defenders Franchise\n\nHey Defenders. We have just enabled Single Player and Private Sessions to Dungeon Defenders Eternity tonight.\n\nTurning off Single Player/Private match in our initial release of Eternity was related to our fear that the server costs would be exponential, and cause us to lose significant money. We realize that jeopardizing the loyalty of fans far outweighs the risk of profit – and it was a mistake.\n"\n\n\nA I already own the original, I've only had to pay £4, which is nothing really. If you do not and pay the full amount then you're about to experience the best of a fantastic game with none of the issues that existed before (such as people hacking their characters to get hacked op stats and bad internet games hosted on other peoples machines). It's no longer an issue because the information is stored on dedicated servers (which they could not afford before due to being a new company)\n\nIf you read many of the negative comments they all seem to be displeased about things that have allready been resolved or things that are kind of inconsiquential.","August 2, 2014","true","0.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGamingChocobro/recommended/302270/","TheGamingChocobro","GamingChocobro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGamingChocobro/","502 products in account","Now. As a player of the original Dungeon Defenders, I looked forward to this. Now, unlike everyone else.. ranting and raving about how Crap this is. Let me start off with the good stuff.\n\n1: You don't have to pay to unlock all the characters. They are all there ready for you.\n\n2: The UI for your Character Sheet is much better. It allows you to easily swap over gear\n\n3: The bonus of your armour ACTUALLY changes when you put it on. For EG: I picked up a crown and I saw the crown on my charaters head.\n\n4: The abillity to create a character and name it without having to go out of the game and back to the menu to name it, colour it, and all that.\n\n5: The open tavern. Alot don't like the idea as Whining, Rude people, Noobs and such. The open tavern is a place where people can meet up, stuff like that instead of having a game on a menu to pick from. and not knowing who you might be playing with. At least with the open tavern, you can get a rough idea.\n\n6: The abillities. Nothing makes Dungeon Defenders like the placement of towers and useage of abillities. That is still all there, but with a little more. There are now ingame items which can be used to assist gameplay. Of course these can be bought from the tavernkeeper, or you can find them randomly drop from Goblins, Orcs, Dark Elves and the such or from chests.\n\n7: The Character Model. The Character sheet now has a model of your character. It allows for 360* rotation to view all angles of your character.\n\n8: Cross-Platform. Got a friend who is waiting for a new PC? Well why not buy them a copy of Dungeon Defenders Eternity on a different platform and let them play with you.\n\n9: Same classic music... it even sounds clearer\n\n10: The map selection is easier to traverse\n\n11: The portraits of the parents look better\n\n12: When dying, you have 6 colour slots instead of 3 making for more customization\n\n13: (Just Played Multiplayer) The drops are individual and so are the chests. no longer shared mana\n\nNow that I belive I have done all the Pros, its time for the cons.\n\n1: Lack of instant customization. Sure you can pick a skin to use on a hero, but to customize it more, you need to buy Dye from the tavern keep. Oh If you make a mistake, buy a bucket of white wash and start again with buying more dye.\n\n2: Limited Skins. Heroes have custom skins, but they are limited.\n\n3: One Server. From what I can tell, there is one server.\n\n4: The Cash Shop. Yep, the annoying Cash shop to get more stuff. Usually associated with Pay 2 Win games. Though in Dungeon Defenders Eternity, it is thankfully only for cosmetics.\n\n5: While an open tavern is good, It also does have its cons. With an open tavern, The abillity to move around is hard. The lack of space to find friends, or even preview your character are hindered.\n\n6: Online. Now, I know you might rage at this, saying online is a con? well, It is and it isnt. The con of the online is that if your not connected to the internet, you can't play.\n\n7: Currency. You no longer use Mana crystals. You use gold coins to buy stuff which you find randomly in chests and from enemy drops and buy sellling old gear. (Not to sure about after completing a wave or a map as my game wasn't completely downloaded when I stated to play)\n\n8: Wait time. You join a game wether its private or public and you have to wait.\n\n9: It doesn't use Steam UI for invites\n\n10: You can't customise your Crystal\n\n11: The Defence Units are shared among all players, including those playing summoner\n\nThere are more pros and cons, but as of this time of what I have played, This is all I can give. I am bound to do another Review after more playtime.\n\nNow, Some people might like the original Dungeon Defenders and hate this, or vice versa or like both. It doesn't matter as everyone is different. So I am not going to say YES buy this or NO don't buy this. I will let you decide if you want to buy it or not. I wouldn't based your decision on the reviews, but on videos on gameplay, demos or trying it at a friends place. But as a gamer and lover of Dungeon Defenders (note Dungeon Defenders was one of the first games I bought on steam when it first came out many years ago near christmas) I would recommend this if you want to just have fun without the worry of paying for more characters, maps, skins etc.","August 3, 2014","true","6.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Dungeon Defenders is an epic combination of Tower Defense and Hack-and-Slash RPG and there are no other games in this genre that even come close.  Sure, there's Sanctum, but its mechanics and defense building are so much less interesting, its weapons have less kick, there's fewer options, and oh yeah.  The enemies have 100% immunity armor.

DD1 was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours enjoying. I had hoped DDE would be an excuse to play through the same DD1 experience but I have found a few things that make the experience less than what I hoped.\n\nInitial ♥♥♥♥♥es:\n* I really dislike the forced armor aesthetic. I would have preferred they adopt a DOTA 2 model: have each of the pieces be for looks only and make them purchase-able and trade-able. Actual in-game, stat-bearing armor would be otherwise invisible. * Having to use Playverse means having separate achievements, friends lists, etc. I understand the reasoning behind this is to allow for cross-platform support but I would have liked it to be a little more transparent. The ideal scenario for me would be to use each platform (Steam, Game Center, etc) as its own directory. So, I would be addressed by non-Steam users as STEAM\tzodyaq. This would allow each platform's users to take advantage of their native functionality and not add a separate (and unnecessary) friends/achievement system. * The Steam download is just the 40mb launcher. As with my above point, I feel that this move is similar to being forced to install Games for Windows or Origin to play a game. I understand the reasoning behind this is, at least initially, to be able to push quicker updates.

I cannot, at this time, recommend this game to anyone but the most die-hard Dungeon Defenders fan who would be willing to use a beta-quality game and help them iron out the rough edges by reporting bugs and being patient. I'll likely re-assess at a later date.","July 27, 2014","false","16.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

To date, I have 295 hours put into the original Dungeon Defenders.  It's one of my favorite games, so much so that I purchased a 4 pack for my friends during 2013 winter sale.  I saw Dungeon Defenders Eternity - revamped with new missions, unlockable loot for DD2 and on sale for $5.99.  I didn't hesitate...a poor choice on my part.  The game is now server based so that you are streaming from Trendy - security from cheaters, understandable.  But at this point the game is pretty much early access at best.  Long queue times, laggy servers.  I tried to play today and couldn't stay in for more than 5 minutes until a "your session has timed out....etc" error popped up.  At this point, until they fix the bugs the game is unplayable.\n\nIt was $6, not a big deal to me.  I'd be more upset if I had shelled out the regular price of $19.99.  What really bothers me is if this is what is to come with DD2, I'm going to be really let down by Trendy.  Hopefully they can get their act together, fix the servers or completely rethink the way they have the "online only" play set up.","July 27, 2014","false","2.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I could run Dungeon Defenders fine (Lower settings) at about 30 fps. Dungeon defenders etternity both looks and runs better (At similar lower settings) so thats one worry down.\nThe changes to the game are mostly good. The game plays well and there is more loot than ever before. The multiplayer both sets up and plays better and each player has there own individual chests and loot pick ups (So no loot ninjaing. Although that was fun at times) which makes for a better multiplayer experience. The shared tavern is not a terrible addition as many claim, it is a little annoying fighting your way to the bar but its a small grumble. I don't like the new menu systems for items (Its very small sometimes even when displayed through my massive TV) and having all your costumes as items gets in the way. I like the new hatching and leveling up of pets and visibility of armor etc. Consumables seem a bit pointless but it might be I need to use them a bit more to get the point. But these points aside this IS the game you know and love in a new updated version for you to grind through. If you made a little 'whoop' when you saw this on steam but then changed your mind, change it back. Its all good. All the chracters costumes and levels you want plus extras and the new permadeath hardcore mode is awesome.\n\nPS Dont fear the microtransactions......so far its pointless not play to win.

Kill tons of enemies and bosses... and farm for even better loot to upgrade and destroy "The Old Ones" with. That said, the game has been changed around plenty enough to give a new feel to even the most veteran of defenders.\n\nAdded to Eternity are a plethora of new systems and tweaks that really give the game that fresh coat of paint it deserves. Eternity starts you off with all 12 of the games classes right off of the bat, as well as all of the maps from the core game, and the download packs(holiday maps aside) rolled into one. On top of that it starts you off with several costumes unlocked, with some being put behind achievement walls giving you something extra to work towards just as you had to with the first game. Aside from the characters and maps, TrendyENT added in a much welcomed dodge mechanic that allows you to jump out of harms way in an instant, so long as you have the energy for it. Both hero and monster damage has been reworked, the overall games balancing has been given some loving, and the overall display has been given a fresh look. The game also features new maps not seen in the core game or in any of it's downloadable packs, as well as a new looting and crafting system. Gone is the mana bank and coins have taken their place. Coins can be used to upgrade weapons, buy items/consumables that you can use in battle, and even to purchase colored dyes which can be used to recolor practically every inch of your character in numerous ways. The pet system was also given an overhaul, as you now collect pets by gathering eggs mid-battle and hatching them. You'll never know what pet species you'll get until it hatches!\n\nMy only real gripe with the game so far is it's launcher. The launcher itself is horrible... It can take quite a while to download a patch, or the core game resources, which most will find to be annoying. Aside from that the game feels, looks, and plays like Dungeon Defenders, but better. I've spent roughly 15 hours at this point actually playing the game, and it's a purchase I most certainly do not regret!!\n\nI highly recommend this game for anyone who enjoys Action RPGs, Loot grinding games(similar to diablo and borderlands), Tower Defense games, Co-op titles, and fantasy styled games. It's a lot of fun, and even more so when you play with friends. With plenty of maps, challenges, and classes (With more maps coming soon for free), there is always a ton to do in Etheria.\n\nHappy Defending, and see you in the Playverse!\n\n8.8/10","August 1, 2014","true","22.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

This game's base mechanics are so similar to the origional that it's extremely difficult for me to even think this was ported TO mobile. Besides, it seems you need gamepad attachments for your phone or something, so why even play it on a phone or anything if you're just gonna slap on some gamepad bits... This is a game that's available on mobile, but doesn't CATER to mobile. Stop calling it a "cheap port from mobile", because that's totally not what it is.\n\nAnyway, my friends and I were a bit skeptical at first because of all the horrible reviews here, but after we bought the game, well, you can see how we liked it from the eighty hours I've clocked in. It's a good game with a few balancing issues still, but they've shown alot of real effort towards balancing progression, stats, gear, and all that fun stuff. It's alot better than it was in DD1.\n\nWhy's everyone complaining about summoner? Him having his own personal DU pool was just absurd from a game design perspective. He's no longer OP and uses regular DU like everybody else. I mean sure, he can't attack, but that's kinda the reason his soldiers can move. RTS-em-up, yaknow?\n\nThey added amulets (which act as standalone spells) which are pretty nice. They even made new assets and everything for them, it's great. They also help give the player more power to do stuff and aid in balancing out the game. Sure, some have trolling potential, but just get together some friends and play yourselves then.\n\nPublic tavern/hub world. I was cool with it, it's not gonna kill me to holler at a few people for friks and giggles, and helps the tavern not be creepily empty like it was all the time in DD1.\n\nIf you liked DD1, you'll like this. Also, the "cash shop"? Just a bunch of emoticons as of the time of this review, they're not even worth buying and don't affect the game at all. Dunno if it'll be expanded upon, but right now nothin really freemium or microtransaction-y has happened.\n\nIt has always-online servers, and you can only play online. Don't get the complaints about this; this is how MMOs work. Yeah, this isn't an open-world MMO persay, but you could call it an MMO. Plus, when Trendy's servers DO bite the big one, they'll hopefully pass the torch to dedicated servers or something. If they don't, well, SOMEONE's gonna do something about it since this game is online-drivin (at the moment of this review). I don't think they'd just shut the game down and lose all the potential customers. Matchmaking for the game derps now and then, but even big companies have server problems, so should we REALLY bash an INDIE company over such a trivial issue?\n\nNo splitscreen yet, the game's being "developed" in a way, as in it's still receiving updates (which is something you should expect from an online MMO-esque game). Splitscreen was initially removed due to exploits involving it from what I've gathered.\n\nI keep calling it "MMO-esque" and the like because, while the public taverns are where you see the bulk of players, each actual game map supports 1-4 players, barring some huge maps which allow 1-6 players if I recall correctly. If you can't deal with trolls or the incompetence of the players in public servers, just get some friends and host private matches.\n\nContent is streamed in, instead of downloaded all at once. Honestly, I prefer it this way. It means I don't have to wait an hour for the game to download if I want to play right away. On the other side the content has to download when you get to it, but I'm cool with that. Core game mechanics are loaded right away, so you won't be bumbling around in a disjointed mess or anything.\n\nAgain, this game has a few balancing issues still, but givin the nature of everything I feel that most of them will be ironed out at some point. The game's still a hell of a lot of fun, and it'd be a shame not to give it a try. Don't listen to those clowns who only clocked in under an hour, or barely over an hour, of playtime. Listen to a real Dungeon Defender.\n\n...Besides, if you've owned DD1, discounts stack. I got this for six bucks. That's like, a happy meal at mcdonalds or something. It won't bite back, trust me.\n\n(Oh yeah, by the way, this game has all the relevant DLC of DD1 pre-installed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonnyTrump/recommended/302270/","JonnyTrump","JonnyTrump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonnyTrump/","225 products in account","I have spent, as of writing this review, about 1 hour in game. I have 6 hours on record, but about 3 of them were downloading, since the Steam download is essentially just the launcher.\n\nWhat were the other 2 hours? Well, in all honesty, I've spent 2 hours collectively trying to connect to their servers. I got a single map in today. While trying to return to the tavern, a familiar "you have been forcibly removed from the game" message appeared. I don't even know what that means, but I'm guessing it's a way of saying the connection timed out designed to make the player feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥. When somebody's forcibly removed, you imagine some obnoxious guy getting kicked out of a store or club by security, not somebody that's having issues connecting to a server. That aside, I haven't been able to connect to a game since today. It's been like this since I got it. I get to play a little, then I'm forcibly removed from the game. Of course, if this were like the original Dungeon Defenders, I could just play single player if I wanted and still play the game at least, but nope, not an option. Between that, the addition of microtransactions in a B2P game, and the inclusion of a second type of log-in after Steam make me kind of wish I could just get my money back and leave this mess behind, and hope that when DD2 comes out, they make some improvements on this system they have.\n\nAll the complaining out of the way, there are some really great things here. The addition of 4 slots for consumables like potions or, which I prefer, amulets, are an amazing addition. The amulets give you little magical abilities at the cost of mana, like AoE lightning, of a fireball, or healing. The consumables have a variety of effects, ranging from potions of mana that give you additional mana, to holy hand grenades which just deal explosive damage. Before my last forceful removal from the game, I'd picked up a couple of pet eggs, which made the removal even more painful. They were drops after completing a level, and apparently you hatch pets in this game by putting them in one of your 4 amulet/consumable slots and getting exp. That was exciting to me, and I couldn't wait to see what I got.\nAlso, to their credit and to defend the second log-in, they seem to have included TwitchTV streaming. Or, at least, I saw an option that had a sign-in for it and a "start stream" button. That's cool, now there might be a good number of DD streamers to help bolster the community.\n\nOverall, as the game is, it needs some work. Maybe buff the servers, or let there be an offline mode, even if it's completely separate from the online in terms of characters and loot and stuff.

In some ways DD Eternity is BETTER then the original game, it's not another Unreal Engine start up, it's on it's own dedicated engine..

I will list everything that is DECEPTIVE about the game below.\n\n1. There is NOTHING here to tell you that you MUST be ONLINE to play this, the original Dungeon Defenders let you play OFFLINE and LOCAL network.\n2. There is NOTHING here to tell you that your going to be STREAMING 99.99% of the ASSETS on the FLY, that's right you get a 40mb dl then you have to STREAM the rest of the game, this is MAJORLY wrong.\n3. This is meant to be a fully paid for game.. yet it has a 'Cosmetic' Cash Store in it.. Which it SHOULD NOT have at all.. if you pay for a game you pay for the game, not part of the game.\n4. Trendy Have been deceptive in how they handled the release, how they put up information, etc.. These guys have seriously LOST a lot of the respect the community had for them.. OVERNIGHT.\n\nTrendy Need to remember that not every one wants to be online while they play a game, there are a lot of defense personnel who game, who can NOT always be online, there are a lot of people in areas with POOR internet that can not always STREAM content, while you can understand the harder stance against Hacking and Cheating, Trendy have taken what people loved, the ability to CONTROL THEIR GAMING EXPERIANCE, and said you MUST PLAY OUR WAY ON OUR SERVERS or not at all.\n\nBad move Trendy...

If you want to play multiplayer, this game forces you to make 3 of your 4 party members go dps.  Otherwise multiple builders just step on eachother's toes.  Summoner in the old game was the only thing that eased up on this, allowing two builders and two dps for a 4player game.  Although I feel the summoner being pushed to DU was slightly warrented, as it made games where you did not have someone to fulfill the Summoner role difficult, however it returned us back to the origional issue of a "Tower Defense" with four players fighting for rights to build towers.\n\nI await the day they change this, as to change my review to a thumbs up.

All DLC's in a single go, with more features.  But sadly, when you buy this game you happily offer you to be a beta tester of their new idea of networking.   Ideas that are poorly trouth.  As a example, they have one hub, and all players have to use it, and this hub seems to have low capacity and to be off sometimes.\n\nThis turn something that could be a good introduction to the game, into something that is probably better to avoid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aeralis/recommended/302270/","aeralis","Aeralis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aeralis/","87 products in account","To put it simply, this is a disgusting mess.\n\nTo be fair, all the new stuff is great. The new gear system, the modified progression, the consolidation and simplifying of all the DLC... all of that is really nice. The problem is the unholy layer of oily grime and garbage it's all buried underneath.\n\nThe UI is beyond clunky. It actually feels like it's even working against the player at times. Doing even the simplest of tasks requires navigating menu upon menu, where the original game has everything right there waiting for you. And it's all just so slow.\n\nThe new tavern system is atrocious. Gone forever are the charming personal taverns, decorated with trophies and awards. But the really important part is how you are now forced into a crowded, public tavern. It lags, it's loud, and all the while the chat is popping up over your menus you're trying to navigate. Be prepared to inspect multiple players instead of opening the forge or shop because the tavern is so overcrowded. What used to be a place of relaxation between missions is now just as chaotic as the missions themselves.\n\nEven the tavern itself is a mess: The Tavernkeep is still behind the counter for all your shopping needs... but the new crafting guy is on the balcony above him. This places every single useful aspect of the tavern as far away from each other as possible, leaving you to run around all over the place when all you want to do is get set up for the next mission. Also, for some reason some of the practice dummies have been removed. Want to test your new weapon? Well get in line, because so do the other dozen people in your tavern!\n\nCustomization seems to be a mixed bag. Your character wears their gear now, which is neat, and you can even dye it with a wide selection of colors. (This is extra fun with the Jester/Fool, who like to just kinda slap the gear onto their bodies wherever they'd like.) However, you can no longer customize your crystal or your character's base colors on creation. They gave some, but they also took some.\n\nOne of the big draws is the usable items, like the amulets. They're kinda neat, but really, I feel like they're unnecessary and just serve to dilute the diversity of the character classes a bit. Also, the pet eggs are weird. The game gives you a pet, but you must carry it in an item slot and watch it do nothing for a while until the game decides you may start using it. This is somehow considered fun and a positive addition to the game.\n\nSpeaking of "fun," there's also a crafting system. Maybe this is a personal opinion, but I've never seen the appeal to these things. They jsut seem to be this weird fad game mechanic that everyone puts into their games nowadays. I've never heard of anyone saying "Wow, a crafting system! I am so excited for that!" Honestly I don't see the draw of the game giving me a weapon, but telling me I can't use it until I collect an arbitrary number of useless doodads.\n\nFinally, there's the biggest elephant in the room... the always online system. This is another one of those cases where, if you want to play your game, you're at the mercy of the servers. No offline play at all here, not even for single player. (There isn't even a single player mode. You just have to make a private room and not invite anyone in. But you still have to deal with the public tavern.) And someday, when the servers die forever, so too does your access to this game. While on the other hand, the original game is all on your computer, meaning you'll always have it.\n\nSo, in short, this is a good... expansion? Remake? I don't even know what to call it. But whatever it is, it's good. It just needs a LOT of buffing and scrubbing before it's actually servicable. I'd STRONGLY recommend just playing the original version. The updates here are nice, but ultimately not worth the tradeoffs.

Trendy basically lied about it having single player on it's list of features on the steam page, then decided to remove it after it went on sale. Even though they've fixed some of the problems them trying to play disaster control is no way to run game development. It made 3/4 of the playerbase ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at them and put off a majority of potential customers. I enjoy the game but it's essentially just the first with addons, it would have been different if major content was introduced but it just feels like major patches added in.\n\nThe only thing you get when you buy it is the client, not the full game download. So eventually if their serves die your left with nothing to show for it. They single handedly probably killed a majority of the hype for dungeon defenders 2 by trying to milk the original game this way. So be warned their likely to screw up anything else they develop in the future.","July 26, 2014","false","11.8"," 15 of 28 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","15","28","0","0"

No split screen. Stay away.\nDon't get me wrong, if this was simply a bundle of the Dungeon Defenders series, it would be well more than worth it...but ALWAYS ONLINE. And many other bad changes.\nOkay, maybe you live in the mystical wonderland of internet where you get more than 1 provider, and one of them is actually reliable, so what's this new version all about?\n\nSlightly revised UI. I actually really dislike the fact that when you hit the inventory button, only a tiny bit of the screen is used to show the stats of the character, and you have to go through more than 1 window to look at your gear. The item box thing is a good bit more clunky, as you now have to choose your hero from there instead of when you're loading in, so, quite unneccesary.\nSupposedly more secure online play. I can't attest for or against this.\n4 more maps. Yeah, I got through one of the new maps before I got fed up with the horrible load times. Pretty on par with current maps.\nDid I mention there's no split screen? You can't play with friends unless they buy their own computer and this game. Kinda annoying, especially when the previous version had it in.\n\nBUGS. By god. So many bugs. Can't even log in half the time because of them. (and that's not an exaggeration, literally every other time I tried I got kicked out because of something like "AsAdmin doesn't like you" or some nonsense like that, even occasionally crashing) And when I do log in and queue for a game (no single player, wtf?) And in those precious few moments I am actually in the game, I am often stuck in the loading screen for 10-15 minutes, by which point I restart the game. I honestly don't know if it was the game or my connection, but...always online ftw.\nMy computer far exceeds minimum requirements for this game, so not a problem with my hardware.\n\nOh, and because of the communal tavern that everyone goes to, whenever someone logs in, it lags your connection, and for some reason, if you're comparing items, the stat screen goes away...and it will do that each and every time someone logs in, or gets out from a game...better be quick with those comparisons.\nAlso, other players are a pain because they block your movement, crowd you out of the item box, and will attack the training dummies you are using to compare actual dps for your weapons.\n\nOn the plus side: they made it so that you collect coins instead of mana to buy/upgrade items. I also kinda like the idea of the blueprints...but I only had 2 drop and they weren't that great, certainly not compared to what drops regularly\nHowever, you can't buy items now for some reason, and some characters really can't solo if they don't have good items, so better hope your drops are better than mine when I tried and play the barbarian\nEvery person also spawns their own chests and items. This is relatively good. You don't have ninjas, or mana hogs. I thought at first this just makes it incredibly easy the more you have, but the numbers seem to scale up with the more people you have.\nI like the item seperation, don't know about the mana...it's convenient I guess.","July 24, 2014","false","9.9"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","0"

I bought it because I figgured "hey, for how much I played the original, I could get $6 worth out of it". I was wrong.\n\nOne of the features listed is cross platform play. One of those platforms is Android. Basically this means you are playing an awkward phone version of Dungeon Defenders on your PC. The graphics took a noticable downgrade and everything feels a lot slower paced and clunkier. Not to mention the new interface manages to be even more awakward and unhelpful - I don't think I can see what a pet does without first equipping it and swapping into an entierly different menu.\n\nIt's a shame too, because some of the new features ARE pretty interesting looking. Pets now have both passive and active abilities, and you can get amulets to give characters new active skills as well. But the overall performance hit, coupled up with being forced to play online in multiplayer (No solo play here. At all.) really ruins it.\n\nSecond Edit : They patched in being able to host private games and play solo, but when you do you still seem to have to "wait for other players" for about half a minute before you can start the stage. The Tavern is still public though. They also let you download everything up front - and I did. Now I can say for sure that the graphics took a hit, they can't still be streaming in at this point.\n\nFor a comparison, this is the original game : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=291059560\nAnd this is DDE : http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=291059468\n\nBetween the worse visuals and the slightly less responsive gameplay, I'd sooner recommend playing the original than I would recommend DDE.","July 22, 2014","false","3.5"," 18 of 34 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","18","34","0","0"

Yes, it is the original game rehashed, but that was made clear prior to release.  Yes, it has new features, but more or less it plays like the original.  As an owner of the base games of both, this is the one that I prefer.\n\nGraphics 7/10 - They choose a slightly different style for DDE and I personally liked the style of the original better.  The graphics don't seem as clear and crisp as the original.  They even have a warning about streaming textures....why can't I opt to download these?\n\nSound 10/10 - This game has some ridiculously addictive music.  I've caught myself humming along with bits of it.  A family member who played it breifly said the same thing.  Some sound effects could use a little more oomph but that's about the only downside I could say.\n\nGameplay 8/10 - I'd love to give this game a 10/10 here if not for one fact.  Load times.  Load times drag down the overall experience even when playing in a private lobby.  On the plus side, this game is FAR more accessable that it's predecesssor for finding gear for your characters.  Having the option of which stats that the game is comparing is a big deal for newbies especially.  The massive amounts of mana available on each map means your resources are not the limiting factor, it's more focused on your strategy.\n\nDeveloper Support 10/10 - Let's face it folks, this is the game they are supporting more at this date and time.  DDE has gotten a lot of bad reviews and most of the constructive criticisms have been addressed.  It has gone from what felt like a beta release to a full release over the last few months.  Their continued support and patches will make this into an even better title.\n\n","September 20, 2014","true","49.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppickeri/recommended/302270/","ppickeri","ppickeri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ppickeri/","176 products in account","Considering the popularity and quality of the first edition of Dungeon Defenders, I was surprised by the overwhelming number of negative reviews for what I'll call the *upgraded* Eternity edition. I should start by saying that my experience with the original was only about 2 hours playing the demo on Xbox 360. I was impressed but never got around to purchasing it. So I'm basically brand new to the franchise.\n\nMy friends and I have been playing some Sacntum 2 recently (and loving it), so we decided to give DD Eternity a shot. We almost didn't purchase Eternity due to the large number of negative reviews, but after canvasing the complaints most of them could be categorized as follows:\n\n1) The UI is totally unintuitive (some say broken)\n2) There aren't enough new features added over the original to really consider this a new version\n3) It's online all the time\n4) No single player or private modes\n\nLet me address each of these:\n\n1) The UI is totally unintuitive - Yah this isn't the greatest UI in the world, but it does actually work. It just takes some getting used to. But it definitely isn't broken, just suffers a bit from poor design. I wouldn't make your buying decision on this characteristic alone.\n\n2) Not enough new features - I'm a totally new player to the franchise, so I can't speak to the evolution from the original to Eternity. But I can give my opinion on how I think the new version plays: It's fun as hell! There are quite a few classes to choose from each with their own flavor of play, tons and tons and tons of items, a variety of ways to build your characters, and the combat is smooth and easy to get used to after a few matches.\n\n3) It's online all the time - This is true. It really boils down to personal preference. You don't have to interact with any other players, you'll just see them in the Tavern (Dungeon Defenders equivalent of a Lobby). I'm not in the habit of playing with strangers, but the online only component doesn't really bother me. They have their own online platform they are developing called Playverse which is a bit convoluted when you are trying to get a group with your friends, but it still works. We've gotten used to other platforms where you essentially invite a friend with a single click, or accept an invitation with a single click. Playverse makes you have to do like three clicks the first time to accept a friend invite, after which the invites work much easier.\n\n4) No single player or private modes - So this game came out about a month or so ago as of this writing. I have  a feeling that the game may have launched without single player/private modes, but has since been patched to allow it. Here's the bottom line: you can absolutely play single player or private mode with up to 4 of your friends. If it's just two of you in a private match it's totally fine - you won't get any strangers added to your game. I've played several matches solo and won handily, so the difficulty must scale with more players.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend this game. It has a few rough edges, but these are things that can easily be improved with some patches going forward. The game is not broken as others are claiming. It plays beautifully and is a lot of fun to play either by yourself or with friends. After playing for a few hours now I felt obligated to come and write a positive review to offset the huge number of negative reviews.","August 30, 2014","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I owned Dungeon Defenders on Xbox, but never got the dlc seeing as the PC version looked a lot better. However, I didn't really ever have money I felt was worth putting towards getting it with all the DLC. This provides a really nice way to get all that at a cheaper price. The only major downsides are that it's online only (for this type of game, I'd really prefer the choice to go online or not), and that it's horribly lacking in explanation for new players. I already had an idea of what things were coming in, so it didn't affect me too much, but it was still annoying trying to refresh my memory on what the stat pictures were. Also, I actully liked the old system where mana was money. It was cool balancing greed and need.\n\nNOTES TO DEVELOPERS SHOULD THEY SEE:\n-Please for the love of god fix the issue where your cursor goes away on a menu page when someone walks behind it. When I'm comparing stats, I don't need the popup to disappear every 4 seconds.\n-GIVE ME MORE MANA FROM CHESTS IN SOLO. I understand you wanted to balance it around teams, since everyone gets their own chests. But 100 mana isn't enough for crap by yourself, making it neccessary to have a hero that can fight the waves, even if you want to build a pure tower character and watch the fight instead.\n\nEDIT:\n-They fixed the issue with the menus going away. This is fantastic. Thank you!\n-They give more mana when there are fewer players on the map now.

There are certainly differences, and once you have got used to them the system actually works very well. Trendy have listened to all of the complaints and have made efforts to address them.

We have two accounts at my house and have been playing two person games. Overall we are enjoying it very much but there is a lot of confusion. Some things that should be simple take an internet search to figure out. Because the game is new, there is not a lot of information on the internet. Simple things like inviting friends, creating a party, and hatching eggs are just different enough to cause problems. My biggest issue is initial load time. One computer may be ready to play almost immediately while the other wants to reload a lot of graphic files. So far it seems almost random one whether a computer want to reload graphic files. We have learned to start the game, then go gather our drinks and snacks while the graphics load, then come back to play the game. With a weekend of play we only had one instance where a party member was dropped as the dungeon was loading. No time warps as far as we can tell.\n\nOver all we had a lot of fun with the updated version of a favorite game. Everyone gets their own chests so building is faster and much more even. Experience is divided evenly among characters. No more worrying about the knight and mage towers giving most of the experience to those characters. I do wish that the inventory system was easier to use. There is still a lot of junk items to go through and sell. I need to experiment with the item filters in the Options menu and see if I can filter out the items without losing the income I get from selling them.","August 4, 2014","true","203.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Dungeon Defenders Eternity is a very basic game, I prefer the older version of the game in a sence of the fact you are able to buy items within the shop such as pets etc, Dungeon Defenders Eternity has a very long way to go before it starts gaining much more positive reviews on it, such as Singleplayer, Unlockable maps (Via level etc) and loads of other different features to make the game more positive and enjoyable! Ive played this game alot on Xbox 360 (Original Game) and although ive only played 4 hours of this version i defo think it can be improved alot, maps, leveling, items etc could all be better. I hope the creators take into count that the game seems much better with the original features, impliment some of them and add single player so u can unlock new maps and bonus maps and get legendary items etc maybe alot more people will like it!\n\non the positive side of things, i would recomend this game because although it needs alot of work it is enjoyable to play, the fact u can switch between 1st and 3rd person camera and u have personal loot is a brilliant idea! i would rate this game 6/10 because as i said earlyer it still needs alot of work to become a much more positive game!","September 9, 2014","true","4.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

This also means most new players will likely go for the DDE over DD1 (dungeon defenders eternity/one). New levels have been made and more to come, including one in the campaign (so far, I have not made it too far as I have been enjoying the social aspect, and testing out the classes), pets now come from eggs that hatch simply by having them on your person and you never know what you will get.\n\nAlso, gear now appears on your person in a physical way which is fun, especially when you get the full set of something. Mana is no longer the currency, coins are, which drop from creatures just like mana, and are used to upgrade your items. However you can no longer buy weapons or pets from the barkeep (as of yet). There IS an ingame cash shop, but the only thing in it is emotes for your characters at a dollar each. Dyes are also available now with the barkeep, as well as a new crafting system.\n\nFor crafting, recipes drop from mobs, and materials seem to only drop from chests (though I could easily be wrong, i tend to get caught up in the action). You can choose to join your own private tavern, or a public one with other people milling about. There are even more new features that I could mention but I am sure you could find more complete lists out there.\n\nIN CONCLUSION:\n\nI find this game to be quite a bit more fun than the original right now given it is easier to join people of my own level, there is more details on the games I am joining, I can host private if I really want to and only invite my own friends, and it has stopped me being booted out for not having that one awesome piece of gear or whatever other reason people saw fit.\n\nThe only downside I saw, no offline play, which I do hope comes later, but I understand why not if it doesn't.","September 27, 2014","true","17.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I have 100s of hours into the original DD and all of the DLC.  DD is one of my favorite Co-Op games.\n\nPROS:  DD Eternity is a nice refresh of the original.  I felt it had enough new stuff to offer to feel like a fairly fresh experience.  It's still the same game for the most part, but has a bit of a facelift.  There are a few new boards, tons of new gear, more gear sets, and special items that boost loot quality, stats and other things.  There is also a lot of new character cusomization.  I really like that all of the characters no longer look identical.  The biggest pro is they are continuing to update and add to the game, giving you more to look forward to.  Also, the issue with taverns not being private is fixed.\n\nCONS:  IT's the same game. If you are looking for an ALL new experience, you won't get that here.  The game is very Internet-reliant.  if you have a poor connection, you will have issues.  The updates take a long time to download and apply.  The balance is a smidge off (The first few waves are easy, then oh-my-gosh!)   I'm not crazy about the Playverse interface, I much prefer Steam (though they are adding some Steam integration)  Most of the issues I have are minor quibbles.\n\nIf you enjoyed DD and haven't played in awhile, you will enjoy this game.","September 23, 2014","true","83.5"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

Also, whilst the new UI looks nicer in places, in others it looks unfinished, and in general seems to be less intuitive (e.g. info text whilst building only appears after 0.5 of hovering, not instantly)\n\nI like the idea of trying out new improvements on the old version of the game, to see which features are well received so they can be added to DD2, but with the amount lost in the transition, this is worth no more than a free beta to owners of the original DD. Really, this is an unfinished package, that should only be released as early access in its current state, but with DD2 in public testing, this wouldn't make any sense either.","July 22, 2014","false","2.5"," 24 of 47 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","24","47","0","0"

It is an action RPG tower defense game like the original that has the same char. with diff. abilities and balancing. Many of the mechanics and much of the gameplay style is changed for the sake of making the game play like what I'm assuming dd2 will be like instead of staying with the tried and true of what DD did right and fixing issues and refining what worked there. It is saved server side so it requires a constant internet connection as well and suffers from lag routinely due to this fact.

Yes.\nThis remake/redo/whatever did improve and balance the gameplay, which was definitely needed. That is one major positive.\n\nHowever, it threw away so many of the basic elements that made the original a great game. I am unable to stay in the same lobby with my friends between matches, instead it boots them to some random server. The original had it great, keeping us all in the same place, instead of making me reinvite and reconnect every time we start or fail a map/tavern.\nBy the same token, because the servers are now externally hosted (I understand - helps control hacking), my ping is so much higher. This isn't such a bad issue when there are not too many monsters, but later on, it is a real pain.\nThe microtransactions, well I don't really care too much about them: they're mainly just for taunts, which are not needed.\nHowever the shop is so much less intuitive and instead of making everything easier, it became much the opposite. It tried to improve on sorting, which is good, but it still fails to have a filter for a certain type of armor. Considering you get set bonuses, it would be better to have this.\nAlso you don't get the bonuses from two weapons, instead everytime you swap your weapons, your towers get the current weapon's stats. This is fine for balance, except everytime I press "z" to swap weapons, my towers are half damaged. It would be easier just to have the one weapon so I can easily replace it when I get better ones, or have an option to have 1 or 2.\n\nYeah, just my rant.\n\nTL;DR : Gameplay - Good,  Everything else - Kinda disappointing.","September 16, 2014","false","18.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The fact that they're there leads me to believe that this game is set to go F2P in the future - after they've made as much as they can off sales.  I refuse to play this game until the cash shop has been removed.\n\nI was one of the silly people to buy this game when it was first released, belieiving that it was a finished product instead of the Early Access title that it really is.  When I was told of the microtransaction shop right after i bought it and all the severe game-breaking bugs in it, i was furious.\n\nLittle or no response was given by the devs other than this being a test bench for Dungeon Defenders 2 (which I've been told it will be a F2P game) - yet all the information I've found on the next Nom Nom/Trendy game to come out has led me to a non-Dungeon Defenders game that looks like it's graphically and engine-wise identical.  It's a game called Monster Madness.\n\nI honestly feel I've been scammed.\n\nIf you too feel this game should have been labeled and had and EARLY ACCESS warning to it, you should write Steam Support and ask for a refund.

It was frustrating at times, but rewarding I feel when everything went as planned. Now we come to this. I read on the store page that it's somehow better and balanced and stuff. I'm like...sure, the game had a few things here and there that could have been taken care of. So might as well take it and give it a go.\n\nWeeeeeellllllp, even with the discount that was I managed to get it, it's still a very dissapointing experience.\n\nThe graphics are better I admit, they look pretty awesome too. The item mods that appear on you are a nice addition too and you can color them with dyes as well, which is even more awesome.\n\nAaand that would conclude my pro's for it. The neutral stuff, is well it's just the same deal, which isn't really bad in my opninion but take it as you may in the end, as everyone has their own feelings about that.\n\nAnd the cons? well, there are quite a few in my case.\n1. Look I understand a downloader and installer on the same launcher that does both things at the same time. Though, pray tell me why dit it feel like warming up my proccessor during that, I have no problems with heating when steam downloads other games.\n\n2. FFS can you all just take some time to add some more ♥♥♥♥ing video options? The classic DD had ♥♥♥♥ for options ingame, and just a few basic things in it's launcher. I personally dont own a high end machine, and being able to remove certain "details" would improve my performance. And dont get me started on the "OOOH BUT IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE"....Look the last thing I care about when building ♥♥♥♥ and fighting crap is how nice and surreal the shading looks okay? and in my case it's just taxing my CPU and such.\n\n3. WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥? The first time you enter you are placed in a tavern full of random players, faaar away from the feel of the nice and cozy private one you had in the last game. Figuring out how to do stuff is just a chore and there's no tutorials that I could find ingame to explain ♥♥♥♥ to me as some things are different than the last game. Also can you ♥♥♥♥ing clean up the ingame store? I nearly bought stuff for real cash, it's ♥♥♥♥ing confusing, and like someone else said, somehow it's even more of a mess than the old inventory/box/shop thing.\n\n4. Is this a game coded for mobile platforms and ported to PC? It barely feels optimized, I cranked everything as low as I could, and you'd think that that would give a dual core CPU at 3Ghz, 4Gb RAM and a AMD SApphire HD7770 a chance to at least sport some nice FPS if it can't handle the awesome graphics. Again, please please please let me have more freedom with options. They never killed anyone, and devs seem to think that there's no people that like to fiddle with the options to get the best graphic/performance ratio on even a more weaker machines anymore.\n\nAll in all, it does have it's pros but in my case I have just too many bones to pick with this game, right from the very first thing you see. That being the downloader/installer/launcher. if I were to grade it compared to the first? It feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone of it, and that's impresively bad since it comes from the same devs I belive.\n\nTLDR: If you want the old DD experience but you felt it just wasn't confusing enough, then by all means drop 20Euros on it in a heartbeat.","August 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It was frustrating at times, but rewarding I feel when everything went as planned. Now we come to this. I read on the store page that it's somehow better and balanced and stuff. I'm like...sure, the game had a few things here and there that could have been taken care of. So might as well take it and give it a go.\n\nWeeeeeellllllp, even with the discount that was I managed to get it, it's still a very dissapointing experience.\n\nThe graphics are better I admit, they look pretty awesome too. The item mods that appear on you are a nice addition too and you can color them with dyes as well, which is even more awesome.\n\nAaand that would conclude my pro's for it. The neutral stuff, is well it's just the same deal, which isn't really bad in my opninion but take it as you may in the end, as everyone has their own feelings about that.\n\nAnd the cons? well, there are quite a few in my case.\n1. Look I understand a downloader and installer on the same launcher that does both things at the same time. Though, pray tell me why dit it feel like warming up my proccessor during that, I have no problems with heating when steam downloads other games.\n\n2. FFS can you all just take some time to add some more ♥♥♥♥ing video options? The classic DD had ♥♥♥♥ for options ingame, and just a few basic things in it's launcher. I personally dont own a high end machine, and being able to remove certain "details" would improve my performance. And dont get me started on the "OOOH BUT IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE"....Look the last thing I care about when building ♥♥♥♥ and fighting crap is how nice and surreal the shading looks okay? and in my case it's just taxing my CPU and such.\n\n3. WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥? The first time you enter you are placed in a tavern full of random players, faaar away from the feel of the nice and cozy private one you had in the last game. Figuring out how to do stuff is just a chore and there's no tutorials that I could find ingame to explain ♥♥♥♥ to me as some things are different than the last game. Also can you ♥♥♥♥ing clean up the ingame store? I nearly bought stuff for real cash, it's ♥♥♥♥ing confusing, and like someone else said, somehow it's even more of a mess than the old inventory/box/shop thing.\n\n4. Is this a game coded for mobile platforms and ported to PC? It barely feels optimized, I cranked everything as low as I could, and you'd think that that would give a dual core CPU at 3Ghz, 4Gb RAM and a AMD SApphire HD7770 a chance to at least sport some nice FPS if it can't handle the awesome graphics. Again, please please please let me have more freedom with options. They never killed anyone, and devs seem to think that there's no people that like to fiddle with the options to get the best graphic/performance ratio on even a more weaker machines anymore.\n\nAll in all, it does have it's pros but in my case I have just too many bones to pick with this game, right from the very first thing you see. That being the downloader/installer/launcher. if I were to grade it compared to the first? It feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone of it, and that's impresively bad since it comes from the same devs I belive.\n\nTLDR: If you want the old DD experience but you felt it just wasn't confusing enough, then by all means drop 20Euros on it in a heartbeat.","August 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Trendy.. you need to fire your UX and UI designers immediately. Even for a touchscreen interface it sucks, and it should have been ripped out for the PC version entirely. The icons are awful, the layout is clumsy and the overcrowding is just typical of terrible, terrible modern tablet based shovelware.\n\nThere are definitely positives but gutting the local games in favour of heavily laden DRM based, nickle and diming microtransactions really, really turns me off continuing to play it and hoping it might get better.\n\nThe worst part is no local co-op, the only reason my wife got into Dungeon Defenders in the first place...\n\n... oh but you could buy two copies of the game and play on two screens!?!\n\nYeah, and I could also put a rusty nail through my scrotum too!","August 3, 2014","false","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Original 35 hours. This one I've clocked almost 24 hours on already and have had it for a few days only. It was also nice getting all the DLC for 5 bucks, as I didn't have it previously. The only thing that is really a concern right now is latency, which has been $#!+ for me the past day. Before I was playing fine but I can't play at all today, which is something that will probably be fixed (tons of people are lagging from what I've been reading). I don't understand all the hate coming from the community myself. It almost seems like they hate it just for existing, because... Reasons which got patched in a day to a week from release? They changed and rebalanced the game. Appearently the original had hacked items everywhere as well due to everything being kept locally. I really don't see any reason to hate the game so much.\n\nBottom line, there are Pros and Cons to the game. It came out a week ago running on new software they made, and they aren't a huge studio. I expect them to continue improving and putting more content into it.

However, this "new" game does help. If you have played DD1 before, all Eternity will do is leave a sour taste in your mouth.\n\nYou don't have your own tavern, you have to click Play a few times before it will get you into the game, and then when you are in, you have to queue up to be able to play a map... they removed King's Game (my favorite map :( ), you can get kicked (Login session expired, srsly?), which can happen when you are on the second to last wave of a map. Party checks that require you wait 30 seconds before starting a game, the list goes on... I'm sure they'll improve it, as it is new as of July 22nd, but my suggestion is to wait.\n\nAs you can see, I've played five hours, and got kicked twice.

Let me summarize why:\n\n- intensive serverside lag issues to a degree that the server makes enemies do impossible moves, eventually causing you to loose matches.\n- So called balancing. Way to much of the abilities and defense units have are subpar towards the enemies. The few exceptions get nerfed so instead of a Tower/RPG hybrid they changed this game into a FPS clone.\n- Mistakes they made in the previous installment made again. In the previous game some loot was to powerfull so they made it far more difficult to obtain. Causing new players to never achieve the levels the first players got into. In this game they admitted some loot dropped that shouldn't have. They stopped the loot from appear and nerfed peoples loot to a degree that should have dropped with a boss who shouldn't be defeatable (people used a glitch to kill him cheap). But this gear still had stats you would find 1 in million in current drops. Now they added a new difficulty with monsters finetuned to those stats on gear. So people who played legitly have no chance of winning this causing another gap between players. It also confirms in this game only cheating gets you further in the game.\n- Very bad menu's. In the more difficult levels even one second not paying attention could cause you to loose the game. But any action in the menu's takes at least 5 seconds to animate. We don't live in the later 80's anymore where 256 colorsreens were high tech on a 286 model. Get your junk together and show me computers can calculate faster then humans can.\n- Poor fixing in "forgotten" content and disriminating people because of it: Some special gun gifted to you when you bought the game wasn't available in the first weeks. They fixed it so who buys the game now does get it. The only way for the players who bought the game earlier to get this gun is to create an account on their forums and PM the community managar there and hope he posts you a code to get the gun in game. No news post IN the game mentions this so any player who isn't active on the forum doesn't know about this and doesn't get the gun he should have gotten in the first place. If it was forum visiters only I'm ok with it but as newer players do get it now without touching the forums ever. It's downright discriminative.\n- Bad community. Those cheaters with their over the top gear are whining the game is to easy. And it seems the developers are listening to them.\n\nSo after seein al that I can only see the game going down the never ending spiral of not letting any new player enjoy their game. as the excisting community is rotten I don't want to touch this piece of #### ever again. Can't wait for Dungeon Defenders 2 so I can give it negative points as well.

It is an action RPG tower defense game like the original that has the same char. with diff. abilities and balancing. Many of the mechanics and much of the gameplay style is changed for the sake of making the game play like what I'm assuming dd2 will be like instead of staying with the tried and true of what DD did right and fixing issues and refining what worked there. It is saved server side so it requires a constant internet connection as well and suffers from lag routinely due to this fact.

Yes.\nThis remake/redo/whatever did improve and balance the gameplay, which was definitely needed. That is one major positive.\n\nHowever, it threw away so many of the basic elements that made the original a great game. I am unable to stay in the same lobby with my friends between matches, instead it boots them to some random server. The original had it great, keeping us all in the same place, instead of making me reinvite and reconnect every time we start or fail a map/tavern.\nBy the same token, because the servers are now externally hosted (I understand - helps control hacking), my ping is so much higher. This isn't such a bad issue when there are not too many monsters, but later on, it is a real pain.\nThe microtransactions, well I don't really care too much about them: they're mainly just for taunts, which are not needed.\nHowever the shop is so much less intuitive and instead of making everything easier, it became much the opposite. It tried to improve on sorting, which is good, but it still fails to have a filter for a certain type of armor. Considering you get set bonuses, it would be better to have this.\nAlso you don't get the bonuses from two weapons, instead everytime you swap your weapons, your towers get the current weapon's stats. This is fine for balance, except everytime I press "z" to swap weapons, my towers are half damaged. It would be easier just to have the one weapon so I can easily replace it when I get better ones, or have an option to have 1 or 2.\n\nYeah, just my rant.\n\nTL;DR : Gameplay - Good,  Everything else - Kinda disappointing.","September 16, 2014","false","18.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It was frustrating at times, but rewarding I feel when everything went as planned. Now we come to this. I read on the store page that it's somehow better and balanced and stuff. I'm like...sure, the game had a few things here and there that could have been taken care of. So might as well take it and give it a go.\n\nWeeeeeellllllp, even with the discount that was I managed to get it, it's still a very dissapointing experience.\n\nThe graphics are better I admit, they look pretty awesome too. The item mods that appear on you are a nice addition too and you can color them with dyes as well, which is even more awesome.\n\nAaand that would conclude my pro's for it. The neutral stuff, is well it's just the same deal, which isn't really bad in my opninion but take it as you may in the end, as everyone has their own feelings about that.\n\nAnd the cons? well, there are quite a few in my case.\n1. Look I understand a downloader and installer on the same launcher that does both things at the same time. Though, pray tell me why dit it feel like warming up my proccessor during that, I have no problems with heating when steam downloads other games.\n\n2. FFS can you all just take some time to add some more ♥♥♥♥ing video options? The classic DD had ♥♥♥♥ for options ingame, and just a few basic things in it's launcher. I personally dont own a high end machine, and being able to remove certain "details" would improve my performance. And dont get me started on the "OOOH BUT IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE EXPERIENCE"....Look the last thing I care about when building ♥♥♥♥ and fighting crap is how nice and surreal the shading looks okay? and in my case it's just taxing my CPU and such.\n\n3. WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥? The first time you enter you are placed in a tavern full of random players, faaar away from the feel of the nice and cozy private one you had in the last game. Figuring out how to do stuff is just a chore and there's no tutorials that I could find ingame to explain ♥♥♥♥ to me as some things are different than the last game. Also can you ♥♥♥♥ing clean up the ingame store? I nearly bought stuff for real cash, it's ♥♥♥♥ing confusing, and like someone else said, somehow it's even more of a mess than the old inventory/box/shop thing.\n\n4. Is this a game coded for mobile platforms and ported to PC? It barely feels optimized, I cranked everything as low as I could, and you'd think that that would give a dual core CPU at 3Ghz, 4Gb RAM and a AMD SApphire HD7770 a chance to at least sport some nice FPS if it can't handle the awesome graphics. Again, please please please let me have more freedom with options. They never killed anyone, and devs seem to think that there's no people that like to fiddle with the options to get the best graphic/performance ratio on even a more weaker machines anymore.\n\nAll in all, it does have it's pros but in my case I have just too many bones to pick with this game, right from the very first thing you see. That being the downloader/installer/launcher. if I were to grade it compared to the first? It feels like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clone of it, and that's impresively bad since it comes from the same devs I belive.\n\nTLDR: If you want the old DD experience but you felt it just wasn't confusing enough, then by all means drop 20Euros on it in a heartbeat.","August 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Can shout for party invites.\nItems now show! Stylists would love this feature.\nMore item slots!\nCoins and consumables! Amulets to help you.\nMystery eggs! Hatch them!\n\nCons:\nNightmare/Mixmode is not up.\nHardcore I heard is permadeath, may be fun for daredevils but I'm already having trouble finding gears.\nCan't open your own shop or decorate your own tavern.\nCan only see games opened by people in your tavern.\nCan't see people selling items.\nCan't switch characters in survival to level yourself.\nPlayverse gets confusing and seems pointless besides the party system. Should've just used steam to add buddies.\nAquanos has a glitchy area where the wyverns or flying eels circle around and not enter map.\nSummoners now are just "DPS pet" users, something that I feel a hunter should be having. A strong pet.\nSummoner's archers stay slow and weak, can't even pass easy mode deeper well solo when starting.\nNot sure how some people are doing 5mil dps already with 3 full level 60's geared up on first week, later to find out it's from Palantir insane boss fight while being lied to about survival.\nONE HUGE pet peeve is that, when you d/c from a private game. You can not rejoin it even if you are in the party with all 3.\n\nOver all it's fun but I'm hesitating to play because I can't find a nice game to join.

You click play and you're dumped into a tavern with 20 other people. WTF? Then I go look for a way to get my friends in. Eh... nope. Escape-menu? Nothing. After 20 minutes of Googling, I finally found that if either press F11 or go to a menu where you get a mouse cursor, and then click the icon in the top-right that looks like a ball of wool, you'll get a sidebar menu that looks worse than Games for Windows Live. Seriously, it's horrendous. But, this is the thing you have to use to add friends to your friends list (because you can't invite Steam friends straight into a game, like with Dungeon Defenders 1), and then you need to form a party using friends from your friends list. Only then can you start a game with your friends.\n\nThe gameplay so far has redeemed the poor user experience with the friends list. All classes from DD1 are there, though they have been altered a bit. The summoner no longer has its own unit count, but shares defense points with the rest. You can still equip two pets like before. Pets also grant you a special ability, which you can activate with the X key and which has a short recharge timer. There are a few more gear slots and item sets are now clearly indicated. There are consumables which give you more options while you play, such as regeneration amulets or taunt-totems.\n\nLoot is now assigned to each player, like in Diablo III. This is also the case for mana from treasure chests. So everything you see on the ground, you can pick up!\n\nThey introduced coins as a currency for in the shop and for upgrading items. I suppose this is to make a distinction between the stuff you use to build towers and what you use to enhance your characters. So far it feels right.\n\nTL;DR; Social features are messed up.

For some reason, Trendy decided that it would be a great idea to rip out and try to replace the (quite functional and pleasant to use) existing UI from DD1 and replace it with this mess. I had to look up the manual to create a hero, the one thing you have to do before even getting into the tavern! And once you're there, it just gets worse. You're in a tavern with a zillion random people, with no way to get into one with the friends you want to play with.\n\nThe old crystal customization is gone, and there's no way, as far as I can tell, to change your skin color, only hair and clothing. A few of the old seasonal and challenge missions didn't make it over, either.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend the original version, if you can get it on sale. It seems to have slightly better performance, and the features it has, like split-screen, are more interesting to me than what DDE has. If you like to play with randoms, though, DDE might be a better choice.","July 25, 2014","false","20.3"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

I refuse to play this game until the cash shop has been removed.\n\nI was one of the silly people to buy this game when it was first released, belieiving that it was a finished product instead of the Early Access title that it really is.  When I was told of the microtransaction shop right after i bought it and all the severe game-breaking bugs in it, i was furious.\n\nLittle or no response was given by the devs other than this being a test bench for Dungeon Defenders 2 (which I've been told it will be a F2P game) - yet all the information I've found on the next Nom Nom/Trendy game to come out has led me to a non-Dungeon Defenders game that looks like it's graphically and engine-wise identical.

I actually went all the way to have characters level 78 in the console version and managed to get the platinium trophy.\n\nYet this version has been a huge dissapointment, I really felt like I was being ripped off, the added content seems okay in the overall (I have a friend that has this game pc version, and there are many new cool features which are described on their website). Yet this game is SOOOOOOO BUGGGGYYYY. I have the mac version, I mean, I understand since most people are on PC then most of the support should go there... But if you'r going to release your game on a platform make it at least playable on that platform. This game is so laggy I feel I am living some kind of slow motion flashback... And i have a 2000€ mac that runs pretty much all I have ever tried, and a fiber optic internet connection.To resume my grinds with this game are:\n\n-Of course BUGs AND LAG for the mac version ( can't imagine the linux version; must be like playing in screenshots). I mean even the downloading tool crashed during download I had to re-run around 8-10 times... Mouse sensitivy cannot be adjusted directly so say good by to any decent fluidity...\n\n-Fake "offline mode", so far EVERY SINGLE TIME I have launched this game in "offline mode" the game just crashed systematically. This also happens sometimes normally when you are connected so i tried again and again... never worked...\n\n-I knew before buying this but I feel I should point out that half of the new heros are a fraud, they are just the same heroes as before but with different skins, actions skill, and a bit different stats, they are 4 copies of each of the original heroes, they have the same towers! For a tower defense game that was dissapointing The ther ones are different altough really not a revolution IMO.\n\nI would just say I did not enjoy playing this game, I rarely post negative reviews because usually my problems are that I don't like features in the game but I had never played a game this buggy. It feels like a game in early acces, and I played more stable early acces games... I really loved DD concept but here I feel I just wasted 20€.\n\nI don't recomend this game if you are a not a pc user.","May 10, 2015","false","8.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Played it too many hours. So I might say I know what I want from DD game.\n\nLet's keep this simple, DDE couldn't be done as an update to original game. There are too many changes. Most of all new online only. Old game was ridded by hackers. Financial side is awful. Mana was worth nothing in trading. Now with DDE, everything starts from beginning. Perhaps keeps hackers out for good.\n\nNow pros & cons:\n\nPros\n-New loot, more sets and cosmetic changes\n-Full wipe, game really needed it\n-New maps, haven't yet tried many, still.\n-Pet hatching\n-Control over hotkeys. So good system now, you can remap num keys for different characters way you need/like.\n-New survival system. I have just scratched surface, tried Deeper Well at medium difficulty, survived about 20 minutes with level 14 character.\n-I don't mind the new inventory. Make folders ;) I personally made folders for armor, weapons, pets etc. Inside armors I made folders Old School and New School where I put old armor and new ones.\n-Maybe even more stuff I haven't yet tried or discovered :P\n-Always online, no more hackers.\n\nCons\n-Always online. One thing that bugs me, we should get personal taverns. As I organise my inventory, almost everytime peep joins or leaves, dragged item drops.. And too much hazzle. Need some privacy :D\n-Possibility of downtimes on servers.\n-I'd like to have everything integrated at steam. Another account at Playverse.. Oh well, just have to live with it.\n\nI recommend this game upgrade for old and new players.

However there are some interesting aspects to it, the pet hatching for one, and if your into cosmetics then of course the whole new armor changing appearence and dye system is a great feature. Other then that it's pretty much what they described, Dungeon Defenders with some tweaks while you wait for DD2.\n\nAll in all, if your hardcore into dungeon defenders and spent billions of hours playing it, you might instinctively dislike this. But doesn't mean people should nerd rage all over it either just because you spent all that time, it has its merits for those who never really got into the first one for one reason or another, or just got tired of playing the original because of all the overpowered hacked and exploited characters.\n\nFinal verdict. Not what i was hoping for, but at least I dont feel like i wasted money. If you give it an honest try without pre-judging it, then it's playable and thats all you can expect from the devs so cut them some slack.","July 22, 2014","true","4.9"," 135 of 271 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","135","271","0","1"

I would recommend this game to anyone who doesn’t own the first one. The first question I asked when playing this game is it better than the original, I would say no it is not. They made some good improvements to the game but they left out of the things I liked about the old. The graphics are better and the game itself seems to run fairly smooth. I do like the fact that they made changes to the currency which a lot better than the mana crap from the first game. I'm still up in the air about the gear changes, while it’s nice to have my character appearance change with the gear, about 50% of the time gear looks really stupid when you have it all on. I wish they would just let me toggle the gear appearance on or off like other games instead of making buy items to make them invisible. I have never been a fan of having to connect online all the time to play a game. When it works it’s not a problem but I get a lot of random lag spikes in this game even when doing a private session, which I would never see in the first when hosting my own game. The whole time I play this game it makes me just want to go back and play the original, I want to like this game as much as the other one but just not as good. While this game does feel less slapped together as it did when it was released it still missing something, not sure what that is. Even with the problems I have with this game it still can be really fun, if you have never played the original this is a good game to get into the franchise.","October 25, 2014","true","10.1"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

If you're one of those that purchased the original and are curious to what an alpha version of DD2 is, then you can satisfy your curiosity at a cost of your fast food breakfast.  Even with the rushed out single player, there is still more work to be done.  Trendy was very shady with this release.\n\nThe game plays very much the same as its predecessor except no way to set up co-op between your friends outside of connecting to a public lobby to do so (as far as I am aware of this posting) which makes creating games that much more difficult.  If it is possible the current layout of the game is confusing and far from intuitive.  People that were used to controller play more than keyboard play will find themselves at a loss and trying to at least remap what they can do with their controller.  There's very little in the way of that support in this iteration which may perhaps be a sign for DD2.\n\nDisappointed that this isn't tagged alpha or early access.

Always-online DRM (seriously?) with their own overlay (Uh, hello? Steam? You know, that thing you're selling your game through?), no offline/LAN options whatsoever (there's "singleplayer" sure, but that's it), and literally unplayable without a constant internet connection.\n\nThere are also a few costumes inexplicably missing from the original, which I'm assuming will be patched in later. Too little, too late.\n\nIt's not even funny how much better the original version was just because of the fact that it did NOT have the always-online DRM/overlay... thing, proper singleplayer/LAN support (clicking "play" and being dropped into a lobby designed for 4 players with 20 other people in it is not my idea of "singleplayer", and if that's all I want to do, I should NEVER have to deal with that OR the online overlay/DRM thing). I can never stress this enough: Always-online DRM is NEVER a good thing. For anyone. The punchline? Pirates crack these games too. Some people even take it as a challenge, this one doesn't even really look particularly hard to crack, and coming from someone with zero programming knowledge that should say a lot.\n\nI think my last complaint would have to be that the original version pretty much had full support for everything this has to offer. They just decided to mislead their consumers to get more money on the way to the sequel. Wasn't the whole point of having offline saves and trendynet in the original that one would be secure? Well good job keeping that secure and showing support for it by just completely giving up and making an entirely new thing that might as well be Uplay or Origin. Granted, it's not THAT bad... Yet.\n\nThere ARE a select few positives I didn't quite explore: Equipment is (allegedly) visible on your character when equipped. There's something like six new maps. The dedicated servers are (allegedly) more secure than the old trendynet (would it have been so hard to let people make a local copy of their trendynet saves and force a restart on that one after implementing actual security measures?), though there's also supposedly some noticeable latency, so all things considered...

Now Dungeon Defenders Eternity came out, keeping in mind a lot of the issues that were in the original Dungeon Defenders.\n\nThey have largely smashed the hacker issue, due to server-side items. This requires an online connection, and I'm more than happy with that in return for limiting hackers.\n\nThey have have several notable changes to the class mechanics, some major, and some even controversial. In my view, the way to look at this is... this is not DD1. This is a familiar game, with a new perspective. Are the changes for the best? That's a matter of opinion. Personally, I find the changes refreshing.\n\nThey added on several new game mechanics, and fixed some annoying issues from DD1. Did they get every change right? Probably not. But overall, this is a new take on DD1 that I find a new great twist to a familiar game, and worth the one-time price tag for a still awesome game that now comes with much of the previous DLC content right along with the base game.\n\nIn the end, even with issues considered, I would certainly recommend this, what is in my opinion a wonderful game, to others.","December 10, 2014","true","151.7"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

It's not.\n\nThe bad:\n- Playverse is a laggy, randomly disconnecting mess\n- Client is unstable, crash to desktop is common\n- Upgrades on the ground immediately disappear before you can run over to pick them up thanks to a low items on ground cap.\n- Towers somehow got dumber from the original, big damage tower like Striker now shoots the weak goblin in the front of a pack instead of the super tough ogre in the middle.\n- 'Noone' plays this, thanks to all the other issues, see http://steamcharts.com/search/?q=Dungeon+Defenders for details.\n\nThe good:\n- Includes vast majority of the dlc available in the original for free.\n- Can be played in offline mode which gets rid of the lag but of course its rather lonely.","January 2, 2015","false","37.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

New levels, with all the best levels and campaign missions from the first one, tied together in perfect harmony.  Hackers are gone, kick-abuse is gone, which were the reasons that most people stopped playing the first game.  It's true that this support should have just been added to the original, and I'm not sure the reasons behind why it wasn't, but for the introductory price it was hard to say no.  Playverse isn't the best online platform support but neither was steam when it first came out, and I have faith Trendy will fix it up in no time.  Plus PV makes it super easy for friends to join in your game by prompting them to accept/decline games you're hosting and automatically placing you into the same party system you've used before.  It's like if XBOX live auto added you to party chat with your friends that were online and auto joined their games when you turned on your xbox, it's that easy.  For $6 (introductory price + DD owners discount) these improvements is a definite recommend.  I ended up buying a 2nd copy for the wife's account to play co-op.","August 8, 2014","true","26.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

However, the Linux client for the original Dungeon Defenders is full of bugs and Trendy seems to have no intention of fixing them.  Meanwhile, the Windows version, while exhibiting a bug or two, is far more stable and contains fewer obvious problems.  Since I read that this game was web based and Trendy advertises that it supported Linux right out of the gate, I figured that even if there were problems, all platforms would be on the same footing.  Boy, was I wrong.\n\nI can't say that on Linux there are some strange effects, or that this class' towers don't work correctly, or that performance is poor.  I can't say that because the Linux client WON'T START AT ALL!  THE CLIENT JUST CRASHES!  I CAN'T EVEN PLAY THE GAME!\n\nI've gone through forum post after forum post, looking for a solution or maybe that  it just doesn't work on my distro (Fedora 20).  But it turns out the problem doesn't not appear to be distro specific.  The client just doesn't work on any Linux distro.  What's worse is that Trendy appears to know this but still lists the game as being available for Linux.\n\nNow you might think I'm just a flamer and that if what I've said here is true then there would be far more negative reviews by Linux gamers.  Here's the catch (and I hope you're sitting down for this one):\n\nVALVE WILL NOT LET YOU POST A REVIEW UNLESS YOU'VE PLAYED THE GAME FOR AT LEAST 5 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNot the easiest thing to do if the game won't run for more than a second.  What I had to do was install Steam on a Windows system, login, install the game on that system, then let it run for 5+ minutes.  All just so I would be allowed to post this review!  I was so disgusted, I didn't even actually play the game on Windows.  I just let the launcher sit there.\n\nNow I understand Valve's point of view, trying to slow down trolls as best they can.  However, in this case, they have to know by now that there is a major problem with the Linux client to this game.  Yet they still allow the game to be listed as "Available on Linux".  That makes them partially negligent in allowing this fraud to continue.\n\nSince I can't get my money back for this game, I'll give any reader patient enough to read to the end of my rant this advice:  Don't give Trendy a dime of your money for this POS until they get their act together and actually deliver what they promised!\n\n\n************** UPDATE 10/10/2014 *****************\n\nIt looks like they've made some updates to the Linux client.  You have 4 options to launch now (not sure what they all mean).  The options are "Play Dungeon Defenders Eternity", "Link Steam Libraries", "Unlink Steam Libraries", "Play Offline".  For me they all do the same thing.  The application tries to launch and exits.  I get a flash of a window, but it's disappears so quickly I can't see anything to give me a useful hint as to what's going on.\n\nTrendy (or whomever is developing this now), you guys suck!!!","August 13, 2014","false","19.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Because of this I can't finish a match because it is impossible to protect against the enemies due to not being able to get to them (and because I can't move to place towers).\n\nThe public tavern causes nothing but issues.  I can barely manage my inventory because of how confusing the UI is.  There is no tutorial for people who are trying it for the first time (even as an experience DD1 player I barely knew what was happening on my screen)\n\nThe new "features" don't really make the game worth paying for if you already own DD1 and basically any of the DLC.\n\nI plan to come back to this game after each update to see if any of the problems are fixed.\n\nMost importantly, it is not playable for those without a good internet connection "offline" play doesn't work (I'm not even sure it actually exists), and private matches are still incredibly laggy (even with 30Mb/s+ speeds)\n\nMy reccomendation to all who read this is:  Give the game a while before you buy it.

Long story short: This is a game that's being marketed as "definitive" that's in an early beta phase, at best.  There's rollbacks and lag issues for their online-only servers (there's no offline mode), a complete lack of meaningful loot progression, horrible UI issues (it looks like it was made to fit in mobile, and there's annoyances like item stats not being on dedicated lines so it's hard to compare items), and there's a HUUUUGGEEE list of features that existed in DD1 that don't in DDE.\n\nThings missing:\n1) Nightmare mode, hardcore mode, mixed mode, and pure strategy mode.\n2) Full Single Player functionality - They added single player after the community outcry, and have been slowly adding in more and more functionality, but it's not quite there yet\n3) Private taverns - You're stuck in a communal tavern with 15 other people happily making tons of noise.  If you dislike hearing Slice 'n' Dices attack dummies or simply don't want to read a 13y/o's curse-heavy ranting, or simply want to decorate your own private tavern, then you're out of luck.\n4) No achievements/awards/trophies - With the conversion over to public tavern, all the joys of trophies in private taverns are gone.  There's nothing to work towards, and no reason to beat any maps besides the ones that give loot.\n5) Challenge rewards - Currently, challenges provide ZERO experience and loot.  Upon completion, they DO give artifacts, which are permanent stat boosters, but these artifacts are not stackable and offer completely negligible increases (we're talking adding 8hps to a character with 10-20k life, and 1-2 to fire resist when you have 950).\n6) Loot despawning priorities - In DD1, loot has prioritization on what disappears first.  In DDE, it doesn't.  And there's FAR fewer items allowed on the ground (online server reasons?).  Currently, instead of the ~200 items allowed in DD1 on bigger maps, there's 35 allowed in DDE, and because there's no loot despawn prioritization, that means stuff often disappears before it hits the ground.  Loot only appears near you, and even when it does that upgrade that just dropped might disappear before you can get to it while the 50g item you can buy from the tavernkeeper sticks around for 10 minutes.\n7) Meaningful progression and incentive to do hard maps - Everyone does insane ramparts.  Why?  Because it drops far better loot than any of the DLC or later maps like CD, and it's one of the easiest maps in the game.  Of course, this means that once you get the gear from ramparts, there's nothing else to do, so the playerbase has dropped by half every 1.5-2 weeks since release.\n8) Tower/Character balance - DD1 didn't have great balance, but it at least didn't have completely broken classes.  Huntress traps are so bad that no one uses them, summoner pets are broken (either useless or so OP they break their own animation with how fast they shoot), towers get over-nerfed for no reason and in an odd manner (including nerfs to huntress traps no one uses), and some classes are flat-out bad now (barbarian is HORRIBLE).\n9) Itemization - Some great items from DD1 are missing (treadmill pets, costumes that change gameplay mechanics, meaningful & unique weapons), and the itemization in general is just inferior.  Weapons are all very similar and no longer have speed stats, so they all basically feel the same (outside of huntress, who has a few weps that are clearly superior, especially with the removal of speed stats).  Monk weapons all have horrible ranged damage so ranged monk dps isn't viable, barbarian swords are junk (speed stat issue again causing problems, to say nothing of barbarian stat scaling itself), apprentice weapons are all similar and junky enough that apprentice DPS isn't really a thing, etc.\n10) Rewards for the challenges/campaign maps/survivals - There's no rewards for any of these, including beating CD.  You get... nothing.  no seahorses, no pets, no specific weapons dropping from specific bosses... nothing unique.  everything that drops drops everywhere, and while some campaign maps like aquanos will reward you after beating a boss, the rewards are completely random... you can get a few accessories and nothing else.\n11) A whole MESS of maps, costumes, pets, items, and other fun things that simply don't exist in DDE.  Too many to count or list here.\n12) a workable armor set system - DDE has a few extra slots for armor and 9 different sets instead of 4.  I'm too lazy to do the math, but instead of sets being fairly viable for everyone, at any level, they're now basically inaccessible to most of the community, since the chances of you having the same 1 (out of 9) type of item for all 7 slots that's decent enough to wear is nigh impossible.\n13) A balanced upgrading system - The new system is percentage-based, and it's FAR harder to get money for those upgrades.  You'll have to spend a LOT of time playing Vacuum Simulator, since smashing the "E" key and picking up everything to sell it later is the only decent way to get money.  But even that aside, the percentage-based system (10% of base stats per upgrade, and 20% of base damage per) completely breaks itemization.  I won't go into detail, but suffice to say this breaks endgame items and throws items (and thus, characters) completely out of balance.\n14) Kick system - If you like playing public games, accept that about half the players you encounter will simply afk the second they join the game, and there's nothing you can do about it.  At all.  And that's if you're lucky... if you're not they can actively ruin your experience by selling your towers, and again, there's nothing you can do about it.\n\nBasically, I could go on for paragraphs on content that's in DD1 that was simply left out or is plain better (UI, loot despawn code, loot progression, trophies, map rewards, etc etc etc), but here's what it all boils down to:  you are NOT getting a definitive version of DDE.  You're buying what everyone playing agrees is a beta product.  I didn't even list out the major bugs & exploits in the game, and there's a LOT.  So while this game has a few improvements (more active play options with amulets, a conceptually better survival mode), none of it is balanced yet and there's so many bugs and issues in the game that you shouldn't give Trendy money for a "definitive edition" when it's nowhere near that state.  Some people might still like the game and play it, but no one can argue with the fact that this is a works-in-progress, so ask yourself if you want to reward a company that essentially spits on their best customers by re-releasing a title like this in such a misleading fashion.\n\nAt best, hold on to your money until the game is what they say it is, and frankly, I don't think it ever will be.  The core of DDE is so busted that even when they DO tack on NM, it's certainly not going to FIX anything... it'll just magnify the problems that already exist and aren't being addressed.","August 23, 2014","false","145.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Long story short: This is a game that's being marketed as "definitive" that's in an early beta phase, at best.  There's rollbacks and lag issues for their online-only servers (there's no offline mode), a complete lack of meaningful loot progression, horrible UI issues (it looks like it was made to fit in mobile, and there's annoyances like item stats not being on dedicated lines so it's hard to compare items), and there's a HUUUUGGEEE list of features that existed in DD1 that don't in DDE.\n\nThings missing:\n1) Nightmare mode, hardcore mode, mixed mode, and pure strategy mode.\n2) Full Single Player functionality - They added single player after the community outcry, and have been slowly adding in more and more functionality, but it's not quite there yet\n3) Private taverns - You're stuck in a communal tavern with 15 other people happily making tons of noise.  If you dislike hearing Slice 'n' Dices attack dummies or simply don't want to read a 13y/o's curse-heavy ranting, or simply want to decorate your own private tavern, then you're out of luck.\n4) No achievements/awards/trophies - With the conversion over to public tavern, all the joys of trophies in private taverns are gone.  There's nothing to work towards, and no reason to beat any maps besides the ones that give loot.\n5) Challenge rewards - Currently, challenges provide ZERO experience and loot.  Upon completion, they DO give artifacts, which are permanent stat boosters, but these artifacts are not stackable and offer completely negligible increases (we're talking adding 8hps to a character with 10-20k life, and 1-2 to fire resist when you have 950).\n6) Loot despawning priorities - In DD1, loot has prioritization on what disappears first.  In DDE, it doesn't.  And there's FAR fewer items allowed on the ground (online server reasons?).  Currently, instead of the ~200 items allowed in DD1 on bigger maps, there's 35 allowed in DDE, and because there's no loot despawn prioritization, that means stuff often disappears before it hits the ground.  Loot only appears near you, and even when it does that upgrade that just dropped might disappear before you can get to it while the 50g item you can buy from the tavernkeeper sticks around for 10 minutes.\n7) Meaningful progression and incentive to do hard maps - Everyone does insane ramparts.  Why?  Because it drops far better loot than any of the DLC or later maps like CD, and it's one of the easiest maps in the game.  Of course, this means that once you get the gear from ramparts, there's nothing else to do, so the playerbase has dropped by half every 1.5-2 weeks since release.\n8) Tower/Character balance - DD1 didn't have great balance, but it at least didn't have completely broken classes.  Huntress traps are so bad that no one uses them, summoner pets are broken (either useless or so OP they break their own animation with how fast they shoot), towers get over-nerfed for no reason and in an odd manner (including nerfs to huntress traps no one uses), and some classes are flat-out bad now (barbarian is HORRIBLE).\n9) Itemization - Some great items from DD1 are missing (treadmill pets, costumes that change gameplay mechanics, meaningful & unique weapons), and the itemization in general is just inferior.

I have enjoyed the game thus far but have mostly played with 2 or more friends from other games. It is very addictive and almost everything but the character emotes are free.\n\nHonestly it's a game that if you have friends to play it with and like a more interactive tower defence game then you should definitely play this. I would recommend once you buy it and DL it, load it up and let it download all the maps before you play. This prevents any issues when loading maps and minimizes bugs.\n\nIt's true, this does seem like their BETA test for a Dungeon Defenders 2, making Eternity more like a 1.5 version that the makers can milk ££ out of...and I am completely fine with that. I would rather buy this game cheap while it's buggy and report the bugs than DD2 which will hopefully be awesome be this precarious. The ingame UI needs a LOT of work, and I mean a lot. I didn't find it user friendly but this is hopefully something being worked on. Notably the UI does allow access to Twitch for easy streaming - like streaming a BETA. Oh, I see what you did there game makers. *wink wink*.\n\nA mixed bag from me, but I'm still gonna keep playing. If they release nightmare mode or boost the lvl cap from 60 i'll probably play more. I also like what they've done to survival mode making it a 1:00:00 hour constant defence where you don't have to AFK for 12 hours until good loot starts to drop :D!","August 13, 2014","true","70.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Far from the definitive version advertised, this is just a money grab.  A rebalanced endgame?  Endgame difficulty is currently dissabled with no eta on when it might be implemented.  Hardcore mode and Mix mode from DD1?  Disabled with no eta.  Remember running survivals in DD1 and running around at the end to see what gear dropped?  Well in DDE monsters drop 1g coins in addition to loot.  There is a 400 item limit for how many things can be on the ground, and coins take up most of this limit, resulting in most of the loot despawning whithin moments of dropping.  No eta on when this might be fixed.  The developers from Nom Nom Games (thats right, this isn't being produced by the same people that created DD1, it's just being marketed by them) are making all the same mistakes they the Trendy developers made in DD1 and the community is suffering from whiplash while the devs flail around trying to fix their mistakes.\n\n\n\nThis is essentially a beta to test the playverse archetecture for Dungeon Defenders 2.

There are several new maps and challenges, including what appears to be the start of a new campaign.\n\nThe Tavern has been converted to an open lobby with a personal trophy room at the back.  Survival Mode has been modified from the original 3-5 hour binge to a 1 hour timed single wave survival and the loot curve has been balanced for proper advancement.  Players will also find that all loot and chests are player instanced so you can loot all you want.\n\nIn the original Dungeon Defenders, mana was used to summon traps/towers and level up weapons.  A few changes to this system make it more friendly.  Mana is now only used to summon traps and towers.  Weapons are leveled using gold coins and pets have their own separate experience pool.\n\nI would recommend that you buy this if you enjoyed the original Dungeon Defenders and are still interested in playing. If you have already burnt out of the original Dungeon Defenders this game will not offer much to keep your interest since the innovations added do not offset the lack of new content.","July 25, 2014","true","88.5"," 51 of 104 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","51","104","0","0"

Dont believe me?\n\nYou should. All the negative reviews on this page are before they added singleplayer in.\n\nWhen you first log in, I will admit, its nuts. Have you ever been to a spawn town in a busy MMO, or gone to New York? Thats it. The tavern is a hub that EVERYONE uses. So, sometimes crazyness happens. But don't you worry, little girl, this is the only time your little loner side has to show like a sore thumb. Ignore the people. Go join A PRIVATE GAME. Dont join a public game if you dont want to join muilitplayer. BOOM! Your alone!\n\nThe gameplay hasn't really changed, other than you now get less mana. Or so it first seems... in singleplayer this doesn't really matter, but in muilitplayer, people used to NOT share chest, and made it so people couldn't even do anything because there was no mana to go around. They changed it so every player can open every chest. So, 3 people can touch the same chest and it wont go away for the forth person. So, every player gets the same amount of mana. Otherwise, in singleplayer, this change sucks, because your getting less mana.\n\nThe games pretty. Nuff said.\n\nThey added some new missons to the main campain. It will feel a bit fresh to older players.\n\nThe GUI, is uh... really, well ugly, acually. Its new. Does it feel rushed? Completely, acually. Its not something you can't get used to, mine you, but its odd.\n\nCoustumes are now items, so only 1 person can wear them. Yea, it kinda sucks. You can see your armor though, so who knows what you'll look like in the end anyway.\n\n2nd to last, the crafting system. Cool! At the time of this review I couldnt test it out, but I'm sure that i lets you dupe items for crafting ingredents you find on quests.\n\nFinally, the shop system. Lots of people don't like the whole spending real money thing, but its only for cosmetics, so its okay. The new system goes like this. Instead of using mana, it uses coins, witch is found the same way mana is. Its a bit more rare, but you wont cry because you only got 5 peices in a run. The money can buy lots of new items that are consumed on use. These items do a varying amount of things, but an example is a mana collector. Place this bad boy down, and collects mana for you? Easy! Nice! Theres also mana potions, health potions, bombs, lots of awesome stuff.\n\nSo, yea buy this game. If you havn't bought dungeon defenders go buy this. Its worth it. If you have bought dungeon defenders, its up to you. Its a plunge your gonna have to take, but the new changes and others things I didnt take about in this review, You might be happy. Remember that you have a big discount because of you owning the game already.\n\n\nRemember though, I'm a dude on the internet. I like DD a lot. I bought this game (before singleplayer) knowning it was bad. I bought it anyway, because I love DD. I'm not gonna make you use your wallet. (If you have it anymore after the steam summer sales!)\n\nOh, and all DLC carrys over. Nice!\n\nIf I write anything else, I'll start writing a novel. You get the idea. Check out more reviews, NOT THE ONES BEFORE SINGLEPLAYER, before you spent your money.","July 22, 2014","true","15.4"," 32 of 66 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","32","66","0","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/archdale/recommended/302270/","archdale","Archdale","http://steamcommunity.com/id/archdale/","288 products in account","I personally like the game, but like others, are a bit jaded on the details of what is new or included. I'll break it down best I can.  The game is basicly a GotY edition of Dungeon Defenders, including the DLCs from the original, but also including changes and new levels.\n\nNew, but not really listed\nMatchmaking - You share one tavern.  I assume it has a cap, so there are several taverns.  To those who never played the base game, the tavern is where you prep before going into a game, sell items, and can goof off.\nYou will be paired with like, leveled people.  You still get to choose what level and difficulty you choose to play on.\n\nLoot Drops per Character - Your item drops in a game are yours.  You don't have to worry about someone taking an upgrade because of the matchmaking.\n\nStreaming Client - Yes the game looks bad when you first load, as many reviews have said.  This is due to the game streaming textures and whatnot the first time you need them.  It only downloads once.  That's why the download for the game through steam is quite small.\n\nWhat might annoy\nMicrotransaction - Everyones favorite thing to hate.  Currently (June 22, 2014), the game only has emotes as microtransaction items.  A bit overpriced, but they are cosmetic only.\n\nNo Tutorial - It just dumps you into a lobby, the tavern.  No character creation, no explaination of controls.  Ask in chat and someone will probably gladly point you in the right direction.\n\nPlayerverse instead of Steamworks - They decided to use their own matchmaking system, with its own friends list, party making and trade system.  The reason probably stems from cross-platform play with phones/tablets.  This can be seen as a good thing if you plan to play on your phone or tablet as well.\n\nNo private game - This shortcoming is already being fixed tonight; seems like an oversight by them.  I think they were hoping to have a bustling matchmaking system, instead of a bunch of private games.\n\nNo character transfer - You'll be starting at level 1 again.\n\nThings I like so far\nTweaked Play - Pets now have abilities you can activate.  You'll find pet eggs you can hatch.  And there are items you can use in combat, like health potions and bombs, as well as buffs.  Also they added a dodge ability.\n\n\nDespite my short list of what I liked, I really enjoyed the original, and look forward to leveling up and seeing how the end-game has changed.  For people who haven't played the original, this is the version to get.  If you have the original and are debating getting this one for the discounted price, look at the things I highlighted.  Comment on this review if you have questions or want clarity.","July 22, 2014","true","93.8"," 32 of 66 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","32","66","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayjona/recommended/302270/","ayjona","Ayjona","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ayjona/","467 products in account","It seems this bears reiteration upon reiteration:\n\nDisregard the majority (though never all) of the negative reviews and sentiments for Dungeon Defenders Eternity. The vast majority are based upon misunderstandings, misconceptions or factual errors, and are therefore inapplicable to the actual product.\n\nDungeon Defenders Eternity is NOT:\n\n* A mobile port. It is based completely on Dungeon Defenders, with added code and assets. From whence this idea comes, I know not, as there is NOTHING to suggest mobile roots.\n* Laden with IAP. The in-game shop ONLY sells cosmetic items, a standard not only of the genre (in as far as DD can be categorized), but a new paradigm for the games industry as a whole. And it is one of the most harmless and fair ways for developers to increase their profits (which is often not about quick cash grabs, but about staying in business and making new games, especially for indie developers).\n* Visually downgraded. This fallacy is based on the new streaming texture mechanics, where textures are streamed upon first launch, thus allowing players to get into the game faster. That this would make 50+ reviewers believe that there has been a graphical downgrade only shows that customers will jump to conclusions within SECONDS, and never challenge the legitimacy of their own preconceptions, or double check their initial findings. I first launched Eternity on a 1 MBIT/S TETHERED SMARTPHONE CONNECTION, and the textures for the tavern loaded within one minute.\n* More demanding than the original edition. The two Steam apps put almost the exact same strain on my processor, GPU, etc.\n\nDungeon Defenders Eternity IS:\n\n* Significantly improved. The list of new features include manual dodging, a whole crafting system, consumables and spell amulets that provide entirely new powers in battle, pets that can be hatched and trained to fight with their own abilities in battle, visual armor upgrades, and a true hardcore mode.\n* FINALLY hacker-safe. Hacked characters made the original almost entirely unplayable for anyone hoping for balance and even matches, as so many players had over-levelled or over-equipped hacked characters. (This is one of the primary arguments for always-online requirements for games with multiplayer modes, and proven very succintly in this case.)\n* Rebalanced.\n* Endowed with an entirely new loot system, as this was an oft-critizied part of the original.\n* Equipped for true cross-platform play. Progress is already shared with the Android Tegra version, and iOS will receive the same later this year.\n* Not designed to siphon money of old players, as all of us who own the original are offered to buy DDE for 5 euros.\n* Linked to the upcoming sequel, with unlockables that will be available in Dungeon Defenders 2.\n\nSo, is this a good game? That depends on your sentiments regarding the original. An improvement? Oh, yes, in nearly every single way. The ultimate version of Dungeon Defenders 1? Very, very nearly so.\n\nCould Trendy have launched this new version more smoothly and predicted some of this confusion and irritation? Probably (though after looking at the Steam store description and new page for the game, I find it hard to see any room for significant misunderstanding, or most of the misconceptions that surround the launch).\n\nA worthy purchase? If you are a fan of the original, definitively. If you’ve never played Dungeon Defenders? Oh, gawds, yes!","July 23, 2014","true","18.7"," 32 of 66 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","32","66","0","0"

I played (according to Steam) 831 hours of DD1.  So I'd say I'm pretty familiar with it.  This is basically the same game with some tweaks.\n\nI don't like the lack of offline mode, but I understand the reasoning.  It really is the only way to prevent cheating.\n\nI do like the pets-from-eggs (and they seem to be a lot more common) and that pets have quality levels.  I haven't done any crafting, but I'm looking forward to that.  Hardcore/permadeath is an interesting way to add a little spice to existing levels, as well as provide better loot in them.  Being able to play from a browser is nice, for those times when you aren't at your gaming rig.  Cross-platform play is nice, too.  It means I can play on my nVidia Shield or my PC or my fiancee's old Macbook.

Inventory management is a pain.  Especially for comparing equipment.\n\nOverall, I like it.

The game isn't any where near as bad as everyone says it is, and if you enjoyed the original game, you'll enjoy this one. The cash shop only sells $1 emotes and nothing else (at least as far as I have seen) and the servers were fine for the few hours I played yesterday. The game's a great buy if you loved the original but didn't buy all the DLC as it all comes included in this game, and while it might be a harder sell point for someone who already bought all the DLC, the few new features the game offers, and the promise of no hackers, is a decent reason to pick this version up, and if those don't sound like good enough reasons, then stick to the original.","July 23, 2014","true","13.1"," 29 of 60 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","29","60","0","0"

It looks and feels like the original version, and the control and responsiveness are fine. They will feel clunky because you're going to play with a slow character for the first time in years.\n\nThe public taverns are utterly painless, and remove the hassle of closing your game every time you want to look at your inventory. Nor will you need to politely decline the companionship of players 5 times your level while they hop around on the bar.\n\nEverything else seems pretty much the same to me, though I don't doubt that those of you who've put in hundreds of hours will find changes to the math you'll find pleasing or not so pleasing. The biggest change I see is that you won't need to derp around the game listing, wondering if you belong within the weird level range of the various games that have been running for heaven knows how long. You quite literally press go and get dropped into a game seconds later with people around your level. It's honestly pretty nice.\n\nAs a side note, the numbers on the negative reviews here paint a picture of an angry little brigade putting in an hour or less before writing the game off on bugaboo grounds. There are serious reasons to find fault with this game - there always have been - but they certainly aren't in play here. These people are upset about specific disagreements they have with the direction the franchise has taken, NOT with the actual quality of the game.","July 23, 2014","true","33.2"," 28 of 58 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","28","58","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/modkiq/recommended/302270/","modkiq","Modkiq","http://steamcommunity.com/id/modkiq/","181 products in account","Don't care about the bad reviews that people with literally 0.2 hour playtime. I will provide you with a proper review for the game.\nI have no idea why this game is getting so many negative reviews. In this review I want to go over some of the things that they changed about the game.\nBefore I start, this game is basicly Dungeon Defenders 1, with new content, and a lot of fixes.\n\nNew Content\nCash shop\nThe cash shop is getting a lot of hate by a lot of the reviewers. They are saying that it makes the game developers look greedy, and that they only care about money. This is false. The only thing you can buy in the cash shop, is taunts. You can buy taunts for $1 each, and there is a total of 34 taunts you can buy. It does not give you any benefits in the game, but it does make you very cool looking.\n\nThe pause menu\nThey have made a new pause menu for the game, which does not only look amazing, but it is amazing as well. You can now change your options in game, without having to close, and re open the game. You can once again inspect players (look at their gear and stats), you can add randoms to your party without having to add them on steam, and you can report players for different reasons, like cheating, offensive username, language and profile picture.\n\nThe tavern\nThey are using the same tavern as in the last game, but you are now sharing  the tavern with other players. This makes it possible for you to just sit in the tavern, and chat, make new friends, trade with randoms etc. It makes a community out of the game.\n\nStory mode, challenges, and just maps in general.\nThey are using basicly all (and some new ones) maps form DD1, but they have made it so you have to complete them in order to be able to play them. This makes it so you can no longer but the game, and instantly lvl up to the max lvl. You have to work for your lvl, and you have to work for your gear. This makes it more funt o play with friends.\n\nPets, armor, weapons.\nYou can now see parts of the armor you are wearing, which is really cool. All the armor pieces does not look the same, like it does in the original game, and you no longer get armor with just +1 stats if you play on easy mode. This makes it way more balanced.\nFor the pets, I think they have made a huge improvement. They have made it so all lvl 1 pets comes from eggs that you need to carry around (basicly just have it in your inventory) until they hatch, and you get a new pet. All pets have special abilities that you can use (with cooldowns), plus they will fight for you, like they did in the original game.\nFor the weapons, I have ot noticed anything different yet, apart from the new textures.\n\nCoins!\nYou no longer have to be greedy when you are upgrading your friend's towers with your mana, because you no longer use mana as money. They have made it so you get coins instead. This makes a lot more sense to me, as I think of magic, and summoning when I think of mana. I don't think about buying armor with it. You get coins about the same way you get mana. You get them form killing mobs, selling your loot, and completing maps.\n\nSmall changes\nI have found a few small changes in the game too, that I think are really cool.\nWhen you are near another player, you can see their health and mana bar over their heads. Now you don't have ti pause the game to see if anybody has any mana left!\nThere is a mini-map in the corner of the screen, so you don't have to enable the full-scree map to see where the remaining mana-chests are. You can just look at the mini map! You can of course use the large map too, if you perfer that.\nWhen you are building a tower, or repairing one, there is no longer a giant progress bar showing in the middle of the screen. They made a small, but nice looking bar down in the left corner instead.\nKeybinds for your forge. Now you have keybinds you can use in your forge, instead of having to click first the item, then the unlock button, you can simply click L while hovering your mouse over the item you wish to lock/unlock to do so. There are more keybinds like this.\n\nThings I don't like about the game\nIt is a bit confusing the first 20 minutes\nYou kind of have to play DD1 to understand what's going on in this game. I guess you could always google a "Dungeon Defenders Eternity tutorial".\nThe first time you load something, the textures are blurry as they render for the first time.\nThey change a lot of things in the game without warnings. Suddenly they figure they want to remove single player, but after a while they add it again..\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, this is a very good game, and if you liked the old game, this is a must. I have 500 hours on the old dungeon defenders game, and I wouldn't be suprised if I got up to another 100 hours on this game.\nI don't know why this game got so many bad reviews (mostly by people that only played it for under 1 hour). I believe it is because it is so different from the first game. It takes some time to get used to the new things. People are getting mad when they see that there is a cash shop, but I don't think they should worry about it, as the cash shop only sells taunts. You can buy everything else for in-game coins! I really have no idea why they are calling this a phone-app though. It is just like DD1 in my opinion.\n\nNotice that the game is not a finished project. They game came out yesterday, and they are still working on things like bugs (haven't found any serious bugs yet), new content etc. You have a lot of things to look forward to if you buy this. It also has some sneak peaks on dungeon defenders 2, as they use some of the DD2 things in this game. And yes, they added private games, so you can play alone if you perfer that.","July 23, 2014","true","4.6"," 27 of 56 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","27","56","0","0"

I have put hundreds of hours into the orginial Dungeon Defenders and decided to buy this one as well. Bottom line is, I believe it IS WORTH IT. Whether you are new to the game, or already own it. It is worth the money, and they seem to be working on and fixing any problems so far. DON'T LISTEN TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS! Most complaints have been fixed at this point and there is still being work done. Overall, the game still plays the same as the original with some fixes and additions that arguably make the game even better! Now... let's get into it.\n\nThis review is going to written as though you played the original just to point out the reasons for buying this new version.\n\nPros:\n-More maps\n-Almost every DLC from the original comes included in this version\n-Any equiptment is now visible on your character\n-Pets have alternate abilities that can be activated\n-Item slots for equiptment that can be activated during battle for various effects (Summon a storm cloud that deals damage, make all your attacks poisonous, heal nearby players, etc)\n-Players now have there own mana chests as well as drops so no more stealing or fighting over mana/equiptment\n-You can dye your character AND items\n-Mana is no longer currency, instead during levels there are gold coins mixed in with the mana as enemies die\n-Hardcore mode is now scary (if you die...your character is gone for good)\n-Hitting control allows your character to kind of dash ahead a bit to get around a bit quicker\n-running into your towers causes you to jump automatically to allow you to get over them with ease\n\nCons:\n-Still HAVE to be online\n-When completing a level, you always have to return to the tavern prior to starting a new level\n-The overall userface and inventory system is a bit more clunky then usual, but is manageable\n-Hardcore mode I feel is also a bit too much some times haha\n-No split screen\n-A store that uses REAL money (but is only for cosmetic stuff like emotes and costumes so no biggie)\n\nAgain, overall the game plays the same. Once you are actually in a match and playing through a level, you won't really notice a difference (other then a few of the new additions). Some things have even made the game better from the original! It's not as bad as those initial reviews made it seem, and although there have been some problems and it isn't perfect...it is getting there. And even as of now, it is still great and feels close to the orinigal DD we know and love.

Just a bit of exploring, and it makes much more sense and is easier to navigate.\n\nI understand why people are getting angry, but I think that nearly all of these reviews are overreacting. I don't think it's fair to say that you don't recommend a game after an hour or less on record. Granted, recommending it with the same amount of time isn't very convincing either.\n\nBut, this game does have a lot of added features that spice up the gameplay and make it all-around more enjoyable, in my opinion. The UI for the shop is clunky, yes, but in the actual Dungeon Defense part of the game, the UI is much smaller and easier to navigate than previously. Also, the upgrade system is much easier to understand and use. They've added Pet Eggs to make obtaining pets easier, as well as Consumables. Seriously, so much has been added from the first game, it's ludicrous.\n\nMy favorite feature is the dodging. Parkour parkour, mutha******.\n\nHonestly, I think this game is getting way too much negative feedback considering how good it actually is. Much better than the first game, in my honest opinion.

Having now levelled a new character into their mid 20's I can say that this version is better than the Original.  Players no longer fight over crystal chests each round; the loot system has been tweaked for a smoother experience and the dlc from the first title has all been included and rebalanced for a better levelling experience. The UI does  have some issues with not being very intuitive on how to manage your inventory but the developers have posted that UI changes are being looked into.  As far as price goes even at its full $19.99 tag, this version is a better deal than purchasing the first title with all the dlc; so its a no brainer for anyone who hasn't already purchased the first game.  With the game servers being handled entirely by the developer, instances of cheating will hopefully be far less prevelant or nonexistent compared to the first DD.  Overall I'd say this title has some rough spots to work out as far as its UI is concerned but overall I would not tell someone to not give it a try and enjoy one of the best action/tower defense games available.","July 24, 2014","true","20.8"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

The launcher is unnecessary and unattractive. The first time I tried to launch the game from it it crashed. You are now required to make an account with a servivce I have never heard of (you have to log into the account in the launcher before you can start the game). I understand that the service is providing servers to host games, which prevents hackers, but I absolutely hate how this was gone about. I'm sure another solution could have been found, or more time could have been put into implementing something such as VAC to not require another account just to launch the game. You are also immediately dropped into a multiplayer lobby with lots of people when selecting play, there isn't even a character select. This is also unnecessary and not something I think adds value to the game. I prefer starting a game and being present a menu, or at least some kind of character select, not being dropped into a game with a group of people I don't know. Oh yeah, and there are microtransactions... they went F2P without going free. My first impression upon launching this game (when I loved the original) is to stay far away. I highly recommend you don't spend money on this. Wait until the original version is on sale and pick that up- or just wait for the second one (which they hopefully haven't done the same to).\n\nThis version of the game cripples a great game with a multitude of poor and unnecessary decisions. I am upset that I spent any money on this (even if it was only $6). I normally don't write reviews, but I want to help people avoid this. It's simply sad that such a great game was put into such a miserable state like this.","July 22, 2014","false","0.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

A hardcore grinding game - Perfect to take away your many leftover hours.\n\nSweet new spell slots they made for more personal charecter options (also able to put in eggs to increase tower stats instead)\nSpells like  hero healing, tower healing, and extra field damage all found as both single target and area of effect or even personal player damage boosts for those who want to make the action themselves!\nAnd about the eggs - Feels awesome you need to first find the egg and then hatch them into pets later and not only does it make more sence but only increase the grinding you need to do further.\nThey also added crafting which is a nice touch to a grinding game.\n\nThe new survival mode they made makes it interresting in a whole new way because you cant just switch your chars and make the best defence by yourself .. now you actually need team members to get the job done proberly for the whole hour!\nOfcourse for some that is also a downside, but fear not. Going beserk alone is very posible with the right spell setup!\n\nNow that was all the good stuff ..\nDont know when any of this will be fixed but here is how it is as of now..\n\nJust when you log in it loads just as any other time.. But nothing happens .. Cant join tavern - Awesome\n\nAnother bad thing they need to fix is the party option - and for a multiplayer game it should be crucial..?\nWhen you are in a party and try to start a map the "ready" button people need to press bugs out and you get stuck.\nWhen a map is over and you are in a party ( if you managed to get this far ) it sometime bugs the party and the trouble starts once again..\n\nThis might not sound as much.. But when you got someone to play with and you might be able to play 1 map and then get stuck in bugs for more then 30 mins before just entering the tavern again to get stuck once more?\nIt makes it bad.. Really bad .. Almost like the bugs got bugs :o\n\nBut even with the current bugs solo maps seem to work fine most of the time. And what you get to play is as awesome as ever!\n\nSo besides the bugs in this game I fully recommend it! Maybe waiting abit to buy it is a smart move so they got some time to fix the bugs.. But not that it matter really when the game is this awesome!\n\nHopefully this gave you some answers you were looking for.

Here is the real review! Beware of people that are downvoting this game because of bugs. Look at the date of their review and then look to see if a patch just came out. The game acts really BAD when you click play at 25% downloaded instead of waiting for 100% and the first 3 days after a patch it acts really laggy, BUT after 3 days and 100% downloaded this game works perfectly.\n\nNow onto the review, this is a similar game to DD1 but they remade it for transitioning into DD2. This remake allowed rebalancing to all the items and classes. There are extremely few hackers, I have only seen 2 people with hacked items in all my hours on the game. Patches are plenty and they have added new levels and minions to keep it interesting. Downsides to DD1 players are that the reduced the size and weapon effects so you can't get rediculously huge items anymore :( . It took like 4 months to finally see nightmare survival mode and mix mode still isnt out, but we will have all the blanks filled in soon I hope. Still a great game just not as addicting as DD1. If what they say is true about item transfers to DD2 then I recommend playing DDE over DD1. There are a lot of minor UI and mechanics theyve added that really make the game more enjoyable.\n\nStill wish the game was more flashy and outrageous though.","November 12, 2014","true","180.2"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961909777/recommended/302270/","76561197961909777","The Major","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961909777/","193 products in account","I've seen way too many bull reviews, so here is a review with the information on BOTH sides. Hopefully this will actually help someone make the choice on if they want to get this or not. This review is admittedly mostly aimed at those that have played dungeon defenders in the past and are thinking about buying this one as well. As you have looked below, I'm sure you see the wall of text; don't worry, I will be putting bullet points at the end.\n\n[PROS/CHANGES]\nLet me start off by saying I do really enjoy both dungeon defenders, and Dungeon Defenders Eternity. As for all the wonderfull changes that are made, there isn't a single one that I don't enjoy.  We have two stats replacing the skill stats, such as the joust for countess, as Ability Offensive and Ability Defensive. They act just like they sound, with Ability Offensive helping out the offensive skill if you have one, and defensive helping the other. These two stats do play into more, but I'll get to that later. The next new thing is that you no longer only have a helmet, chest plate, pants and gloves. Now you have all those, plus greaves, belts, masks, shields and each one of those items has stats associated with it, as well as actively change the way your character looks. A nice change to actually see your equipment change your character, besides just your weapon. There is also now a crafting system, where you can randomly come across blueprints for items from monsters. From chests you gain crafting materials, and you just take those and go talk to a shroomite on the 2nd floor of the tavern, and if you have the necessary materials you can make said item. The really nice thing about this is that you actually know the stats the items is going to have before it's made, but the bad thing is that I believe once you make it once, you'll have to get another one to make it again.\n\nAnother really nice thing that falls near the same catagory, is artifacts. From beating certain bosses and challenges, you obtain artifacts that you can use (you can only use that specific artifact on that specific character once, but are not limited to only one artifact used on that character,) to give a permanent bonus toward stats, such as tower attack. Some do have level requirements as well, such as a demon one requires your character to be level 15 in order to use it on it. There are also boosts you can get that are consumables that can increase the quality, quantity and rarity of items that drop on that stage. At least, until you're done with the stage, then it reverts to normal. That being said, getting a bunch of rare items with really good stats isn't something I can complain about.\n\nThe next really big change, is in a completely new catagory called "Active Items." These active items can be potions, bombs, distracting traps, eggs, and ability amulets. Yup, ability amulets, such as "Thunderstorm Amulet," that give you new spells to use. Remember those new stats I spoke of? Well, say your Thunderstorm does 70 damage every .33 seconds base. Not only does your offensive ability buff your Joust, or whatever base class ability you have, but it ALSO buffs the item abilities. So, instead of doing only 70 damage every .33 seconds, now you're doing 100 (70+30). That's just an example, mind you, so no real formula's were used. As for the eggs, it's a new way to gain pets. While your out slaughtering hapless orcs and whatnot, an egg can sometimes drop. All you do is put that egg in the active item slot, and wait until it get's enough xp to hatch. Doesn't seem to be too bad as far as the amount necessary. You already know the stats of the pet before it hatches, but not the type, so you can take an educated guess on if you want to hatch it or not. Speaking of types, pets now have a passive ability as well as active. Take a hawk, for example. It still has it's peck-like attack that does damage that it will regularly do, but it will also have a swoop active ability (On a 15 second cooldown,) that doesn't cost any mana that adds a bleed effect to anything hit by it.\n\nNext up on the list is how things have been rebalanced, and the UI changed. If you place a turret down, say a ballista, you can still cursor over it and check it's stats - such as how much damage it does and fire rate. However, if you open your radial menu and select the tower out of that, then it will actually show you information such as the ballista's base stats, and how much YOUR stats add. It also gives you information on if certain stats, like tower speed, will affect it or not. Kinda neat, and somewhat helpeful! On the topic of rebalancing, I don't have any direct examples, but I can definitely say that after 712 hours or so of Dungeon Defenders this one definitely feels more fluid and even. Another neat thing is the dodge mechanic. You get 4 charges that replenish quite quickly, assuming you don't use them one after the other, and it gives you a horizontal leap in whatever direction your moving in. This is great for avoiding projectiles, jumping ledges, getting around the map faster or dodging that assassin that just jumped over you and is about to eviscerate your head.\n\nAll in all, lots of really, really nice changes in my opinion.\n\n[CONS]\n\nNothing is perfect, and dungeon defenders eternity is no exception. The game does suffer currently from some nasty bugs, some of which I've noticed particularly with Summoner. I've had orcs moonwalk through walls off the level and dissapear. I've had ogres decide they don't like where they are and relocate to a different spot, or go suicide in pits. I've had the kobold lit fuse running at you about to explode sound looped on my headset until the round was over, even though the last kobold had died a while ago. I have teleported to my cursor's position while selecting something from the radial menu three times, though I have been unable to purposefully recreate it.\n\nThere is a ... cash shop... shudder... I place this under cons because it invites the "Pay to win" aspect in games. No better example then the original Diablo 3. Thankfully, as of right now, all it contains is Emotes so hopefully their plan is to only sell cosmetic items through it. If that is the case, then I can remove this off [CONS] and place it in a [MEH] slot. As of right now, the tavernmaster pretty much only sells those emotes for cash, and some dyes, dye removal and respec potions so he's pretty much unnecessary at the moment which makes me kind of sad.\n\nWhile the thought of  having to start completely over from scratch does not personally annoy me or anything, I understand why it does others. It especially hurts if you played 100% legitimately, but still... It's understandable, to me, due to all the other changes. Once again though, I do miss my stuff and I know that others do as well, so leaving it here under cons.\n\n[  -----THIS IS THE BIG HITTER----\nYou have to be online to play it, since you have to be logged into their trendynet servers. Even if you're playing solo, just like Diablo 3, you have to be connected. Also, the tavern is now a... well... tavern...  You no longer have a private tavern all to yourself, as now it is a hub for all players. The bright side is you get to see lots of people running around doing stuff, but the bad side is that you're constantly being spammed by "SUCH AND SUCH HAS JOINED," and "SUCH AND SUCH AS LEFT." This wouldn't be so bad, except it plays that same noise as when someone would join your tavern in the original every single time, and also removes the tooltip if you're, for example, trying to compare two pieces of loot. When I have tried to figure out if I wanted to equip something, I've had to jump into a game just to keep it straight so I could actually compare them.\n[      You CAN still host solo/private games, but have to wait 40 seconds for "players to join." Not too bad, but if you fail the map, there's no retry button so you have to wait again.","July 24, 2014","true","75.5"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

New item slots have been added like trinkets to use during combat such as Flash heal, Instant tower repair, and even a holy hand grenade to deal with pesky skeletons. A new currency has been added called coins, which is used to upgrade your items instead of mana. There are orb like items which grant you increased exp, loot drops, and loot rarity which apply for the entire map and for everybody, further encouraging team play. Towers now have stat numbers available, so you can see exactly how your skills affect them. There have been some downsides however, such as now your armor appears on your character at all times, which makes you look gaudy if your armor selection clashes. I would like the ability to turn this off. The summoner no longer has minion points but uses defense points like everyone else, however has been buffed to compensate. The tavern is a public hub, which lags everytime someone joins for a split second, making inventory management a bit irritating. Overall though, I would recommend this version over the original any day of the week. If you've already bought the dlc for the first one, maybe only get this for 5$ or if the new features really appeal to you. There is one last thing to mention, and that is the playverse overlay. I mention it last because it's barely worth mentioning as it doesn't really add anything to the game, and account creation takes a few seconds at best. Don't let it dissuade you from this awesome version of a good game.\n\nEDIT: The mana that drops from enemies is not shared and is able to be picked up by anyone. I'm sorry for misleading you on that fact. Chests and items still remain as being unique to you and you alone","July 27, 2014","true","19.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I'm enjoying the game with a lot of other people, some DD veterans, some new. There are some emergency maintenances which disable matchmaking, but this is overtrumped by the revamped matchmaking thanks to playverse.

This version is altogether broken and filled with so many poor choices it makes it hard to enjoy. This is sad because DDE is a fun game with creative elements but...\n1. Mandatory online in order to play, whether solo or local. This is terrible for so many reasons. One reason is everyone starts in this small tavern hub and it's cluttered with people spawning and throwing spells around...its a mess. Shopping is difficult as you have to maneuver around to click the right spot not occupied by someone. The biggest problem of all is...I havent been able to play for an hour now as it won't connect. It keeps telling me matchmaking has problems...I DONT CARE, I DONT WANT TO PLAY WITH PEOPLE (outside my party and even then sometimes not at all). I paid to play a game not watch loading screens. mandatory online without ability to filter out people is just so strange and gives creedance ot those saying things like "mobile port", especially when in context of always online.\n\n2. inventory and shopping is one of the other great detractors from fun. I played one match today and spent 45 minutes going through every piece of poorly indicated (stats) junk to find one or two better items. Multiple clicks to manage, lock/unlock items, then finding what is part of a specific set (from what I hear equipping everything of a set is a bonus), then guessing what each little icon indicates for stats/perks. If that wasn't a pain enough, to compare an item to an equipped you hover over it, everytime something happens (someone logs in, changes chars, chats...) the stats dissappear and you have to continue to hover....and only then do you get to compare it to one of the two weapons as it never shows stats for both. The loot drop system makes this even more of a problem because you collect sooo many items in one match, give us a few appropriate or decent items to choose from, we don't need 50 pieces of junk not worth much money or even useable by our characters every match.\n\nNew players be warned nothing is clear, not exhaggerating I literally mean nothing. It will not explain what anything means outside of the obvious, just make sure you play with someone who is in the know or good luck.\nI kept the thumbs up in hopes this will be fixed, because the core of Dungeon Defenders no matter the version is fun and worth a play.","July 27, 2014","true","31.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

If a single one is destroyed, it's game over.\n\nThe general idea is to build tower defenses like any other tower defense game and defend the crystals, but the formula has never been done like this outside of Trendy's Dungeon Defenders series.\n\nThe entire game is played from a third person perspective, and during combat, you can run around and fight enemies much like a hack and slash RPG, all while gaining experience points to level up, find awesome loot and become one of the few elite heroes that can destroy anything without any trouble.\n\nIf you like tower defense games and you want to try a new spin on the genre with many new layers, give this game a shot!

If you buy this game, you get EVERYTHING free. So basically, I wasted around 30 to 40 dollars in dlc and this game. I have all the dlc for the original dungeon defenders, and basically, it was all for nothing. Still had to pay about 5 or 10 dollars for eternity, and I get no perks, cosmetics, or any kind of extra.\n\nIn other words, I absolutely hate that this game was released and that this company does not carre at all that we supported the previous game with so much money.\n\nTo anybody thinking "then just go play the other game instead", no, it isn't right. The other game is technically pointless now because everybody is going to transition over to this one. This one is more balanced and has a lot more to do to keep the game going. But it is so discouraging that I spent so much money on these games, only to be placed in the EXACT same spot as everyone else who simply paid 5 dollars.\n\nTo conclude, I will be researching more to see if I am incorrect, and if the other players can not actually just pick whatever look and character they like, but if I am correct, this company can be sure I will not spend another minute on any of their products.

Of course the launcher is totally different, but it's because of the non-stop hackers who ruined the game with their impossible high score. The mana really lost its value as a currency because it was quite easy to add mana to yourself. Now there are coins, and it's impossible to cheat because of the server based datas. This is a good point IMO.\nI think they made this game as an other game just because they didn't want to delete the old school game, so people can play at their favorite. But still, why made this one not free or for really cheap ? I already got my DD game, i don't want to pay for quite the same think...\nIt's not really expensive if you already have the game, but come on, 6€ until the 29th July, maybe 15€ after it's not nothing...\nA good point IMO, is that they listen to their customers, they made patch almost everyday in order to improve the gameplay and their game.\n\nSo for all the people who trash-talk every time against Nom nom games and Trendy, be patient and stop insulting a game without even playing it.

I knew from the start that yes it was the same game just with new features, no I won't have any of my old DLC since this is a new/separate game, and was excited about the visual gear (because I'm a firm believer in personal customization).\n\nSo lets jump into the game.\n\nWe start by making a profile which is fine. We did this in the old game, then we hit the “Play” button. I'm expecting to see a choose or create a character screen, but instead I'm in the tavern as a random cavern with a few dozen other people. In my confusion I just have to ask how do I make a character because nothing explains how. No brief tutorial, no inn keeper popping up on the side of my screen saying “hey, welcome, lets start by showing you around”. I actually restart the game a few times thinking this was a bug.\n\nOnce I find out how to change my character, I decide to start how I started in the old game. Playing solo and leveling three different characters: Mage, Series EV, and the Summoner.\n\nHours into the game, I find a few things very pleasing:\n\nCoin System: New currency system.\n\nEggs: Pets in the old game were super rare.\n\nPet abilities: Being able to have certain pets that do certain things helps with customization.\n\n4 new player abilities: These can be either eggs, consumables, or new skills.\n\nTrading through Play-verse: I can trade gear with friends even when they are offline.\n\nVisual gear & Dye: Again, I'm am all for customization.\n\nNew Survival system: Rather then just more waves, you start and are pressured to build as the waves progress. More skill intensive.\n\nHowever I also find other things displeasing:\n\nHaving to use play-verse to create groups with friends. Now I have no problem with games using their own system. Especially when multi-platform games. But the system its self is just super slow. Nothing shows you how to use it. Like having to create a party first, THEN add your friends rather then adding a friend and a party automatically being created.\n\nThe Tavern: I know this is supposed to act like a main player hub. I nick-named it “Stormwind” from World of War craft. A place where all players go to when not doing quest's or missions. However the Tavern was originally built for a single player. Being able to show case mission rewards and host there own shops to earn mana. A system no longer in the game.\n\nThe timer before a match starts: Maybe its just be being used to the old game where the match would immediately begin. I'm guessing it's like your League of Legends before play screen where it waits for everyone to load the data so the game play it's self can be smoother. But this is still the case for solo play.\n\nMake one character: Unlike the old game, you do no have split-screen capabilities that allow you to level up multiple characters, or invite friends to play on your account. This is more of a “if you want to play it, you must buy it on your own system.” which is in a total different direction then the first. But $$$ is $$$.\n\nCharacter swapping not as relevent. In the old game, to be a good solo player, you had to swap between characters during build phases. Build your towers, build your a.o.e bubbles, build your summoner minions, kill with your warrior. Now it's still possible to do this, but it's so hard to level a new character since you cannot run it yourself. Maybe running your own alts wasn't a normal intention even in the first game.\n\nWhat it needs:\nSome way to help players better understand what it is they are doing. What to do, and what everything means.\n\nIf it is so hard to level up multiple classes, show a preview or have a detailed list on what a character does. Like e.g. Barbarian. “Since he cannot build defense, he uses two weapons and stances to destroy waves of enemies” before players embark on the journey and waste their time.\n\nOverall:\nIf you own the first DD, if your looking for new new, this isn’t it. However this is a good refresher.\nI will stick in a few more hours because I just like the overall feel that DD gives and I know that this is still early and it's a preview for whats to come in DD2. Using DD as a trial and error system.\n","August 1, 2014","false","43.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There are small problems riddled here and there, but for the most part, the game is very fun, balanced, and entertaining.

Plenty of characters to be, and plenty of maps to play along with varying modes that are standard to Tower Defense games, e.g. survival, boss waves. The Action RPG elements are not similar to Diablo or the likes, but add a level of engagement above that of just placing towers.","July 28, 2014","true","19.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GraekEasterEgg/recommended/302270/","GraekEasterEgg","Graek Tarmikos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GraekEasterEgg/","366 products in account","ATTENTION! THIS REVIEW IS ONLY A RESPONSE TO THIS BUNCH OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND A COMPARISON TO THE FIRST TITLE , IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FIRST DUNGEON DEFENDERS IS LIKE, OR DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THE STEAM REVIEWS ARE TALKING, READING THIS WILL BE A LITTLE USELESS, BUT YOU CAN DO IT ANYWAY, I AM JUST A GUY WITH CAPS LOCK.\n\nYou know... this really surprised me. After i saw hundreds of negative reviews for this game i though that the game would be a disgrace to the humanity, and i will start by saying: Yes, it have its flaws, but it is not as much as Steam reviews are trying to convince there is.\n\nThe game uses the same gameplay style as the first one, and it is like you had all the DLC.\n"BUT HEY! THE GAME IS TRYING TO SELL SKINS WITH REAL MONEY""\nNo, it is not, you have a whole pack of skins in your inventory, what they ARE selling is Emotes, that are basically animations that prove nothing. It is not only not required, but also, no one that buy them will be superior to you in any aspect, you probably won't even see anyone using these things.\n"BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ADDING MICROTRANSACTIONS TO A PC GAME!"\nYes, that is true, but the same goes to the first game. Look at the DD1, look at the DLC quantity. There is a lot of them, and they are important things, like characters or missions. This one gives you all the previous game DLC included, comparing to that, selling emotes is almost a joke.\nAnyway, continuing the review... The gear thing is awesome, you can have the most riddiculous equip possible, your character will still look amasing, the feeling of gearing up is incredible.\nAnd about the new item types, there...\n"THEY WERE TOTALLY CRAZY DOING IT! IT IS NOTHING LIKE DUNGEON DEFENDERS!"\nCalm down... let me finish: Yes, the weapons ARE completely.. hm... peculiar. You still have the weapon types of the first game, but in this one, you have more. I already found a machine gun, a granade launcher and even a freakin' Flamethrower. Yeah. Completely not what you would search in a Dungeon Defenders game, but that is not necessarely a bad thing, i found it really awesome actually, these weapons are given a little "medieval" style, so it doesn't break immersion that much, and i found myself pretty badass while burning enemies.\nBesides that, they indeed solved that hackers problem DD1 had.(even if they did in a strange way), they tried to add Playverse in-game, so they can have some feedback before DD2. Also they solved their first week probl...\n"YOU COULDN'T PLAY SINGLEPLAYER OR OPEN A PRIVATE MATCH!"\nYes, yes... Stop interrupting. Even though they got that wrong, they solved really fast.\n"HOW ABOUT THE WHOLE LOAD OF OTHER PROBLEMS WE TALKED?!"\nWell. You can found online a chart the devs made showing the most talked problems with the game, and how were they handling it: First one was microtransactions, and they already pronnounced that every future mission will be free, and they will NOT sell level-increases or armor/items. The second and third were "no singleplayer" and "live texture streaming" things they already fixed.  Fourth was the confusing HUD and inventory system, what they said that it is a known issue and will fix it soon. Next on the list was that the game was a "portable device version of the original", and they already said that it is not (I didn't quite understanded this part, i have the DD second wave on my ipad and it is nothing like this game, and if they are referring to the way this game is presented, it obviously have something to do with mobile versions, considering it will launch to mobiles soon, with cross-plataform). And lastly on the list was the "must be online to play", what they are already fixing.\nIf there is something i do have to complain is the bugs, there are a lot of them, something small enemies glitches their ways into my defenses and stuff like that. Nothing game-breaking, but a little annoying.\nNow the pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n+Classic DD1 experience.\n+Gear showing up.\n+Awesome new weapons and armor.\n+Balancing fixes.\n+Graphical Improvements.\n+Devs are listenning to the feedback and trying to fix their mistakes.\n\nCons:\n-Loads of bugs.              (may or may not be fixed)\n-Confusing HUD.            (will be fixed soon)\n-Must be online to play. (will be fixed soon)\n-No private taverns.       (will be fixed soon i guess)\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nEven by screwing up a bit, the Devs are giving attention to the feedback and improving the game. The game have all the features DD1 Had. It adds all the DLC content the first game had for free. It did rebalanced the game, fixed the hacker problem, added some cool new content. If you don't have DD1, i recommend you buy this game, if you have DD1, i recommend buying this game, but if you have DD1 with all the DLCs maybe it is not worth the full price, since it doesn't add much, you could wait some discount.\n","July 28, 2014","true","14.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Game is not much different from Dungeon Defenders and the multiplayer hub has a habit of going down repeatedly, making multiplay impossible until whatever has been gone wrong is fixed, which in my experience has always taken far too long. The bottom line is that you can never scedule multiplayer with friends because you can never be sure if the service will be up or down. It also has some strange performance issure and random hitches which can really cause problems at the wrong time. As yet I haven't figured out why this is happening. I have a high-end PC which has no problems with much more demanding games, so I attribute the problem to poor optimisation or some other kind of oversight. Either way, save your money.","December 30, 2014","false","18.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Sure, you can buy the DLC and it gets fun for a week, but no one wants to spend $15 for a map and challenges and then $10 for some new heroes. This version, though, is great. It's only $15 for all the DLC and characters, and it comes with a ton of new maps and weapons. The crafting system is great, since most of the armor and weapons you create are very good, and the dyeing and costumes are a great addition. In the first game, I found it wierd that the equipped armor doesn't show up on your character, but they finally included that.

The amount of bytes in the negatives.. Which I found amusing. :)\n\nAnyway, into the game.\nThe game starts off with a good looking menu. You press Play. Instantly transported to the tavern, where literally everyone and their mothers are hanging out. You don't get to choose your class straight away, unless you look into the defenders forge deep enough, to find at the bottom of the character list, that you can choose between the four main classes. The tavern shop, is incredibly messy. I didn't know what was what, and where to go for whatever item I wanted to purchase.\n\nThis game IS TOTALLY MULTIPLAYER CURRENTLY. No singleplayer. Frustrating to say the least. But you can host a private game however. The mana graphics have changed so they all look exactly the same... (makes it worse really). The chests are buggy to open, take a lot longer than the original DD. Standard weapons do a lot more damage too. Other than, not much difference.\n\nThis game has MASSIVE potential, it just needs to be refined a lot more. It's extremely messy and all over the place. I do love the loot you can get now, you can get jewellery and temporary boosts and potions and whatnot. Also, I do love the fact armour shows up on your character now. PLUS!!\n\nOther than that, it's a bit of state at the minute. If you wish to purchase and experience it... be my guest. :) But I wouldn't recommend it, EVEN though this is a positive review. This is positive because of the sheer potential this game could have if done properly and is refined more.","August 5, 2014","true","12.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Time will tell if the online aspect will prove to stop the hacking from the first game.  That being said its good ole DD.  Few new surprises, but otherwise same game just more streamlined and simpilified.  There's a lot of gaming to be had for the entry price.  If you're like me and was a big fan of the first one, but stopped playing because of all the overpowered (and hacked) people that would ruin the games online then this will make you happy.\n\nIt has been so long since I've played DD I've been enjoying relearning the different techniques needed for the dfferent maps and making new friends along the way.\n\n\n\nAs for the people complaining about microtransactions they are only there to change the appearance of your characters, they in no way shape or form alter your characters power, stats, or abilites.  Its just for looks!\n\nThey also have been really good about addressing bugs and have been adding constant patches and updates to the game.  (in addition to adding single player options as well).\n\n\n\nBasically if you loved the first one and want to get your Dungeon Defenders fix in again then this is a great way to do it.","August 6, 2014","true","3.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So when you purchase this game it comes with all of the dlc that was with the first, plus a few new missions. That is the most important change. There are some differences which others have repeated many times the best of which is that loot (item drops, mana, etc.) is seperate for each person. So there are no more drop hogs that pick everything up whether it belongs to their class or not, and no one picking up all the mana for themself. Also your character now wears the armour that you equip.\nSo if you already own this game on pc, yeah it might not be completly worth it to buy right now, I myself would wait for a good sale. However if you are like me and have only owned the console version of the game, with 1 piece of dlc, it is worth the buy. Especially because the console edition never recieved the additional characters the pc version had. Or if you have not purchased or played Dungeon Defenders at all I would reccomend going for this game over the original as it comes with the dlc.\nIt is good to mention that this still in fact a "new" game that still has bugs, and incompleted things/ideas that they are working on. The major thing that I myself am waiting on is full controller support. It was in the original DD so it should be able to transfer to this game no problem. Yes I prefer controller for this style of gaming, you can go ahead and make fun of me, I am just very clumsy with a mouse and keyboard. Once that is available I will give this game a full 5/5 rating.","August 6, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pewpewpews/recommended/302270/","pewpewpews","PewPewPews","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pewpewpews/","386 products in account","Love it! Better balanced, better UI, better loot system, and NO MORE HACKING -- in theory. This is what DD should've been from the get-go. Contrary to what some of the early reviews said, this is NOT just a mobile port. And there IS both single player and private party play (though you still have to be online -- that's how they prevent hackers, as everything is hosted on their servers this time).\n\nBig changes:\n===========================\n* Online only play. No more hacked characters and items, hopefully. Matchmaking (presumably hosted on Trendy's servers) instead of peer to peer hosting. Hopefully no more hacked hosts.\n\n* No split screen, level xp revamped. You don't jump from 0 to 70 with three split screen characters in Tavern Defense anymore. You actually have to earn your levels with each character.\n\n* Towers rebalanced. Summoners now use DU like everyone else. Most towers cost less DU. EV buff beam nerfed so it's not the end-all-be-all must-have tower anymore. (Opinion: I think this is a change for the better, because now you have to think about which towers and heroes to use. It's no longer just poons + buff beams + minions. Will have to wait for higher level play to see how this turns out... but so far it seems promising.)\n\n* Loot system redone. Everybody gets their own private loot and don't have to compete with others anymore. Much more loot variety: weapons, sets, quality levels (tiers), etc. all much better. Loot's actually useful now.\n\n* Mana system redone: Every player gets their own mana chests (total chest mana is divided by number of players). They see their own crystals when they kill a monster. You can still drop mana for other players.\n\n* Microtransactions were only for the new emotes. All heroes, maps, and non-legendary/super-legendary costumes are included for free. (Not sure if this is because I already own them for DD1)\n\n* Visible armor sets and accessories for all characters. It's fun to see the Jester wear hats on her knees and belts on her hat :)\n\n* Pets now drop as eggs that need to be incubated and then hatched. All this means is that you carry them in an inventory slot for a wave or two and then double click on them to see which pet you got. Then they level up as before. But now every pet has both their old passive ability and a new active one. For example, the genie can summon a mana aura that increases mana drops in a radius for a while. The helicopter cat can add additional damage to your next attack (almost like hawk stance). The faerie does a large AoE heal. Etc.\n\n* A few new maps\n\n* It uses their own Playverse service for matchmaking/chatting instead of Steam. It really sucks, is buggy as hell, and completely unnecessary. Wish they stuck with Steam.\n\n* You can carry up to 4 activatable inventory items. There are Amulets that add skills like regeneration auras, poison DoTs, flash heals, etc. There are also bog-standard potions (healing, for example) and some one-time-use bombs, decoys, etc.\n\n* True hardcore mode: With this on, your character permanently dies (loses all levels and equipment) if s/he falls. The best loot is found in this mode -- for those willing to risk it.\n\nMinor changes:\n===========================\n* Revamped UI, with item sorting, filtering, etc. Better item comparisons. Better item and tower stats. Other quality-of-life UI enhancements: You can now filter out all lower tier weapons, for example, and then unlock them all and sell them all at once!\n\n* Armor & weapon dyes\n\n* Every character can hold two weapons and switch between them, like the Jester and EV could before.\n\n* Most DLC costumes available from the get-go, without needing requirements or additional payments. Legendary and Super Legendary costumes still need to be earned, if they're in the game at all (not sure yet).\n\n* Consumable items (health potions and whatnot)\n\n* In-game currency is now gold coins instead of mana. Most chests, monsters, etc. drop coins. You can also sell items for coin. Coinage is abundant at least in the early game.\n\n* Currently, the real-world money shop only sells emotes for your costumes. Not sure if they'll add more things later.\n\n* You can make a short forward dash several times before needing to recharge it (basically a sprint)\n\n* Finally, rebindable keys (or Xbox 360 buttons -- including readying and dropping mana!)\n\n* Borderless full screen mode\n\n* Minor graphical updates\n\n* You can now type full sentences in chat! No longer limited to the previous 70 or so characters.\n\nConclusion\n==========================\nDefinitely worth it for $6. I've switched to this for the online play alone, to be free from hackers, and probably won't go back to DD.","July 23, 2014","true","35.3"," 22 of 47 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","22","47","0","0"

While the hackers in the original game didn't ruin the game (we're all against the monsters anyway), it did cheapen the experience. Perhaps now "Level 100" will actually be a sign you're competent enough to take lead on a defense.\n\nI am slightly disappointed by the Summoner nerf (using DU instead of MU) but it's probably for the best.

It comes with all the popular defences of the original is more stable and from what theyve said it hard to hack which is nice. ITs also a fun way to start from the beggining the new pet system is awesome with hatching eggs you find during defences. I loved the original. If you can get over PLayverse being another account to sign up for its worth it. And if you own the original its 6$ and I say completely worth it even as someone who bought every DLC I just consider this a dlc that makes me restart. Also Hardcore permadeath adds meaning to beating all levels on hardcore. Only issue I didnt like where minions from the summoner taking DU instead of MU but from what a dev told me its to properly balance late game and the new campaign theyre working on. So I'll let it slide. Dont follow the hate Eternity is nothing more than paid DLC that we've gotten time and time again it delivers what it promises.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/owlswah/recommended/302270/","owlswah","Harru","http://steamcommunity.com/id/owlswah/","406 products in account","((Review reworked 24/7/14 - yes, this could be considered 'in constant development'.))\n\nPlaying Games with Bad Reviews so you, my friends, won't have to if it's a bad buy! ...is my personal motto for this review, because I've heard a lot of bad things about this. Like, a lot of bad things. Like, seriously, this game had severely negative reviews when it first launched and I can't blame them. It is supposed to be the definitive Dungeon Defenders experience, and while it may be shaping up to be one, I can't help but feel... well... annoyed, and somewhat disappointed.\n\nUpsides/What is new\n\nNow, first things first, this game is basicaly DD1 with a new engine, there's no two ways about that, the game has been rebalanced and tweaked and looks better in some ways, looks worse in others. It still plays pretty much the same: Build towers, kill monsters, collect loot. The upside to this is that DDE has all the heroes and their costumes unlocked for you right out the gate, well, whatever was in DD1, anyway, who knows if they'll offer costumes as a microtransaction.\n\nThe game plays just as well as the original, with a few QoL tweaks like client-side mana and equipment (thank goodness), the fact that the currency is replaced with gold coins so that you no longer feel the need to leave mana out on the field, the ability to AUTOMATICALLY JUMP OVER SMALL OBSTACLES (10/10! GotY!) and the fact that there's more equipment slots plus the ability to weapon swap in the middle of a wave even if you're not Series EV (which is her gimmick back in DD1, although it seems useless now because her towers are pretty good for support.).\n\nThe UI is decent enough to fuss about with, it's not terrible, but it sometimes feels a bit clunky like the item box interface. No idea how crafting works, and my hotkeys get reset everytime I go back to tavern. There's not much of a tutorial to figure anything out if you're a newcomer, although some veterans reportedly had some trouble with it as well.\n\nTaverns are now public... that's something I'm not too sure about, sure, it's nice to see other people in the tavern but some people don't like to see strangers running around, spamming attacks, towers, and so on. I tend to ignore such things, preferring much to get out of there as soon as I can.\n\nDownsides/Problems\n\nWhen this game first released, and this is going to be an understatement, there was a terrible fuss over how the game was missing some of its advertised features. Single-player and private lobbies? Patched in after the fact. Cards and Workshop? I dunno when that came in, but they're there now. Third-party accounts? Not advertised at launch, but there now. Always-online DRM? Not what most people were expecting. Cash shop? Bluh.\n\nHowever! The company seems to be putting a small effort into fixing a few things if what they've been doing didn't tip anyone off, so at least they're trying to make things work.\n\nSo, acknowledgements of missing things at Day 1 and general fussery aside, what's the problem here?\n\nThe servers breaking in the first few days of launch doesn't really come as a surprise to me, these days. It's probably just me, but I just don't really expect any company to handle their launches very well, but perhaps I've been jaded by seeing so many online games releasing and then buckling under the pressure of people coming onto the server and breaking them. When I first played this, they were fine, although it was after the initial surge, I believe, or I was playing at a quieter time.\n\nThe cash shop in a paid game kind of rubs me the wrong way, although they're selling cosmetics right now, so that kind of mitigates it, it's still a cause for concern. Right now, I don't feel too strongly about it, but I would feel wary about it, just in case.\n\nOverall\n\nAll in all, this is not a bad game, but it's been sullied by how it was handled right out of the gate, and that doesn't put a lot of trust in their customers. The price for this is questionable, but having a hefty discount for owning the game plus the initial release sale at this time of writing brings it down to a price I can somewhat agree with. Sure, I'd prefer it to be more or less free or be a patch for DD1, but if they insist on it having a price, then so be it, but the initial asking price right now for a small upgrade doesn't fit the bill, perhaps when it is more fleshed out then the price would have more worth to it.\n\nAnyway, it is up to you as to whether or not you should buy it. If you don't particularly care much for Trendy's antics and want to play Dungeon Defenders, this could be a good pickup for what it's worth since it has the Eternia Shards levels packed in with it. However, if registering a separate account on Playverse and having a game that requires you to always be online irks you, but you still want this game, I suggest you go pick up DD1 over this.\n\nSide note: I honestly wish there was an undecided option for reviews on Steam whenever the reviwer is unsure on whether to recommend it or not, like in my case. Honestly, what happens in the future can tip my view on this game in whatever side's favour.","July 24, 2014","true","9.0"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","11","25","0","0"

With that being said though, that game and community were completely dead for me. The fact that people could get anything they wanted just by running a program in the background killed it for me in every sense of the word. This game has been given new life with this release making it a LOT harder for people to just hack and get what they want. One cool/weird thing they did with this game though is you don't download anything until you need it. That means when you first start the game, EVERYTHING is going to be super blurry. Just give this some time and it will pass as you download the required files. So far this game has been wonderful and fun to play again and really helped revive a game that just wasn't fun to play anymore.\n\n--UPDATE--\n\nAfter playing this game for almost 60 hours now after its first release I can honestly say that the game is better than its previous counterpart. While the game is still going through some growing pain as far as the servers adjusting to the player load, the staff seems to be really helpful and quick to fix any issues that come up. The staff also takes a lot of what people are saying in the forums and fix what needs to be fixed.\n\n-- Conclusion --\n\nIf your reading all these posts saying stuff like "THE SERVER IS DOWN, WE CANT PLAY" or, "This game sucks, there is no single player" then your just reading peoples first impression. Even WOW couldn't keep their servers playable for the first couple days and DD is doing a way better job than they did. The single player is now enabled due to popular demand. They are fixing every issues as they come up including server down time. When it does go down its for like 5 to 10 minutes tops and this only effects you if your not already in a game, it wont kick you out of one you already have going. Ignore these trolls who didn't give the game a fair shot or are just upset that their hacked max item set can't be transfered from the old hackers resort version of the game.\n\nGET THIS GAME","July 24, 2014","true","67.9"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

Trendy made a huge mistake shoveling this reskin under thier banner tho that had nothing to do with developing it. It is pretty much a Greatest Hits album with some skuffs on the disc. All textures have to wait to be streamed to you. The interface is absolute crap. (took me asking how to switch to a differnt class because there is nothing to tell you what to do.) No tutorials. The in game store is totally changed with some things costing real money. Yes the game plays much of the same with a few tweaks to inventory. But this rehash is unneeded if you have the original+ all dlc. The game has not aged much to need a high def reskin. But even if your a new player. Go buy the original it plays better and you dont spend a half hour or more trying to get your bearings ( and I beat the original and I was still lost in the GUI choices )","July 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Because i'm so used to the game loading instantly in DD once a level is picked and now this whole countdown waiting for player stuff has been implemented it needs to be tweaked slightly. Add a check box that allows players that are ready to tick, and if all players have loaded and ticked, they can begin instead of waiting for the whole countdown, me and my mate have monstrous gaming pc's, 95% of the loading time is us waiting about.\n\nTrading: i know the game has its reasons for having our own client side loot, and it is great i enjoy not fighting over loot anymore, but it would be nice if i could just right click an item in my inventory and click drop and it becomes server side, when playing with more than 2 friends its time consuming clicking trade on each person when if a "drop" feature was implemented everyone in the game could mouse over the items i dropped to see if they are better and take them, if not ill scoop them all back up, i miss that.\n\nThese are just a few of the problems in this game in comparison to the first, it bugs me when developers seem to lose a lot of good aspects to a game that were in previous versions, this should be every good thing from the last and much more, which in most cases it is, just these little things let it down.\n\nI'm a massive DD fanboy and i do love this game, i could spend all day pointing out the amazing points of the game which is why i chose to just dig at the negatives a little hoping it would get some feedback out there and hopefully eventually sorted.\n\nhighly recommended game guys, if you loved the first you will love this one more!\n","July 24, 2014","true","34.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Will update this once I played more this weekend.\n\n>edit\n\nOkay so after playing for a bit longer tonight, the only real complaint I have is that of the new tavern system. Anyone familiar with DD will have spent a lot of time in their OWN tavern, but now you have to be in a public tavern, and connection issues galore a lot of the time you can't even connect to one. This leads me with the issue of sitting at the end of a game for 10 minutes trying to leave so I can start a new one, but unable to go to my own tavern, it's really frustrating, I spend more time waiting than I do playing...\n\nAnother annoyance is that you can't make your own public game. So if you want to play public, you have to play with people you don't know. Yes, you can create a private game, but what if I want to level up a DPS character and can't solo some of the larger maps (for example), and can't be bothered to use my builder? This means that you can either play with randoms, some of which are bad... not blaming them, some people might not have played DD to my extent, but I don't want to play with new people at the moment, I want to experience the "new and improved" end game. And sometimes it can even take 5-10 (sometimes longer) to even FIND a game for your level/difficulty/map... So the only other option is a private game.\n\nOther than that I'm enjoying my time, I think I'll wait until the connection issues are fixed and I can actually host a public game and/or tavern to remove the complaints I talked about above.\n\nIf you're a veteran DD player and you have the $$$ to spare, pick it up and see what you think, it's really not as bad as some people on here have made it out to be, the connection is ♥♥♥♥ and the way you actually get into games is also ♥♥♥♥, but the gameplay itself is as good as the original we all loved, maybe even better with the new pet "active" abilities and trinket type items.\n\nIf you've not played the previous DD, I wouldn't bother spending the amount of money they ask for on this UNTIL they fix what I mentioned, after those are fixed I have no issues with this game so far.\n\n_______ ONE MORE THING_______\n\n"Eternity was created to give you, our fans, an opportunity to revisit Etheria while allowing us at Trendy to test an alpha version of playverse, the server technology that will host Dungeon Defenders II. This project has already undergone rigorous testing and feedback from a group of dedicated Defenders, and we can’t wait to continue improving and refining with the help of our entire community." - DD2 Blog - Please stop complaining about how this is the same as the original DD.","July 25, 2014","true","181.7"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

Without hacking, with some extra content.  As such it gets my full endorsement.  As someone who came to the party late, there was no point in playing public multiplayer due to the hacking.

The only thing you can (currently) buy are useless Emotes for $1 - all skins and dyes are earned as usual, as are all weapons, armor, etc.\n3) Dumbed down or DLC deficient - the gameplay is identical, and the UI is largey the same or slightly streamlined\n4) Lacking single player or private matches (both were added with a day 2 patch)\n\nThey did add a uPlay-like launcher to the game that might annoy some, but I found it to be seamless.  They need the overlay to offer cross playform play later on, which steam cannot do.\n\nDrawbacks:\n- You cannot import your characters.

The original game is fantastic. This one is a insult to every Dungeon Defenders fans out there. Trendy Entertainment lost me with this. There is nothing that is actually new. You may gain four maps, but you loose more. And now you have to pay with microtransaction stuff that you already bought with the original game. That's a big Up yours from Trendy."\n\nReview few months later with more objectivity (Still subjective):\n\nPros:\n- Good game concept (reference of the Original Dungeon Defenders here)\n- Fun and active gameplay\n- Different classes that you can play\n- Has loot\n- Has leveling\n- Has character statistics\n- You can see your gear on your character (difference from the original game)\n\nCons:\n- It's a game made of streaming\n- It's a pale copy of the original\n- Missing good elements or the original\n- Has microtransaction (For a copy that you have to pay for of a game you probably already have paid for it's ridiculous to not even have access to all the old content without paying again and again)\n- It is called the "Definitive Edition" even though it's a downsized version of an amazing game\n- Every map you play for the first time takes longer to load since the game is being streamed.\n- It is sold like it has more content that the complete version of the original even though it has less.\n- You can only play online\n- You don't have your own tavern anymore so the one that is used as a lobby is always full of people, making it harder to browse your stuff, manage your inventory and test your DPS on the dummies\n- The "new arranged stuffs" from that game to make the game work proprely and prevent hacking and cheating should have been an update to their original game, not a copy\n- There is more negative stuffs on this game that left my mind at the moment, I will add more if the tought of the game ever cross my mind again\n\nConclusion :\nIf you really want to play that game I strongly reccomend to wait for the orignal complete package to come back on sale. It worth the 12$ or so. The original game alone is still fun, but this particular version is frankly a rip off. Of course, everything stated in here is a personal opinion.

New features, new interface, all the DLC character packs, new levels, etc.\nBut oh boy is that ever not what you get.\nThere are some improvements, definately, and it is nice to have a version of the game that runs stably on Mac (original DD has lots of unresolved crash bugs on Mac). I like the new money system (gold coins instead of mana points), and new types of equipment (like talismans which give you special abilities), and I like how they've done the pets (they start in eggs now! You don't know what it will be until it hatches!), but the overall experience of the gameplay is miserable. It is very laggy and the controls are poorly responsive. Enemies attack while stunned, which makes short ranged attacks pretty much worthless. You can't play through the campaign be progresing through levels in a story-like format, you have to return to the tavern after each level. Final waves don't sell junk automatically, so if you want the points for it you have to collect it all and sell it back manually, which is a real nuisance.\n\nDungeon Defenders (the original) is an exceptional game, and as this one is basicaly a redesign of that, it is a fairly good game as well. But I will be sticking with the original. I just wish I could have the improvements of DDEternity with the smooth controls and gameplay of classic DD.","September 28, 2014","false","3.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

If your someone new to the series and wants all the things mentioned above and doesnt mined all of the flawes i have mentioned, go right ahead. But from me, I would like to say if you put some notes saying that it isnt compatible with your old saves and that, then it would be fine. Don't disguise somthing as somthing it isnt is the moral of the story. If for the original you put a complete DLC pack for about £10-20 then you would have so many happy people buying it. in my opinion, don't bother, but those are my two cents and hey, i'm not gonna stop you if you want this.","October 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freyar/recommended/302270/","freyar","Freyar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freyar/","1188 products in account","Dungeon Defenders Eternity is a bit of a surprise to most. A game that changes up the multiplayer aspect of the original Dungeon Defenders game to better protect itself from cheating (which was apparently a huge concern for the original game) is now caught in ethical crossfire as to whether or not it should be a free update or what-have-you regarding those who owned it.\n\nIn the end it doesn't matter. A game stands at $19.99 for a redeveloped online-only release of Dungeon Defenders using the same back-end that Dungeon Defenders 2 will use. Is it fun? Very much so. Just like the original game I've found myself addicted to the game and found it even cutting into sleep these past few days.\n\nBuild Towers, defend crystal, level up, get stats, fight again with a harder map or difficulty. DDE supposedly improves this aspect by making a rebalance pass on items, making it a little more fair when it comes to upgrades. While I didn't have trouble in the first game, it is nice to know things were looked at a second time.\n\nAs far as items go, you now have them actually displayed on your character. Get a helmet for your summoner? Shows in game. All these items can also be dyed, which in turn gives a much more personal touch on the game as you play through.  Pets also have a new mechanic that allows you to find eggs and hatch them. While so far it feels like an extra step to the process of obtaining gear, I have a strong suspicion that there is more to it than first appears.\n\nSome new content has also been added. Challenges and maps that are supposed to be a bridge from Dungeon Defenders and it's sequel while allowing you to earn gear for when Dungeon Defenders 2 comes out. This is interesting as I personally can't wait to see what challenges there will be.\n\nSince the game is online-only, there are some issues with performance. Server latency can impact the game as can disconnects in the newly tuned Hardcore mode.  This also means those with poorer quality connections may have trouble with this version of the game, however this was done with the intent of keeping all user data server-side to prevent tampering. For those that were frustrated about the cheating going on in the first game, this may be the solution (though admittedly it may cause a bit of grinding teeth since it isn't a patch.)\n\nIf you haven't played Dungeon Defenders before, now is a great time to get into it. $19.99 and you get almost all the content that was released in the first game, plus a little more in a secure environment. For those who owned the first game and its DLC, it becomes a much more difficult decision. Did you want a safe environment to play, or did you stick to solo or private matches in the first place? Where you frustrated with balance issues in later game modes?\n\nAt $10.99 it's hard to recommend to existing players if they truly didn't have issues with the first game. However, at a lower price (like at the time of this review) it's much easier to make a compromise and move up for $5.99 instead.\n\nI like the game and while some of this business leaves a bad taste in my mouth, it's hard to not enjoy what time I have with it.","July 24, 2014","true","42.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

Upon hearing of it's release, I bought it immediately, despite the criticism it had gained over the first few hours of it's launch. I can certainly say that some of the complaints were justified, but most of the main problems have been patched out of the game, along with balance tweaks and more. Micro-transactions are contained within the game, but are only tied to cosemtic taunts in game, that do nothing to benefit the player, other than look cool. Dungeon Defenders Eternity also comes with most of the DLC from the original game, including all the characters, the Lost Eternia Shards DLC, and the start of a new campaign. It also contains the ability to transfer items to the upcoming game Duneon Defenders II.

Having to incubate an egg by fighting with it equipt and waiting (im)patiently for it to be ready to hatch was a lot of fun, I have a seperate folder in my Item box for eggs and pets, I currently have a Shoddy Shroomite with 22 upgrade levels, which is great as you dont invest coin to upgrade them, but fight alongside them to get XP for them.\n\nSecondly was the addition of visable armour, nothing surprised me more than noticing I had not only the witch kings great helm on, but a tiny little crown sitting atop it, not the most ferocious looking but still novel and fun, adding dyes to armours and skins was a interesting edition as I can finally get back into the customization of my character and I actually have to work towards it.\n\nThe game has enough new features to outweigh the current teething problems on the serverside with the occasional drops and inability to join games (sorted by hosting private and publicizing it). With responsive and active dev teams working on the community highlighted issues (such as the odd UI) I feel that given time DDE will be the true 'definitive' version we were promised.\n\nMany negative reviews are given from the perspective of those who like DD and refuse to accept any variance from their accepted view of what is "right" for the series, however after logging several hours in both games I have found that most of the faults they find are all without any real impact other than the server problems which is common across nearly all new releases.\n\nIn conclusion, given time, this should prove to be more of a gem than people are giving it credit for.","July 27, 2014","true","29.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I think this is a plus because I felt we were being forced to use Minions as they effectively doubled (Or even triple since you don't need to use up half their points as walls) your defense strength / amount of placeable towers for damage.\n- All loot is instanced! No more loot ninjas! All Chests are instanced to you (and whatever come sout of them), I think dropped mana from enemies is NOT instanced though! So be fair for that, but all other loot, go nuts!\n- New Dash feature that lets you do some quick jumps ala UT/Quake style! (Although you have a stamina bar and right now you can only do it via the ctrl key, so no double tapping a direction for now)\n\nCons:\n- It costs extra (But overall it's cheaper for new players, and 70% off for owners of DD1 now, which I feel is fair as the dev's have obviously put in a bunch of effort.\n- Always online (I think this is ALSO a plus, stops hackers, allows you to play while the big/highrez textures stream in (First time only, so expect some blurry textures at first but trust me they do get better)\n- In-App Purchases (But these are purely costmetic, right now they're just $1 emotes)\n- Public Tavern (Which is actually really good for some people but for me it causes big lag)\n- Slow internet means you will get lag, no matter your settings in game, but I think it's bareable. (Like mine, damn having bad internet in Australia)\n- Having to start from scratch even though you might have already spent hundreds of hours in DD1\n- Splitscreen/Local Co-Op has been removed. (I'm hoping for it to return though, as this is a huge con for me)\n- Survival Mode is forced "Continuous" which means (at the moment) No switching characters, and no chance to either stop, go pee/sammich/greet loved ones or, for the slow ones out there like me, loot/upgrade/repair without worrying of a DEW stabbing you in the ♥♥♥♥.\n- Textures start off super low res (But this is so you can get in the game faster) and download overtime as you play (As do maps), this can cause extra lag and make the game look very bad graphically, but just give it time and those sweet sweet graphics we've come to know and love will come rushing in! (It's a first time thing for everything, but after that first time everything will already be downloaded and therefore not a blurry low-res mess.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I bought it and will continue to play (hoping end-game RNG is fixed so we don't get max level gear with -50 stats)\n\nEDIT: I will be updating this as I experience new/more parts of the game!","July 23, 2014","true","58.1"," 19 of 42 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","19","42","0","0"

Spent 24 hours fixing the launcher and getting the game to launch.

I really tried.\n\nI should have listened to the reviews, there is not a single game, BESIDES THIS ONE that I want to refund.","November 26, 2014","false","4.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Maps and gameplay very unrefined.\nOffline mode to prevent playing with cheaters. But game balanced around the OP stats everyone had online. That is what I meant by obsurdity.\n\nDD1E:\nHas limited options and maps when compared to original (very disappointing)\nNearly no hackers since game files are on company owned equipment.\nI feel the items were earned through player efforts making the average item level economy feel more justified.\nHonestly this is the more refined version of dungeon defenders.\n****This is where we should of started so people wouldn't have ranted.****\n\nI honestly miss a lot of the content but if they release it later. No problem.\nHowever the lack of cheaters in this game is to much of a pro to pass up\n\n*Since steam's game value system only is a thumbs up or a thumbs down. Rather then a numeric value system. I will have to lean towards thumbs up. That's because of conversion rounding. LOL, why isn't there a meh horizontal hand.","August 6, 2014","true","82.0"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
