It has a convoluted sense of humor akin to a Yotam Perel or Edd Gould cartoon, but with more f-words. The gameplay involves 2D stealth platforming similar to Mark of the Ninja, but with a pixel-art style and a noir theme. The music is great, and makes you feel like a modernized incarnation of a gumshoe detective as you punch out guards and rewire electronics while trying to solve a twisted, oppurtunistic murder.\n\nMy personal score for Gunpoint is a 9/10. There isn't much true replay value to speak of, which takes away from a perfect score from me, but like I said I had a lot of fun replaying levels and achievement hunting for over 15 hours after I had beaten the game.","May 5, 2014","true","21.0"," 226 of 245 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","226","245","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/206190/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Richard Conway is a private detective in the wrong place at the wrong time. Shortly after strapping on his new pair of hypertrousers he finds himself on the receiving end of quite a few pointed fingers, the result of making himself seen on a security camera seconds before a key figure was killed in the same building. Rather than come clean and hope the police believe his story, he decides to take the easy root of breaking into the companies headquarters and destroying the footage, and hopefully getting out with his new coat blood stain free.\n\nTom Francis's Gunpoint isn't what you might think. This isn't a game about guns, or about pointing them; it's about jumping through windows like a maniacal frog and rewiring security systems to suit your needs. To an outsider I imagine this sounds incredibly silly, but that's part of why it's so brilliant. It manages to be both self aware and hilarious, yet remarkably smart in every aspect of its design, and the pieces come together so perfectly that it never ceased to blow me away as I dug deeper into it.\n\nYou could call Gunpoint a platformer, but if anything it's more of a human catapult simulator. Using your futuristic hypertrousers you can jump incredible distances without the worry of a quick death when you hit the ground, or more accurately, smash through a window or onto an unsuspecting guard. Movement is made even more fluid by Conway's spider-like ability to climb walls and cling to ceilings, essentially turning you into the ultimate cat burglar as you effortlessly move through buildings. It's an extremely impressive move set that feels amazing and as if its constantly evolving as you play, with new levels making use of moves you may have never used or even known were possible before, creating a constantly satisfying and stylistic loop of continual mechanical growth.\n\nStanding between you and a parkour bonanza however is a plethora of electronic doors, security switches, cameras, alarms, and other traps that will send you home in a body bag if the guards are alerted, or simply stuck in place. Luckily Conway comes prepared with the ability to hack and rewire these devices to his own uses, with the animatronic like guards being more objects that need to be rerouted than anything resembling human intelligence. This is where Gunpoint evolves into something beyond a clever hook into a ridiculously smart puzzle game, allowing you to quickly reconfigure circuits to set off other devices, open doors, disable guns, and on the whole make you feel like a tech wizard. It's not so much the great mechanics themselves that make Gunpoint an amazing game though, as it is how they are balanced so effortlessly between being clever and keeping the player moving forward, something all to often lost with puzzle games but that Tom Francis has got down to an absolute science. There was never a moment when I felt I wasn't doing something useful in Gunpoint, and even when I failed the brilliant auto save let me quickly restart just seconds prior..\n\nIt can't be stressed enough just how much style Gunpoint exudes, from its subtle but unique art design to its masterful noire tinged soundtrack. The graphics are simple yet have a ton of detail squeezed into every pixel, with superb use of lighting setting the mood for a dark detective story and smooth animations allowing you to forget how simple the character designs actually are. Gunpoint succeeds most where so many "retro" games fail in making itself instantly identifiable and memorable, and using its aesthetics to compliment its mechanics and narrative.\n\nI said it before but I'll say it again, it blows my mind when I think about how amazing every single moment of Gunpoint is. The writing is witty yet crafts an engrossing, compelling narrative that didn't need to be complex for me to devour every line of dialog eagerly awaiting how it would all end. The mechanics fit together as if they share a cellular bond, evolving and challenging the player while keeping them in constant control and giving them the option to approach encounters however they see fit. The absurdly polished presentation makes it effortless to sink into its world for the few hours it takes to complete, which left me satisfied yet eager to go back and see how I might could play through it differently. It's an absolutely astounding accomplishment for something almost entirely developed by one person, and a brilliant experience that topped any expectations I might have had before hand but have since been all but forgotten.\n\nNow if I could just get a pair of those pants for myself...\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 23, 2014","true","3.3"," 91 of 100 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","91","100","0","3"

Absolutely flawless in every aspect I can think of. From graphical representation, gameplay mechanics, level progress to humour and level design, I loved it.\n\nYou are in a role of one Richard Conway, a freelance thief, or a cat burglar (I like the way it sounds) who finds himself in a tricky position at the start of the game and has to complete all sorts of missions for his multiple employers to get himself out of the trouble, and learn some secrets along the way. The story itself is very interesting and made me play just one more mission, so I won't spoil any of it, just so you can feel the same way I did.\n\nThe main gameplay mechanic we have control over is Crosslink, with which we can rewire the building's electrical skeleton, which consits of various doors, switches, lights, alarms and such that we will manipulate to help us get to the intel we want. Different types of guards make the gameplay more challenging and force you to plan your way more carefully. The missions start out easy and ramp the difficulty up as you progress in the game. After every mission a new contract will be ready for you along with the amount you will recieve upon it's completion.\n\nThe characters are very well done, and I really liked the main guy's style and humourous way of dealing with things along the way. You can upgrade your character with new gadgets after every mission, and your own stats, such as longer and quicker jumps.\nFluid gameplay makes playing this game an absolute delight and I have not encountered any bugs in two playthroughs (except for some typos, but it's ok :)) I've gone through.\n\nOh and there is a level editor, so you can create your own levels and spice it up with everything you got, or you can play other people's creations if you are not a creative type.\n\nOverall:\n\n+ fluid and responsive controls\n+ simple, yet aesthetically pleasing graphics\n+ great story\n+ level design\n+ humour\n+ level editor\n\n- absolutely nothing\n\nRecommended to everyone, this is a little masterpiece and go do yourself a favour and play it right now.  10/10","January 7","true","12.3"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","96","45","47","11","0"

The main gameplay mechanic involves rewiring switches and electronic devices. For example, if you need to open a locked door, you can link a light switch to the door so that it opens when you press the switch. As the levels progress you can create lots of complex solutions. Walk in front of a surveillance camera to summon an elevator which sets off a sound detector which opens a trap door causing a guard to fall to his death. The story revolves around corporate espionage and murder, and the whole game has a great sense of humour. Character dialogue is text only, and the graphics and sound are basic, but the music is pretty good. Unfortunately Gunpoint is quite short.

It is sold at full price for £6.00 (but has been sold on Steam previously for £1.20), and has Steam Trading Cards and Achievements.\n\nGameplay:  The main notable features are the crosslink and wirejack mechanisms, which allow you to rewire electronics and security systems in ways that will allow you to progress and solve the level. The main character – Conway – also possesses ‘Bullfrog Projectile Trousers’ that allow him to jump around the map with enough force to break windows. Throughout the game, you can use upgrade points to improve both the speed and strength of the jump made by these trousers, which are extremely useful during later levels. The levels felt mostly varied, but only 3 guard types made it somewhat easy to slip around undetected. In the shop, the player can purchase additional skills which can aid in their attempts by adding more features and functionality to the Crosslink device. Money and upgrade points are earnt after completing missions. Overall, the difficulty of the game was not hard – the longest time I had spent on a level was around 7 minutes (and this was on the last level), and I’m sure others could complete it quicker – but the acquisition of new upgrades and skills meant that you could revisit older levels and complete them in a faster, more efficient way.\n\nGraphics / Graphical Design:  The graphical design of the game fits extremely well with the setting that the developer was hoping to accomplish, with the design of the main character being a particular success, fitting into the grungy, detective theme that was aimed for. The main overall design is 2D pixel, with all assets made in relatively high quality.\n\nAudio:  The soundtrack of the game was pretty damn good and fitted into the style well; it felt very jazzy at times. Aspects of the soundtrack were of a slightly similar vein to some of the aspects of the Mission: Impossible soundtrack, but this is probably what the developer was hoping to accomplish. The actual sound effects themselves were great, with the only one lacking slightly being the gun, which sounds a bit tinny (and a bit like a cap gun). But overall it was a solid soundtrack that contributed to the overall experience and ambience.\n\nPersonal View:  I have to say, this is one of my favourite stealth games and the experience put out by the game was good, solid fun. I never had too much trouble trying to solve levels, with a lot of my time spent figuring out how to get an A+ rating on every level. I particularly enjoyed this game since it allowed me to creatively approach a situation – solutions are not linear, and you can achieve your goal in many different ways. I have finished the game 3 times as you may be able to see from my play time, but each playthrough did not deteriorate in experience.\n\nReplayability:  The average time to complete the story on its own seems to be around 3 hours on average, but more time may be spent gaining the A+ rank on levels based upon the different ‘badges’ you can get - for example, having no witnesses, or making no noise – and this seems reasonable incentive for the player to continue. There is no New Game + mode in this game, but I believe that in this case it does not matter and is not applicable. Some people may not get as much time out of the base game as me, but the amount of workshop levels that have been created is bound to extend the playtime by at least a few hours.\n\nFun:  I found this game to be a good source of entertainment for at least 10 hours, and in this time I have not completed too many of the (generally well-made) workshop levels. The fun aspect comes from approaching levels in different ways and trying each time to solve the ‘puzzle’ in a different way. It can also be fun to come back after progressing further into the game with more upgrades, as this allows you to potentially unlock new areas of the map.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED – A solid stealth title with unique mechanics and a decent storyline.","November 24, 2015","true","11.1"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","23","23","3","0"

I’d heard such great things about it, but due to an increasingly-large backlog of games that I haven’t touched, this one got shelved and I honestly forgot about it for a long time.\nBig mistake. Gunpoint is one of the most unique and enjoyable indie games I’ve played this year. The innovative gameplay style, the storyline, the dialogue, music and aesthetic all came together to create a very nifty little package.\n\nSetting\nYou play as Richard Conway, a trenchcoat-wearing freelance spy. Immediately after donning your newly-received Bullfrog Hypertrousers (high-tech pants that allows you to make massive leaps), you’ll be summoned by Selena Delgado, an employee for gun manufacturer Rooke. Unfortunately, by the time you ascend the elevators to see her, you find that Selena has been shot. Even worse is the fact that security cameras in the building indicate that you were in the building at the time of the murder, thereby making you the prime suspect.  You're then tasked with clearing your name and finding the true murderer. Throughout the game, you quickly discover that there’s a huge rivalry in the city between two weapons manufacturers, Rooke and Intex, and the murder of Selena Delgado fits somewhere in between this. There are several twists and turns in the story as the mystery surrounding the murder is slowly brought to light.\n\nIt’s not the most original or innovative story ever told, but the game breathes extra life into the story to life by giving the main character so much personality. Much of the narrative is told in the form of text messages between you and the people giving you missions to fulfil. During these text-based conversations, you’ll often be given a conversation tree, allowing you to pick your response. Whilst the majority of choices don’t affect the direction of the storyline, many of the lines are incredibly humorous and witty. If you want your version of Richard Conway to be a complete smartass, you’re in luck. It’s been a while since a game has made me laugh out loud like this one.\n\nGameplay\nDespite looking somewhat like a 2D-platformer, Gunpoint is a puzzle game at heart. It plays like a 2D version of Portal in many ways. Rather than using the portal gun, you're instead given two other major abilities that you'll use to complete objectives.\n\nThe first of these is your epic super jump, which allows you to jump massive distances and with force great enough to break glass windows. You aim your jump with your left mouse button (which will draw an arc) and release it to make the jump. For whatever reason, you’re also able to climb walls like Spiderman, but we’ll leave that alone for now. The other major ability comes from your "Crosslink", a device that allows you to rewire circuits. It sounds complicated, so perhaps it’s best illustrated with examples. Whilst anyone can flick a light switch, only  the roaming security guards have the ability to activate the switch to open the security doors. To work around this, you can use your crosslink to hack the light switch so that the switch that usually turns on the light instead activates the door-switch, which opens the security door for you. A more complicated scenario would involve you hacking a motion detector, which upon activation will cause an elevator to move down to a certain level, which subsequently activates the sound detector (which hears the “ding” of the elevator), which then opens the vault door containing the computer that you have to hack to complete the objective.\n\nThe game becomes far more complicated in later levels due to the addition of extra circuits, represented by a separate colours. Only objects of the same colour can be connected, and activating these additional circuits in the first place requires you to access a point to “wirejack”. It adds an extra layer of challenge and forces you to be more creative in your approach.\n\nAside from the main objective, each level also includes several optional objectives, which usually boils down to either minimising violence, ensuring no witnesses are alive, or hacking a laptop that’s placed in the level. Performing these optional objectives rewards you with a higher grade that’s given to you at the end of the level, although getting higher grades doesn’t appear to reward you in any way (other than, well, bragging rights I guess).\n\nUpon completing each level, you’re rewarded with a certain amount of cash, which can be used in between levels to purchase several tools that’ll make your life a bit easier. The Hushcracker, for example, allows you to go flying through windows without making a sound. Whilst I would question the realism of such a device in the real world, the point is that it works, and it helps you navigate around the security guards like a ninja.\n\nWhilst there’s probably an ideal way to complete each level, the game gives you a butt-tonne of freedom in order to find your own way through. The game encourages trial-and-error, and is very forgiving when you make a mistake due to the fact that it kindly autosaves every few seconds. Upon dying, the game gives you a choice as to where you’d like to restart. Since there’s nothing in the world that frustrates me more than re-doing simple segments of a game over and over again, this is stupendously appreciated. Tom Francis, you’re doing God’s work here.\n\nIf there’s any gripe with the game that I have, it would have to be the short length. Sadly, you’ll reach the end of Gunpoint before the 3-hour mark. Clever and humorous achievements (probably the best I've seen in a long time) might extend the time a little, but overall you’ll likely be so enamoured with the game that you can’t help but wish there was just a little more of it to go around. Luckily, the game features a level editor and Steam Workshop integration, which allows you to both create, share and download levels from other people.\n\nPresentation\nThe game takes place in a very simple pixelated 2-D art style found so commonly in the indie industry. It looks absolutely fine in its own right, but playing at the higher resolutions make certain objects or switches just a tad too small to see. Furthermore, the game looks a bit dark, which can make certain security personnel (notably the all-in-black Professionals) a bit difficult to discern at first. Other than that, you’ll hear no more complaints from me about the aesthetics.\n\nAlso included is a very jazzy soundtrack that appropriately accompanies and builds on the dark, crime-filled motif that makes up the games setting.\n\nOverall impression\nDespite all the hype surrounding the game on release and all the wonderful reviews that the game had, I really wasn’t expecting much from it. Needless to say, this short journey that ended way too soon completely blew my expectations and more. The beauty of the game is embedded in the simplicity and addictiveness of the game mechanics and the humorous, tongue-in-cheek writing that complements the dark tale.\n\nDo yourself a favour and buy this game.","January 7, 2015","true","6.4"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","0"

I'm not sure what to call it... yeah, I guess "puzzle" or "puzzle/strategy" makes the most sense. You play as a little trenchcoat-wearing pixel guy whose mission is to infiltrate a series of buildings, steal something, and escape without getting caught or killed. While most levels do have a clear-cut "solution", there are a variety of ways you can go about your mission, thanks to various special abilities and upgrades you get along the way. The two biggest tools at your disposal are a jumping ability that allows you to leap up to (or fall down from) crazy heights without dying, and something called a "crosslink" that allows you to hack into a building's electrical network and rewire stuff on-the-fly. For example, you can wire a nearby switch to open a door on another floor, or trigger an elevator remotely to distract a guard. The crosslink mechanic allows for a crap-load of possibilities, which is good, as that's the main meat of the game. You can also utilize violence as a means to an end in your solutions as well, either by punching out guards, threatening them at gunpoint, or outright killing them. Tying all of this together is a story full of twists, turns, and turns that twist around again. Frankly, it's kind of convoluted, but it does all make sense by the end (assuming you pay attention). The entire game can be completed in roughly 3-4 hours, so it's not overly long. I suppose this could be a bullet point in the "negatives" column, but I felt it was a decent enough amount of content for the price. It's fun while it lasts, and is worth checking out.\n\nTechnical notes: while the game itself is fundamentally good, a few technical issues do bring it down a bit. I ran into several bugs in my playthrough that caused critical elements of levels to stop working as they should, forcing a restart. It's not a huge deal, as most levels can be completed in just a few minutes, but it is worth noting. Additionally, there are some really weird resolution issues with the game. If you set it at a high resolution, you can see more of each level, but that also means that the tiles and sprites that make up the levels get smaller, making it more difficult to play (at least, I thought so). This issue can be solved by setting the game to a lower resolution so that the important areas of each level fit mostly within that area (I found 1600x900 to be a decent size, or possibly slightly larger depending on your monitor).","August 26, 2013","true","8.6"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","30","41","0","0"

It feels like a more stealth-based, zoomed-out, 2D version of infiltrating an open-ended area in the original Deus Ex, in that the level has a goal, but it's set up as a playground to allow you to explore your abilities and exploit opportunistic, er, opportunities.\n\nIt doesn't take long to get through this, but I enjoyed every moment of it, and some significant branching decision points in the game and in the dialogue make me wonder how things would change around in a second play.","October 9, 2014","true","3.7"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

I had already finish this game several time outside of steam before finishing it several times more while on steam therefor my playtime is not reflective of the game itself. Should be 3 - 4 hours tops.\n\nGUNPOINT	Developer: Tom Franchis and others.\nRelease Date: 3 June 2013\nGenre: Platformer, 2D Espionage, Detective, Puzzle\nOfficial Website: http://www.pentadact.com/	What is Gunpoint?	A stealth action platformer game made by an ex PC-GAMER editor Tom Franchis using gamemaker.\n\nThe game stars you as Conway, a freelance spy for hire who also happens to be a hat fancier. The game has you break into building quietly or if you happen to be a jerk, loudly, to accomplish your objectives and mission before getting the hell out. Also comes with the unique twist in the form of the wirejack module.	Option Menu	Very Good\n\nYou have a wide variety of options to choose from rebindeable keys to colourblind options to the large range of resolution on offer. The only issue is if this incredibly basic game lags on your laptop then the best you can do is lower the resolution since there is no graphical option settings.	Graphic	Good\n\nThe game is a stealth 2D espionage game therefor the main concern should be clean graphic style and easy to identify elements all which Gunpoint delivers very well. While the basic sprite based graphics aren't too much of a looker they do have their own charm in Gunpoint noir inspired setting. At the very least you won't confuse the background with the buttons.	Music/Sound Effect[MERGED]	Music:The game has a soothing nostalgic jazz based music while in the menu screen and a quick jumpy music while in mission.\n\nSFX: Very good, other than the fact that gunshot sounds like popcap gun, everything else is near perfect. Especially the SFX of the glass being smashed and guards face being pulverized.	Controls	Excellent\n\nYou use the mouse to aim your bullfrog module and alt button to toggle your wirejack. For most part Conway controls well enough to not feel like you're controlling an ice skater in the middle of a competition. 	Gameplay	Now that I have written at length about Gunpoint other point lets touch upon its gameplay mechanic. Your character has a basic device called the Bullfrog Propulsion Module which is the mainstay of most of the mechanic. You press the left mouse button to aim a reticule and releasing the result in which Conway will propel himself rather weakly towards the direction you have given him.\n\nThe other highlight is the wirejack system where through a series of module you can buy Conway will turn the electrical grid to his advantage by rewiring doors, calling elevator and other such gameplay elements.\n\nOther than that, it is a fairly standard stealth game.  Guards have cones of vision that you can sneak through using the walls and ceiling or if you are feeling particularly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you can just Bullfrog straight into them and punch them in the face. That is a legitimate gameplay element. But its not just 1 type of guard no, more will be introduced as you play through the story mode.\n\nMission usually involves you breaking into a building and either retrieve something or to hack something, basic stuff but the level design and short length of the game keeps it fresh.\n\nAfter a mission your results will be tallied and you can acquire a skillpoint used to upgrade the Bullfrog charge time and power, the money you earn can also be used to purchase modules for Kenway which ranges from snuffing out the noise he makes when he smashes through glass to him having a gun to literally make a guard stand still at Gunpoint.\n\nAnother thing that should be touch upon is that while the game itself is linear the story outcome itself is not, choices of dialogue you made and the result that comes from it will indirectly influence how other character will think of you and will go so far as to change the ending itself.	Conclusion	Recommendation? Yes I will say this a yes old chap. Its a fun quirky little game that does not overstay its welcome while having a rather deep story that encourages a few playthrough to get all of the ending. If you were to trust my words then yes I would tell you to get it and to get it at your convenience.\n\nScoring Methology:\n-S-Rank: excellent\n-A-Rank: very good\n-B-Rank: solid\n-C-Rank: satisfactory\n-D-Rank: inferior\n\nVerdict: S-Rank. [Short Quirky And Fun]\n\nCredit:Thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help!	Extra Note	This game has hidden achievement so the achievement hunter out there might want to use a guide to get it all but otherwise the normal achievement itself is easy to get.\n\nThe Special and Exclusive edition contains some extra goodies but if you do not feel like it then just get the one with the soundtrack, the tune is rather relaxing.\n\nAlso has steam workshop support so you can upload your own level or play with others to expand your playtime.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480355380\nGunpoint\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480355430\nMenu Screen Showing The Game Mission, Upgrade And Shop Button\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480355500\nOption Menu\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480369637\nResolution Option\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=480369739\nBullfrog in Action Also Graphic Showcase\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/206190\nStore Page\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews","July 12, 2015","true","3.4"," 31 of 43 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","31","43","2","14"

I can't tell you much more than that, you really have to see it in action. It's a cool device.

As soon as I started the game there is a small cutscene that welcomes you to the game and I loved it immediately from then. This game is one of the few games I can say that is nearly totally original being a weird platformer hack-them-up stealth game.\n\nGunpoint is a game about breaking into buildings with the aim of stealing data from computers, simple enough. But the way you must make your way through these levels is by rewiring circuits to activate doors, alarms and even enemy guns. The whole game can be made slightly easier and arguably more fun by buying addons like the ability to use your own pistol or smash glass silently.\n\nAs you can probably tell I don't have many hours on gunpoint and thats probably because it isn't a very big game. The actual game took me about 2 hours to complete and I just needed to play more, thank god there is the workshop. I apologise that I can't comment on the storyline as I gave up following it after about mission 2, however from what I did read, the game gives you a lot of opportunities to choose your own path in a humourous and personalised way. The "choose your path" style to the storyline also grants you the opportunity to multiple endings and ways to kill the final boss.\n\nAll in all, the only downside I have about this game is the length of it, I do feel however that this can be overlooked with the addition of the workshop. The gameplay is original, the graphics are awesome, the soundtrack is seriously amazing and it has one of the best checkpoint systems in a game ever (allows you to choose one of 3 checkpoints at time increments). Is it worth the £6 ($9.30ish)? Totally, I couldn't recommend this game more to any kind of gamer... seriously, get it now!\n\nI would have to give this game a strong 9/10.\n\nEDIT: I actually worked and got all the achievements in this game! totally worth the effort!","October 31, 2014","true","5.1"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

You're a detective and have multiple choices for interaction with your clients. (Naturally I was as condescending and insulting as possible – the reactions were very much worth it!)\n\nGameplay: The game controls start out very simple, jump, and movement. You jump with the mouse button, and you use ASDW to move right or left, and climb up or down. As you complete various missions you earn skill points that you can spend to improve your skills, and money to unlock upgrades. Some missions require certain upgrades to progress, but generally the game is very doable with minimum upgrades.\nGenerally there are two elements to the various puzzles you face while playing Gunpoint. Firstly, you need to keep out of the site of guards. This is where the “stealth” tag gets placed on the game. The guards line of site is pretty standard for most games of this genre... Secondly, there is “wiring” you do some very rudimentary “wiring”, for example you can wire a switch to turn off a light, call an elevator, ...and when the elevator arrives it makes a noise and that triggers a sound sensor to open the door in front of you.\n\nAchievements: There are two types of Achievements in this game: Hidden, and visible.\nI personally find “hidden” achievements annoying because you can find them by looking at global statistics anyway. (The purpose of hidden achievements are for people to accidentally stumble across them while playing the game.)\nAfter your first play through you will probably have roughly 40% of the achievements, a second play through will earn you another 40% (as long as you do things differently). After my second time through I simply replayed the levels required.\nAs a side note, you don't need to reset your game and start from scratch like I did, you could just replay old levels. Since the game is such a fast play through anyway, it hardly maters if you reset or not.\nOne final note, for achievement hunters, this game is an easy 100% completion with relatively less commitment for achievement work.\n\nPrice: Gunpoint is priced at $9.99. I personally spent 8.6 hours playing the game. I played through twice, and earned all the achievements. As far as I'm concerned the game value comes out nearly perfectly at 1 dollar an hour. (this is my personal method of measuring a game's play value)\nIf you're tight on money you could certainly wait for a sale, however... the developers are indie, so supporting them is good!\n\nConclusion: The game itself was fun, the humor in Gunpoint was hilarious, the story was well written, the gameplay was fun and easy to learn, the achievements were all relatively easy to get but more importantly funny to get (generally the achievement text is a joke based on what's happening in game), the price is as fair as you can expect.\nI recommend this game to anyone who enjoys 2D games, indie titles, puzzle games, or “stealth” types of games.\n...Maybe all that matters is that I now have the ability to kick down doors. Thanks for reading my review!\n\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update July 01, 2015:\nSpellcheck","July 1, 2015","true","11.6"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

Even if you are going to spend quite a time analyzing each level you will probably spend 3-4 hours max. However, it got big replayability potential, because not only each level supports different solutions, but also ways of playing it. It allows you either rely on your planning and tactics or also just pure luck. One of the things that I really liked is that you can choose whatever equipment you want at any point of the game (If you have enough money) so If you buy pistol you can refund it anytime and grab something else instead.

I did eventually read some of the dialogue that takes place before each mission and it put a smile on my face as it is humorously written and its nice to see that even in game. Smashing guards through windows, remodeling their faces through means of punching and causing general prankster shenanigans feels rewarding in a strange way.\n\nMost missions will task you with stealing some data from a computer in a secure (or so they thought) building with guards, locked doors, security cameras and such devices. But once you've reached specific points in the building, you can hack it all. Hack the guards gun to fire when you flick a light switch, make a wall socket buzz out electricity killing a guard when another guard walks through a motion sensor one floor above... its all possible.\n\nThe fun part is, you can ignore it all and do it your way. All levels can be beat without any guards noticing you were even there - the true spy way. You can go in, kill everyone and make Rambo proud or just have fun hacking everything you can. It is a puzzle game as its core, it can be as tough is you want it to be - killing everyone will generally be easier than going in sneaky peaky like.\n\nIts worthy to mention the soundtrack is fantastic and blends with the game nicely. I wouldn't penny pinch if I was on the fence about getting the special edition. The main story will take about 1-4 hours to complete, depending on how you play and how bad you are at puzzle games. It does come with an easy to use level editor and steam workshop support where other people's levels are shared. This potentially gives countless hours of replay-ability.","September 17, 2014","true","5.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

You play as a spy (think Inspector Gadget) who's missions consist of stealing video tapes, taking out targets, or simpy hacking into  corporate servers to get info that you in turn can use to help the Corporation or bring it down. This game also gives you decisions story-wise that allow you to be the morally "good" guy or if it's your thing you can be a murderous "bad" guy. The story is not long by any means, you should be able to finish it in about 2-3 hours. The replayability is definitely there though. Each mission gets graded which makes you want to go back and beat your old score. You can beat the game in a few different ways. It's also backed with steam workshop, so you can create your own missions and confrontations or just play someone other persons creation.\n\nGameplay wise think "Mark of the Ninja" mixed with "Watch Dogs". The mechanics are heavy on stealth and strategy. There is no one way to complete a mission, instead the game gives you options on how you want to beat each level. Want to kill everyone and leave no witnesses? You can. Want to sneak past every gaurd after you hack the lights and beat the mission without killing anyone? You can. Want to just knock their asses unconscious and move freely? You can. In between each mission is a shop where you can purchase items (Revolver, etc..) and spend upgrade points (Higher jump, faster jump charge time, etc..) I would recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy, nior mysteries, or dudes in trench coats.\n\n\nHere's a recap of my first play-through>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\n\n\nA case of crossed wires\n\n19 dead. 28 injured. 20 jobs. $13,000.

Cool atmosphere, fun puzzle solving.\n\nYou play as a sardonic (darkly humoured/ironic) spy-for-hire, its a "film noir/gumshoe/detective" aesthetic with some really funny, self-aware, and crass humour throughout the campaign (see Acknowledged Ludonarrative Dissonance achievement). You're faced with a few narrative changing decisions, and objectives that require you to use unlockable items (some cool/funny ones :D ) and problem solving talent to complete missions. Overall, really good level design; some missions aren't as challenging as others, but are still a lot of fun to play given the solid mechanics, humour, and punny dialogue. You'll get a good 3 hours out of the campaign, and there is a level editor to keep you coming back (although, really its the narrative/campaign/missions that make this game worthwhile).\n\nI really enjoyed this game.

I dislike most puzzle-platformers, but this one is very light on platforming: you can clearly see where you’re going to land before you make a jump. And it autosaves every 5 seconds or so, you don’t have to replay the whole level if you screw up. Great gameplay, story, writing, music, pixel art. It is quite short, though. The biggest flaw is its poor support of highres monitors (there’s no scaler, the sprites look tiny in 2560×1440 or blurry in 1280×720 (with hardware scaling); the only solution is to use windowed mode and Windows magnifier to scale things up—inconvenient).

It's good, SO GOOD I'd recommend others to get the Special Edition for a few bucks more. (I don't work for SD in any way, shape or form). The story is pretty straightforward, the actions players make doesn't influence the story much, if at all. However, the dialogue is funny. They dont take themselves TOO seriously.\n\nThe gameplay is where Gunpoint takes the cake. It's difficulty varies depending on how you want to tackle the levels. It has a low skill floor, this is for players whos playstyles are influenced by the likes of John Wick or Deckard Shaw, no-nonsense playstyles where what they do doesn't matter as long as they finish the levels. However, completing levels whilst making minimal noise and leaving very little witnesses feels very rewarding. These different ways of completing levels gives the game decent amount of replayability.\n\nThe gameplay gets 10x better towards the end. Having the ability of kicking down doors like they're nothing is great fun! Dont think that's fun? Imagine your 16 year-old self being late on your first day of high school. The strict, old, cranky lady you have as your English teacher has little tolerance of latecomers. The door is locked. "Jokes on you, woman!" you shout. The door is knocked down, the woman and your fellow students alike stare at you, dominance is immediately asserted the first second you come to class. Your territory? Marked.\n\nI'd like to give a shoutout to Root-chan for providing me this opportunity.

With the ability to jump to absurd heights and stick on anything, walls and ceilings included. Each mission has some preamble to give some context and is very clever and quite funny. Your objectives include (mostly hacking into a monitor) or picking up laptops.\n\nThe crux of the gameplay is staying out of sight. Turning off lights, hanging off the ceiling and tackling the guards. One simple punch should do the trick. Preceding to the objective and extracting. Buts that not all. You soon discover that you are magic.. or least have the ability to connect things electrically from great distances. This process is called crosslink. You can switch between regular vision and crosslink with a simple flick of your mouse wheel. There are multiple colors which basically identify the different circuits in the building or buildings on the map. You can try things like connecting a switch to a door so that when flicked it operates the door. I'd elaborate but experimenting is its own reward, the proverbial 'EMMERGENT GAMEPLAY' that marketing teams get so excited about. There are sockets, alarms, cameras, sound detectors, elevators among other things for you to experiment with. These are sometimes puzzle-esk but mostly serve as tools to infiltrate undetected.\n\nYou die real fast. One shot one kill but what's great is restarting is almost instantaneous making experimenting really fun and interesting. You can even choose to start at different intervals some seconds away from when you met your demise. There are also gadgets that require batteries that can can aid you in infiltration and those things are fun but the best way to play is to get real familiar with and into crosslink to prevail, the most rewarding way if I was to give a suggestion. Arguably, the ability to crash through windows silently may be a bit over powered but that ability is mitigated by using a lot of your batteries.\n\nIn a recent update after I finished the campaign twice (it's relatively short, about 4-5 hours) user created levels are now available in the steam workshop. Which invariably as user created content goes has some truly great levels and some others that are less than stellar.\n\nTHE GIST\nI love this game, one of the very very few games I bothered to actually go after all the achievements and actually get them (as some are hidden within dialogue choices and gameplay actions and are very rewarding) plus enjoyed the process of doing so as well as just experimenting with the mechanics. I'm not entirely sure if this was exclusively the work of Tom Francis or if someone helped but regardless of that. This absolute gem is worth every penny.

Or a detective who is really good at hiding in the dark? Or just like to beat the living daylights out of someone? Well, Gunpoint lets you do that, and much more. Gunpoint is a 2D indie strategy puzzle game that is visually represented via pixel art (and it’s very well done, might I add) that lets you infiltrate buildings and steal top secret data. Though, unlike most games nowadays, you can’t simply walk in and take the thing. As what the category says, you have to what war veterans would say: strategize; and invent your own solution to the level. This makes the game very interesting, for there are so many options to solve each puzzle. You can turn of lights, and attack the guards in the darkness, or just come up behind them and punch them while their comrades point their guns at you. Also, you don’t take fall damage (because ♥♥♥♥ you, physics) so jumping out of 20 story buildings is okay! Sometimes, Gunpoint can provide some hilarious gameplay.\n\nGunpoint is exclusive with not only it’s gameplay, but also with it’s storyline. At the start, the story can be quite hard to get a grip of. But when you progress, it becomes a bit easier to understand. On that standpoint; the storyline overall, is brilliant. It’s quite interesting, dark, and sometimes humorous from time to time. Gunpoint also has a very unique little system called “Crosslink”. In this you’re able to change functions of many objects; like to link a button to open a door. This will be your main component in the game, and it’s also very fun to play with. Gunpoint is that kind of game that lets you interact with your environment and change it to your advantage. This can end up to a very interesting way to outsmart the guards, and to trick them. Each level challenges you, slowly getting harder until it’s almost cruel. All of this and more adds up to an original and superb game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/206190/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Gunpoint is fun and can be appealing to all crowds, however though the puzzle factors for action gamers can be hindering.\n\nThe game consists of a man who was given a suit that can absorb impact from jumping from obscene heights. The suit also gives the man amazing powers of being able to attach himself to any wall (or ceiling) and jump really high. Guards cannot be taken on directly without being shot and armored guards cannot be taken down. There are however ways to overcome certain challenges and guards that are not armored can be taken down from behind. When you do die you are given the choice to go back in time a few seconds, five seconds, and ten seconds.\n\nThe pretense is to sneak around VIA jumping, stairs, elevators and steal information or an object. This is done by "wirejacking" certain circuits. You can "wirejack" or connect say a light switch to a door that you need opened, because you've connected a light switch in another room and turned off the light - that guard goes to the light switch, flicks it on thinking it'll turn on the light when it reality it opens the door for you - and now you're free to run wild. The game starts with simple colored red circuits but as the game goes on the difficulty increases.\n\nUpgrades are available throughout the game as the player collects more money. Upgrades can consist of arming your guy with a pistol or allowing for higher jumps.\n\nThis game is fun don't get me wrong, the idea behind it was good. I feel though there could have been something else introduced to give me more reason to recommend it. I like the game, but I feel the rating is an honest one.\n\n7.4/10","November 16, 2014","true","1.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Each mission has you perform a few simple tasks (usually hack a computer or steal something), the challenge is in getting there. Which can be done in whatever way you wish.\n\nUsed to guards seeing you causing a game over? Not in this game.\nNo way forward except killing the guard always looking at the elevator? Not in this game.\nTime limit on the mission so you have to take risks? Not in this game!\n\nEverything is up to your play style, you can be a patient and calculating infiltrator that takes a long time but comes away unseen (and get acknowledged for both of these things) or go in fast and dirty, knocking out all guards in your path (and be acknowledged for both of these things too!).\n\nBetween missions you are presented with some well-written conversations between the protagonist and his various employers.\nThe only thing left I can consider listing are the abilities you can get over the course of the game. You can jump really high, climb all vertical surfaces, hang from ceilings, rewire electronics so a light switch on a different floor opens up a door and, yes, keep guards at Gunpoint.\n\nThis game was a delight from start to finish, and my only complaint is that there should be more of it.\nThere is an extensive level editor, and recently even steamworks support for it, but I want more of the story too!","July 9, 2014","true","12.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Even if it is short, it's worth whatever price you spend on it, wether full store price or discounted.\n\nThe gameplay all has a really nice feeling. It is centered on stealth, where you have the ability to jump great distances at will. A lot of things could get the guards' attention, especially breaking windows and the "ding" sound of an elevator reaching a floor.\nIt has some nice humor too, and the game sometimes makes fun of itself.\n\nThe part I liked the most in this game was the soundtracks, as they're somewhat dynamic and they're actually nice songs. Other than that, I liked jumping over unsuspecting guards and reaching my objective without hurting anybody and even not letting them know I exist.\nAlso, the autosave system in this game... It's cool stuff. The game autosaves every ~5-6 seconds, and also before any important moves. If you close (and autosave) the game while in a mission and re-open the game later on, it'll instantly load the autosave on the mission you were in, which does great for casual play or simply quick play.\n\nThe difficulty of this game can vary easily, as you are not punished for taking a long time to think about how to infiltrate a facility. You can make it a little more difficult by not enabling special perks, and by playing in a certain way. This game is great for all players. Don't worry, if you're a hardcore player (Dark Souls as an example), you'll still love this game because of the many things it has.\nIt barely has glitches too, and they're not gamebreaking.\n\nMy rating is 10/10, quite one of those must play games.","September 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game design is so inteligent, well thought, that this premisse could make an AAA successful game easily. Wait a sec... yeah, Watchdogs! Now that I thought about it, this game is like a Watchdogs 2d, except this one here came earlier and is more awesome on its own way. I mean, this game did not need to be a $50+, super graphics, "open world" to be a bad ♥♥♥ innovative game.\n\nPS, Watchdogs fans: I'm just kidding, guys. Watchdogs seems pretty good aswell, even though I still have not played. Also, they are definitely different games with only good similarities.\n\nBack to review:\n\nThe levels on this game are perfectly designed to improve the difficulty more and more and the learning curve of your "hacking powers" is great. Challenges you will face includes lasers, armed guards, sensors, alarms, doors, noise, police, etc. Think of this game like Mission: Impossible 1 (the very best).\n\nGood gameplay is good. Innovative. You need to plan every movement, wire ("hack") the right cables on the right moment to close a door over a unarmed guard, or to keep an armed one stucked in a room. You can buy a lot of upgrades aswell, like, for instance, a cloak for jumping across glass without making noise, or upgrades on your pants to jump higher.\n\nThe story also has a good part here. Is great, fun, intriguing and yet light and casual. Each level is a mission that you receive as a job from secret employers. More than one time you will need to make a choice, take sides, etc. The payment for mission completion is what lets you buy new stuff and upgrades.\n\nDon't fear this game. The title might be misleading but it's not a 90's shooter, its more like a stealth game 2d.\n\nI recommend this game to pretty much everyone, since awesomeness is meant for everyone. You'll have a good time with this and replayability grants you another few fun hours if you wanna see all the endings and/or if you are an achievement hunter.","June 23, 2014","true","9.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a little hard for me to describe just how hilariously crazy the narrative gets without spoiling the experience, but when it opens with the protagonist accidentally flinging himself out of a fifth story window you know you're in for a good time.\n\nYes, the game is short. Very short.  Even without bypassing puzzles by smashing through windows or incapacitating guards, it only took me around three hours to complete the storyline. There are no sidequests and only a handful of collectibles. That's possibly my biggest issue with Gunpoint - the sheer lack of content makes it feels more like a tech demo than a fully fledged game. But considering this is the creator's first game (and made in GameMaker, for Pete's sake) I'm not fussed.\n\nThe level editor also might as well be nonexistent. While it's relatively easy to create or install player-made levels yourself, the lack of a Steam workshop means there's barely any public interest in doing so. A dialogue editor also would have been a nice way of making custom stories, but would probably be a nightmare to code. (Edit: Steam Workshop compatability has since been added. Fantastic.)\n\nAs much as I'd love a more fleshed-out sequel (or at least some sidestories/sidequests), I'm more interested in seeing what else the creator has in store. Dude's got a lot of promise.\n\nAdditional: If you're looking to buy the Special Edition DLC for just the soundtrack, don't bother. Go to the official Bandcamp page instead - it's five dollars cheaper and comes with bonus tracks, remixes and unused audio files.","March 15, 2014","true","10.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's hard to nail down as any one particular sort of game, because it does all its constituent parts so incredibly well. Much like a good book, you'll find yourself looking forward to every step of Gunpoint, even as you pine for the part you just came from.\n\nGunpoint is the story of Richard Conway, a snarky freelance thief who specializes in corporate espionage. A fateful job lands him in the middle of a murder mystery with a surprising number of twists and side stories. Each mission sees you sent into stylish 2D high-rises to pilfer goods or information. There are guards to outwit and doors to unlock, mainly through your clever Crosslink system. Gunpoint lets you wire devices together to make them interact in unexpected ways, like a light switch unlocking a blast door or a trigger pull setting off a wall socket overload.\n\nWith the Crosslink at your disposal, levels become sprawling puzzles of networked electronics. You can create incredible chain reactions of chaos and diversions, allowing you to slip past security at just the right moment. A few additional gadgets give you greater flexibility in doing just that, like spring-loaded trousers, climbing gloves, door-flattening kicks, and more. Money earned from missions are used to upgrade your abilities, but levels are designed to be completed with any or none of the optional skills unlocked.\n\nThe core gameplay is plenty compelling enough, launching yourself through plate-glass windows and jury-rigging entire skyscrapers to your whims. But it's the writing that elevates Gunpoint to an instant classic. Dialogues between Conway and his clients are snappy, natural, and endlessly entertaining. You get plenty of dialogue choices, split between realistic decisions and creative variations of the same responses. You'll have every opportunity to tell your foes off or ingratiate yourself to the more sympathetic characters, and every branch is its own reward of storytelling.\n\nAll of this is wrapped in a delightfully detailed pixel package and a moody noir soundtrack. The menus smack a little of programmer art but that's literally the only complaint I can level against Gunpoint. The story will last you about two hours but they're some of the best gaming has to offer, and there's Workshop support for user-created levels. I'm not saying anything about Gunpoint that hasn't been said a thousand times before, but it's worth my time if I help even one more person discover it. No matter what you enjoy about your games, you're sure to find it here.","April 4","true","2.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Most games don't have your character glibly text his contacts the bracketed notes you assume are for your own benefit.\n\nThe puzzles are engaging, tricky, and combat is hilariously satisfying. The game is somewhat dynamic and you can play for most sides like any true espionage agent. You can play like a consumate professional, or you can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with spring-loaded pants and an itchy punching fist.\n\nThe only real downside is that in the end, it all boils down to a single ending. It's an ending you can handle several different ways, but it's the same one, really.\n\nProtip: Don't get too fancy when you clear the final level for the first time, save whatever battery you have, because whatever you have at the end is how much battery you have for any post-game easter egg hunting you might want to do.

The art is simple but effective, using its minimal tech to create a convincing mood. The jazzy soundtrack is perfect for the story. And while its particular selling point of rewiring the building around you as you sneak through it wasn't implemented as well as it could have been, it still makes for some highly elaborate, complex solutions to puzzles at times.\n\nEverything about it was a treat, and I didn't have any complaints but for its fairly short running time.

Perhaps its because of the pixel art, but I want to draw parallels between this and Monaco, another game which continually occupies a significantly percentage of my consiousness. I am not even certain it is reasonable to try to draw a parallel, but emotions are running hot and baby ain't nothing going to stop this steam engine.\n\nThey're not similar in the gameplay so much, which are actually quite different from one another, so much as the atmosphere and theme which evoked similar feelings. They both share the mechanics of guards and security cameras and the ability to hack the environment. But the short story is that Monaco is almost impossible to top. The puzzles in gunpoint are never very hard, but stopping for a moment to analyze the situation does unfortunately pull you out of the action.\n\nNot every meal needs to be tenderloin in a mushroom pan sauce.

Platformer is nothing new... Donkey Kong and Mario had been around forever. Stealth games are nothing new either. Metal Gear had been around for a long time too. But combine the two, and a healthy dose of puzzle via the Crosslink, where you hack switches, doors, and more, by rewiring them to do something else, and you have something unique yet familiar. As a super freelance agent, jump, sneak, and bash your way through the levels doing work... for whatever side you choose. Graphics are pixely, but that's part of the charm. Definitely give it a try, then design your own levels with the editor and share it with the community.","August 2, 2013","true","14.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carth/recommended/206190/","carth","Carth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carth/","336 products in account","Gunpoint is a 2D platform puzzle game with simple but solid gameplay. You are a spy who has some projectile trousers that let you jump a very long way and not take damage from falling. Holding the left mouse button lets you aim and power up a jump. You can climb walls and ceilings and smash through glass with your jumps (although doing so will alert nearby enemies).\n\nAt its heart it is a puzzle game. How can you get from where you are now, to somewhere else, and then out again? Usually your task is to get to a computer and hack it. You have to get past guards who behave predictably (e.g. a standing guard will always face the same way, unless he hears a noise). As such, you can plan how you'll do it. You can also rewire things like lights and doors, for example, you could make a lightswitch open a door for you. Different parts of a building might be on different circuits, which you can activate by reaching a circuit box of that colour.\n\nYou can upgrade your equipment and buy new things as you earn money for the jobs you do. There are usually multiple ways of completing a level, depending on the equipment you have and how much violence you want to use. At the end of a level you are told how many witnesses you left, how violent you were, how noisy you were etc.\n\nThe plot follows a murder mystery in which you yourself are implicated. The dialogue is sometimes humourous, but skippable if you just want to play the game. It's not completely linear in that you can choose the order you play many of the levels, but it's quite a short game, and the story is a little confusing such that you might not appreciate what's happening initially. However, there is a level editor and plenty of custom levels in Steam Workshop.\n\nThe later levels are bigger and more complex, and I feel like there could have been more levels like that, because overall none of the levels were particularly difficult. But even though the core game is a little short and doesn't have great replayability, it's still a good game and worth a play.","August 24, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The spy can also burst out of windows and beat guards up. The fun comes when you're hacking though, and you can do stuff like electrify a socket that a guard is standing next to or confuse a guard by turning off a light. Now I'm not saying I'm better than anybody but when a light gets turned off I don't get confused and start pacing the room like a weirdo but this is a video game I think. Anyway, the writing is actually competent for a video game and there's a lot of options as to how you tackle a level. Only problem is that this game is kinda short but there's Steam Workshop support and a level editor.

It takes 1 and Half hour to complete the game. I have to admit the was enjoy able. Some puzzles really made my head scratch. Game is simple to understand. Story has some twist and turn but its OK. But its bit pricey. As a 10$ game it should have game play time worth 10-12 hours. Another negative point is there is replay value to it. So special mission no extra missions nothing. Just plan old 1.5 hour of game play and you will never look back to it.\n\nMy recommendation is buy this game when it is cheap like it was on sale for 75% off. That is its true value.

Not enough games make you feel like that underground vigilante, trying to manipulate the intrigue between competeting factions. Even less games allow you to be a clever spy tinkering with your electronic environment to outsmart guards and enemy spies. It's hard to fine that "Yes!" feeling when an intricate plan goes perfectly according to plan, leaving no witness and no casualties. There's just a certain smug satisfaction you get from watching guard try to turn a light back on, only to be opening doors or turning other lights off elsewhere. It's a certain satisfaction you can only really get out of Gunpoint right now.\n\nI'll make this somewhat brief. You should buy Gunpoint. It's an incredibly clever and fun game with lots of funny and well written dialog along with fantastic stealth gameplay. There are multiple-ish ways around each level depending on what upgrades you've gone for, and there are multiple storylines you can follow, although they don't ultimately effect the final ending. It is an incredibly polished and thought-out game, and you should play it.\n\nAlthough, you might want to wait for a sale. If there is a problem with Gunpoint, it's that it's way, way to short. Took only a little more than two hours to beat, and while there is some incentive to replay levels for a better rating or follow different contracts, there isn't much incentive to spend that much time with the game after beating it. There is a workshop, but it's fairly limited. There are a few good maps, but a lot of them are just boring or broken, and there's rarely something new uploaded. So, if you're the type that needs to maximize bang for your buck, $10 for 2 hours of gameplay might be too steep a price, and you might want to wait for the sale.\n\nBut at some point, you should buy and play this game. Simply put, it's fantastic.","June 26, 2014","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game has various electronic devices (buttons, lights, elevators, alarms, doors, cameras) that are nominally assigned to coloured circuits.  You can wire devices up in a building any way you like as long as you don't cross coloured circuits, however judicious use of the aforementioned sound detectors etc. will let you do this.

I'm not going to mention any of the plot, it's good and serves it's purpose quite well with charm and style.\n\nI really quite like this, the main 'campaign' is short (about 3 or so hours if you fiddle about) but quite wonderfully done.  The levels are very well designed with absolutely loads of routes and tactics that can be taken to beat them.  You really can go back and play each level an entirely different way.  The level designer as it stands I've found easier than most to use, however it seems to be less capabable than the ones used to create the in game levels.

The game gets better and a lot more puzzelling as you get further on.  However, if you don't want it to be harder, go to the in game shop and buy a new gun, or wiring systems with in game currency (you get money for completing missions)!\n\nAlso, if you like choices in games, there are calls that at the end, you get a mission.  In them calls, you can very slightly change the direction of the call by answering how you want (by using the two or three options)!\n\n\n\nOverall, this game is awesome and I think all indie lovers should have it!\n\n-Tom (TomTheCubeGaming)","February 11, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

My understanding though is the levels and campaign are straight forward text files so editing/creating anything used in the main campaign is well within reach.\n\nSo yes, buy it on the understanding that the included content is quite short but well worth the money and you'll have a minor amount of legwork to do for extra levels (try http://www.gunpointlevels.net/).\n\nAn advanced level editor is also available here: http://steamcommunity.com/app/206190/discussions/0/864971139146390709/","December 29, 2013","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Unfortunately, he got caught on a camera and is now a murder suspect: on to destroy the evidence because who would believe you anyway? Murderer too used the awesometrousers.\n\nYour guy can jump very high, cling to ceilings and floor and with some additional gadgets rewire the electronics systems of buildings. He does not choose his targets: his clients do. Smartpants, he accepts any mission that pays money and tries to sound witty doing that. In case it left you wondering, that pun was totally intended.\n\nA typical level goes like this: break into a building, hack into a computer and get out, and if you're like me, do it totally undetected and without hurting, let alone killing anyone. The rewind system ensures you don't have to restart too often. Actually, the ability to rewire electronics is even more important than bouncing like a cat and you may even debate whichever is the best.\n\nDefinitely worth it for the sneaky-puzzly mechanics if not for the witty albeit quirky dialogue and story.","July 17, 2013","true","13.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For instance, Conway owns a pair of high-tech pants that allow him to jump to ludicrous heights and sustain little to no falling damage, as well as a device that allows him to rewire virtually anything connected to a power source to fulfill whatever needs he might have. And let's not forget corrupt companies with their evil tycoons sitting at the CEO chair.\n\nGraphically speaking, it's hit-and-miss. If you like pixel art, you'll like this game's style, but if you don't, well, at least the gameplay and music can make it up to you.\n\nMusically speaking, spectacular. If you're a fan of old noir movies and games, the atmospheric soundtrack to this game will touch your inner detective.\n\nAnd finally, gameplay. 2D sidescrolling with high jumping and stealth elements, in a nutshell. Every thing is responsive, you definitely feel in control of your environment as Conway peruses the electrical grid of the building he's trying to sneak into and of Conway himself, as he either skillfully jumps into an open window, pummels someone to a temporary coma (or death) or silently crawls on ceilings and walls avoiding the watchful eyes of the guards.\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic.

Plus a good sense of humor.\n\nMechanics:\nIts a 2d "sidescroller" platformer. Sidescroller in a loose sense of the word.

Which is where this game really shines, and what turns it into a puzzle game. With the wiretapper, You can change the Circuity of the building. Altering the circuits of alarms, security cameras, doors, lights, and plug sockets. The combination of these two mechanics is what makes this a great stealth game.\n\nStory:\nAfter purchasing his Hypertrousers, Conway accidentally leaps out the window of his apartment building and into the lobby of a nearby building, one in which someone was murdered. After hearing gunshots, and going up the building to investigate, conway walks in front of a security camera, which would put him at the scene of the crime, he has to erase the backups before the tapes are found.\nI Don't want to spoil anything, because this is all adressed by the first mission.\n\nExtras:\nIf there isn't enough reason to buy this game, it also comes with a Level Editor, so you can make your own puzzles. And i really do hope at some point this gets steam workshop support. I'd really like to see what others come up with.\nNot to mention you get a free Tf2 hat with the deal. I mean, C'mon, the hat looks pretty cool.\nAnd you can have the spy wear it. Because why not.","January 18, 2014","true","11.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For instance, Conway owns a pair of high-tech pants that allow him to jump to ludicrous heights and sustain little to no falling damage, as well as a device that allows him to rewire virtually anything connected to a power source to fulfill whatever needs he might have. And let's not forget corrupt companies with their evil tycoons sitting at the CEO chair.\n\nGraphically speaking, it's hit-and-miss. If you like pixel art, you'll like this game's style, but if you don't, well, at least the gameplay and music can make it up to you.\n\nMusically speaking, spectacular. If you're a fan of old noir movies and games, the atmospheric soundtrack to this game will touch your inner detective.\n\nAnd finally, gameplay. 2D sidescrolling with high jumping and stealth elements, in a nutshell. Every thing is responsive, you definitely feel in control of your environment as Conway peruses the electrical grid of the building he's trying to sneak into and of Conway himself, as he either skillfully jumps into an open window, pummels someone to a temporary coma (or death) or silently crawls on ceilings and walls avoiding the watchful eyes of the guards.\n\nAll in all, this game is fantastic.

If you're worried about the title being "Gunpoint," don't:  you can get through the thing without shooting anything.  Really, my only complaint about the game is with the Achievements.  You can get most of them by just replaying individual missions and doing things a little differently.  Those are fine.  The problem is that some of the Achievements are mutually exclusive in a single run-through.  You either have to replay the game or finagle with save game files to get them.  But, after 13.5 hours of game play for a 100% Achievement rating, I managed to finish the game.  At that length and with the quality of the game, the current list price of about $10 is about right.  But, since I'm cheap, I still recommend you wait for a sale (I got it for about a quarter of that).","May 23","true","13.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The soundtrack consists of many jazz tracks, most of which are remixed in a more techno-esque fashion. I 100% completed the game in 7.4 hours, including all achievements and A+'s in all the levels. The final level of the game is one of the best in any game ever, providing an extremely satisfying ending.

You were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and have been framed for murder. You must go through numerous levels to find out who framed you, and clear your name.\n\nThe gameplay is great. You have a gadget called the "crosslink". It is used to rewire circuits in any way you wish. From basic changes such as making a light switch open a door, to causing an elevator to switch off the lights, making a guard walk through a booby trapped door, and having it slam in his face. The combinations are endless.\n\nThe game is very much stealth focused. Confrontation with a guard will quickly result in your death. But this does not mean you cannot sneak up on everyone and beat them to death. You can get through levels silently, with no witnesses. Or you could rush through and make sure no one is left breathing to be a witness.\n\nYou have multiple other gadgets to utilize too. Conway wears no ordinary trousers. They are spring loaded allowing him to jump great distances. His trenchcoat allows him to survive a fall from high distances. There is also an upgrade system which allows you to buy new gadgets, and improve already purchased ones.\n\nThe story is great. The dialogue is incredibly funny, and the characters brilliantly wrote. The game also has an absolutely superb soundtrack. One of my favourite in any video game. You can check it out for free here[gunpointgame.bandcamp.com].\n\nThe average time for completion is about 2-3 hours. So if you are looking for a short game to pass time, this is definitely one to consider. With multiple dialogue options, and plenty of achievements to earn, the replayability is great too.\n\nGunpoint is easily my 2013 Game of the Year. I absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone.\n\nEdit: As of some date a few days ago, workshop has now been integrated into the game. You can now browse from hundreds of user-created levels, adding hours more fun to the game.","March 21, 2014","true","7.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The sound is great, the graphics are cool retro but not too retro, and the gameplay is fun and very creative. Whoever created this is quite smart to come up with such a cool unique idea. I really had a great time playing through this. The only issue is that it is short: I beat it in a little more than four hours. And it is like Portal 2 in that once you beat it, you really can't replay it because you already know how to solve each level. I would say because of its short four to five hour length, don't pay ten bucks for it. Unless you are jumping out of your skin to play it, catch it on sale for $5 or less if you can which is what I did.","October 11, 2014","true","5.6"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","14","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthvaderrocks/recommended/206190/","darthvaderrocks","Seymour The Llama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthvaderrocks/","89 products in account","This is an excellent game.\n\nMain premise: You are an industrial spy who wears a cool hat and a trenchcoat while trying to solve a murder (and make a killing in the meantime). You have two main abilities to help you do this (besides the hat): the BullFrog Jump Trousers which allow you to jump absurdly high distances and your Crosslink which allows you to hack into nearly any system, influding doors, security cameras, guns, trapdoors, and so on. The game requires you to master both of these abilities to be able to complete the brilliant puzzles it throws at you.\n\nIn case you didn't know this already, this is a puzzle game. The main point of the game is to solve puzzles by avoiding (or slaying) guards and hacking systems to acheive some objective.\n\nAnother fun element of the game is how much control you have over your character's morality. I personally tried to play the game without killing, hitting, or being seen by any guards, a feat I did not successfully accomplish. You can just as legitimately try to tackle every guard out of a window, however. There isn't that much of a different ending either way, but it was fun to try and solve the puzzles in so many different ways.\n\nAll in all, Gunpoint is a great puzzle game that I really enjoyed. My only critique is a relatively small one: the bug causing the game to crash on my computer unless I disable the Steam Overlay is a little irritating, especially because it keeps me from being able to play the Steam Workshop levels. Overall a great game, however. Keep 'em coming!","August 31, 2014","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Again typical start up, you get your briefing - but this can be expanded on, IF you ask the right questions. Your loadout is filled with various upgrades and gadgets, which are slowly acquired so you get used to how each piece works,\n\nThe presentation is neat, the controls are pretty good and the murky murder mystery the game opens with is written well enough to compel you to play on.  I enjoyed the deliberate humour, but the mid game shenanigans made me cackle: Like accidentally tackling someone through a 3rd storey window into the tarmac!\n\nKudos to the Gunpoint crew for their autosave function, rather than relying on a checkpoint system: which wouldn't work for this type of game, they instead record as you play and you can choose a rollback point if things go to hell.\n\nLooking for to more games from these guys.\n\n*slowly attaches silencer to lance, then Batroc Le Leaper jousts off the top of a building*\n","January 7, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(I wasn't expecting to laugh so much at the sassy answers from the main character)\n\nThe gameplay is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing smooth and satisfying, and the hacking-rewiring thing works well, tho in my opinion they kinda underexploited it since there was truly a way to make complexe paths.

Gameplay is fun, intense, and really requires a lot of thought. You play a freelance spy in a cyberpunk world, not far off from the game 'Jazzpunk'. Theres a whole story that starts out as a murder case, and ends up being so much more. The story was easily a 10/10. The game is easy enough that you can easily become an expert in no time at all. With little over 4 hours of gameplay, I wish the game was longer, but the make those 4 hours count. Perfect game for a lazy day when you have time on your hands. One of my friends (you know who you are,) said he didn't want the game "because the graphics were 2D."\nDispite the fact that they are 2D, i feel like a lot of effort was put into the game atmosphere and the textures. The soundtrack was pretty good, had a Techno/jazz feel. The end of the game is just fantastic, although I wish there were levels after the end. Overall I would say 8/10, the only reason why it wasn't higher, is there just wasnt enough, and $10 seems like alot for such a small game, but still fantastic. try to get it on sale, but if you can't, get it anyway.","September 18, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, in every conceivable way, this game is far, far, far better than Watch Dogs. SO, are you considering buying Watch Dogs? Don't. Buy 5 copies of this instead. The mechanics are impeccable, the intriguing story keeps you playing until the end, then lets you replay any mission you want - with your new upgrades.

It is refreashing too see that some game developers remember the roots of iconic pixel games.\nBut it's not just the nastalgia that makes Gunpoint unique.  It's the complex puzzles required for completing a mission.  There are multiple ways of completing a mission, either way is preferable.  From hiding in the dark to knocking the guards off a 5 story building through the window.\n\nThe game includes a unique story that adds some witty humor.  From jumping out of the building to talking with yoru clients.\n\nWhat makes the game stand out are the puzzles.  You need to work your way through various guards and security cameras in order too accomplish your goal.  Hacking terminals, doors, cameras and even the pistols of the guards.","November 25, 2013","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I beat the story already and I can honestly say that I am looking forward to many more hours spent with the workshop. I highly reccomend this game and I think that you can't get the full experience without the special edition which I also highly reccomend purchasing over the main game as the developer commentary is helpful in some levels as well as it being interseting to be able to hear about some of went on in development.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/recommended/206190/","turinwing","Perdix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/","148 products in account","TL;DR - This game is a fun, albeit short, puzzle game that uses a limited set of mechanics to extract varied, satisfying and solid gameplay; not to mention a bloody hilarious sense of humour.  The campaign will occupy you for ~5hrs, but the level-creator will occupy you for many more.  Definitely recommended.\n\nThis is a side-on puzzle game in which you use super-powered trousers and a 'hacking' interface to infiltrate a selection of buildings, extract the information you want, then get the hell out of there; usually through comically jumping through a window and faceplanting the concrete outside.\n\nBoth the movement and hacking have been done in an extremely intuitive way, which encourages you to experiment with the environment with your limited toolset to achieve your goal - jumping through glass into a guard and knocking them uncouncious with classic batman-esque sound effects; wiring a switch to a door, slamming it into guards to incapacitate them, hotwiring a plug socket and a siren so that all the guards sprint to the room you want and are promptly electrocuted into unconciousness - it's all extremely satisfying, and the reward of discovering an ability that hasn't been explicitly outlined is tangible.\n\nThis summary may make the game sound violent, but any violence in the game is dealt with in a comic, non-gratuitous way; also offering the option to complete every mission non-violently if you so choose (both options are equally viable and as rewarding).\n\nThe end of each mission gives you a rating for 'violence', 'witnesses', 'noise', and 'time' - each affecting you overal A-F grade - giving those gamers who enjoy things like speedruns and perfect executions something to aim for; while this really helps the replayability of the campaign alone, the majority of this game's replayability comes from the Steam Workshop - where people have used the game's level-creator to create a huge selection of missions to sink your teeth into.\n\nMy only complaint about this game would be the campaign length but, as this is more than made up for by the Workshop, it's nowhere near a dealbreaker and I thoroughly recommend this to anyone looking for an engaging puzzle game that can be picked up and put down as needed.  Top marks.","July 27, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can rewire devices in the level to do certain things, such as rewiring a light switch so that instead of turning out the lights, it opens a door into a guard, knocking him out. There are a ton of devices that all do different things when triggered and you can wire almost any combination of triggers/devices together. Your character is also very mobile: you can crawl up walls and hang from the ceiling, and you can superjump with a pair of robolegs your character buys in the opening cutscene. Levels also have a couple of collectibles, in the form of laptops that you can hack to read emails from the game's characters. The characters are really well written, and the dialog is pretty funny. The characters will also give optional goals at the start of levels if you want more of a challenge.\n\nAnd if you want to spend more than a couple of hours on the game, you had really better go for every one of those challenges and collectibles, because this game is short as HELL. I took my time and meandered about the levels, reset them a few times, and I still beat the whole game in like 3 hours. There's a level editor with workshop integration, but a game shouldn't have to rely on user generated content to last for more than one short sitting.\n\nIn short;\n\nPROS: solid gameplay with interesting mechanics, well written characters, funny dialog\nCONS: short as hell, can easily be beaten in a few hours","July 27, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The pain killers were still there, but the fog had taken a vacation that day.  I was awoken by the post man, he only rang once, but he left a package.  They were my new enhanced pants; they fit nice, tight across the seat showing off what some say is my best asset.  I didn't care how they looked though.  They let me jump.  They let me jump high.  That counted for a lot in my line of work.\n\nI hadn't been in the pants for long before the doorbell rang again.  I figured itt was the drab UPS man coming back to check on the fit of my order, but instead I was hit with a dame charging in without waiting for an answer.  Her hair flamed red, fell down over the shoulders of her severe over coat with her fedora pulled low to hide her eyes.  I stood looking her up and down; it was quite the sight.  She stood avoiding any attempt at eye contact, though I noticed my new pants caught her attention again and again.\n\n"I don't have time for games," she spat as she opened her coat and reached a steady hand into the shadows inside.  I tensed for moment thinking she might be going for her piece.   That thought didnt' last long though; if she had come to rub me out, she would have done it by now.\n\nShe threw a folder on my desk, finally looking me in the eye from under the brim of her hat.  Her eyes, they were brown.   "I lied.  This is actually a game.  But it's a fun game, so you're going to like it.  You're going to figure out how to get through all of these buildings, then you're going to hack some computers, maybe punch a few guards.  It's going to make you think and it's going to make you get creative.  And the whole time, you're going to get a jazzy soundtrack that's pretty great to push you along."\n\nI snagged the folder from the desk, flipping through the pages.  The thought of playing a game, a game that was part stealth, a game that was part puzzle; it sounded like a tough nut to crack,  I knew I was the man for the job though.  After all, I was having a good day and I've got these new pants to try out.\n\n"I'll do it," I said, looking up for the folder.\n\nAs abruptly as she'd entered, the flame haired dame and vanished, leaving me alone with nothing but a case load and the promises of puzzles to solve.  I was going to find my way back to her; after all she'd never mentioned how she planned to pay for the job.","July 19, 2013","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think I do wish that the complexity/difficulty had ramped up faster (without making the game longer), but it was a really pleasant way to burn a few hours.","July 28, 2013","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/recommended/206190/","turinwing","Perdix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turinwing/","148 products in account","TL;DR - This game is a fun, albeit short, puzzle game that uses a limited set of mechanics to extract varied, satisfying and solid gameplay; not to mention a bloody hilarious sense of humour.  The campaign will occupy you for ~5hrs, but the level-creator will occupy you for many more.  Definitely recommended.\n\nThis is a side-on puzzle game in which you use super-powered trousers and a 'hacking' interface to infiltrate a selection of buildings, extract the information you want, then get the hell out of there; usually through comically jumping through a window and faceplanting the concrete outside.\n\nBoth the movement and hacking have been done in an extremely intuitive way, which encourages you to experiment with the environment with your limited toolset to achieve your goal - jumping through glass into a guard and knocking them uncouncious with classic batman-esque sound effects; wiring a switch to a door, slamming it into guards to incapacitate them, hotwiring a plug socket and a siren so that all the guards sprint to the room you want and are promptly electrocuted into unconciousness - it's all extremely satisfying, and the reward of discovering an ability that hasn't been explicitly outlined is tangible.\n\nThis summary may make the game sound violent, but any violence in the game is dealt with in a comic, non-gratuitous way; also offering the option to complete every mission non-violently if you so choose (both options are equally viable and as rewarding).\n\nThe end of each mission gives you a rating for 'violence', 'witnesses', 'noise', and 'time' - each affecting you overal A-F grade - giving those gamers who enjoy things like speedruns and perfect executions something to aim for; while this really helps the replayability of the campaign alone, the majority of this game's replayability comes from the Steam Workshop - where people have used the game's level-creator to create a huge selection of missions to sink your teeth into.\n\nMy only complaint about this game would be the campaign length but, as this is more than made up for by the Workshop, it's nowhere near a dealbreaker and I thoroughly recommend this to anyone looking for an engaging puzzle game that can be picked up and put down as needed.  Top marks.","July 27, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can rewire devices in the level to do certain things, such as rewiring a light switch so that instead of turning out the lights, it opens a door into a guard, knocking him out. There are a ton of devices that all do different things when triggered and you can wire almost any combination of triggers/devices together. Your character is also very mobile: you can crawl up walls and hang from the ceiling, and you can superjump with a pair of robolegs your character buys in the opening cutscene. Levels also have a couple of collectibles, in the form of laptops that you can hack to read emails from the game's characters. The characters are really well written, and the dialog is pretty funny. The characters will also give optional goals at the start of levels if you want more of a challenge.\n\nAnd if you want to spend more than a couple of hours on the game, you had really better go for every one of those challenges and collectibles, because this game is short as HELL. I took my time and meandered about the levels, reset them a few times, and I still beat the whole game in like 3 hours. There's a level editor with workshop integration, but a game shouldn't have to rely on user generated content to last for more than one short sitting.\n\nIn short;\n\nPROS: solid gameplay with interesting mechanics, well written characters, funny dialog\nCONS: short as hell, can easily be beaten in a few hours","July 27, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's a great game.\n\nEach mission, you're asked to break into a building and reach a computer terminal.  To do this, you need to figure out how to rewire circuits to open the correct doors, while avoiding being shot in the face.  This gives the game a pseudo-puzzle-game feel.  However, if you don't feel like solving puzzles, or are just a generally violent person, you also have the option of pushing the guards out the windows or beating them with your fists.\n\nThe best part of this game though is the dialog.  Dear lord that dialog.  Whereas I usually skim over dialog for most games, in this game I found myself genuinely looking forward to the between-mission cutscenes, because the choices you're given are so funny.  I laughed every time.  Every time.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game was so short.  It took me 3 hours to beat the first time, and 2 hours to beat a second and get all the achievements.  I don't normally recommend such short games, but I enjoyed the gameplay and humor so much I feel it was worth the cost, even at full-price.\n\n9/10","February 26, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gunpoint has some weird technical glitch (memory leak?) where it starts lagging pretty hardcore after playing for 30 minutes or so, forcing me to constantly reset the game whenever the FPS drops... and yet it's a testimony to the game that this hardly hindered my enjoyment.  Sure, the story is dumb in a noir way, but the jazzy music, somber atmosphere and open gameplay made me love the world anyway.  I particularly enjoyed the fact that you could gain abilities in pretty much any order, so the stages had to be intelligently crafted in such a way that there was never a single expected path for you to follow.  Heck, you could even get a gun at one point (pardon the pun), but it comes with so many drawbacks that I hardly ever used it.

In most of the missions, you "hack" your way into a building and ultimately downloading/stealing files from computers. You can hack lights, switches, elevators, outlets, cameras, and even enemy guns! This novel idea pretty much opens a variety of ways in playing the game. You can try planning your moves right from the beginning or just tackle the obstacles as you go along.

Today I loaded it up, dived in and found a game that realised what made a good puzzle game, ingenuity. You see, you don't have all that much in the way of abilities, apart from being able to jump really high (and fall from great heights safely), being able to punch people out in one hit, and a habit of dying after being hit with anything remotely bulletlike from any angle (although that last one might just be common sense). Soon you get the ability to rewire electronics, which is where the game shines. Each level presents itself as a maze of sorts, where you can open close, break or otherwise wreak havoc with various objects in some remarkably clever ways, all through a simple set of controls.\n\nI know it says stealth up there, but that's really kind of optional. You do kind of have to go the stealthy route (since, again, one bullet = death) you can either be noisy or quiet, or most often a mix of the both. But its rewarding, and doesn't really value one over the other. You can spend a minute setting up a connection so that a door whacks a guard in the face as he walks through it, or you run up behind him and knock him out a window, or come the other way through said window, send glass flying everywhere, land on the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and beat him until the floor is covered in a fine red sludge. Or you could, you know, just go past whilst he's not looking. Your choice\n\nThe only real problem I have is that its not very long. I finished it in 3 and a bit hours, and whilst there's a level editor (and presumably the ability to download other people's levels) that might not add too much. Its good, but short.","April 17, 2014","true","7.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nowadays we have a hundreds of 3D games of all kind - shooters, RPG's, action games, racing simulators, etc... All these are cool. But Gunpoint is a remarkable example that idea of the good game was always on the first place. And only after it come different effects and other good-looking stuff.\nGunpoint is a 2-dimensional stealth with a little shooter part. The game also has a good scenario which involves industrial espionage. The main thing that you have to do is resolving different puzzles. And this is the great fun and the most strong feature of the game. You always can solve each of them different ways and gain more achievements for this. Gunpoint has good soundtracks which suit the game perfectly. The only drawback is that the game relatively short.\nSo I recomend this game to all the people who want fresh attitude to the game process and overall game experiance.","February 1, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a fairly simple puzzle game, and nothing is going to leave you thinking for long.  The challenge comes in your style.  Trying to complete a level without being seen etc.  Getting to the objective quickly and out is fairly simple but not very rewarding.\n\nDon't pay full price for this game, but if you see it in a bargain bin then pick it up.

Great story and plot that let's the player make his/hers own decisions on how to progress and how the story will unfold. Beautiful soundtrack that really makes you feel like an old fashioned detective. Funny achievements and allows for the player to decide whether he will complete the mission with stealth or to just fight his way through a building, sneak through the shadows or hang on the ceiling waiting to pounce on an unsuspecting guard? No matter which way you play it, Gunpoint is worth the purchase.

Fun game, albeit terribly short - under 6 hours to complete at a leisurely pace.\n\nGunpoint shows that super-duper graphics is not required to make fun game-play.  It's a fairly simple puzzle game, and nothing is going to leave you thinking for long.  The challenge comes in your style.  Trying to complete a level without being seen etc.  Getting to the objective quickly and out is fairly simple but not very rewarding.\n\nDon't pay full price for this game, but if you see it in a bargain bin then pick it up.

I should perhaps mention that I had no idea what the game was about at the time, but it was cheap and scored high on Metacritic.\n\nWhat did I find?\n\nOne of the best games I have played in recent years. It is difficult to explain just why it is so good without spoiling the game, suffice it to say that both the story and mechanics, as well as their execution, are without fault.\n\nThe game has a subtle, dark sense of humour which punctuates its noir storytelling. In terms of actual gameplay, I would describe it as an immersive puzzle platformer, though its beauty is that each problem can be approached in a variety of ways.\n\nThe game is not particularly long, and I completed it in roughly four hours, though my playstyle is ponderous at best. However, that should not discourage you from spending money on this gem of a game. The variety of solutions as well as the multitude of achievements will make subsequent playthroughs as riveting as the first.\n\nIn conclusion: Buy it, download it, play it, recommend it.","January 3, 2014","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This novel idea pretty much opens a variety of ways in playing the game. You can try planning your moves right from the beginning or just tackle the obstacles as you go along.

It has fun and over-the-top gameplay mechanics, multiple solutions for most problems, actually good writing, a good sense of humor and a gritty, intriguing and non-linear (!) storyline while not taking itself too seriously.\n\nToo many games these days pride themselves in being 'retro', which basically means "roguelike", "unfair" or "suffers from poor controls and presentation". This is where gunpoint is *very* different. The visuals are stylish and consistent, the controls are lean and simple (in a good way), the music and sound effects are fitting and the overall gameplay comes together nicely to create an experience that is actually fun to play (and just as much fun to watch). Simply put, the developer really understands what games were supposed to be like (once, a long long time ago...)!\n\n\nBesides, where else do you get to jump at people, smash them through a window in the fifth floor and facepunch them 200 times after landing (just to make sure they won't get up again, of course!)?\n\n\nSeriously, get this game.

If I had to summarize this game in a single sentence, I'd probably say "A game about feeling stealthy". I don't know how else to say it, I really don't. This has been the first "stealth" game I have played where I have felt truly stealthy and badass. And I've played quite a few, and found the stealth sections to be boring and annoying. The soundtrack probably brings some of those feelings. The soundtrack is fantastic, albeit short, and every track is a joy to listen to. If you want a small dose of the music, I'd recommend listening to the trailer. The storyline is lacking, but I wouldn't consider that to be something that makes it a terrible game. In fact, even without a storyline, this game still shines. The storyline does what it should do, however. It gives you an objective. A villain, per-se. And that's all you really need. Last of all, the gameplay is what brings it all together. Early in the game, you are given the ability to "jump". It's exactly what you think. You can do whatever you want with it, though. Climb on walls, hang on ceilings, etc. All the while, being extremely unrealistic and silly. The other main mechanic, the rewiring of electricity, is a joy. For any puzzle game enthusiasts, this part of the game is for you. However, don't expect any puzzles to be too complex. There are multiple ways to reach your endgoal. And all of them are fun. I would definitely recommend this game even if it is very short.\n\n8.5/10","June 20, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's only one or two things I dislike:\n1. The replay value is slightly reduced because if you replay a level and you do slightly worse, (e.g. not getting as many achievements) the game takes this to be your final score and applies it on the menu.\n2. There isn't a lot of it! The main story was wonderfully witty and cleverly created, and I know there's the Workshop and level creator, but a bigger core game would have made it more perfect.\n\nThe rest of it is fantastic. The movement mechanic somehow combines action and fast playing with strategy and planning in the cross-link and those brilliant hyper-trouser things. Conway's character is a hilarious parody of itself and the player. His interaction with the other characters is always funny, and I love the method of communication between them too.

The campaign itself is a bit short but you can replay and talk to the characters in the conversations before each level and choose different ways to address them, playing out either a serious noir story or as a sarcastic spy caught up in a bunch of stuff.

In fact I more resemble a certain XKCD comic about delayed enjoyment of major releases.  Somethng about Gunpoint though grabbed me right off.  I threw my $9 down and let the chips fall where they may.  They... uhm... I'm not sure how to finish that metaphor.  It wasn't $9 wasted, let's just say that.\n\nThe entire thing is a wonderful mix of retro-puzzle-cool, with visuals in the vein of a 386-era platformer but with that modern twist of ingenuity and "hey, you're a spy now, cool!"  The ambiance is great, very 30's hardboiled/gumshoe/spy but with a pseudo-modern setting and sci-fi gadgetry.  As a kid, did you ever wish there was an awesome "be a super spy" game that you could play?  This is that game, except designed by an adult with rather good development sensibilities.\n\nThe gameplay itself is that perfect mix of "easy to pick up" and "takes practice".  All your gadgets have their obvious uses, but after you spend enough time playing around you start to learn all the other cool things they can do... and the other cool trouble they can get you into.  You can generally get through the game if you take your time, but after you do you can challenge yourself to do it faster and possibly with certain restrictions, like never knocking out a guard or even being seen by one.  Yes, you will want to play it again.\n\nGunpoint's plot is satisfying but somewhat short, leaving you wanting more.  As I said above you can get some of that satisfaction from playing the game over again, or even going back through old levels with your new gadgetry to completely break the intended puzzle aspects.  There's also a level editor and the ability to load custom levels, which can further satisfy that need for more.  The only downside is that they can't (as far as I can tell) be arranged into a plot-based progression like the main ones are.\n\nThe last thing I'll say in this surprisingly long recommendation is that the game really reminds me of Deus Ex, of all things.  That's hardly surprising though given that the game was designed by Tom Francis, a self-confessed fan of the game who's written articles on it for major game publications as recently as 2010.  Gunpoint definitely has that "multiple solutions to every problem" thing down, and it tickles that same part of my Game-brain.\n\nIn short, buy this if you like Deus Ex and/or puzzle platformers and/or spy coolness.","July 15, 2013","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Ever since then I've been an avid fan of all sorts of indie games that comprise of such attention to detail and atmosphere as Gunpoint. Some additional features were added like the Steam workshop, and there was even a time you could get a refund back in in early 2014 because the developer didn't think he would be able to pull through to add Steam worshop. Late 2014 and Steam workshop was added. The reason this was very important, because with Steam workshop, the amount of levels are now endless, and you can now create your own levels and share them with the Steam community. Before you were stuck replaying the same levels over and over again just to get the best possible rating. Which is another cool feature in Gunpoint, every time you complete a level, you get a rating, obviously, stealth, and non-violence will only earn you the best rating possible. Undoubtly, Gunpoint is one of the best indie games I've ever played, and I'll certainly say it is one of the few games that pioneered and paved the way for other indie games of similar quality to follow.","April 4","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gunpoint is actually very funny, though, in an almost Douglas Adams sort of way.\n\n10/10, would jump out of plate glass window again.","November 8, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After finishing Gunpoint, my Steam Library read '2 hours' of gametime. Sounds like a turnoff, right? Well, Gunpoint is crafted in a way that makes 2 hours seem reasonable. After all, Rome wasn't built in a day, but Portal was certainly beaten in an afternoon.\n\n(If you want a short review, I've written a shorter version at the bottom.)\n\nI didn't bring up Portal for only one comparison: I like to think that Gunpoint is like a 2D version of Portal (if that didn't happen to exist already). Yes, there's no psychotic AI lecturing you throughout the story, there's no lasers or energy balls and it's certainly a lot more serious than Portal. However, your main utility lets you get from one place to another quickly, you don't really have a weapon on you, the starring feature of the game is used in a variety of ways, there's some very interesting puzzles that make full use of your surroundings, the game can be beaten in a single day and the humour will make you smile multiple times (personally, I think it beats Portal).\n\nSo, enough of the similarites to the puzzle game with myths concerning baked goods, what makes Gunpoint unique? Hypertrousers and the Crosslink. The former lets you leap great heights and survive them (your enemies can't); the latter  lets you rewire electronic devices to others, such as light switches to electric sockets or security cameras to doors. These two features make up the main gameplay and are VERY satisfying. Timing a pounce onto a guard and knocking him out of a glass window never got boring for me and screwing around with the Crosslink led to entertaining solutions to problems (like knocking out a guard by opening a door quickly in his face). Combine this with upgrades like larger jumps and new gadgets such as silently breaking glass or rewiring GUNS and it all works together very nicely. Every puzzle gives you a way to try again, you'll never find yourself trapped in a room from screwing up: every puzzle in Gunpoint has a solution.\n\nThe plot typically follows a noir detective setting, in modern times. You play as a freelance spy, taking on jobs in search of pay who gets caught up in a murder mystery involving rival companies, friends and people all with different motives. Each character feels different from each other in personality, which is quite the acheivement for a game where the characters are only pixelated faces and text. As these characters give you instructions, there are points where you're given 2 sides to a point, and you have to choose which one to side with. The last one is a real morality question; it WILL make you think. Conversations take place on your phone, and you have multiple responses you can make to what you're told. These can range from serious, shady quotes, to questions about your mission, to humour that physically made me laugh out loud, something Portal couldn't achieve. Speaking of humour, it's all very well-written but keeps the serious tone throughout, something I can applaud. Some of the achivements account for this humour too, such as getting one for the previous action of knocking a guard out with a door, hitting yourself with a door, and my personal favourite: punching a guard in the face over 50 times until you get an achievement begging you to stop.\n\nAs for presentation, I love it all. It takes on a retro style of pixelated characters and backgrounds but still keeps them very detailed, from graffiti on the street walls in the distance to the apartment windows in the background being on or off. THAT is good detail. Fitting the noir style, the music is mainly jazz with techno mixed in at some areas to fit your hacking abilities. It's very smooth and relaxing but also fits the mood of the mission you're on. It's simple, but effective. And great to listen to as you punch a guard in the face over 50 times until you get an achievement beggin you to stop.\n\nCONCLUSION/SHORT REVIEW\n\nI love Gunpoint. I love its originality, I love the humour, I love the music and the campaign length personally doesn't bother me. It's short enough to avoid being stale but long enough to make you satisifed. If you like noir settings and fun, clever puzzle games, pick this up. If you want something new, pick this up. I bought this on sale and personally wouldn't have minded paying the full price, though that's just me. If it's too short for you, there's multiple story decisions to make which affect your outcome, as well as Steam workshop maps to try out.\n\n(If  you want to see how I did, click the link to see the games' final surprise.

Thank you Fabian Van Dommelen and John Roberts, your attention to detail and skill is brilliant. Thank you Ryan Ike, John Robert Matz and Francisco Cerda, 'Security, Circuitry and You' is going to be travelling through my ears for the next few months. And thank you, Tom Francis.

The game is short (less than four hours) but because the in-game level editor could potentially provide a lot more play time, I would say this game is definitely worth it. The gameplay is new and excellent.\n\nPros:\n+Excellent and unique gameplay\n+Cheesy but funny humor\n+Great noir feel to the game (with the exception of the goofy jokes, but they're funny, so it's ok)\n+Level editor for making and sharing your own levels\n\nCons:\n-Main game is very short (took like 3.5 hours for me)\n-Game menus sometimes feel a little unpolished; not sure how to describe it, they just feel slightly unfinished in some way. However, this does not make the menus difficult to navigate and is not present during the actual gameplay.\n-(Linux only) Did not work in XFCE for some reason. I switched to dwm and the game worked.\n\nThe real reason to buy Gunpoint is that the gameplay is new and innovative. It's also the kind of game where the amount of crazy scenarios that can occur can go way beyond the main game, which is why the level editor is such a great feature. I recommend it at full price, particularly if you love noir or puzzles. If it's on sale it's a no-brainer.","June 19, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It starts off with a murder, and you need to figure out not who did it, but why. At the end of the first mission, there's an admittedly funny scene that shows you how you got your first piece of equipment, and then you're told that there is evidence you're the killer, but you obviously aren't.\n\nAs I mentioned, the game in general is fun, both to play and to read. There are several achievements were the developpers make some obviously cheesy jokes, like one where you beat a guy a bunch of times, but they really work if its your first time experiencing them. The controls are easy to learn, and there is more than one way to stealthily finish a level. The new Worhkshop integration lets users create their own levels, some of which are admittedly creative and harder than the ones in the game.\n\nIt's short and direct, so it leaves you wanting the more it doesn't have, which is filled by thr Workshop levels. About halfway through, there's a mission that lets you take one of two choices, either supporting the innocent company or helping out the guilty one. There's also a different mission where you can tell, or not, the bad guy that you were contracted to steal from him.[/spolier] I definitely want there to be a sequel, and this is definitely worth the $10.\n\n10/10","February 28","true","20.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Gunpoint's strategy with a stealth element and it's game mecahnics are what really makes the game unique. They are fascinating because they make you think in terms of open and closed circuts - e.g. object A does this which triggers object B and electrocutes a guard. While it's easy to catch on, it's not so easy that mental effort isn't required - I'd say medium on the challenging scale. If just doing the bare minimum, one can finish this game in a matter of hours, but there are extra achievements possible for doing levels with a specific style or speed if that's your kind of thing.\n\nThe dialogue is cute and made me laugh. While it's not an adventure game per say, you are given a few choices that will affect the game. And the ability to choose different dialogue options in between missions made me feel more invested in my character. (For example, I made my character as snarky as possible.) The music is well done and quite fitting, as is the 16-bit design; both really help to aid the cloak and dagger atmosphere for our spy protagonist.\n\nAll in all it's a cute little indie game that's definitely worth getting on sale.","January 3","true","8.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would have to wait a 5-30 seconds for the game to unfreeze, then everything I did in that time would go through at once, usually causing me to die.

The game is surprisingly not very judgemental regarding how messy you complete its missions, though individual clients like it better if you are clean or dirty when you do the deed.\n\nThe game is at its best when you are precice, focused, and fast, and that's what it lets you be.\n\nAlso it's funny as hell. You want good writing in a game? Get this one.","August 6, 2015","true","5.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was one of the first games I bought on Steam and I can't get enough of it. Gunpoint is one of the, if not the best, indie game I have ever played.\n\nPros:\nThe crosslink is a really cool feature and it makes you think about where you need to wire buttons or motion/sound detectors or unwire them to prevent one of the AI from activating what you just activated.\nThe story is pretty cool. It isn't the best story I've ever seen but it's good in it's own right and I was interested the entire way through the game to know what would eventually happen. SPOILER: The ending is really cool to me, I like that you find the killer and finally face up against him and Fritz and avenge Selena's death.\nThe soundtrack is awesome and it sounds appropriate for this game. This easily passes for me because I'm a sucker for good music.\nThe game is an overall fun experience. It's definetly one that I'll never forget.\nThe art in Gunpoint looks nice. The backgrounds are really detailed and the levels have so much detail to them, too.\nThe game never gets too hard to the point where you want to punch a hole into a wall. The game is well-balanced.\nThe outlets.\nCons:\nThere isn't really a bonus at the end of the game for getting all of the achievements and getting A+ on every level.\nIn the end, Gunpoint is a really amazing game. I wasn't expecting much going into Gunpoint as I only bought it for $5 while on a sale. I was very surprised at first when I completed Gunpoint and ended up loving it. I always come back to the game when I'm bored to get lower times on levels I had a couple minutes on. It's really cool to complete your record you got from the beginning of the game in more than half the time... and it feels great to beat a level faster than the developer.","July 15, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gunpoint's strategy with a stealth element and it's game mecahnics are what really makes the game unique. They are fascinating because they make you think in terms of open and closed circuts - e.g. object A does this which triggers object B and electrocutes a guard. While it's easy to catch on, it's not so easy that mental effort isn't required - I'd say medium on the challenging scale. If just doing the bare minimum, one can finish this game in a matter of hours, but there are extra achievements possible for doing levels with a specific style or speed if that's your kind of thing.\n\nThe dialogue is cute and made me laugh. While it's not an adventure game per say, you are given a few choices that will affect the game. And the ability to choose different dialogue options in between missions made me feel more invested in my character. (For example, I made my character as snarky as possible.)

After finishing Gunpoint, my Steam Library read '2 hours' of gametime. Sounds like a turnoff, right? Well, Gunpoint is crafted in a way that makes 2 hours seem reasonable. After all, Rome wasn't built in a day, but Portal was certainly beaten in an afternoon.\n\n(If you want a short review, I've written a shorter version at the bottom.)\n\nI didn't bring up Portal for only one comparison: I like to think that Gunpoint is like a 2D version of Portal (if that didn't happen to exist already). Yes, there's no psychotic AI lecturing you throughout the story, there's no lasers or energy balls and it's certainly a lot more serious than Portal. However, your main utility lets you get from one place to another quickly, you don't really have a weapon on you, the starring feature of the game is used in a variety of ways, there's some very interesting puzzles that make full use of your surroundings, the game can be beaten in a single day and the humour will make you smile multiple times (personally, I think it beats Portal).\n\nSo, enough of the similarites to the puzzle game with myths concerning baked goods, what makes Gunpoint unique? Hypertrousers and the Crosslink. The former lets you leap great heights and survive them (your enemies can't); the latter  lets you rewire electronic devices to others, such as light switches to electric sockets or security cameras to doors. These two features make up the main gameplay and are VERY satisfying. Timing a pounce onto a guard and knocking him out of a glass window never got boring for me and screwing around with the Crosslink led to entertaining solutions to problems (like knocking out a guard by opening a door quickly in his face). Combine this with upgrades like larger jumps and new gadgets such as silently breaking glass or rewiring GUNS and it all works together very nicely. Every puzzle gives you a way to try again, you'll never find yourself trapped in a room from screwing up: every puzzle in Gunpoint has a solution.\n\nThe plot typically follows a noir detective setting, in modern times. You play as a freelance spy, taking on jobs in search of pay who gets caught up in a murder mystery involving rival companies, friends and people all with different motives. Each character feels different from each other in personality, which is quite the acheivement for a game where the characters are only pixelated faces and text. As these characters give you instructions, there are points where you're given 2 sides to a point, and you have to choose which one to side with. The last one is a real morality question; it WILL make you think. Conversations take place on your phone, and you have multiple responses you can make to what you're told. These can range from serious, shady quotes, to questions about your mission, to humour that physically made me laugh out loud, something Portal couldn't achieve. Speaking of humour, it's all very well-written but keeps the serious tone throughout, something I can applaud. Some of the achivements account for this humour too, such as getting one for the previous action of knocking a guard out with a door, hitting yourself with a door, and my personal favourite: punching a guard in the face over 50 times until you get an achievement begging you to stop.\n\nAs for presentation, I love it all. It takes on a retro style of pixelated characters and backgrounds but still keeps them very detailed, from graffiti on the street walls in the distance to the apartment windows in the background being on or off. THAT is good detail. Fitting the noir style, the music is mainly jazz with techno mixed in at some areas to fit your hacking abilities. It's very smooth and relaxing but also fits the mood of the mission you're on. It's simple, but effective. And great to listen to as you punch a guard in the face over 50 times until you get an achievement beggin you to stop.\n\nCONCLUSION/SHORT REVIEW\n\nI love Gunpoint. I love its originality, I love the humour, I love the music and the campaign length personally doesn't bother me. It's short enough to avoid being stale but long enough to make you satisifed. If you like noir settings and fun, clever puzzle games, pick this up. If you want something new, pick this up. I bought this on sale and personally wouldn't have minded paying the full price, though that's just me. If it's too short for you, there's multiple story decisions to make which affect your outcome, as well as Steam workshop maps to try out.\n\n(If  you want to see how I did, click the link to see the games' final surprise. Don't worry, there's no spoilers for the plot. http://www.pentadact.com/category/conwaysblog/?K=14&U=30&C0=1&E1=1&C1=2&E2=1&C2=1&C3=3&C4=3&C5=1)\n\nAs a final statement, let me just say this. Thank you Fabian Van Dommelen and John Roberts, your attention to detail and skill is brilliant. Thank you Ryan Ike, John Robert Matz and Francisco Cerda, 'Security, Circuitry and You' is going to be travelling through my ears for the next few months. And thank you, Tom Francis.

There's only one or two things I dislike:\n1. The replay value is slightly reduced because if you replay a level and you do slightly worse, (e.g. not getting as many achievements) the game takes this to be your final score and applies it on the menu.\n2. There isn't a lot of it! The main story was wonderfully witty and cleverly created, and I know there's the Workshop and level creator, but a bigger core game would have made it more perfect.\n\nThe rest of it is fantastic. The movement mechanic somehow combines action and fast playing with strategy and planning in the cross-link and those brilliant hyper-trouser things. Conway's character is a hilarious parody of itself and the player. His interaction with the other characters is always funny, and I love the method of communication between them too.

Another awesome touch is that when communicating to people through text, you can choose your responce, you can either be a quiet and polite, a one-toned gentleman or you can be sarcastic (which is defineately my favourite because it's really funny).\nEven after I finished the game, I can go back and play with it for hours, by either replaying levels (which is still really fun), or by making my own levels and playing other's.\n\nShould you buy this game?

It was one of the first games I bought on Steam and I can't get enough of it. Gunpoint is one of the, if not the best, indie game I have ever played.\n\nPros:\nThe crosslink is a really cool feature and it makes you think about where you need to wire buttons or motion/sound detectors or unwire them to prevent one of the AI from activating what you just activated.\nThe story is pretty cool. It isn't the best story I've ever seen but it's good in it's own right and I was interested the entire way through the game to know what would eventually happen. SPOILER: The ending is really cool to me, I like that you find the killer and finally face up against him and Fritz and avenge Selena's death.\nThe soundtrack is awesome and it sounds appropriate for this game. This easily passes for me because I'm a sucker for good music.\nThe game is an overall fun experience. It's definetly one that I'll never forget.\nThe art in Gunpoint looks nice. The backgrounds are really detailed and the levels have so much detail to them, too.\nThe game never gets too hard to the point where you want to punch a hole into a wall. The game is well-balanced.\nThe outlets.\nCons:\nThere isn't really a bonus at the end of the game for getting all of the achievements and getting A+ on every level.\nIn the end, Gunpoint is a really amazing game. I wasn't expecting much going into Gunpoint as I only bought it for $5 while on a sale. I was very surprised at first when I completed Gunpoint and ended up loving it. I always come back to the game when I'm bored to get lower times on levels I had a couple minutes on. It's really cool to complete your record you got from the beginning of the game in more than half the time... and it feels great to beat a level faster than the developer.","July 15, 2015","true","17.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/206190/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Gunpoint is a stealth puzzle game just as the developer says, and is a very competent game as well. The game boils down to its two main mechanics and ties in a detective story with some humor too. With some simple gameplay mechanics, the level design is done in such a way to take full advantage of your toolset for some invigorating puzzles and stealth.\n\nThe story in Gunpoint revolves around freelance spy Richard Conway, as he tries to clear his name from someone’s murder and solve a murder mystery. The majority of the story is told through messages on Conway’s phone, and this is where the humor comes in. You the player are given multiple dialog options, and several of Conway’s responses are snarky or bizarre in context. Whichever response is picked, there’s bound to be some good laughs at the overall script and the player dialog. In the main game there are a few choices to be made. They do change the story slightly, though the levels remain mostly the same. Anyhow, the strong film noir story works out fine with some excellent humor mixed in, along with good variety in dialog responses and story choices to mix things up.\n\nGunpoint’s stealth puzzle gameplay is in two distinct pieces. The first is the Bullfrog, a set of trousers that allow Conway to leap really tall distances and at a high speed. Conway can also pounce on enemies and punch them either to knock them out or to death. The second is the Crosslink, a tool to hack and rewire electrical components together to solve puzzles. These two components are the basis for the puzzles and stealth of the game, with the levels strongly using these mechanics in interesting ways. Throughout the game, unlocks can be received, either through using skill points for upgrading the Bullfrog and battery system or for unlocking new abilities. The new abilities tie in closely with the core mechanics, and serve to augment certain playstyles players may have as they complete each level. The levels and abilities serve multiple kinds of solutions, whether it be violent engagements or undetected stealth. With these two gameplay mechanics and great level design that gives players multiple ways to solve them, Gunpoint’s stealth puzzle gameplay is quite open ended on giving players freedom using just these two main tools.\n\nThe art style of Gunpoint is a 2d pixelated style. The world of Gunpoint is pretty well detailed, while still having a pixel art style that isn’t too retro. The environments do a great job in expressing the film noir style with the different buildings and the urban setting, with relatively simple character and object models to make gameplay streamlined with easy to see designs. Overall it’s a mix of good detail in the buildings and backgrounds, with more simple designs on characters and objects to easily stick out in gameplay.\n\nThe music of Gunpoint is an excellent jazzy soundtrack. Since this game is heavily inspired by film noir, it would only be natural to have the music reflect that style. Each of the music pieces range from slower songs played in the menu or during the phone dialog, to faster songs well suited to the espionage during gameplay. The songs played during gameplay have essentially two versions, one when the view is normal and the other when Crosslink mode is active. It’s a very nice touch that helps to identify which mode the player is in, and suits the current display too with a more electronic style when hacking along with the jazzy style while in the main view. The music of Gunpoint brings in some nice sounding jazz that sounds great while playing through both the story and gameplay sections.\n\nGunpoint takes stealth puzzle gameplay with its two main mechanics: leaping and hacking. The game takes these concepts and uses them in new ways with its levels and unlockable abilities. Alongside that is a film noir story that packs some solid humor with both the overall script and possible dialog choices. To tie the game together are a fitting detailed pixel art style and a solid jazz soundtrack that makes gameplay fun and fitting to the theme. Gunpoint plays well with these elements for a unique game experience that is fun to play through along with some bright ideas for some smart game design.","April 18","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

It's fairly linear outside of the dialog and a few missions.","May 18","true","10.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Do you like puzzle games? Do you like stealth games? Do you like awesome jazz music? Do you like secret agents? And do you like games that are f***ing awesome? If the answer to all or any of these is yes, then buy this game! This is hands down one of the best games I've ever played. It suceeds in being a puzzle game and a stealth game. And best of all, it makes you feel like a badass secret agent. This game gets a 10/10. So thank the developers for making this masterpiece by buying this game.","January 19, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So the guard will pass thru the motion control and elevator will go up and make Ding. Sound alarm will hear that and you gonna fall, but wait isnt that glass and guard on it as you fall?

Definitely worth the $10 that I only paid 25% of.\n\nThis game unexpectedly has an amazing and mysterious plot, awesome gameplay (I found no bugs), nice art, and a few jokes here and there. In fact, if you're feeling so silly, you can go ahead and screw a bunch of people over if you want to.\n\nThis game unfortunately, is too short. I finished it in about 4 hours. I may go back to get some more achievements. Thanks to Steam, though, you can create and submit levels to the Workshop. So if you don't feel like playing the plot a second time, be sure to check that out!\n\nA great choice if you need a break from your usual games.","June 17, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played 'Watch_Dogs' before 'Gunpoint', with the latter released about a year and half earlier. I liked 'Watch_Dogs'; it's good (but not $69.99 good, making me feel lucky that I got my free copy from nVidia), but I feel that it is not as polished as it could have been and some features could have been implemented better.\n\nThis brings us to 'Gunpoint', which ironically features less guns than 'Watch_Dogs'. Both games require players to use hacking as a tool to solve puzzles, but 'Gunpoint' implements the hacking better and is a more polished game. Its game design actually puts hacking into the forefront and encourages players to complete the game in a stealthy, non-lethal and even non-violent ways. You need to think creatively to solve the puzzles, especially if you aim for an A or A+ rating. Completing a mission with a high rating is, therefore, very rewarding. The game's replayability is very high as it also includes a level editor.\n\nOn the other hand, the hacking in 'Watch_Dogs', while fun at times, seems like an afterthought and gimmicky. In some 'Watch_Dogs' missions, it is often easier to shoot than to hack your way out of a difficult situation. I think most people will agree with me that the best parts of 'Watch_Dogs' are ones where your hacking skills and wit are your only disposable tools. 'Gunpoint' is pretty much all these "best parts", making it a superior game to 'Watch_Dogs' overall.\n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend 'Gunpoint'. It is a well-made game and it is one of the best puzzle games I have played. If you are interested in 'Watch_Dogs', well, get it when it costs $30 or less. Like I said before, I enjoyed 'Watch_Dogs', but I think your time will be better spent if you play 'Gunpoint' instead.","February 28, 2015","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can't possibly recommend it enough.\n\nThe creative gameplay mechanic of "rewiring" elements of the level mean that there's a lot of flexibility in playstyle and even in solutions to each mission. Use your sneaky spy tools to switch off lights, avoid cameras, and disable traps--or enable them right as a guard walks past. Or just shoot everyone in the face. Or do a combination of both. It's the greatest.\n\nThe dialogue is awesome too: funny, perfectly interactive, and seasoned with a dash of noir-detective smarm.\n\nThe main campaign is short--it took me, the world's slowest gamer, about 5 hours, so it should take most normal folks about half that time--but it has full Steam Workshop support with a level editor for player-creatable maps, and I played it again to get better stealth ratings on some of the missions and still loved it the second time around.\n\nArt style may not be to everyone's taste (I loved it, personally) but I think the fun of the gameplay is well worth giving this game a shot even if you're hesitant about it.\n\nRating: 5/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it","May 14","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On paper, it might seem difficult, but it's actually pretty easy once you understand the hacking mechanics. It's on the short side, so you can breeze right through it in a few hours.\n\nThe story revolves around a freelance espionage agent that is startled by a murder in a building next to his apartment building. He only ends up investigating it because he sets off these new spring shoes he bought which launches him into the murder building. Conway ends up being part of a conspiracy and helps track down the real killer why also figuring out why the victim was killed.\n\nGood game. Good soundtrack.\n\n8.5/10","April 26","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You're a corporate spy in a 2-D world trying to solve a murder that you unwittingly pin on yourself. Each mission involves avoiding or knocking out guards, re-wiring electrical systems, smashing through windows, and hanging off the walls like Batman. You can jump ultra-high too without hurting yourself. Late in the game you can pull out your gun, but I don't recommend it.\n\nYou gain abilities by purchasing them in the store, and take missions for a variety of (competing) clients. You communicate with them via text message, and the conversations are often hilarious. They may have a variety of requests - complete the mission without hurting anyone, or kill everyone, or be completely silent.\n\nManipulating the various buildings is simple but extremely fun, and doesn't get old for the three hours it takes to beat the game. Given the length it might be a stretch to recommend this one at full price, but at $5 or less it's a no-brainer.\n\nSome performance notes: it's more demanding than a 2-d pixel art game warrants. My 2010 Macbook couldn't play it, despite meeting the minimum Mac requirements. I have 4.6 hours of playtime because the first 1.6 hours were spent struggling to try to play it on the Macbook before I gave up and played it on my main rig.","July 5, 2015","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
