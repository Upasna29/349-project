I've played a couple levels and probably 100 or so matches already, so I felt I would write an impressions review (mostly since there is a story of sorts, which I wont finish for a little while most likely, but when I do, I will amend this review as necessary).\n\nAnyway, this game isnt different in philosophy to Contraption Maker, Bad Rats, and so on, except that it is more enjoyable and definitely much more humorous. It does have a story as mentioned before. Basically you are an ex tennis champ who got hooked on an energy drink and it ruined your career and your life, so now, you are on a mission to free people from its evil influence, an influence that has spread like wildfire. How? Well, via your tennis skills of course. You will roll through themed levels (clowns, cops, etc...) using your service skills to try and knock out as many enemies as possible with as few balls as possible. There are obstacles that will destroy your ball, but others than will set off chain reactions that assist you in your endeavors.\n\n\n....and that is pretty much all there is to it, at least at the point I am at.\n\nbtw....if you idle the title screen to get as many points as possible there, you will get an achievement when you hit one million points, lol.\n\n\nAnyway, this is what I consider a great time waster. Just have a few minutes? This is the game for you. Have more time to spare. Ditto. In fact, while I doubt this will be most people's game du jour, it will definitely serve to fill those voids where you dont know what to play, dont have a lot of time to play, or generally are just bored but want to play something.\n\nActually a very easy recommendation for me. I give it a sliding scale 6-9 out of 10 depending on your state of mind, lol.","December 24, 2015","true","4.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","14","16","2","1"

Contrary to the title making it sound like you're a madman running around smacking people in teh face with tennis racket.\n\nYou are set in a position which you cant move and you have to aim and shoot your ball in which it bounces and reflects of walls in order to hit your targets. Your enemies at first are clowns, but then progresses on to Police and more!\n\nThe game is smooth and very relaxing - it also comes with 15 achievements however the games difficulty starts to increase when there are more objects on the screen and glass which destroys your tennis ball and stops it reflecting.\n\nThe game doesnt try to be anything special or stand out, although it does have pretty bright colors, funny humor and everything feels it works as it should.\n\nIf you're after a fun game for a cheap price then definitely get it. If you're looking for something more spectacular then maybe this isnt the game for you.\n\nIf you feel there is anything I missed or need to add, feel free to comment below.","November 18, 2015","true","5.7"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","12","20","2","0"

Think Angry Birds, but it's more about eliminating people on direct contact with your tennis balls (or exploding soda cans) rather than by falling debris, although that is an option as well. Seems like there are a lot of levels here, and you can extend your playtime even further by going for a crown on each level. The slow motion ragdoll effects after clearing a level are a nice payoff. This will be the closest you'll get to hitting a tennis ball at a latte and iPhone clutching hipster outside of your daydreams on the subway.","November 18, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","8","13","2","0"

Well, try to visualize a frog with a tennis racket in his hand… It is a bit hard to imagine, isn’t it?  Well, don’t! I have the answer for you. Just play Tennis in the face.\n\nTennis in the Face is an action/puzzle game with great physics. You will be playing Pete Pagassi, who will attempt to save the city from Explodz, an evil energy drink company. You will start your quest, as all good Tennis players, in a metro. You will have at your fingertips the Oddingtong Metro map and all you have to do is to get all the necessary golden crowns to unlock the next metro station.\n\nArmed with your sensational and precise serve (hopefully, you make an ace), you will have to hit all characters in the level with your tennis ball or a can of the energy drink from Explodz. Achieve a chain reaction and knock out all your enemies with a single ball (sometime 2) and you will score the perfect game, set and match!\n\nA well-executed game which offers over 100 levels with nice graphics and catchy music. Very easy to play, fun and the difficulty increases with each level.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Fun Graphics\n-	Easy to play\n-	Over 100 levels\n-	Great physics\n-	Achievements & trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	This type of game will always be a bit repetitive\n\nWell, I know what I am going to play during each Grand Slam - Tennis in the Face!\n\n8.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

You might be thinking to yourself, why would they not have gamepad support on the PC, you'd be surprised.\n\nNow let's give you a little bit of back story, you are a disgraced tennis all-star who owes all his whoas to an energy drink called eXplodz. It is now your mission in life to use your killer serves to take out all opposition as you take revenge on the company behind eXplodz. You will have to make your way through town taking on the likes of clowns, cops, scientists,hippies, and more.\n\nThe object of each level is to try to take out all of the enemies in as few hits as possible. Utilizing the platforms, walls, and enemies you will have to bounce the tennis ball to perfection. If you can do it quickly you will gain a crown for mastery of the level, and of course the more crowns you get the more special pieces you unlock.\n\nGraphically this game looks great. The levels are all clearly laid out, the HUD (Heads Up Display) gives you all the information that you need while not cluttering up the screen. There's also the fact that you get to see the outline of your previous hit's path. Actually to take it a step further even if you reset the level you get to see the previous hit's path, so if you are looking to get that perfect shot on the first hit you can take that approach, which is what I did several times when trying to get that crown.\n\nHere's the deal if you are looking for a fun game with plenty of replayability and you like physics based games, you are going to HAVE to have this game in your collection. There is plenty of game here, and the fact is that this is the type of game you can pick up and put down, and pick up again with very little need to learn the system again. There's also the fact that each level is only one screen so going through one takes almost no time at all, so there's no big time sink, well that is unless you get the itch and try to go through the entire game in one sitting. This game gets a 9.2 out of 10.","February 24","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
