"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/466800/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","The Dope Game is a drug selling simulator wherein your goal is to make it to the end of X amount of days without getting arrested or killed. Ultimately, you need to make enough money to pay back the loanshark who lends you two grand to get you started on the righteous path to selling all kinds of substances, anything after that is fair game to spend as you like.\n\nI'm not even sure why I bought this title. The most obvious reason that I can think of, is that it's a throwback to the old web-based drug dealer games that my friends and I used to play during computer class in high school. Somehow, believe it or not, this game is actually less interesting than the web-based version that I used to play; it didn't even have any fancy pictures. This one does, however mediocre they may be. I still haven't figured out why you seem to play as the Unibomber, either.\n\nThe gameplay is basic. You travel around different parts of the town, and you buy and sell various illegal substances. Each time you travel, an entire day passes despite the fact that you take the bus there. If you're smart, you buy when the prices go low and sell when they're skyrocketing. The catch is, not all substances show up every day, so you could potentially be stuck with 40 hits of Ecstasy for days; even longer if the price doesn't flip in your favor. Lucky for you, the creepy old hooker hag on the bus usually has some insider wall-street drug information. Sometimes you run in to trouble with the law, or groups of gang members. These events could lead to either your arrest, death, losing a portion of your money, or losing some/all of your drugs.\n\nThere are some stores scattered about town; the loan-shark, gun store, hospital, and bar. Each have a rather cliche character running the joint. Sometimes a random guy will approach you on the streets to sell you a new backpack, so that you can hold more drugs. If you're feeling especially violent, once you have enough money you can purchase a weapon and then go on a murderous rampage if you so desire.\n\nWith that, there is honestly not much more to say about The Dope Game. Once you've survived for the initial 15 day period, you can go back for 30, 45, etc, as they unlock through progression. It's fairly easy to cheat the game by just buying Ecstasy when it's at an all time low, selling at a high, going and paying back the loan-shark, and just traveling on the bus until the days are done. The gameplay is dull and uninteresting even for what it is, the artwork is painful to the eyes, and the music is drab. Just go seek out old web-based versions of this same concept, and you'll have a better time.\n\nRating: 1.0/5.0 - It's Bad.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","May 31","false","1.3"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

I would like to be able to see how much I paid for certain things though so it's easier to compare prices, and it'd be good to have bonuses like instead of running into the cops instead be rival dealers who you can jack if you win. Also, in one of my games I found 300,000 in the alley and while that's great and all, the game ended a few moves later because I won it. Technically I just found a bunch of money and it'd have been nice to continue on.

Luckily when your playing it switches between a few of these types of songs to keep it not so repetitive.\n\nOMG I\'m laughing so hard because your characters face looks like the Sketch artist rendition of the Unabomber, no seriously if your too young google it then lol.\n\nThere should be an option to shoot Sweaty mike when you come to pay your loan off, for\nhim being a cocky lil bish at the begining and threatining you lol (Update lol it seems that IS an option, omg you guys rock for that lol)\nLove that you can fight the dealer but it needs gunshot sounds, even the original dope wars had that.\n\nOne thing this doesnt have that dope wars had was a calculator and keeping track of how much a drug cost you and the currect rise or drops in prices. That was a REAL helpful tool to be honest and should be implemented.\n\nAt least travel still works well, I like the map system they have and that you ride the bus lol\n\nThe interactions between cities are nice, and a really great add on. Maybe add buying a Car for faster travel and holding more guns? That was in dope wars too.\nOverall I like the game, I hope they work in the sound FX and make more interactions, but overall I dig it.\n\nPros:\n+ Very Reminicent of Dope Wars, God did I love that game.\n+ Achievements\n+ Fun and Funny\n+ Trading Cards\n+ A game about selling Drugs\n\nCons:\n- No Gunshot sounds when Fighting\n- No keeping track of profits or loses\n- Needs more random encounters\n\nThis review is a part of Steamified\'s Community Reviews program and the credit goes to Steamified for providing the key for review purposes.\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.\nYou\'re also welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.","June 1","true","2.0"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","1"

In addition, a play session's length can be selected, mitigating unnecessarily long and repetitive games.\n\nThe basics of the game are as follows: The protagonist is a drug dealer, choosing to buy and sell a large variety of drugs in the city of Starkham for a set amount of time, beginning by taking a loan which is suggested to be repaid, but the option not to is given. The game revolves around profit: with assorted drug prices fluctuating over time in several locations, the player must find the best way to net enough money to pay of their loans, buy guns, hire bodyguards, et cetera, all the while under the council of an elderly drug addict on the public bus, who provides you with inside information and, occasionally, human teeth.","June 4","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The last 100 turns or so you have a cop jumping on you 95% of the time which makes it impossible to actually trade any dope. Since trading is the whole point of the game, this takes a lot of the fun out of it and makes the late game much more of a grind. PLEASE DO SOME BALANCING OF LATE GAME EVENTS!!!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piggypuggs/recommended/466800/","piggypuggs","That Random Indian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piggypuggs/","42 products in account","So I have got to say that this game isnt bad. It has a good concept and a good price. But as you play, the game appears to be very easy. I mean the first time I played I traveled somewhere and immediatly got arrested even though I wasnt hold durgs but whatever. But after that I won 4 times in a row in less that an hour. I mean I guess it got a little challenging but it was too easy for me. I could literally just go from one place to another, buy the cheapest drug in abundance, sell it in an expensive area, put all money in the bank, and wait it out. And BOOM you win. But one thing that really bothers me is that it seems more like a flashgame. It doesn't seem to be a game that would cost money. Also once you get the hang of playing this game, it gets repetitive. Going back and forth and getting a bunch of drugs and selling them and win. This game seems more like a slightly strategic time waster. But the characters kind of make up for this game. I recommend this game to the people who just want to spend their money on a flashgame or just want a time waster.\n\n\nPROS -\n\n- Good Concept\n- Decent price\n- Good Time Waster\n- Characters\n\nCONS -\n\n- Gets Easy\n- Gets Repetitive\n- Seems More Like a Flash Game\n\nI would give this game a 6/10.\n","May 31","false","0.3"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

It should be noted that everyone, including yourself and the police, seems to have had the same blind gun trainer. Thankfully if you run into any serious trouble, you can trip 5 times before finally running away from the confrontation. And don't worry if you run out of bag space because there will absolutely be a backpack peddler smugly waiting for you at every location.\n\nOverall, it's an okay game. It's basically a revamped version of Kongregate's Dopewars. If you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this. Now make your mother proud, buy 4 weed and chat with my spirit animal the bus lady.

You have to calculate the number of drugs to buy based on cash on hand.  There should really be a "buy max" button and increment buttons.\n\nOn the plus side the art is kind of cool and it looks like the devs are applying patches rather quickly when issues come up.","May 31","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Then i randomly picked up like 500k(which buys the best gun in the game) while having 50k (which is already a sizeable amount) and THEN cocaine was selling for 5K! it was usually around 16k at the lowest. So i bought like 140 units (the most i could carry). THE NEXT LOCATION, it did some dumb setback where i get scared by some gangbangers and I guess my characters is the worst drug dealer on the planet, because he dropped all 140 units of cocaine, and i went broke and floored my monitor...","June 6","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
