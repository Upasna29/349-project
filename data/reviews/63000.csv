The stuff of horrible, malicious slander and propaganda.  You hear it all the time.  They "hoard gold", "burn villages", "eat princesses", they "must be slain for the good of the people."  People brag about their dragonslaying prowess.  Showing a brutal murder of a dragon on TV barely merits a wink from standards and practices departments.\n\nIn a world where games like Skyrim and movies like The Hobbit glorify violence against dragonkind, it's good to see someone had the sense to portray a more balanced look at the situation.\n\nIn Hoard, you play as a dragon going about daily life while being hunted by cruel, vicious knights, seeking the companionship of fair princesses, acting as the local neighborhood watch by dealing with petty thieves said knights don't bother arresting, keeping unslightly crops from littering the landscape, preventing traffic problems, and other clearly benign acts.  In return, you have to survive the prejudiced assault of said knights, archers, powerful wizards, and trolls who want to kill you on sight.\n\nThis game is a poweful lesson in tolerance toward those who are different and scalier, and maybe could use a cool, refreshing breath mint once in awhile.","June 29, 2014","true","9.9"," 39 of 45 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","39","45","7","4"

While doing so you need to protect your lair from thieves and enemy dragons. To be able to better do this you can level up your dragon when collecting enough gold on a per game basis (does not persist between games). This game definately plays better with a controller and is designed with multiplayer in mind. While the game may get boring playing alone once you've tried every mode and possibly even before you've played every map at least once it's fun for a long time in multiplayer. The (up until now) two DLCs bring more elements to the game along side a good load of new maps which extends the gameplay quite a bit.","November 25, 2013","true","10.5"," 25 of 27 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","25","27","0","0"

I enjoy it a great deal. Nearly everything about the game is amazing. However, the developers made some glaring omissions when it came to this game. While these omissions do not diminish the game completely...they stop it from being a truly awesome title. These omissions are:\n\n* Ability to turn off the timer, in order to have open ended games.\n* Ability to set up a game how you want to play it. Units, buildings, # of dragons. Instead it's set up with predefined scenarios.\n\nOut of these two, the first one is really the downer here. I feel like, things are really getting fun around the 9 minute mark, only to have the game end at 10 mins. If you can look past that though, and are not a stickler for sandbox type features...HOARD is still a very very fun game.","December 29, 2013","true","2.5"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

With each thing you burn, you collect gold which you carry back to your lair to gain points. Not only that, but you get to kill knights and kidnap princesses. How awesome is that?\nThe aim of the game is to get as many points as possible in the ten minutes time that is allowed. That's it. Every game is ten minutes, and there is a variety of maps to choose from. With your treasure points, you can level up in each ten minute game, and choose different stats to boost. You can improve flying speed, flame power, gold carrying capacity, or your defence. You can't max all of them during a mission, so you level according to your playstyle. Do you like being a glass cannon that flies fast? Do you like being able to carry a lot of loot and tank everything? It's up to you.\nIt can be frustrating to play against friends as well since you can damage them and force them to drop their treasure if their health drops to zero. In Co-Op you can't damage each other. You can choose to play with your friends or against them, but in against, prepare for a little rage to happen.\n\nGameplay\n\nIt can be played as a singleplayer or multiplayer game, so you can play all with friends, or with one or two against the computer. It's actually pretty good as the computer AI isn't easy to compete against. This makes it just as fun alone as with friends, and because the games are always so short, it leaves you plenty of time to do other things as well, instead of needing to be committed to one game for hours on end.\n\nControls\n\nBetter played with a gamepad. Otherwise Keyboard WASD to move and your mouse to burn things. They are a little clunky at times.\n\nSound\n\nThe sound is relaxing, to the point you don't notice it as you focus on the game, it's perfect background noise. However, it can also be grating when your mission is nearing the end of the ten minute timer as it then becomes more noticeable,  since it makes you feel oh dear time is running out help!\n\nOverall Verdict\nThough its a simple and small game, nothing to get committed to, it can be the perfect game after a long and hard day, and you just want to relax to something by yourself for ten or so minutes at a time not having to worry about anything other than collect treasure with your purple flying dragon.\nAnd tell me...

On others, you'll need to ransom princesses, or survive a certain amount of time.\n\nUnfortunately, there is very little to Hoard's gameplay. Left click to breath fire, right click to power-up and use wasd to move the dragon. This makes the game incredibly difficult to recommend at 11.5$.\n\nThe game is also rather easy; the AI dragons will always let you backstab them for early gold, and keep them down throughout the matches.\n\nEither get the complete package in a sale, or skip it entirely, but it just doesn't have enough to be worth 11.5$. Don't get the game without the DLC, because it's not really worth it; the dynamite carts are the most fun you'll have past the first hour or two.","November 25, 2013","false","20.5"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","28","38","0","0"

Oh wait, im a dragon!\n\nGameplay\nHoard really has a interesting idea of just looting as much gold as you can from either destruction, stealing, or fetching princesses. You basically select what area to play in and can travel back and forth across it, but becomes increasingly difficult as more towers spawn to shoot at you and more heros also come out to attack you for stealing the princess.  Like bullet hell games but with a twist of staying on a grid with the ability to go back and forth at will.\n\nThere is various game modes like time trials, survival, race the other dragons to X amount of gold. There is DLC for more modes i believe but I have not actually tried them.\n\nMultiplayer\nThere is multiplayer but I have had no luck in finding people to actually play with. So I cant really say much about that, but since there is AI you can fight against I suppose it makes up for the lack of online people.\n\nNot sure if I would recommend this game at full price seeing as how for me its more like a game you pick up and play every now and then in short bursts for fun.","February 28, 2014","true","21.0"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I've had a lot of fun and a lot of laughs playing this game. It is overall simple, yet it contains some complex elements. You can destroy towns and farms regularly or you can leave them alone and let them prosper, making farmer carts and wagons more valuable. You could even choose to make a town fear you and send you tribute instead of destroying it, but enemy dragons could destroy it or even make a town fear them instead. You can upgrade your dragon to suit the situation. The dragons change visually depending on how they're upgraded, which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nHoard is at its best when you have friends to play it with. I still have fun in single-player, but the AI is not a challenge and has not been polished. I can easily end a round with more than 200,000 treasure while the enemy computer-controlled dragon has about 1,000 treasure. The AI is prone to flying straight through enemies without trying to dodge. Computer-controlled dragons will also sit on top of powerups for long periods of time in an attempt to pick them up, yet they can't because they already have a powerup that's ready to use. I've also had problems with computer-controlled dragons just hovering in random places for very long periods of time, causing them to get killed. You can play with up to four friends, but if you don't have enough players, the game will fill in any extra spots with computer-controlled dragons.\n\nI don't like the game's current music. It is too serious and doesn't match the fun, light-hearted nature of the game. I would recommend downloading and installing the old music. It really improves the game's atmosphere.\n\nI think the game is a bit pricey, but I'd recommend getting it and the DLC when it goes on sale. Definitely try to get friends to play it with if you get this game.","July 16, 2014","true","19.6"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","16","18","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dadsgamingaddiction/recommended/63000/","dadsgamingaddiction","Dad's Gaming Addiction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dadsgamingaddiction/","1195 products in account","Hoard is hard to pin to a particular genre, but I’d call it a mix of real-time strategy and action arcade with more focus on the latter.  Players will assume the role of a dragon whose goal will be to score the most points.  Players can go it alone, compete against the AI, or invite up to three friends into a multi-player match.\n\nIn Hoard, there are four modes: Treasure, Princess Rush, Survival, and Co-op.  Treasure is the main mode in which players will be competing to earn the most gold.  The map will evolve around them as gold carts make their way from building to building.  Cities become more populated, castles become stronger, and the human NPCs become more vicious.  Players will be attempting to burn down whatever they can to collect gold and bring it back to their base, though they are free to attack each other.  If a dragon loses its health completely, it is forced back to its base to regenerate health and loses any score multipliers or gold that it may have been carrying.\n\nTherein lies the strategy element to the game…players can go about their business and just concentrate on collecting gold for their stash, but will miss out on resetting an opponent’s score multiplier by draining all of their health.  Allowing another player to keep a 3x score multiplier throughout the game can be disastrous.  Multipliers are earned by staying alive and continuously funding the stash, but can be lost in a number of different ways.\n\nAnother neat aspect of the game that I find to be a great addition is that you can level up your dragon.  The more gold you stash, the more you can level up.  You’ll be able to increase your dragon’s speed, fire strength, armor, and carrying capacity.  Will you spec your dragon to be a slow-moving, but powerful tank…or will you opt to be Speedy Gonzales, stashing gold like no one’s business?\n\nAll in all, Hoard is a fun diversion in fifteen or twenty-minute spurts.  It’s not something I’d play for hours on end, but it’s a game I come back to every so often when I need to fill time.  I’d recommend waiting until it was on sale (Steam does this often) and pick it up then.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nsbQVfjIGw","October 29, 2014","true","4.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

Originally, I saw it on PS3, but for reasons I can't remember I got it on here, thus starting my life as a PC gamer. However, that is a story for another time, for now it is time to say I would whole-heartedly recommend this game for those who don't have the time to play full games, yet it is quite challenging for those that want a bit more in their small games.\n\nYou are a dragon and have to collect gold for your ever-growing pile back at your nest. Sounds simple enough, the difficulty comes in when you start to capture princesses, take down towers, defend your treasure agains thieves all the while raiding the villages around the map. There are many different mods, along with a nice tutorial which isn't all that helpful. How it works is you basically have to hit certain events in order to trigger more information about it. Once you've learned all the game has to offer, it lets you play a full game and offers you a gold if you can complete the challenge.\n\nIt is very beautiful looking, I love the table-top aesthetic that is given to all of the boards. It runs really smoothly and the controls work alright for what it's worth: WASD for movement, mouse to aim. The only problems I've really come across was that the AI is extremely basic, which is difficult when you're doing Co-Op challenges trying to get gold on everything. Multiplayer is also wierd, but there isn't much else I can say about it.  Another thing to note is that it does tend to get very repetitive by flying around destroying villages, protecting your stuff and upgrading every time you reach a certain gold limit. The final thing I want to mention is that the enemy AI is RELENTLESS and will more often than not kill you more by sheer numbers than actual difficulty.\n\nYou can also customize your game by modifying a few things, but not that much, if you want a quicker game or easier. If you have friends who are on the same network as you, there's a LAN feature that allows you to play together. For what it's worth, I say it's worth at least checking out if you're the type of person that enjoys grindy games and wants something to play for a few hours at a time in the same league as Fortix. Not really much else that I can say about this game without going into pointless details about the options, which there are a fair number of if you're the person that likes fiddling with menus.","November 4, 2014","true","31.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I enjoy playing this game, but it quickly fell off the top 100 games list. There's nobody playing this now, which makes matchmaking difficult. While the AI is pretty good (better than me, actually), it's more fun to play with human opponents and their quirky styles, so bring a friend.\n\nThe gameplay is fun. Fast-paced and frantic, like an arcade game. In multiplayer, however, there is no way to talk to the people in your game. If you're playing with people on your friends list, I suppose you could use Steam Chat to open up a voice channel, but for the most part you're playing blindly with strangers. This is OK, generally, except that matches take 8 minutes (I believe) and players sometimes drop out if they're losing. The Co-op game mode has the best chance of keeping a foursome together.\n\nWhatever, it mostly works, even though nobody plays. If you buy this, hit me up.

I did discover keeping your Onscreen Keyboard over the edge of the Hoard window gives you spacebar access.\n\nWindowed mode does keep you locked in to  the game window, but overall gameplay can mainly be completed with minimal mouse movement and mostly left clicking.

Burn the things, don't get hit while doing so, and ferry the treasure back home for points.  Simple, but effective.\n\nIndividual sessions are quick, and replayability is provided in the form of several diverse modes, along with the heavy emphasis on high scores.  Coop is quite fun, but unfortunately there's no community to speak of, so you'll only get to enjoy it if you have friends.  Competive mode is even more fun, with the ability to convert towns to your side!\n\nUnfortunately, the scoring system is very arbitrary on a map by map basis, with some gold medals being easy to get and others nearly impossible.  The scoring system also is critical to a fault, and will ruin an entire run if you make the mistake of getting hit even once or twice in a ten minute session.  However, these minor flaws don't detract from the overall experience too much.\n\nThis is a fantastic game for what it is, even if it's not what people were expecting from it.  Don't go into this one for a power trip fantasy - you are a glass cannon through and through.  Hoard can, perhaps, be blamed for choosing a theme that is not entirely matched perfectly with the style of game it is, but it's still a blast regardless.","November 17, 2014","true","33.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's played from an overhead view on maps that look like that they are built on a tabletop. As a dragon, you fly around destroying structures and enemies, collecting gold, and returning it to your hoard. As you collect more gold, you can upgrade your dragon's stats. There are several game modes but they are all essentially based on this mechanic and all about obtaining the high score.\n\nWhile this is all enjoyable, HOARD was clearly built around multiplayer (with both co-op and competitive modes) and playing by yourself to get a high score on the leaderboards gets boring very quickly. Unfortunately, there is no local multiplayer option and I was unable to find any games to join online. As a result, my wife and I couldn't play together and I had essentially experienced all the fun HOARD has to offer after just 15 minutes or so.\n\nOverall, there's nothing wrong with HOARD. It's a good concept that's executed well and seems like it would be fun to play... if you could actually play it with anyone. But with a dead community, lack of local multiplayer, and a complete lack of support from the developer (which was bought out by Kings), there really isn't much reason to play this one. I can only recommend HOARD if you pick up multiple copies so you can play with friends.","April 11","false","1.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Well, in comes the Steam sale to save the day.  I almost didn't buy it, but I'm sure glad I did.  It's clear that the game isn't very well optimized for performance, sadly, but in my case it turned out the 'chugging' effect could be fixed by forcing V-Sync on my graphics card manually, and now it runs smoothly (there is supposed to be a patch eventually to allow V-Sync to be changed in the options).  In terms of gameplay, it is surprisingly deep.  There's a whole mess of maps, options and game modes, and mechanics, and thanks to that, no two games play out exactly the same.  This is a delightful mesh of genres and I think there's is a seriously entertaining game here, once you get past the technical hiccups.

This would not seem like much of a problem at first, but when you need to aim quickly when dealing with faster enemies, you need fast mouse controls for your aiming. This game's first obvious problem is it's mouse control.\n\n2: Limited controller use. It's only support falls into a Logitech controller, and an Xbox 360 controller, this doesn't support Mayflash support or what have you. Thankfully, this issue can be resolved by disabling the control pad in the options.\n\n3: Lack of mouse sensetivity control. This could have resolved issue 1 so easily, this could have made the game more enjoyable.\n\n4: Selfish uncoordinated AI. When you play co-op mode, you expect to have some coordination between the AI, but sadly, this is only achieved through players working together. The AI is set on felfish if or suicidal plans, which is not that bad when you play against it, however, this still means the AI will fail miserably in co-op mode which requires some level of coordination for optimal play.\n\n5: Buildings and units capable of attacking the player upgrade too quickly. This would not be such an issue in a long term game, but when a castle is guarded by a legion of champions because they tore into you in earlier periods does not help.\n\n6: Time on maps is too short. A mere 10 minutes isn't exactly favorable with gathering. interesting as it seems to see how high you can gather before time runs out, it would make more sense if it calculated how much you could hold until you expired from no funds remaining.\n\n7: thieves spawn too quickly as do taverns. This is sadly a case with towns you control, as thieves seldom discriminate on who they steal from! This can mean they may steal from you even with their town loyal to you!\n\n\nSome things to note of good fortune include...\n\n1: color selection, there is a variety of colors to choose from, which is great for identifying your own dragon.\n\n2: Multiplayer functionality, if you can get some friends gathered up for a Co-op match, it's worth it to optimize your resources, and coordinate attacks for the benefit of your group, or to see who is the better dragon.\n\n3: The option to use a controller. This is a good idea, though it needs work, and more controller support for things such as the Mayflash adapter with Wii Classic controller Pro.\n\n4: BEING A DRAGON, now this is a fun idea, it's unfortunate though that the game has some issues.\n\n5: Potentially easier methods of collecting gold. From kidnapping princesses, destroying carts to take money, through grabbing massive gems to turn into fast easy funds, ransom can be a potent means of collecting money. Wizard gems however are nearly suicide as the towers upgrade too quickly, and do so much damage that 2 hits means you're flynig back to your hoard to recover.\n\n\nIf you're a fan of games that are brutally difficult, and have a cruel learning curve, I recommend it! Otherwise, until the creators patch this game to improve and expand the controls, stay away.","June 10, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't tried a controller, but it seems a controller may have an advantage over mouse and keyboard.  In all, it is a game I would recommend for those who like these type of action arcade games.

It is a simple game, but one that is simply fun.\nHorde is a party game at it's core, to the point where the ascthetic of the game is one of a boardgame assemebled on a table top. When played with friends it has all the hallmarks of a great board game to, diplomacy, backstabing, the frantic strugle for an edge to eek your way ahead of the competition as the countdown timer approaches zero... Though that last one is rare in actual board games.\n\nFor such a simple game it is very well thought out. Every aspect of dragon culture has been carefully included to make a highly dynamic, well balanced, cutthroat multiplayer game. There is no deep story or plot. Just some well developed game mechanics for lighthearted frantic fun. If you enjoy hunting for achievements the single player will offer a lot of replayability as well as they are well designed to actually require some skill and practice to achieve and collect... And that skill and practice will come in handy when it later comes time for you to torch your friends so you can take their precious gold for yourself.\n\nHeres what you need to know. You are a dragon, you live an a fantasy country side in which the local peasants are trying to amass wealth and power, and you being a glorious dragon much more powerful and worthy of that wealth are going to take it from them.\nThe games consists of a serious of 10-15 minute matches. In those 10-15 minutes, farms and villages will grow, send trade caravans to one another, build watch towers and defences... And you will burn them all to the ground, take the gold that is left from the ashes, terrify the villages into sending you tribute and kidnapping their princesses for ransome all to grow your hoard, because that's what dragons do... All dragons... Those other dragons on the map are not your friends... They are cutting into your profits... You see them eyeing your hoard... Turn your back and they will steal from you just as happily as from the peasants. You can't let them. Because to a dragon the size of your hoard is status, it is power. The more gold you amass the stronger you become. Rush to accumulate wealth the fastest so you can put those other upstart dragons in their place... The timer is ever ticking down, whoever has the largest hoard when it reaches zero wins!","April 26, 2014","true","26.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As for repetition problem that might arise once you play single player a tad bit too much ... well, the solution for it is simple - hop into Multiplayer, find a friend and start a match of both utter devastation and lolz you both can make on both the kingdom of your choosing and maybe even on each other if you don`t play co-op.

There's not much else to say about the gameplay itself, except the multiplayer. On its own, the singleplayer version of the game is rather tedious at first, with the AI dragging on behind. The player will be hundreds, even thousands of points ahead of the computer. So the addition of multiplayer really pulls the gameplay back up. The competitive mode is mostly the same to the singleplayer version, except more tense and difficult. Not only can you destroy human structures, but you can destroy enemy dragons, and even take their loot! You'll have fun with this game, if you have any friends.

You fly around without any inertia or power, a puny archer or two is a deadly threat, and destroying anything with your fire breath feels like you're melting an ice cube with a blow dryer. Actually, no, a blow dryer will keep going as long as you need it, but your fire runs out after a few seconds so it feels more like someone with severe asthma trying to blow out his birthday cake candles. And in keeping with the feeling of weakness, fire is your only weapon - you don't get to bite, claw or tailwhip anyone.\n\nIt's really a shame, because playing as a dragon who gets to rampage through a living kingdom was a great idea. It would have been an even better idea if there had an asymmetrical mode where the dragon players went up against human players  who controlled the kingdom Majesty-style, but still a good idea ruined by making a friggin' DRAGON feel WEAK.","August 9, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Should be a casual game but I get the impression that to be any good at it you either have to memorize an upgrade path or play quite a bit until it is second nature to play a certain way.","September 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The graphics are easy on the eye and the game rules aren't that deep. Rather shallow. But, this only ads to the somewhat addictive type of game experience that comes from Hoard. You always want to get more and more of those rpecious golden coins. One more and another one. The contrrols are simple, but efficient and not all game pads are supported. But, I think that the keyboard and mouse are the best choice if you want to score high during this game.\n\nThe idea with Hoard is to play as adragon against or with other dragons and to nick as much gold as possible from the peaceful villagers and nature humans roaming the fields. That's it, not more and not less. And still, this simple idea is just about perfect for this type of game. What dragon can get the most stash?\n\nBasically, Hoard is a pretty solid game and a "can't go wrong" thing if you hit it during a sale event. Perfect for some dead time occupation between the bigger titles.","December 20, 2013","true","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Not any respectable dragon I've ever seen. You get armor, speed, attack and (treasure) carrying capacity upgrades, but early on you're just a flying lizard that can barely burn down a windmill before it REPAIRS ITSELF. I don't feel like much of a dragon until the game (10 minute time limit) is almost over and it's time to start over again.\n\nWizard towers are a pain in the ♥♥♥ more than anything. They can one-shot you even late game with all your upgrades, have obscene health, and drop a valuable gem that makes you snail-slow and fills your carrying capacity. Any opponent that sees you hauling a gem will shoot your butt down.\n\nThis isn't so much a game as a series of mini-games running on the same theme. Kind of like Mario party, minus the board game. By the time you get comfortable with what you're doing, it's over. There's no story, just map selection. There's no characters, just choosing your dragons color. There are no other dragon types to pick.\n\n\n\nTD;LR:\n\n-You start too weak, and by the time you're strong the game is over.\n-knights can one-shot you, even though you're flying.\n-wizard towers will one-shot you, even late game, and their range is outrageous.\n-the AI is DIRT STUPID. If you're even half paying attention you'll blow it out of the water by 100k's of gold.\n-no story, just map and game mode selections.\n-There is only one type of dragon, you can only change your color.\n-You can lose a map to the AI and still be rewarded a medal. (Why???)\n\n\n\nIt's just not "enough game" to warrent buying, I have to give it a thumbs down. Its a good idea, but it should've been so much more. :(","June 25, 2014","false","15.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Many people seem to have the same problem, but the developers don't visit the community forum often and so far, haven't helped.\n\nI removed Steam overlay, and that somehow fixed it.\n\nFirst off, the tutorial doesn't do a good enough job of explaining aspects of the game. I always lost no matter what, because the AI dragon would steal from my hoard. The tutorial never explained how to do that.\n\nSecondly. This is a shameful port. If you don't have a controller, you're at a big disadvantage as you'll only be able to breathe your fire towards to left and not multi-directional.\n\nLastly, it just isn't worth the price tag while the developers refuse to help their fanbase with major issues.","December 16, 2014","false","0.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It's a simple enough idea - to hoard as much gold as you can - but they've put in some interesting aspects to the game which mix things up a little.\n\nThe game is very easy to pick up and just play (no need to read through a wiki of information to understand how things work) and there is a lot of re-playabilitiy if you're into getting gold scores. Some of the gold scores that involve surviving for a certain amount of time are really very challenging.\n\nI have admittedly never tried the multiplayer side of the game.\n\nGameplayYou are a dragon and your objective is to steal as much gold as you possibly can. You get gold from burning mills, crops, carts, towns - okay, well from destroying almost anything other than trees. In addition you can steal a princess and ransom her for gold, but beware of the knights who can hit like a truck and want to rescue the princess back from you. Also watch out for thieves, if they steal from your hoard then your multiplier will reset, usually destroying your gold score attempt.\n\nThere are also other AI dragons who will make things harder whether they are your allies or not. I should also mention the different game modes you can play in. One is a race to steal as many princess as possible. Another sets you to survive as long as you can, with more and more stuff spawning that will kill you as time goes by.\n\nControlsA combination of keyboard and mouse. You move with the keyboard and use the mouse to control which way the dragon is pointing to breath fire.\n\nStorylineNone, but none needed.\n\nSoundReally addictive and enjoyable music. Almost want to come play the game again just to hear the music a bit longer. However, it's not as good as the original music was!\n\nGraphicsAlthough they don't seem particularly posh, the graphics are clear and polished and there is a fair amount of detail to them and each map to give you a good balance of visual interest and clear visual information. The latter meaning, you don't lose track of where your own dragon is too easily, there aren't too many projectiles flying everywhere, and there aren't loads of distracting animations.\n\nPros+ bright, clear graphics\n+ fun, if generic, fantasy world\n+ interesting different game modes\n+ some very challenging gold scores to attain\nCons- controls can be awkward\n- AI dragons are stupid\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.\n\nRothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot com\n\nFootnotes\n*Prices are in CDN because that’s what I see. It’s $12.99 for the complete pack, which I do recommend going for, besides it’s cheaper than retrospectively buying the DLC.\n**My profile may not be at 21 hours at the time I write this because before I made a Steam account I had played the game a fair bit on my brother's computer. Yet I want to give you a good idea of how many hours of enjoyment I've got out of HOARD.\n\nEdit Log\n28/02/2015 formatting","February 28, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't bother to play this with your trackpad or a Mac.  You use mouse aiming to aim your breath, while keys to control your direction, which is fine, if the movement of the breath didn't skip.  In some areas, the crosshairs would track fine, and others, it would literally take 3-4 full swipes to get the crosshair 1/2 across the full range of breadth.  Throw in 114 achievements, most of which are "You play this game long enough and you will get them, no skill required", and you have a crapfest of terrible.\n\n1/5","July 10, 2011","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is really simple so you will be up and running in a few minutes. The strategy involves prioritising what to burn (other dragons, townspeople, buildings, carts ect) and accumulating as much loot as possible without losing all your health and resetting your score multiplier!!!!!\nThere are a couple of different modes to try out and getting a gold rated score can be a challenge on some maps. If you are an achievement hunter then there are plenty of achievements to collect.\nThe biggest drawback is the lack of players on multiplayer which make online matches unlikely unless you have a friend who is up for a game but on the few occasions where someone has been online I have found it adds to the fun.\nBurn it all!!!!!!

It's a simple enough idea - to hoard as much gold as you can - but they've put in some interesting aspects to the game which mix things up a little.\n\nThe game is very easy to pick up and just play (no need to read through a wiki of information to understand how things work) and there is a lot of re-playabilitiy if you're into getting gold scores. Some of the gold scores that involve surviving for a certain amount of time are really very challenging.\n\nI have admittedly never tried the multiplayer side of the game.\n\nGameplayYou are a dragon and your objective is to steal as much gold as you possibly can. You get gold from burning mills, crops, carts, towns - okay, well from destroying almost anything other than trees. In addition you can steal a princess and ransom her for gold, but beware of the knights who can hit like a truck and want to rescue the princess back from you. Also watch out for thieves, if they steal from your hoard then your multiplier will reset, usually destroying your gold score attempt.\n\nThere are also other AI dragons who will make things harder whether they are your allies or not. I should also mention the different game modes you can play in. One is a race to steal as many princess as possible. Another sets you to survive as long as you can, with more and more stuff spawning that will kill you as time goes by.\n\nControlsA combination of keyboard and mouse. You move with the keyboard and use the mouse to control which way the dragon is pointing to breath fire.\n\nStorylineNone, but none needed.\n\nSoundReally addictive and enjoyable music. Almost want to come play the game again just to hear the music a bit longer.

In fact, reading thru some of the other posts i noticed a DISTINCT LACK of any answers from ANYONE at BSG. doing some digging around i managed to find a support email address and sent an email containing all the info i had put into my posts in the discussions. that email was sent on 12.11.2014. as of 12.15.2014, i have not received any type of response, including any type of canned email response. i eventually discovered BSG had been bought out by another company, and any emails directed to that company also remain unanswered.\n\ndo i recommend this game? absolutely not. it is a waste of your hard earned money, and any support issues you may have will only fall upon deaf ears. you'll be out your money and be out of any kind of enjoyment you might have gotten from this game if it had worked as intended/expected.\n\nFIND ANOTHER GAME....DO NOT BUY THIS GAME....\n","December 15, 2014","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A game where you play a dragon stealing gold from villagers. With a tabletop aesthetic and realtime growth of human villages. You had so much promise but ended up so very disapointing.\n\nSo first off singleplayer is the same thing as multiplayer but with bots. You start over on each new map and the only gameplay option is high score mode. Each game is played for a set amount of time and the dragon with the most gold wins.    Gameplay can feel very slow especially when you are first starting out but you can also level up your dragon in real time as you get more gold.\n\nThe neat thing is that if you dont destroy a village on the board it will continue to grow and get better defenses. More knights will attack you and if it gets to be a castle there is a princess you can kidnap.\n\nUnltimetly the game just feels disapointing. There isnt any variety beyond what you get in the first map.

Opposing computer dragons are way better at targeting than you are, so expect to easily lose some head-to-head fights when you should really outclass the opponent. Bit better with the dual sticks from a controller, but not enough. 2/5","December 27, 2011","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
