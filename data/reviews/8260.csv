I will say that if you are going to get this instead of Save the World (AKA Season 1), Play Ice Station Santa through What's New, Beelzebub. Trust me, there is a Bonus at the final episode of the season that you get if you go through the order it was made for.\n\nWhile you are playing through the game, You can get rad Decals from the C.O.P.S and even upgrades to your DeSoto if you grab all the decals each episode.\n\nSam and Max: Beyond Time and Space is an experence that is worth the ride. if you have 30 bucks and been wanting to buy a good Point and Click adventure, then by all means, get this.","January 3, 2014","true","6.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/8260/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sam & Max Season Two is made of five episodes and continues insane adventure of Sam and Max in this point'n'click "old-school" adventure game. "Old-school" stands for "has nonsense puzzles".\n\nIt didn't make any big change to the series formula, still having same system. You will notice it in the graphics the most, as they are on same technical level, which would start to feel outdated in 2008. Then again, Season One was kinda outdated too. But hey, it still looks nice artistically.\n\nPositive thing that was added was hints system. You can choose how frequent you want to have main character throw hints at you, from none to often. They come from subtle to insultingly direct. Max may say to go somewhere else, he may hint you "remember how we did it the last time" or Sam may exclaim "Ah, I get it, it's <something that directly solves the puzzle>".\nIt's still helpful to have them as rare.\n\nAnd well, the first half of season isn't exactly amazing. It's original, yet something you kinda expect from comedical adventure games, while it also has adventure games sin: mini-games! Thanfully, they are easy and nice. Most hate cheap'n'hard minigames in such games after all.\nThen as the second half of season comes, it completely throws mini-games away and focuses on much more exciting setting. No spoilers, but you will get some fun things to do. Wink wink, time.\nAnd episodes felt a bit longer than expected too.\n\nSo, if you nejoyed Season One, it will be worth it. And worth it for others too. Almost. Puzzles are still stupid at times. Not as stupid as some "classics" though, it's still weird at times. And not always hinted. Well, aside from straight hints from main characters.","July 18, 2015","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They all sort of blend into one another in my mind, but I think season 2 was the most humorous and it certainly upped the craziness in terms of plot and the locations and situations that Sam & Max find themselves in. This season also introduced many new characters and started to phase out Bosco, who was really becoming tedious and tiresome for me over the course of the first season.\n\nBacking up a bit: these episodic games from Telltale are point-and-click adventure games with quirky characters and surreal humor. If you know anything about the Sam & Max characters, then you should already own all three seasons as you will most likely enjoy them.\n\nMy one complaint about the games overall is that there is a little too much going back and forth between the several locations that comprise each episode, trying to solve the main puzzle (or puzzles) in each location, in order to get something you'll need to go solve another location's puzzles. When you get stuck, you do a lot of visiting each of the locations, looking for the one thing you missed that will let you proceed.","December 30, 2015","true","8.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a franchise known for embracing randomness, the characters and plot fling around and slam together like a honeybaked ham in a laundromat dryer (that anaolgy sounds random, but makes *perfect sense* to the initiated.)

I guess this genre just can't compete with the whizz bang flash generic action/fps crap the industry puts out every year with the same cover across 40+ games.\n\nAnyway the writing and comedy in this game is superb and though some innuendo is present it always remains tasteful. The ridiculous storyline that doesnt have a hope in hell of making sense comes full circle and suprises you. Playing Season One first is a must. Sam and Max's often sarcastic banter is always fresh; add in some quirky characters and the breaking of the 4th wall every now and then and you have one hilarious adventure. The only bad thing i can pick out about the episodes is some of the incredibly tiny details they expect you to find/piece together to progress, while otherwise many puzzles can be solved relatively easily (But what Point-and-Click game isn't like that?).

There's some exposition regarding the recurring characters and what has happened previously, so it's not absolutely required, but generally you are missing out if you haven't played the first season.\n\nMechanics are pretty much the same, although the hint system has changed. If the game decides you are lost, one of your main characters will offer a comment without your prompt (and you get to choose the frequency of this happening.. down to "never"). Also as a side note, support for widescreen is there :3 And I'd say episodes feel slightly longer not sure if this is because there's more content or if they are slightly more challenging.\n\nAnyway, the wicked humor is still there and that's what you are for!","January 27, 2013","true","5.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

And in whole, tied up A LOT of loose ends from the first season. Telltale knew their ♥♥♥♥ back then too.\n\nFrom the technical side, a lot of improvements was made here. Mostly in the engine, which now allowed me to play at my native resolution (1080p), and added functionality to use the arrow keys while in the driving sequences and stuff. Other than the game looked much better and was slightly better to navigate, not much was done to the feel of the game. It was played exactly like the previous season, which wasn’t a problem.
