The pixel art is well done and the music is spot on.\n\nHowever, what makes this game shine imo is the blend of tactical turn based combat and strategy.\n\nBoth you and the enemies turns are taken at the same time. You must strategically move your party around the battlefield and try to set up "plays" and dodge, parry, shield smash, charge, face stab(I'm assuming, I mean where else would you stab the guy?) your opponent.\n\nThis makes for such a different turn based strategy experience. Each turn you're looking at what the enemy can do, which abilities are on cool down and whether or not they're out thinking your dash to the right or your retreat.\n\nI haven't tried multiplayer yet, but I can only imagine playing against a human counter-part would be incredibly challenging.\n\nThis is a game you have to support, if not for you then do it for me so I can get more content.\nCheck out my first 30 minutes below! It may be still uploading.\nhttps://youtu.be/ypg4B7RaoWg\n\n\nWant more Early Access/Indie reviews?

And that's a shame, since tactical rpgs are among my favorite types of games. Now  here comes Flamberge walking in, adding another adjective to an already long genre name, claiming to be a "simultaneous turn-based tactics RPG," which sounds like it must be oxymoronic. But oxymoron or not, Flamberge's combat works, and it works well. It's a fun and fairly unique combat system, and I'm happy to add Flamberge to my "Turnbased tactics rpg" shelf.\n\nThere's a demo on the developer website if you want to try the game out first.\n\nHowever, as of right now, there isn't all that much content. The story isn't there, there's no customization and you'll probably finish all the single player missions in under an hour. That will all change of course, it's an early access game after all, but as of the date of this review, the single player component might not last you long, so if you're on a tight gaming budget, you might consider waiting a while before getting this one. You'll probably get a good bit of mileage if you play muliplayer though.\n\nSo, anyway, I think Flamberge is a very promising title, I look forward to it's future, and I trust the developer will deliver.","March 26, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","8","8","2","0"

It uses this simultaneous turn-based mechanic (similar to Frozen Synapse) and it does it well, combining that with classic RPG mechanics like bosses, traits, and leveling up. The art style is nice, and the OST, I absolutely love (made by some dude called Ben Cohn). Though I can acknowledge that the last recent update was 5 months ago, they are indeed still developing this, and I got a lot of hope for Flamberge. I supported this in Kickstarter :P.","August 11, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Enemies stand there and let you whack them. Somehow you mysteriously miss, even though they stood perfectly still. Flamberge challenges those concepts. Enemies are reactive and are looking to hit you and save themselves. The key word that makes Flamberge so great is anticipation.  You must predict your enemies and constantly evolve your strategy. Combat can quickly change to your enemies favor with one wrong move. This, along with a whole host of RPG mechanics, traits, items, classes, bosses, and more. Make Flamberge sound like something new, fresh, and very exciting to me. With the basic concept and groundwork laid out in its Early Access. Flameberge is very simple to play and has great, detailed, pixel art.\nFlamberge is a game to keep your eye on.

This game is better than having a bullet lodged in my left lung. Heck, it's better than having a bullet lodged in both of my lungs. My eyes did not leave the screen for a single moment while playing this. I dislike turn-based games because they aren't exciting, or they aren't interesting, or they are boring, or I hate them. But Flamberge is the best turn-based game I have ever seen. It combines every element presented in the game in perfect harmony, and I may or may not have started worshipping this game as a god. Maybe.\n\nThis game is worth it's money, even with limited content. I can't even explain why. Perhaps only the words of the immortals can convey the amazingness of this masterpiece, and, alas, I am all but immortal. UNLIKE GREGOR.

The game features an interesting combat system where you and the A.I. pick and chose actions and then execute them simultaneously. Even though this game is still in early access I can easily recommend it with complete confidence. It's easy to play and is highly addictive. I can't wait to play the full game once it releases.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7DHUS88r4Bo","May 3, 2015","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninthpower/recommended/355420/","ninthpower","NinthPower","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ninthpower/","44 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOVERVIEW:\nThis game has been a pleasant surprise even in its current Early Access incarnation. To me, it plays like a more open (and less tedious) version of Fire Emblem. The mechanics are simple and the difficulty is ramped up in a really intuitive way that slowly offers the player new ways to see situations and learn the mechanics.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nAs said by others, the strategy plays out a lot like futbol plays where both the player and the enemy are positioning characters and using the proper skill (parry/disarm/attack/dodge/etc.) that will put the player in a stronger position for the next turn.\n\nYou start getting accustomed to about how far parries and dodges will put the enemy and you start stacking plays to do some real strategical damage. When your plays work out you just feel so boss!\n\nART/MUSIC:\nThe game is beautiful in both art and sound and you'll find yourself zoning out to the ambient piano tracks.\n\nVERDICT:\nOverall a really solid game even in Early Access. Can't wait to see how it grows.","April 7, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It needs more work, so don't think that this a completed project; It's still an EAG.\n\nIt's a coin toss as to whether the dev is going to pick it back up. He seems to have become interested in other things for quite some time, but what's here so far - while not worth $10 - is not bad at all, and with more work could turn out to be pretty great.\n\nIf you're interested then check out the demo.","November 9, 2015","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You set a path and a final action along the path.  If you predict where the enemy will be you score a hit based on your stats.  Map allows you to sneak around and get the jump- but if you stumble out you will be at a disadvantage.  Generally you will be able to get kills without losing health, but more complex maps set you up to manage your health bar against position.  Units revive if you win, but I am guessing KO units don't get experience.  No farming/grinding allowed/required.  Light on story at this point in my playthrough, but am not sure if more story would help.\n\nReminds me of old table-top games like Armor/88.  Could easily be adapted for tanks etc.  Good job Hydezeke","October 25, 2015","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
