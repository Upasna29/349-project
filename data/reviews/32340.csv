Unfortunately just not this version.\n\nThe version that Steam uses is a direct Windows port of the "talkie" CD released in 1992, which adds voice acting and VGA graphics, but at a cost. They removed a significant portion of the dialogue to fit the (uncompressed) voice acting on the disc, reducing the story and detail. Furthermore they censored many, many scenes. http://www.movie-censorship.com/report.php?ID=802320 has a pretty thorough list of censored and missing content. There isn't even almost any background music due to the dialogue taking all the space. As a result of all these, many scenes become rushed and lack the pacing or emotion they're supposed to have.\n\nThe voice acting isn't very good either, it's average at best in my opinion. The technical implementation is also somewhat bad due to being one of the first voice-acted games ever, as many lines are cut off abruptly at the end.\n\nIf you want to experience Loom, I recommend you to find the original EGA version or the FM-Towns version, neither of which are for sale sadly. The FM-Towns version has VGA graphics if you can't stand EGA, but the original looks really good in my opinion and has the best EGA graphics that I've ever seen. The best sound option in the EGA version is AdLib/SoundBlaster by default, but there is a patch[www.lucasarts.com] available that adds a MT-32 option (note however that you either need a real MT-32 or know how to emulate one).","December 21, 2013","false","2.1"," 293 of 299 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","293","299","0","2"

There is no game quite like it in the history of video games. As a professional singer and music teacher of many instruments, I still love the challenge of musical pattern recognition and recall of this wonderfully interesting game. I just saw the manual too and gosh, what a lovely throwback to the past when games really were works of art one could keep in the packaging and manuals that came with it. The music geek in me loves how one is supposed to use pencil to dictate the melodies one encounters in the game. It may be slow going for many of us (myself included) who are now so used to faster paced narratives in video games and other media; however, there is such a charm to it as well as some rather fiendish puzzles that had me cheating via online hint guides which incidentally one would have to pay and arm and a leg for with Lucas Arts hintlines, or so I hear. I give Loom 5 stars out of 5 for absolutely everything though I wish I could make bloody Bobbin Threadbare move far quicker- He is a tad snail like in his gait. Regardless, do play this gem while you have to chance. It is one of the best in the genre of adventure games and one of LucasArts finest offerings in this Musician's humble opinion :) Enjoy, Loom everyone.

I have played the EGA version all the way through and I think it's a pretty good game. I wouldn't rank it high among the LucasArts classics, but definitely something worth checking out. It's got a good plot and has an interesting take on the point and click genre; the only item here is a staff that can play music to perform a draft. You learn more and more of them as you play through the game, and use each draft to help get you through a puzzle. It's a fairly short game, but a good one.\n\nUnfortunately, LucasArts decided to include the CD version of this game instead of the EGA or FM-Towns version. While it has updated 256-color VGA graphics and voice acting, all of the dialogue and music had to be stored as CD audio. The voice acting is sloppily done at times and the music doesn't play very often, killing a lot of immersion. They also cut down the dialogue considerably, leading to some rather confusing moments in the plot. It's really a shame; I'd love to reccomend this game, but I just can't. There is a site that offers the FM-Towns version though, if you have bought this version. Since that's generally considered the best version (it has all the positives of both PC editions and none of the negatives of either), I'd say go on ahead and buy it and follow their method to obtain it.","April 18, 2014","false","0.5"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","29","34","0","0"

When I was a child I read in those paper things called videogames magazines about many graphic adventures nd one of those was Loom. In these days I had a chance to play something so I decided to start Loom... And Finish it. The playtime over there is correct. But let's talk about it later...\nLoom is a graphic adventure directed by Brian Moriarty that sees You as Bobbin, a recluse and almost despised wizard apprentice. Bobbin is summoned by the elders of the village and for some odd reason they're all transformed into swans along with all the villagers, then they fly away. Now bobbin is the last of his village and can pick up his staff to go and search all the lost swans. VERY abridged version.\nThe very innovative interface of the game requires the use of the aforementioned "distaff" which can play all seven notes ( you start with three, and unlock one by one the other ones as you proceed with the game). You can combine the notes into quartets to perform determined actions... Or better, spells (you're a wizard apprentice after all). How do you know the combinations? Along the game you'll see things happen which will emit notes. Simply repeat those notes to perform that action. Very creative indeed.\nUnfortunately the game is very short, even though the story was so promising, and some puzzles were quite interesting. And the worst thing is that the ending is kind of cut, or suspended. The story never really reach a conclusion, and if it does it's a really dark one (no spoilers, please).\nThere are dialogues, but they're just a little more of the essential. Still I really appreciated the voice acting of the characters.\n\n+++PROs+++ INTERFACE. This note interface was a very innovative system, it was a different and creative way to move into this adventure, it fitted perfectly in the game's story and setting and seems odd to me that no more games of the same kind were made.\nSTORY. I have to say that considering the lenght of the game there's a nice and interesting story behind all the game, And with a nice revelation at the end...---CONs--- STORY. ...Too bad that the story is abruptly interrupted at the end. Without spoilers, The end is a complete suspension of the story, obviously leaving every situation as it is. There were plans for sequels which never saw light, there were fan sequels project which never saw light except for Forge, with one chapter out already, but I have no idead about the project actual situation.\nDURATION. And this is the other bad side of the game. It took me 98 minutes to complete the game... Speechless...

Of all the point-and-click adventure games I've endeavoured, this one is by far the shortest.

The graphics and environments are lovely, and very importantly, the voice acting is fitting.  I also finally feel like I'm on the inside of the LucasArts secret club.  Finally, all those obscure Monkey Island references to this game make sense!\n\nDefinitely give it a play.  It's a quick little adventure with a famous classical piece as the backdrop.

When the Weavers depart from their world, Bobbin must venture from his village to reunite with his people and unwittingly uncovers a plot to seize control of all humanity.\n\nPersonally, I rate LOOM with a moderate difficulty. Those who are not familiar with the DOS action-adventure games of old may find the controls a bit tricky, especially in regards to Bobbin's Distaff, an instrument with which he can cast spells called Drafts that take the form of small pieces of music.\n\nThe key to this game is exploration, investigation, and patience. Interact with everything and everyone you come across and attempt spells on them to unlock bits of dialogue and helpful clues as to how to move forward throughout the game. Some puzzles are easy and quite straightforward while others.... not so much. The story, however, is worth all the trouble.\n\nClassical music aficionados will also recognize samplings from the ballet within the game's score.\n\nLength: 2-3 hours, if explored properly.","July 7, 2015","true","2.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I love Loom and consider it is one of the best point and click games i ever had played. Unfortunately, this game has one but very important flaw.\n\nSo, what is good in Loom? First of all, it is a beautiful game with charming backgrounds. The most important part of game - the story - is excellent. This is the story about young magician, who suddenly found himself in center of dramatic events, and story is very well designed. Main character is charismatic and i feel sympathy for him. When the chaos is right there and even the wisest can not find anything better than escape, even then someone just need to stand and fight while he can.\n\nI really liked the fact that in Loom player do not need to collect a bunch of strange stuff and use it in weird illogical combinations, as we usually do in hundreds of "another generic quests". In Loom we play as a magician who interacts with surrounding world by using his magic. To cast a spell, player must play a short melody, using a few notes in right order. With time, our mage will study new notes and new melodies, that allows him to make new wonders. I really enjoyed using this musical magic, it was interesting and exciting for me. I must notice that it is impossible (at least it was for me) to memorize all spells, so i recommend to prepare a pen and paper before launching the game.\n\nOf course, i should mention background music, soundtrack in Loom are compositions of the famous russian compositor Tchaikovsky.\n\nGoing back to the story... well, it is good - really touching and beautiful story - but it is too short and not finished. You can finish Loom in two or three hours and it ends at the most interesting place. So dramatically unfinished! It was a big disappointment for me, i liked the world of Loom, i would like to learn more about its history, i would like to see a sequel so much! In Loom ending is... it is not the ending, it looks like it is only the beginning of story. But, unfortunately... that was all.\n\nLoom is something like an interesting book, in which half of the pages, including the last chapter, was lost and never found. So much unrealized potential... i am sad about this.\n\nWell, anyway. Can i recommend Loom? Of course! Even more, i humbly believe that, if you love point and click genre, then you definitely need to try this game. I mean - despite incompleteness it is still one of the best games, precious artifact of the Golden Age, so why not?","January 16","true","2.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

As others have said, this version is terrible, a crime. However, I recommend you to buy it. Because once you have it in your Library, you can right-click on it and download the game manual. It is not actually the game manual, but the Book of Patterns, a piece of literature that you need to keep at hand while you play Loom. Steam features the best digital version of this book that can be found anywhere. Once you have downloaded it, don't bother to install the game. Instead, download some good old floppy version of the game and play it on ScummVM. You won't regret it.\n\n","August 26, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It centers on two tropes well known from fantasy stories: the creation of worlds and objects through weaving, and magical music spells. In the course of the game, the player has to play the notes of the spells (called "drafts") in order to manipulate the environment. As a newly learned draft is often not immediately used, it's advisable to jot down the music sequences in order to have the right spell ready at the right time. I can recommend the game to anyone with a penchant for good storytelling.","December 8, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story feels a little disconnected, although it does make sense within the world, but in an odd change from the usual inventory management of these sorts of games, I didn't find the music methodology to be exceedingly engaging. I did not play the original (which apparently had a more involved story) so that might have helped to grab my attention a little bit more.\n\nThe game's alright. Not great, but not bad.

One for the point and click veterans and one for those who haven't played it before.\n\nFor the new players first:\n\nLoom is closer to being a point and click than anything else adventure but it is unique. There are no inventory based puzzles, and only a few conversation based puzzles. Instead your character makes progress by casting 4 note long musical spells. Figuring out which spell you need can be as challenging as many traditional point and click puzzles.\n\nThe game is short but it has a properly charming storyline set in a completely weird fairytale-like universe. I think that alone is enough to make it worth its price. It also has 3 difficulty settings since a lot of the game is based on music. So it doesn't matter if you're tone deaf, pick the easiest setting and you'll not lose any of the game.\n\nReasons to play it... In spite of its age, Loom has a truly arresting atmosphere, an intriguing and mysterious plot and great atmosphere. The difficulty settings allow anyone to play and enjoy it.\n\nReasons to not play it.... very few... if you can't handle outdated graphics, if you only like object based puzzles... and you really need the sound on so don't buy it if you hate Tchaikovksy. The background music is mostly Tchaikovsky.\n\nFor veterans such as myself:\nThis is a very faithful update that has caused me no trouble working on modern windows machines.\nThere has been some very decent voice acting attached to the game. The only negative is that the inclusion of voice acting meant that the producers had to cut down the dialogue so what was already a short game is even shorter.\n\n","December 10, 2014","true","13.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's an adventure game that does away with a lot of the previous staples of adventure games, and tells an interesting story in a creative world. It's been a while since I played it last, but there were two negatives I can remember: it takes a bit too long to explore the world, and some of the songs required to finish the game weren't properly explained, and I had to look them up. Despite that, I enjoyed it, but it's not for everyone.\n\nIf this sounds like your style of game, $5 will be worth it. If not, there are better adventure games to look in to (like most of the Telltale Games).","May 27, 2011","true","4.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The voice acting is worth hearing. The edits made removing the character close-up portraits are for the best (they're poorly drawn and don't have formative lip-sync anyway, and the animation is minor. Any scene deletions aren't important to the plot. The game can be beaten on Expert in about three or four hours tops if a walkthrough is used. Play it for the story and the acting--adventure games seem to run along very similar lines and there's nothing that makes it do what others do any differently--your inventory is just moved into memorized sequences, so it's not like the game has no inventory. The writing is kind of confusing, with techno-magic babble confounding things. The audio drama is available online and worth listening to, since it's pretty much bare soundstage play acting (and since the acting is the best part of the game). The music is the most public domain-y generic stuff you can hope for, but it least it's not fully orchestrated and is MIDI (if you're going to listen to an orchestral version, don't go to a game to get the best arrangement of this particular song that repeats almost the entire stinking game with no contextual changes like in later LucasArts games). The story doesn't wrap itself up well, instead of ending on an ending, it ends on a beginning. If you're going to end on a beginning, tell the rest of the story, otherwise you've released a one-thirds finished story. Nice art design and acceptable animation, but nothing that will make someone's top roundup of vintage game art. Play it as a slightly interactive cutscene, not as a game. 30%.","July 22, 2014","false","4.2"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Even though it is short for an old-time adventure game, it possesses a number of fantastic qualities.  The world of Loom, being revealed only in very broad strokes by what we would now consider very primitive graphics, is evocative in a way that many other games fail to achieve.  The gameplay, in which one uses notes played on a magic staff to produce various 'drafts', sort of like magic spells, to solve problems is a fascinating mechanic.

Set in a possible distant future or in another world, you play Bobbin Threadbare, a weaver who is forced watch his people disappear and must go on a search for their location. Armed with a piece of wood called a distaff, you have to travel to different locations and solve puzzles by the way of music, 4 note combinations that can do anything from turn things green to fill goblets with wine. The Steam version is the up-dated version Lucasarts released some years ago and features re-mastered music and full speech.","November 29, 2010","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is like playing in a lucid dream; the game is old, but the art is still gorgeous. The story is very original. The music is enigmatic, tranquil and blissful.\n\nI enjoyed every moment of Loom, but I really wish the sequel was made; the ending is good, but some loose ends were not tied up. The game is an ethereal beauty and a special memory.\n\n4.5/5","August 27, 2012","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Voice acting and graphics are astonishing. Story is exorbitant. Definitely a MUST PLAY title for every serious gamer.\n\n\n\nFor the sequel, if you need it: http://forgegame.com/","May 1","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
