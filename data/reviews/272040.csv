You need to make paper color switch into 1 type for each stage to complete the level. There is a move limit involved and if u do it with least amount of move you get a perfect. IF u do perfect+1 you get an ok rating and still pass the stage but if u do any worse.. you lose the level.. A very simple and basic puzzle that everyone will love playing. There are not too many stages right now and as long as you don't get stuck.. you can finish it in 3 hours or so...\n\nNo archievement.. no trading cards.. basic graphic.. ok music/sound...\n\n7.5/10 for interesting little puzzle game.. And it's probably played better on a Ipad or other pads.. Need to have more stages.","January 15","true","3.1"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","1"

To solve each level you must select areas to fill continuously with a colour (like the paint bucket in MS paint), doing this a number of times to have the entire screen one colour to complete the level.\n\nHighly original and learning curve is not steep.  Some later levels are very difficult however.\n\nIt doesn't take too long to make your way through a majority of the levels, so game-length is perhaps shorter than most similar puzzle games.  Some have compared it to LYNE which seemingly has no end.\n\nOverall, recommended because it's a unique and refreshing take on the puzzle genre, well-presented and colourful.","November 8, 2014","true","2.1"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","0"

The aim in each of the puzzles is to "clear" the screen by making  all the paper the same colour by applying coloured paper to it in as few moves as possible. There isn't any time element to it, so solving the puzzles is quite relaxing and when the game gets tricky it becomes challenging, but not in a frustrating way. There's also a hint system to solve puzzles that you're stuck on. For the price, it's a lovely little indie game with very nice graphics which will probably get you several hours of gameplay, there is also a complex set of puzzles too.\n\n(I think it's very resonably priced) - Definitley worth a try if you love a good puzzle game!","January 23, 2014","true","5.3"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","0"

But wait, they've landed in a pattern, isn't that interesting, what would happen if you just rearranged them a little?  In KAMI, you're given the chance to find out.\n\nPuzzle games and brain teasers can be hard to properly quantify.  Is it a unique experience?  Is the game challenging?  Does it engage the player?  Does difficulty scale with skill?  Is it aesthetically pleasing and consistent?  Is it persistently replayable?  And when the player is done with a session, will they come away feeling satisfied?\n\nKAMI is created by State of Play[www.stateofplaygames.com], the makers of Lume, and named for a folding paper used in origami[en.wikipedia.org], it is a puzzle game where the user seeks to create a single homogeneous grid of paper by changing the patterns of sections of squares.  Each level has a series of different types of kami laid out in squares forming shapes and patterns on the play area.  When the player flips one piece of a particular kami, all linked pieces of the same type also flip, cascading in a way like what a player sees in game of go when a colour gets surrounded.\n\nReminiscent of Zen Bound 2 for it's Asian aesthetic, KAMI is a very minimalist title without any intrusive elements to detract from it's core.  There is one audio track for the game, although not an unappealing one, it can therefore become a little repetitive.  It can be disjointing when the music abruptly halts as the player enters a puzzle, and equally abruptly begins when leaving one, no music plays while a puzzle is in progress.\n\nKAMI is a puzzle game, so it will obviously not start your adrenaline pumping, and it won't shock you, but it will tug at your analytical brain and make you observe the grid and seek out patterns and layers of future moves.  Playing through KAMI you must see the effects of your moves often as far as 5 steps ahead in order to get a perfect score on a puzzle.  Once into the swing of things, getting an OK is not too hard, and often getting a perfect score will take a bit more effort, but not to the point of hair pulling or profanity.\n\nThe game revolves around finding a way to unite each different kami in successive order, so if black touches all of the scattered reds then that is your first kami to flip.  Hints are available for those having a hard time with a particular puzzle, but you only get one hint per puzzle, and it is only the first flip of that puzzle, and while sometimes that will be enough to show a player what needs to be done next, sometimes it just isn't that straight forward.\n\nKAMI comes with the iOS version of the game's premium content, which considerably extends play time, but once completed, there is little to motivate a player to return to the game.  There are no achievements or leaderboards for the fastest completion time, no meta to the game.  It would have been nice for the developers to take advantage of online capabilities and the potential of an engaged player base by giving a puzzle creation tool to players, a remote server could store all user created puzzles, assigning them all lowest possible moves and letting players download new puzzles regularly.\n\nOverall the experience is a calming and satisfying play through, with only a few minor caveats to interfere with the title.  I would say it's worth picking up for anyone who enjoys a sudoku session from time to time.  This review has been done in conjunction with Steam Contests, celebrating four years running.","January 28, 2014","true","2.1"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

The gameplay is simple yet challenging; the goal being to convert the entire board into a single colour of paper within an alotted amount of moves. The amount of puzzles is quite large (20+ levels that contain 9 puzzles each) and they increase in difficulty over time by adding more colours of paper and through making denser shapes with them.\n\nThere are hints available to help with puzzles you're struggling with; however they are rationed daily to prevent you from rushing through the game unjustly; which I found enjoyable as it forced me to sit down and examine pieces for longer - which in turn increased my apprecation of the delicate nature of the design.\n\nMy only wish is that the thematic music (traditional japanese accents) was looped, or had a several tracks to move through. Currently the only music played is when the game is opened or when a puzzle is completed in the correct manner. These little tunes help encourage the setting intended by the designers, so it would have been nice to have more of the same - and with an option to mute or not (there is currently no mute function, meaning that if you put your own music on and complete a puzzle the in-game tunes will still play (I would have probably bought the OST as a bundle too if it was available)).\n\nBut that's just a minor complaint honestly. If you want to have a relaxing time and feel like you're being mentally challenged in a pleasing and charming way, then please buy this game. If nothing else, it's nice to have in your library when you want some quiet time to either just have some light fun or to just zone out and relax (i'd also recommened putting on some chill or classical music whilst playing, it just makes all that much more pleasing).\n","December 25, 2015","true","1.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The player is given a palette of 3-5 colors and is required to ‘paint’ the areas on the screen, so that they all should have the same color in a limited number of moves.\n\nI was able to complete the ‘standard’ puzzles in exactly two hours. There are 5 ‘seasons’, each of 9 riddles, which gives an average time of 2 mins per puzzle – that means they are rather on the easy-to-plain-effortless side . There is also a hint system available, but as far as the ‘standard’ puzzles are concerned, it is not really needed that much.\n\nThe visuals of Kami are the very definition of ‘oddly satisfying’. Watching how screen fills with one particular color and listening only to the sound of paper folding is a pleasant and calming experience. This is probably the game’s greatest asset: it is a perfect  choice for unwinding after a tiresome day, and as far as I am concerned, it’s enough to make me return to the ‘premium’ puzzles (although, keep in mind that the 2nd ‘season’ –out of 3-  of ‘premiums’ deals with black and white patterns rather than colors, which makes it EXTREMELY difficult  to discern)   and wait for the sequel.\n\nPL\n\nKami zalicza się do gatunku gier logicznych przeniesionych z mobilnej platformy – w tym przypadku bez szkody dla samej gry, jak to czasami się dzieje przy portach ze smartfonów. Kami jest przyjemnym i odprężającym doświadczeniem – nie stara się przemielić mózgu gracza ani sprawić że będzie płakać pod stołem przez resztę wieczoru bo tego puzzla się po prostu nie da…\n\nW samej grze dostajemy paletę 3-5 barw i naszym celem jest ‘pomalowanie’ całego ekranu na jeden kolor w ograniczonej ilości ruchów.\n\n‘Standardowe’ puzzle ukończyłem w dokładnie 2 godziny, 5 ‘sezonów’, każdy mający 9 zagadek – średnio wychodzi 2 minuty na puzzla, czyli podchodząc do Kami nie należy się spodziewać zbytniego wyzwania. Na marginesie wspomnę że dostępny jest system podpowiedzi, ale raczej się nie przydaje.\n\nOd strony graficznej Kami jest totalnie odprężającym doświadczeniem. Gapienie się w ekran zapełniający się stopniowo jednym kolorem najzwyczajniej w świecie uspokaja. Podobnie jak muzyka domyślnie grająca tylko w menu – ale można ją włączyć także do puzzli.\n\nPodsumowując: największą zaletą tej gry jest to jak pomaga złapać oddech po męczącym dniu. W mojej opinii to wystarczająca rekomendacja i najprawdopodobniej wrócę do sezonów ‘premium’ – choć trzeba ostrzec że w jednym z nich zamiast kolorów, mamy do czynienia z czarno białymi wzorami które straszliwie trudno rozróżnić. Niemniej, jeżeli kiedyś pojawi się kontynuacja, prawdopodobnie będę chciał się z nia bliżej zapoznać.","July 26, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game has you folding paper, origami-style, to solve puzzles. The game’s title is the Japanese word for paper and I still have no idea how to pronounce it (I’ve been saying it like ‘CAM-E’).\n\nThe method used to solve each puzzle is why this game is so unique. Each puzzle starts you off with a square sheet of paper, much like origami, with this piece of paper being covered in small triangles of varying colors. Your objective is to make the entire sheet of paper one solid color in as little clicks as possible.  There’s a color palette at the bottom of each puzzle and its your choice in deciding what color the end result should be, with that hopefully being the color netting you the least amount of clicks.\n\nWhen you click on any triangle in the puzzle, any other triangle of the same color connected to the clicked triangle will change into the color you have selected. This is a bit difficult to explain, so I encourage you to look at videos, etc. This color-changing mechanic is accomponied by a neat-looking animation as well, which I would describe as a sea of paper-folding triangles.\n\nThe game’s major fault lies in the amount of content offered. I wish there were more puzzles to do, as there’s only 63. The game is $4 (on Steam) though, so that may be the reason. I ran out of puzzles rather quickly, although that can probably be attributed to the fact that I went for the bare minimum ranking in each puzzle, “okay”, instead of opting to go for the “perfect” ranking in each. There is another ranking as well, known as “fail”, and I’m sure you can figure what that means on your own.\n\nThe game’s difficulty curve is fantastic. Slowly increasing, but not to a completely frustrating point. If you’ve got time to kill, then I highly recommend KAMI. Although it may be short, it’s well-worth the unique experience. Oh, it’s also worth mentioning that the game does not fully display in widescreen, but instead has some rather thin black bars to the left and right. No idea why it wasn’t optimized for widescreen, wish it had been.","February 4, 2014","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's challenging enough to be engaging but not so addicting (for me, anyway) that you want to play it until 2am. At that late/level of tiredness you probably couldn't get anywhere with the harder puzzles anyway.\n\nCons:\nThe music. I just switched it off, but then, it's just not my type of background music. It might be yours.\nThis is a VERY casual puzzle game with no extras (other achievements besides 'Oh hey, you completed the level, here's the next one', or a story).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brbteabreak/recommended/272040/","Brbteabreak","Brbteabreak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brbteabreak/","460 products in account","Check out the full review at: http://www.youtube.com/BrbteabreakTV\nhttp://youtu.be/ynLtLKQtRP0\n\nIn a recent review I talked about how simplicity is bliss and how games don't need to be doused in a thick layer of unneeded "features" in order to be amazing. Sometimes I want to play a game with no frills or strings attached and just enjoy myself, welcome to KAMI. KAMI is a very "simplistic" game with the goal of turning all the paper into a certain colour.\n\nThis little game is quite deceiving, in a good way. Each level while having the same goal is completed in a completely different manner, though levels usually only have one solution if you want to get the perfect score, it cannot be helped though due to the simplicity of the colour scheme and how it's not based on some RNG element. You have to plan your moves 3-4 turns ahead and have to look at the big picture in order to achieve perfection. They're simple to complete, but challenging to perfect, and this balance keeps the game from becoming a chore and causing frustration.\n\nAnother thing to point out is this game is a port from the iOS, and from what I can tell not much has been changed. The menus cannot be navigated with the keyboard, it's not widescreen, lacks a decent options menu and also contains a weird hint system which seems to have been a microtransaction on the iOS.\n\nIn saying that it controls fine on the mouse and there seems to be no random mouse acceleration. It also can be played in a tiny window mode while still being fully playable, great for someone who experiences a lot of downtime at their PC. It will also run on Potato so you can just leave this running in the background without worrying about its hindereance on your PC's capabilities.\n\nThe music sticks to the Japanese theme of the game and helps maintain the mood without becoming to overpowering. Sadly the music does not play during the puzzles themselves, and while one might say it's to help concentration why not just give me the option to mute it during said puzzle? A simple icon would suffice to mute the soundtrack during gameplay.\n\nIt also goes without saying that KAMI looks amazing, animations are fluid and has a lot of subtle details that one might glance over. Things such as each paper square, though sharing a colour actually vary slighlty in texture or contrast. It has seemless transitions between all its game modes and puzzles, there's no loading screen which makes you think to yourself, just one more, just one more, and by then you've spent an hour looking at different colour paper and you've missed your bus.\n\nWhile I've been beating down on the game a bit, it's still enjoyable and the things I've discussed are condiments to an already satisfactory meal. While short you're going to enjoy your experience and will be euphoria for anyone who loves to plan turns ahead, much in the way of a game like Chess. That said I would recommend picking it up on Android or iOS for $1, same experience but save yourself some money.","January 25, 2014","true","3.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It combines a beautiful esthetic with simple efficacy puzzles to a very satisfying effect. The puzzles are easy to complete, but they present a challenge by encouraging you to use the fewest moves possible. I find myself doing the same puzzles multiple times because I am determined to find that perfect move set.\n\nThe visual style of Kami is simple and elegant. Using a combination of complementary colors, you strive to turn your puzzle into the singular hue of your choosing. With each click, squares of folded construction paper flow out from the selected location, slowly turning the puzzle into a satisfying uniformity of color.  The game does not restrict you to any specific move limits, and instead will continue to be playable well beyond the recommend move goal. This freedom allows you to simply play with the colors; folding and shaping your paper until your heart’s content.\n\nKami's music is a beautiful rendition in a traditional Japanese style. The game gives you the option to play the music during the puzzles or you can leave the music off and solve the puzzles in near silence. Aside from the music, the only sound during the puzzle is that of folding paper which accompanies each of your moves. This makes for a mesmerizingly tactile experience.\n\nThe simple design, beautiful colors, and comforting sounds add together to make an elegant and relaxing experience that calls to me at the end of a stressful day. For the measly price this game requests it would be a shame not to experience this little slice of peace and beauty.\n","July 2, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's simplistic, or it appears so. It involves some more backward thinking, single tiles being the difference between a Perfect and Okay, or Okay and Fail as you have an alotted amount of moves to clear the board without failure. The goal is to fold out the paper until you only have one colour. It doesn't matter what colour it is, thankfully. Puzzles can be solved in multiple ways. The premium puzzles are much more difficult, at a glance, if you want the added difficulty. The sfx are only present at the start and end of a puzzle, not through the middle. While the sounds stay true to the theme, I sort of wish they had more of a soundtrack involved with the puzzles, but that's minor complaint. Probably for the better, since most puzzlers I've played have failed to find that balance when it comes to music in the puzzle. Overall, I enjoyed my time with the game. Would suggest, at full price or on sale.","January 11","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/272040/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","KAMI is a puzzle game centered around a very basic mechanic – you are given a field of colored squares. You can choose any color and change any other continuous section of squares into squares of that color. Your goal is to change the entire field of squares into a single color (though it can be any color) within a limited number of moves.\n\nStory\n\nAs a pure puzzle game, there is no story to this game.\n\nGameplay\n\nThere are no real twists to the gameplay; every level in the game operates identically. Your progress is measured in how many moves it takes for you to succeed; if you complete a stage in the minimum number of moves possible, you get a “perfect” grade for the stage, and if you take one extra move, you get an OK grade. If you take two or more moves more than the minimum number of moves, you fail. You can restart each stage at any time, and three times per day, you can get a hint, which simply tells you what the first move in the puzzle is.\nThere are 9 stages in each “set” of stages, and 8 sets of stages overall, for a total of 56 stages. The stages start out fairly easy, but get progressively more difficult, adding more colors and more complexity to the patterns, and requiring increasingly greater numbers of moves. Early on, the puzzles can frequently be solved in three moves; by the end of the game, the final set’s easiest puzzle requires 8 moves, and the hardest set requires a whopping 19 – the initial “pattern” on many of these later puzzles looks almost like a random set of squares.\nThe closest thing to a “twist” the game throws at the player is a single set of puzzles which uses black and white patterns on the squares in the place of the colored squares used in all the other puzzles; unfortunately, while it looks somewhat pretty, it makes the game harder primarily via interface screw, namely making it more difficult to tell which squares have which pattern.\nOddly, there are a few puzzles in the game where the so-called “perfect” score isn’t; there are a few puzzles where it is, in fact, possible to actually beat the “perfect” score. Whether or not this is intentional is hard to tell, though it doesn’t really detract from the experience; it is just an oddity.\n\nGraphics\n\nThe game actually looks very nice and clean; the colored squares appear to be made out of construction paper, and the patterned squares have a very aesthetically pleasing visual appearance as well. The entire game’s user-interface is very straightforward and easy to use, though the “get a hint” system is somewhat strange in that hints cost three “points” to use and you get ten points per day – meaning that you end up with an extra, leftover useless “point” if you use up all your hints for the day.\n\nFinal Summary\n\nAs a mobile game, this is a fairly reasonable choice; it is ideally suited for a touch interface, and the games are quite short, with the puzzles taking only a few minutes to solve each. Unfortunately, as a PC game, it is fairly lacking; it is not a very substantive experience, and while it is “enjoyable” in the same sort of way that solving a Sudoku puzzle is, it isn’t especially entertaining, and similar levels of entertainment can be found for free on the internet. There isn’t anything wrong with it; it just isn’t a very fulfilling experience.\n","August 9, 2014","false","5.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

Nothing more, nothing less. From what little I've played of it, the magnitude of changes are pretty much additional colours coupled with some puzzle difficulty (hint- I suck at puzzles) that progresses more or less at a linear rate.\n\nPros\n> General aethestics are nice, the art assets seem very... crisp and have a sense of age to them.\n> Music is nice (when it plays at least), but that might just be my bias to oriental-esque culture.\n> Good to play when casually lounging or just bored\n\nCons\n> Music does not play often, and during gameplay it's typically silent which you could argue is to help with concentration\n> MAY? have a microtransaction system in place of hints, but I am not sure since I haven't used all of them\n> Barely (and I mean BARELY) any options. Fullscreen, music on/off and some other option. But hey, it's an iOS port so it should run on certain types of vegetables.\n\nOverall it is a good game to play while on the toilet or when you're bored. If anything, pick this up on the itunes app store and play it mobile. The cost for a game like this on the PC isn't too bad, but the iOS version should be justifiably better.\n","January 24, 2014","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lessigen/recommended/272040/","Lessigen","Lessigen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lessigen/","473 products in account","Functionally it's pretty much what you would expect from a "fill the entire board with *this* in x turns." Nothing more, nothing less. From what little I've played of it, the magnitude of changes are pretty much additional colours coupled with some puzzle difficulty (hint- I suck at puzzles) that progresses more or less at a linear rate.\n\nPros\n> General aethestics are nice, the art assets seem very... crisp and have a sense of age to them.\n> Music is nice (when it plays at least), but that might just be my bias to oriental-esque culture.\n> Good to play when casually lounging or just bored\n\nCons\n> Music does not play often, and during gameplay it's typically silent which you could argue is to help with concentration\n> MAY? have a microtransaction system in place of hints, but I am not sure since I haven't used all of them\n> Barely (and I mean BARELY) any options. Fullscreen, music on/off and some other option. But hey, it's an iOS port so it should run on certain types of vegetables.\n\nOverall it is a good game to play while on the toilet or when you're bored. If anything, pick this up on the itunes app store and play it mobile. The cost for a game like this on the PC isn't too bad, but the iOS version should be justifiably better.\n","January 24, 2014","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's one of the few puzzle games out there (Portal 2, The Ball, Limbo, and a couple others) that provide the player with a certain 'Aha!' moment. The sense of achievment in its difficult puzzles is really nice. It only comes short in terms of gameplay. There's no alternate mechanics to shake up the gameplay, and it only has 5 worlds of 9 levels each.  I'm sorry to say, I feel this game has nothing to offer in replay value. And you'll never really be stuck on one level for forever a la Candy Crush Saga, because there's hints. TBH, 20 MB and 45 levels of gameplay is not worth $4. If there was more, I'd reccomend it, because it's a fun idea.

I received this game in the recent Humble Bundle, which is highway robbery ; )\n\nKami's puzzle design is a simple concept, yet still quite challenging.  I "perfected" the first round/level of puzzles thrown at me quite easily, but in the second round an extra color was introduced.  I'm excited to see how many colors I'll have to deal with in the final round and even the Premium Levels.\n\nI recommend leaving the music and sound effects enabled.  Although if you don't find the music as relaxing as I do, just mute it and put on your own in the background.  My final thoughts are that I find the game to be challenging (not at all frustrating), soothing/calming, and worth it :)","July 4, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, not having anything to do, I started it up and was very surprised at what I got. The object of this game is to turn all the tiles one solid color. The trick is that the tiles you change will stop when they hit another color. For example, let's say there are two sides, red and blue, you turn one of the sides into the other by clicking on the side with the other color, solved. However, if there is a black tile in the blue zone, when turned red, every tile will turn except those behind the black tile, not being the same color. The visuals are fairly nice, limited but nice. The music is very nice, a calming, simple tune which is pleasent to hear. I will say that in the puzzles it is turned off. I found out just now by exploring that you can keep it on during the puzzles. Simply going to the options menu via a button, which I thought was a credits screem, will give you that option. The only negative, aside from that which is a nitpick, is that this game features two sets of puzzles: Classic and Premium. The classic puzzles are very enjoyable, increasing in difficulty but never very difficult, just hard enough. The same cannot be said for the premium puzzles. These start out fairly difficult and you will probably need a hint or two to progress. That's not a problem but the way this game handles hints, you'll run out of points easily and will need to wait about twenty-four hours before you go back to 10 hint points (which are spent as such, hint 1-3, hint 2-2, hint 3-1, hint 4-1, and so on). To end this review, for four dollars, you cannot go wrong so pick it up!","August 7, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a rectangular grid with squares painted in various colours and only one action - to repaint any contigous area into a new color. Given that, your goal is to have only one colour left on the board, and that in as few moves as possible. The first couple of levels are very easy, and then you are given more colours, and less obvious shapes on the board. But the difficulty progresses nicely, and there's a built-in hint system if you are stuck.\n\nActually, playing this with a mouse seems a bit inadequate, this is a perfect game for touchscreen devices. And it is - go and play it on your phone or tablet. It's also a perfect choice when you only have 15 minutes to play. As well as pretty enough and innocent enough to fool someone into thinking it's a wallpaper or some kind of screen-saver. So maybe office-safe too!\n\nGo play it, it's worth your time.","August 29, 2014","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like some other reviewers, I finished in ~4 hours with a 100% perfect score. Part of that seems to be intentional - there are some clever sequences of 3 or 4 levels where each one becomes more difficult due to a few minor tweaks in the puzzle layout. These sequences effectively teach you how to excel at this game without any instruction but a gradual stretching of your intuition.\n\nBut it doesn't necessarily have to be quite so easy to master. The second premium level - with its eye-popping geometric papers that subtly subvert your efforts to visualize the pattern - hints at the kind of difficult-but-still-not-frustrating levels that would really make this game one to return to for many hours on end.\n\nIn addition, I found myself wishing that the paper folding mechanic was a more integral part of the game, As it is, it's just an admittedly gorgeous, mesmerizing way to fill up a space.\n\nTo sum up, don't take my criticisms too harshly...I am in a bit of tough love with this game. It has a sense of taste and elegance that is really rare in the gaming world, and we need more like it. It hints tantalizingly at the possibility of more difficult, but still dolorous and delightful, sequel.

Still, since it had a very unique aesthetic, I decided to give it a go.\n\nVisually, I've got nothing to add. The game is beautiful, and it also fits the general aesthetic. The music is also good, enhancing the aesthetic, but not much in terms of immersion or gameplay... to me, anyway. Still, it's cool!\n\nThe puzzles are my problem. The first puzzles, I enjoyed! They were elegant, simple, and could still twist your brain a bit, when you found out that the most obvious solution wasn't the most efficient. I liked that. 4-6 moves was cool. The puzzles were also visually well put together! It's a gimmick, but it's well made nonetheless.\n\nThe problem, for me, comes with later puzzles, where the patterns turn into chaos, and moves going as far as 19. Without hints, there are waaaay too many possibilities with very few seams where one could start. (I'm mentioning the last level) Thankfully, the hint system helps a lot! It's also limiting, since you have a daily limit for it... Roots from mobile, I guess. One hint per level, later on, is ideal, since at least you know where to start.\n\nAll in all, it's just not my type of puzzle. There doesn't seem to be any real algorithm to solve it, and there barely are rules of approximation, later on. Initially, yes, sure. But later on, the levels are too chaotic for my taste. It's a matter of patience, at that point.\n\nThe levels have 2 solutions. One, is perfect, with the given number of moves. The other one, is "ok", where you have ONE additional move. It's impressive how much of a difference that one move makes!\nPerhaps it proves how ingenous the game can be. It's just not for me. It's like sliding block puzzles. I hate those!\n\nThe concept is simple, and it starts well! If it seems up your alley, go ahead! It's just not for me.\n\nThe premium levels (free on this version!) were a cool gimmick, but the middle set, in particular, had very obnoxious patterns. They were so similar that it was almost impossible to identify anything in the puzzle. The other were conveyed properly, though.\n\n\nThe solution is often awkward, not following any teaching of the game early on or anything. Good to pass the time, I guess.","August 31, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The colour palette is well choose,\n\nI cut the music after some time after several hours as I'm playing it in between other stuff so it was an annoyance after some time. The sound at the end of a puzzle whatever you win or loose is way to loud and I didn't see any slider for that, even in windows it's at the minimum and still too loud.\n\nI was playing strata before and it has too many puzzle, at the end I didn't felt the joy to finish each one as they were all the same. KAMI doesn't suffer from that in my opinion. The classic mode offer a large amount of different puzzle and the advanced mode give you some more, with the particularity of change the colour, which give quite a difficulty I think as it's tricking your eyes into error, I got of lot of fun doing those.\n\nHints system is good, but perhaps it's a bit much, if used on the same puzzle you can go up to 7 move on the 19 move last puzzle. But that one was crazy and I'm glad I had those helper. When I say tooo easy it's because you have 10 credits per day and the first hint cost 3, then it decreases. Even if it can feel cheating, on this game I didn't have that feeling, perhaps as I was unable to finish some of them and glad I could have an helper instead of looking for the solution ^^.\n\nSo I do recommend KAMI, for people who like puzzle game. It is a great fun.\n\n\nPS: Do not pay attention to my number of hours spent on the game as I idled a lot on it.\n\nLuuna.","March 2, 2015","true","44.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty in a minimalist way with pleasant sound effects, although the limited music becomes grating quite quickly.\n\nMechanically it's simple but satisfying.  There's no progression of mechanics but there's a gentle and smooth difficulty curve, with puzzles building on what's been learned from earlier ones.  Puzzles are set out in groups of nine, but within those there are commonly subgroups of three puzzles which are increasingly difficult variations on a common theme.\n\nOn the whole I'd say the difficulty for puzzle fans is easy to moderate, although the last set of 'premium' puzzles (extra on the mobile version, included in the Steam version) are quite challenging.  After five hours' playtime I'm currently 98% complete - I have two of the 63 puzzles where I haven't hit the move budget - and I can't see there being any short-term replayability, but this is reflected in the relatively low price.","August 18, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is partly because you'll learn out-of-the-box strategies to solve some puzzles, which will show up again in later stages. Some of the trick solutions were particularly devious and brilliant, and I would never have even guessed the opening move if it weren't for the hint system.\n\nThe way the game gives you hints is fair, while still making you work for it. I played anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour every day until I finished the game, and a good chunk of that time was spent staring at puzzles because I used all my hint credits for the day, and nothing I tried was working. Only to laugh when I saw what the solution was the next day.\n\nA lot of puzzle games can be frustrating, but I found KAMI to be joyful and relaxing.

Your puzzles were sweet, and your style was grand. How that sitar swooned me in the gentle february nights when I got perfects left and right. It wasn't until the third set of puzzles that I learned of your vile transgressions against me.\n\n10 hint credits a day, with no way to earn more. "No matter," I said. "These puzzles will not conquer me, for I am one with the kami." Oh, but sweet KAMI, I was wrong. So wrong. Your puzzles became devious, and your sparse, archaic mobile-style hint system with the only ability to wait for the timer to run down for my next set, in which I would use oh so sparingly. I needed my approving sitar, my golden perfect.\n\nOur peaceful days did not last. When in the deep of a puzzle, some where over a dozen flawless moves needed to be made, I discovered yet another transgression: no rewind button, only reset. The peace was over, and the fear of using too many hints drove me quite mad. Many times I would be a breath away from perfection, only to squander a certain move and have to start from scratch once more. Gruelling. Your cold beauty drove a steak through my puzzle loving heart.\n\nThe puzzles too, they withered in scale. No more were the clever patterns or cute little shapes, just guessing, guessing which color to start with, which amorphous shape to expand from. The challenge was gone, yet the frustration lived on. Oh KAMI, you could've been a classic, but you failed your own tenets of relaxing challenge and squandered your greatest assets as a thoughtful puzzler.\n\nKAMI, you really are quite something, but the people should know of your faults as well. You're definitely worth a grab in a sale, but regretably not much more.\n","March 6","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most puzzles only take a try or two to solve, but some are tricky. The whole vibe aims to minimize frustration, but I still felt a little thwarted when I couldn't solve a puzzle quickly. Nevertheless, the paper-folding sound effects are nice, the visual effect of the paper unfolding is pleasant, the music is soothing, and it mostly succeeds in engaging your mind in a meditative problem-solving mood.","February 6","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art goes very well together with the sound design, which is mostly the sound of folding paper, but they got that one just right. Solving the puzzles means a lot of folding, but the sound and visuals never became repetitive, instead they give a constant sense of satisfaction at your progress. More importantly they don't distract you from solving the puzzles and remain a backdrop. The game also allows you to turn off the music, making contemplating the puzzles a smooth calming experience.\n\nOf course you don't play a puzzle game for the design, but to tickle your brain and at that KAMI excels. You will use your intuition and structural analysis to determine the optimal solution. The designers got the puzzle progression and the learning curve just right as I felt my skills improving until the very end of the game. As to the last and longest premium puzzle (3-9), I found a weak spot, finished it in 18 moves instead of the perfect 19 on my first try and was like "meh". In hindsight I see that means a very well designed puzzle(game).\n\nAt other times though, you won't see the solution, you won't get lucky and you will simply have to guess. And KAMI enables that. Restarting the puzzle and trying out other ideas are part of the gamedesign and feel natural. You are meant to do that - a lot. Sometimes trying out random things is even required before you start seeing any patterns.\n\nThere are two possible outcomes for each puzzle: the perfect solution (smallest amount of moves necessary to finish the puzzle) and an OK solution (perfect + 1 move). Any more than that and you fail - which obviously bears no consequences other than your increasing frustration. The amount of moves required is shown next to the puzzle, so you will know how well you are doing. The puzzles are meant to be finished with the perfect score, the OK solutions rarely require an eureka moment, which doesn't mean they are easy, but they definitely aren't a challenge. Even the sound the game makes after an OK solution says: "At least you tried. Guess this will have to do." You can also have the game drop a limited amount of hints, though I don't recommend it, as there aren't many puzzles to begin with.\n\nThis brings me to the game's faults, of which there aren't many. Mostly, it is simply too short (which is of course only my subjective opinion). There are only 72 (45 regular + 27 premium) puzzles and the replay value is very small once you've found the perfect solutions, though with some premium puzzles you might want to examine your newfound solution in more detail. What is more, as you progress, the earlier puzzles become laughably easy. It took me about 8 hours to get everything I can out of this game.\n\nFurthermore, the second set of premium puzzles (one set is 9 puzzles) which uses abstract symbols instead of colours feels completely unnecessary. The difficulty is artificial and comes from the player having a hard time discerning between the markings. I would appreciate the change in visuals if it was well done. Alas, it is not and the puzzles in the second set are of little value.\n\nSome useful information to new players: it is possible to complete premium puzzles 3-5, 3-6, 3-8 and 3-9 in less moves than required for a perfect solution. It feels actually pretty sensible as they are somewhat tough to begin with and there is no real reason to punish the player for not finding the very bestest of solutions.\n\nAll in all I would definitely recommend getting this game for full price or on sale. A unique gem.","February 6","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
