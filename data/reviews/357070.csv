In UBERMOSH you get thrown into a mosh pit full of crazy enemies armed to the teeth and you have to use your katana to cut the bullets up and send them back to where they came from! Killing enemies lets you pick up their guns so you can bring down fire upon your enemies from your own weapons too!\n\nSince UBERMOSH is in Early Access and is also extremely cheap I won't mention anything along the lines of 'lack of content' in my Early Access review.\n\n+Awesome pixel art style\n+A kickass soundtrack\n+Well designed enemies and weapons\n+The weapons that are currently available are varied so you get a lot of different types of projectiles flying all over the place\n+Each round is ninety seconds (not that you'll ever make it to ninety seconds) so it's possible to have a couple of quick games even if you're short on time\n+Excellent value for money even if you only play it for an hour since it has such a low price\n+Simple controls (KB&M)\n+Provides a good challenge but the more you play the better you get, at least that's what I found\n+Three playable classes have been introduced, they add new playstyles to the game but there is still the no-class mode which is what the game was pre-update\n\n-I don't see you being able to play for more than an hour or two but for the price that isn't too bad\n\nHere's a short gameplay video I recorded:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwkeOsMvkow\n\nVerdict:\nEssential Purchase (9/10)\n\nUBERMOSH is a fantastic, fast-paced action game with a cool cyberpunk style, awesome pixel graphics, a fantastic soundtrack and great value for money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makutateridax/recommended/357070/","makutateridax","Arcos Of Blackheart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makutateridax/","378 products in account","Welcome to UBERMOSH, your 90 seconds (Or more) of violent mayhem!\nThis review will be changed consistently, Any time a new update is released, or I change my opinion of something.\n\nNow then, What is Ubermosh? Well, it's a fun little game where you're placed in a desert with nothing but a sword to kill people. Your first kill gives you a gun, if you remember to pick it up. You'll work your way up to the best gun in the game, a quad-shot red gun that I personally feel looks like the Lancer from the Gears Of War Franchise.\n\nYou'll probably die alot, but that's okay, the gameplay is so simplistic and fun, that you're always coming back for more!\n\nThe main idea of the game is to survive as long as you can, and beat your highscore, but as of update 13, There are now some bonus objectives to complete, such as survive 7 rounds, or get 150 kills with a certain playstyle, adding to the fun.\n\nThe music is so kick-♥♥♥ and awesome, making the rounds super fun to play, that it's surprising to know it was all done by one guy.\n\nThere's only a handful of enemies, but that doesn't really matter, since they all do the same thing. The only differences being, the gun they hold, and the blood they spill on the ground. Sadly, this also means there's not a big variety in guns.\n\nYou can currently choose between two different modes, Easy, and Hardboiled.\n\nEasy is, well, easy, not much to say about it.\n\nHardboiled, well, that's where it really gets fun and difficult! Edit: Originally, I had beleived Hardboiled mode to be a bit TOO difficult, as a result of removing Full-Auto, but after playing a little more, I realize, it's perfect the way it is. It becomes a fun, callenging, and true fight for survival in Hardboiled mode, and after going a few rounds in easy, I encourage you to take it up a notch!\n\nUpdate: You can now choose between different playstyles, called Class Mods. Kensai, Gunner, Wizard, or Normal.\n\nKensai: Melee only,Not too impressive, but a good idea. Originally I'd assumed it to be too easy, but after being forced to play it consistantly, I've realized, it takes skill to get anywhere in this mode. Originally, I said you could just stand there and wait for the bullets, well, that's not entirely true. You could, but you'd get killed. Enemies have the tendancy to fire their guns only when they're near you, whether you let them get close to you, or you walk close to them, the bullets will fire, and you'll need skill and quick reflexes to survive longer than a few seconds.\n\nGunner: Of the three new playstyles, Gunner is by far the best. Full auto gives you the opportunity to attack nonstop, and cause absolute mayhem,But only with a gun. You have no sword to deflect bullets. You're given 3 HP, and a gun to start you off with. Without the ability to deflect oncoming bullets, survival is made much more difficult, as any bullet that escaes your sight, can cost you.\n\nWarlock: Warlock serves as a companion to Hardboiled mode, as It gives you only 2 HP, But it starts you off with the best gun, and gives you use of the blade. I suppose the point is to offer a balance between surviving, and scoring, but I feel it's a bit bland.\n\nAs it stands, there's not much else I can say about the game, and I do feel it could be something more. At the same time,I think it's a complete experience, that will provide you with hours of fun.\n\nThe Pros ,the cons, and Inbetweens\n\nPros\n-Awesome music\n-Simple, yet difficult gameplay which provides an addicting experience.\n-Two modes (Possibly more to come)\n-4 unique playstyle options that each add a different level of difficulty\n\nInbetween\n- The only real objective is to beat your high-score.\n-You'll die, alot, and I really mean that.\n\nCons\n-Not many enemies to fight, means not many guns.\n\nKeep in mind, this game is made by a one man team, so some features may not make it in.\n\nFor what it is, I give it a good score of 8.9/10, and I HIGHLY recommend it.\n\nHere's hoping this game will become your new addiction!","May 17, 2015","true","8.5"," 48 of 62 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","48","62","2","1"

You need skill, patience and reasonable reflexes. The kids play it and have no issues.\n\nUbermosh is an arcade game where you are given 90 seconds to survive and kill as many enemies as possible. You are armed with a sword initially which you can use to cut enemies down with or their bullets in half with. The enemies drop guns that you can combine with your sword (L and R mouse button) - you do run out of bullets so you will need to collect new/different guns from dead enemies.\n\nIt's fast based and addictive.\n\nEnjoy.","August 15, 2015","true","2.2"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","37","46","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/357070/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Highly recommended. Short game about good old ultra-violence. 2d top-down-view arena bullet-hell (shooter) genre, which is well-known for the games like Crimsonland. Ubermosh have its own nice feature, which is working just like in the Star Wars - you have a sword to reflect enemy shots back to them. Offers quite a challenge, of the basic kind - kill as many frags as possible before they catch you... or the timer beeps off.\n\nAs a minus, it is very short - if you are a skilled Crimsonland veteran, I'm sure, you can beat it for all achievements in less than one hour. Also, there are not so much variety in guns, gore and types of enemies, as you may expect.\n\nStill, the experience is nice, the price now is very affordable, and to the top of all, all steam cards are so valuable, so you can return all your money spended, and possibly get some extra money over the price you've paid!\n\nMark 8/10 - best buy, if discounted. Tiny-sized, yet very exciting - if you have a knack for quick-paced bullethell bloodbaths.\n\nPS If you're aiming to the gold with all achievements, there is one where you supposed to survive to the end of round, 7 times. It is not impossible, but it goes that way that you either getting the top score, or not rushing into battle and survive. So! To get that "survival" badge, I suggest using the warlock setting, where you have the best gun from the start. Just find a place where you'll be covered from 2 sides, and shoot in other directions. With some luck, they'll not touch you until the timer is off.","November 14, 2015","true","2.2"," 31 of 39 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","31","39","0","7"

I mean it is early access and all.\n-There's not a lot of weapon variety at the moment\n-Repetitiveness could burn you out after a while\n\n\nSuggestions:\n-It would be cool to have a shop you could spend points you earn from rounds, or better yet have a system like Super House of Dead Ninjas where kills unlock you different colored gear, to different weaponry, etc..\n-Customization imo might be cool\n-implement a health pack drop every so often from enemies or a timed drop.\n-Perhaps different abilities such as buffed rate of fire, a shield that sponges one hit, a timed weapon that's stronger than the red laser shotgun(for example a blue laser shotgun that fires more projectiles that only lasts 15 seconds)\n-Create more maps(in general) but also make it to where you fight different species and therefore find yourself a new arsenal of weaponry from the corpses.\n-More game modes.\n\nthat's about it for UBERMOSH atm.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alffly/recommended/357070/","alffly","Alf Fly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alffly/","575 products in account","Ubermosh is an immediate, punchy, addictive arcade thrill. You have a sword. Your enemies have guns. Your sword doesn't just cut people - it also cuts bullets, redirecting them back towards where they came from. So you slice an enemy and take his gun, and then you shoot and slice until either you've succumbed to the increasing numbers of enemies spawning in or you manage to survive for 90 seconds. Then you start again.\n\nIt sounds simple because it IS simple, but that simplicity is in no way to its detriment. UBERMOSH may have a limited scope, but within that scope it's pretty much functionally perfect. That rapid gameplay loop - spawn in, kill, die, restart - proves immensely satisfying, recalling games like Hotline Miami and Luftrausers in its immediacy. Extra wrinkles are added by class mods that place limitations on your loadout and an extra-tough Hardboiled game mode.\n\nIt's not the prettiest game in the world, but personally I like the bleary-eyed, neon-lit 80's VHS presentation, and the colourful pools of alien blood that soon decorate the arena floor add some much-needed brightness. The music is spot-on, adding immensely to the sense of pace and urgency.  You can play using mouse and keyboard or twin-stick style with a gamepad, although personally I found myself preferring a hybrid control method where I aimed using the mouse and moved around using a controller balanced on my knee; it sounds unwieldy, but it's how I got my highest scores and survived the 90 seconds for the first time.\n\nI can't see many people playing UBERMOSH for long periods at a time, but then that's not really what it was made for. I've been having sessions of about fifteen minutes, and what's notable about that is that it always feels like I've been playing for longer, which I think is a pretty good recommendation. With its chunky pixels, copious amounts of screen-shake and immensely satisfying gameplay, UBERMOSH feels like the best game Vlambeer never made, and I can't think of a much higher complement for an arcade shooter than that.","August 13, 2015","true","4.6"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","22","32","0","0"

Pump that adrenalin producing game full of bassy low but fast music and hard impact effects and you get a brutal thump of a game that deserves those capital letters; UBERMOSH.\n\nHighlightsSimple, pure rampage fun with no frills. There are a few games developed in full by a single person (Banished, Dust: An Elysian Tail, et al) which really shine as a result, and this is one of them.\n\n* Low price deserves special mention, there aren't many games on Steam I can comfortably recommend at full price, this is one of those rarities\n* 10 Updates within 44 days of Early Access- this title isn't going to be lost in the wind\n* Good effects that work well for the low-res\n* Thumping low bass soundtrack\n\nMistakesUnlike most Early Access games, there are very few issues, probably because of the games simple, hard-hitting nature. Currently the only real issue with UBERMOSH is it's lack of variety in bad guys, maps and content. There are a number of small things I'd like to see added, like Achievements, but they can't be classed as mistakes. If you're looking for reasons not to buy this, remember that it's currently being worked on full time by the developer, and anything below may have been changed since the time of review.\n\n* The main menu is pretty unintuitive and messy. There are currently only 4 menu items and a class selector wheel, yet 90% of the title screen is taken up by the title image and the 4 selections somehow feel cluttered\n* There's no reason to use anything other than the sword and the 6-Shot gun (which is currently the best gun in the game) so there's almost no variety in attacks after a certain time\n* The aim-fixed camera and bobbing can cause light motion sickness for some\n\nRecommendations\nI'm usually hesitant to suggest buying Early Access, but for only £1.59/1.99€/$1.99 it's an oversight not to pick this one up and it's likely only going to get fuller. If you like the music featured in the promo video then it's also worth the extra £1.20/1.99€/$1.99 for the Soundtrack.\n\nThe one thing to hold you back is that it's likely to come up on sale for just a few pennies in the future, and will probably be all over Indie Bundles for less.\n\n* If you're hankering for more of the awesome music, you can listen to the equally good and freely available soundtrack for GEARCRACK Arena, by the same developer, on Soundcloud here[soundcloud.com].\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/357070/","May 28, 2015","true","7.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

True. But well, from what I've played, I was really charmed by it. Old-school arcade shooter with a punching soundtrack, simple as hell (well to understand) and that idea that the blade can send back bullets... I'm already in mode trying to send them all.\n\nWalter Machado listened to us, people used to arrows for moving or AZERTY users used to ZQSD (which is our equivalent of WASD for QWERTY). He updated the game so that we can finally play with more ease (try to do WASD on AZERTY and you'll be killed after a few seconds). And well, since that, I've confirmed my first impression that UBERMOSH is a little gem. For the price, you'll not be robbed.\n\nWhile the graphisms are clearly influenced by retro-gaming and what we used to have before, I can still see that huge blade, that nice characters and well....

It's personal preference really as it is very easily playable with either control scheme.\n\nAs far as the action goes: it's blindingly fast and crushingly addictive. Different enemies handle different weapons which determine size, speed, and spread of the bullets. To fight them, our means of attack are your gun and sword; the latter can also be used for defense as it can deflect bullets.\n\nWith the ability to deflect bullets, there is also the added variation in how bullets are deflected; for example, the large single bullet is deflected into two slower bullets, while the bullets from the game's proclaimed 'best weapon' almost appears to move back at the same number and at the same speed. A nice feature is the ability to control the direction of the deflected projectiles depending on where you have hit them.\n\nThere's not too much difference between enemies. There seem to be three total but they really only come in two sizes: humanoid, and large alien size. Despite this all seem to move the same speed. While that may sound boring, I believe it simplifies things and helps add to the twitch-frantic action.\n\nAs hard as this game is, you don't ever really feel cheated and are forced to 'git gud'.\n\nAs far as visuals go, the masterpiece is the pictured soldier on the menu. The art style and symbols used remind me very much of Tsutomu Nihei - it's good stuff. I also liked the fact that as you survived and progressed and raised your ranking, the soldier's armour would change (both in game and on the menu) and reflect that change in rank; though I wish you could view and choose the different armour variants.\n\nFor $4USD, this is a great arcade-style game with an awesome soundtrack too.\n\nPS: The 'Kensai Mastery' is impossible.\n\n28/08/15: Kensai High Score = 114 -_-","August 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It keeps gameplay a simple matter of beating your high score in a 16 bit arena full of respawning goons, like a super-basic isometric-ish Unreal Tournament. There are 4 different weapons to choose from, and a melee weapon that can reflect bullets back at enemies, which (aside from melee which you start with) you get by killing off aforementioned goons, and the game objective is as simple as this: Kill as many opponents in the 90 second time limit as possible while not getting killed yourself.\n\nIt's a staggeringly simple concept that for the most part is excellently implemented. Right now, there is only very barebones content, but the game price is reflecting this, and where many games have tons of content but are seriously lacking in enjoyment, Ubermosh is great fun to play and easy to lose hours playing due to it's dip in/dip out gameplay.\n\nThat said, the only dark cloud on this game is that it's early access and developer Walter (it's a one man game team) isn't quite happy with the brass tacks of the gameplay mechanic yet. As such, minor but significant changes are happening within the game all the time (I've had the game about a month max and it's been radically overhauled 10 times already, each time significantly changing the play style required) and right now, each update is resetting your score, which for a game that is purely score-attack and score-attack only can be disheartening and frustrating.\n\nIf you want to support a hard-working solo developer intent on making a well-balanced arcade throwback, and play a game that isn't finished yet but already has piles of one-more-go addictive gameplay, then buy it now.\n\nIf you feel having said game continuously morph overnight into different adaptations of said gameplay, or indeed losing your progress each time it morphs is going to upset you in anyway, I would advise you to wait til Ubermosh comes out of Early Access, because Walter is still very much actively working on it, and as such sometimes it has features added for as little as 4 hours until he decides actually they weren't a good idea. Which if he's reading is absolutely fine, that's development xD. But be aware that the game is being built in front of us.","May 10, 2015","true","8.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Hell, I've purchased 'Triple A' (By whose standards?) games for 30 times that and stopped playing after an hour. Buy this game now while it's cheap and still amazing.\n\nLiked------\nPretty much the whole thing. Quick, easy to pick up, and hard as HELL. Soundtrack is tight too.\n------\nDisliked------\nThe game as it is now, is great. There's not a whole lot I would change. My main dislike at this point is the lack of content. But of course as the game's development progresses, more content should be added.\n------\nDeveloper Suggestions------\nBesides more content(i.e. maps, skins, weapons, achievements), I have a few suggestions I think would improve this game a little more:\nAdd a "pickup" key, for example space bar, that has to be held down to pick up a weapon. Not really major, but I personally found it annoying dodging guns I didn't want as well as enemies.\nImplement some sort of "forced movement"(e.g. stand still lose health) mechanic, for sure. This I think is pretty crucial. Not just for added difficulty but for enjoyment. The game is more fun the more hectic and twitchy it is. Forcing movement will prevent picking up the red scatter gun and just camping a spot.------\nFinal ThoughtsIf you like twitchy, quick, arcade like games, pull out your plastic right now. For $1.99, this alpha is a must-have. The developer is actively updating to make it even better. Don't wait for it to be out of alpha, and get a huge price increase(hopefully, this game is So Good).

Ubermosh has the looks and sounds to stand out from the crowd and make a lasting impression.\n\nThe gameplay is simple.

Alittle bit too easy?\nDo you want a Hotline Miami-eque game set out in a desert where the only trusty weapons are a neon orange cyber sabre  that cuts bullets and random guns?\nMeet this lil' gem: UBERMOSH.\n\nUBERMOSH must've been the best Early Access game I've bought and enjoyed for a long time.\nThe cyberpunk arcade at it's current state may be small, but surprisingly, it's hella addictive.\n\nThe consept is simple: You're a Samus Aran 2.0 stuck in a Kerrigan betrayal situation where a load of alien beasts with blasters storming at you. The goal? Survive by cutting and shooting, and a 5 slot chance counter before it's game over.\n\nI will adress a few pros and cons, though:\n+ Features a fast paced gameplay with a neat control balance and trigger response.\n+ Brings a upbeat punk soundtrack that makes the expirience much larger.\n+ A unique type of arcade in a mosh pit where you either kill or get killed by aliens equipped with a multitude of guns.\n+ Perfect for a quick play during the day and can make you return just to beat the high score.\n+ Morgan Freeman\n+ Self customized skins for each ranked reached.\n+ Gives the option to play with different class mods such as Warlock, Kensai and Gunner, holding different playstyles for each one.\n\n~ Alien spawning comes at a really short intervals, making the player more aware around the enviorment. Problem here is that the cursor play a large role when it comes to scouting out the area, and can cause the player to be vulnerable.\n\n- Endless ammunition. There could've been a limited capacity before the gun is deemed unusable.\n- Guns laying spread across the player area, making it abit of an issue when using one gun and suddenly it's auto-swapped.\n- The swap time between the cyber sabre and the gun doesn't go faster or slow enough to make either a speedy gameplay with both slicing and dicing plus gunning or the player naked enough out in the battlefield for the enemy to shoot you.\n- The game tend to lose saved data, nulling out the rank and kill counter, resetting the whole thing back. Don't know if this is intentional or if that only happens if no internet connection. Regardless, it's abit sad, but it can work as a motivator for some hardcores. (UPDATE 14th of August: This has not occured in the latest updates so I believe the score deletion issue is fixed.)\n\nWhat I wish from this game in the future:\n* An options menu for resolution, volume/sfx adjustment, and fullscreen/miniscreen option.\n* Maybe online co-op.\n* For Extras: A retro 80s arcade window mode.\n* An option to play with controller. (Partial controller support added as of the 0010 update)\n* Possible additions of ingame/Steam achievements. Not utmost important. (Achievements added and class modifications added as of update 0.12-14)\n\nOverall, the whole game in it's current state (as of 5th of May, 2015), it is really well made, and a absolute bargain with the price tag it's on now.\nWould recommend to those who seek out something fresh, loves cyberpunk, retro games (Metroid like), and a game to kill time with a short session of good action.\n\n(Ultra secret drinking game: Take a sip of whatever alcohol you got when you're extracted back to the main menu with friends. Y'all be floored within an hour.)\n\nUPDATE 10th of May 2015:\nController support has been featured for this game, which makes the gameplay alot more different than mouse and keyboard.\nGoing from the Xbox 360 controller, you steer the character with the left analog stick, aim with the right, slash with the cyber sabre with the RT button, auto fire the guns with the aim stick, and start the game with the start button.\nThis need abit of rework, since the gun is auto shooting while directing at one point. I can get the feature might be abit handy and not have to press a button individually, but an option to auto fire could be dandy. Or just leave it and get use to this (for the time being).\nStill, the combat flow is real steady as I'd hope it would be, and I await further improvements and extension on this aswell as more content etc.\nGood job, dev!\n\nUPDATE 14th of August 2015:\nWith the additions of class mods and achievements, this game provides you with a richer experience as your playstyles can be changed from melee only and gun only, to the most overpowered set in the game from the get go.\nPersonally, the respawn tweaks are somewhat justified, but a problem runned into too frequent is the timecap of 1 min 30 secs when playing for class achievements.\nAlso, the damn tutorial doesn't pop up on the hud when playing every session.\nStill, amazing cleanup and addons, Walter.

You cut down your enemies, pick up their weapons and use those to kill them. Your katana is not only a weapon, but also your defense, as it can deflect bullets. You have only 4 "respawns", which is the amount of times you can get shot before having to teleport away.\n\nThe game combines a nice cyberpunk aesthetic with tight controls, and a nice soundtrack. The gameplay is extended with a "hardboiled mode" which reduces the amount of respawns you have, as well as "gun mods" which change your gameplay. Give up half your respawns in exchange for starting with the best gun, or have double respawns but only use your katana.\n\nThe game isn't very long, but it is really enjoyable. I'd certainly recommend it at this price.","August 17, 2015","true","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I mean, it is impossible, at least for me, to stop clicking or pulling the right trigger to fire as you frantically kill off many enemies trying to take you out.\n\nPlus, this is the first Early Access game I purchased, and I can tell you that I do not regret that purchase one bit.\n\nIf you're a fan of dual-stick shooters like, say Robotron: 2084, Total Carnage, or Zombie Apocalypse (using those three as examples), PLEASE give this game a shot.

The game is extremely difficult, yet incredibly addictive. It's the same everytime you play, there are around 6 different types of guns each with different fire rates, projectile speeds and projectile types to accompany your sword, which you use to deflect enemy projectiles.I think it's a little annoying that on occaision, an enemy might literally spawn on the ground you are walking to, which will cost you a life every now and again if you aren't quick enough to right click in time. Basically, if you are looking to spend very little money, on an addictive pixelated clusterfest, this might be for you.

You get 90 seconds to survive and take down as many gun-wielding alien goons as possible, and initially, you only get a sword. You bring a knife to a massive gunfight. Luckily your blade is capable of reflecting and splitting enemy fire and forcing them to eat their own bullets.\n\nGraphically, the game is very simple, but effectively incredibly intense. You'll see classic pixel sprites and a constant smooth 60fps throughout. It's also incredibly color and plain fun to look at.\n\nGameplay wise, this game is a roller coaster. You get a few different classes to choose from, and each of which you'll have to master if you plan on 100% completing this game. No Class Mod has you start with a sword only, but allows you to pick up enemy guns, and you get 4 hits before you fall. Kensai allows use of only the sword, but you get six hits before game over. Gunner gives you a fully automatic gun at the cost of your sword and give you only three hits. The last and frankly best class is Warlock, which gives you use of the sword and the best gun in the game right out the gate. However, just two hits and you're down for the count. Completing this game requires you to get 150 points with each class, 200 points with any class seven times, surviving the full 90 seconds seven times, and attempting (but not beating) Hardboiled Mode. If you love games that are purely score-based and are easily motivated to beat your own high score, this game is tailor-made just for you and I guarantee you'll have hours of fun.. If you don't break your mouse. By the way, I do highly recommend using the keyboard and mouse over a controller. I personally find the twin-stick shooter controls awkward and troublesome. It works smoothly and everything, but it's simply not my cup of tea.\n\nThe music in this game is by far the best element, and the developer was smart to include the soundtrack as DLC. I can't really describe it well but I guarantee you could listen to it while fighting off an alien invasion and be pumped and focused the entire time.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun, difficult time killer! It's hectic, fast-passed and difficult, so beginning gamers may have a tougher time, but give it a bit of practice and you'll have it completed in a matter of hours.\n\n9/10\n\nTL;DR\n\nPROS:\n- Incredibly fun\n- Incredibly high replay value\n- Best soundtrack on Steam. No joke.\n- 100% completed very quickly if you're focused and skilled\n- The badges and cards aren't bad either\n\nCONS:\n- Very high difficulty - not recommended for newer gamers\n- May cost you a mouse or two if you're easily frustrated","February 19","true","4.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Cutting bullets with a sword and arcade-style gun-toting mayhem all rolled into one amazing package. The soundtrack is adrenaline-fuelled and it makes you want to keep on going. The class mods also add an interesting spin with each one having different effects.\n\nIf ever cyberpunk mosh pits become real, I want them to be like this.

Its addicting, easy to learn, hard to master, and just a great indie game.\nThe gameplay is you start with a sword and ricochet projectiles at your enemies by reflecting. The reflected projectile kills your foes instantly, and you cut also rush an enemy and cut them instantly too. A dead enemy always drops a gun you can borrow. Each class you play has a varying amount of lives, and can be orientated towards a shooter or a slasher role. The Warlock starts off with the strongest gun in the game, and can reflect bullets, but also only has 2 lives. The no  mod class/GREEN(The default class) starts with no gun, 4 lives, and can reflect bullets. Kansai starts off with 6 lives, and a sword, but can't grab guns. Gunner has 2 lives and a fully automactic gun, and can make any weapon, even the strongest weapon automactic.\nOnly real problem with this game is a lack of content. Theres a Hardboiled mode, and 4 classes with alternate roles, some Steam achievements, and of course Trading Cards. However, the trading cards really have had their value dropped by a ridiuclous amount($0.24 to now $0.07). If this game had local multiplayer, that would be so amazing...*hint hint game developer*\nTo anyone who enjoys addicting fast paced gameplay, I highly recommend this game. Its speed, pumping electric  soundtrack, fast paced action, low price, just mix together to make this one of the best games i've played in a long time.","January 9","true","3.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a simple game, really. You're thrown into an arena, tasked with killing as many enemies as you can, while simultaneously trying to last for the duration of the event. There are several guns, and a blade which allows you to cut enemy bullets, winging them back at the shooters. I can't level any worthwhile complaints at the mechanics of the game. If this was all that Ubermosh offered, it would be a solid - albeit, lackluster - game. However, I haven't touched on its best parts, yet.\nAt its core, Ubermosh is a frenzied bullet-hell shooter. It's arcade-y in all of the best ways - simple, clean, and addictive. But, this isn't what makes Ubermosh so much fun. No, it's the chaotic, electric-neon adrenaline rush the game manages to create.\nThe soundtrack for Ubermosh fits the gameplay and visual style completely. The gritty, pounding electronic vibes blend perfectly to the frenzied tempo of pulsing laser weapons and slashing projectiles. Visually, Ubermosh conjures something akin to the neon-drenched arcades of Gibson's Sprawl Trilogy; it's a mix of static and pixelated splashes of vibrant color.\nUbermosh is a simple game, yes. Simple enough that some might consider it a negative. However, it's a steal at $2 - well worth the price of admission.\n\nUltimately, Ubermosh is an addictive, pulse-pounding pixelated frenzy of a game; it's a game with the look and sound of a cyberpunk dream, which delivers frantic combat. And, I can't help but recommend it.","March 7","true","1.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a simple game, really. You're thrown into an arena, tasked with killing as many enemies as you can, while simultaneously trying to last for the duration of the event. There are several guns, and a blade which allows you to cut enemy bullets, winging them back at the shooters. I can't level any worthwhile complaints at the mechanics of the game. If this was all that Ubermosh offered, it would be a solid - albeit, lackluster - game. However, I haven't touched on its best parts, yet.\nAt its core, Ubermosh is a frenzied bullet-hell shooter. It's arcade-y in all of the best ways - simple, clean, and addictive. But, this isn't what makes Ubermosh so much fun. No, it's the chaotic, electric-neon adrenaline rush the game manages to create.\nThe soundtrack for Ubermosh fits the gameplay and visual style completely. The gritty, pounding electronic vibes blend perfectly to the frenzied tempo of pulsing laser weapons and slashing projectiles. Visually, Ubermosh conjures something akin to the neon-drenched arcades of Gibson's Sprawl Trilogy; it's a mix of static and pixelated splashes of vibrant color.\nUbermosh is a simple game, yes. Simple enough that some might consider it a negative. However, it's a steal at $2 - well worth the price of admission.\n\nUltimately, Ubermosh is an addictive, pulse-pounding pixelated frenzy of a game; it's a game with the look and sound of a cyberpunk dream, which delivers frantic combat. And, I can't help but recommend it.","March 7","true","1.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You have exactly 90 seconds to destroy as many of your enemies as possible and of course not die in the process. This game is all about fast replay, like arcade games of yesteryear. Armed with a sword you will dance across the battlefield weaving death while using your enemies weapons against them. For an EA title this all works very well and and the controls feel very tight. As far as difficulty goes, Ubermosh is far from an easy game but death doesn't feel cheating usually, unless an enemy teleports on top of you. One thing to keep in mind though is that you pay for what you get here. While the visuals, music, and gameplay of Ubermosh are fantastic. It's short, repetitive and mostly involves killing everything in sight. Beating your own score is all that is currently involved in the game. Hopefully leaderboards and more features to shake things up a little are on the way. (Bosses would be sweet.) If you are the type of person who played Flash games for hours trying to top leaderboards or you enjoy games where you slaughter endlessly. Ubermosh is going to satisfy. Those looking for something more complex and feature rich, may be disappointed. So get your twitch fingers ready and sharpen those eyes and play some Ubermosh!\n\nI made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/ii2Toy60H5U\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","August 1, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Except for violence.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and fairly conventional. You run around and kill aliens with gun and sword, racking up as many kills as you can within a time limit. This game takes it to the next level with absolutely top notch presentation. The music is fantastic. The weapons are satisfying. There's no plot, but there's a hint of a setting that I find intriguing. I hope to see more.\n\nThere are a few classes, but they don't really change the gameplay significantly. Instead, I'd say they're better served as training tools. No class is the best all around, but you can learn from the weaknesses of the other classes and come back as a better player.\n\nThere are a few flaws. It's very easy to get stuck on the walls, and hits seem to my eye a split second before you actually see collision with enemy bullets. It took a bit of practice to get used to the timing with the sword for that reason, and it can be difficult to know why you died because there aren't any visual cues when you take your last hit.\n\nThose are minor issues, though. This game, for its limited scope, is fantastic.","February 6","true","4.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Worth what I paid, wouldn't buy it for the full price though. The game itself is pretty fun, but lacks variety and replayability. Would be better if there was at least an endless mode, but atm you can't have a run for more than 90 seconds, which is quite frustrating. Needs more gun and enemy variety, too. Overall, I would recommend this game, but ONLY when it's on sale.

You deflect an aliens bullets back at him, kill it, take its gun and kill everything else until you die. Its simple but fun; and its gameplay is sploffing fantastic. There are a few modes, in one of which you spawn with the best gun in the game and you go on a rampage; another limits you to your sword (I love it) and another limits you to your gun.\n\nThere is a Hard mode for you suicidal folks out there which is not needed because the game is not easy, far from it. Not that its hard to learn, its just hard in general; you are going to need twitch skills to avoid jumpscaring damn Aliens coming out of the corner of your screen.\n\nWhat about the problems? Well, there is one. One huge one. There is not enough content; as soon as you spawn and play for a Min or so (if you do not die) you have seen most of the content on display. I reccomend a few updates to the game to increase its content; new enemies, new maps (I wanna see a jungle damn you!), new weapons, new everything! This game has a fantastic OST and its gameplay is perfect, if it were to have more content it would be a fantastic game.\n\nFor now its a very good game in its own right, little bursts of gameplay for the lols every now and again (because the loading times are brilliant) are nice, but if you dont give me enough content to keep my intrested I will not stay intrested and I will go off to play a game with more substance.\n\nI rate it a 8/10. Why not less because it has little content? Well, look at its price. Its great value, every pence you put towards this game will be rewarded with a good amount of content. Bang for your buck.\n\nPS: You know that announcer at the start? I want to get that guy's voice in my life.\n\nEDIT: After a few hours of writing this review, I not only discovered that the developer cannot change the game any more without adding entire DLC's or games, but I discovered that there is another version of Ubermosh. UBERMOSH: BLACK. Not only are the breasts on the main character improved but it has various other addons.

The pumping soundtrack serves to put you in a trance, to better slay all before you. It's a fantastic way to get a quick and satisfying rush.\n\nYour aim is to get as many kills as you can in 90 seconds without losing all your lives. You do this by shooting and deflecting projectiles back with your sword. You move with WSAD and attack and aim with the mouse but a controller is supported as well.

Although each round is only 90 seconds the game just sucks you in and you will end up playing for hours. This is hands down the best $1 I've ever spent. This game is worth every penny you put into it, whether it's on sale or not. Another bonus is the amazing sound track that gets you super pumped and makes you feel even more badass while cutting bullets with a sword.

However for the same price you can buy a pretty sweet game that goes by the name of Ubermosh.\n\nSimilar Games:\nCS GO 2D and the Hotline Miami series are what I can think of right off the bat.\n\nGameplay:\nThe rounds start off with a trickle of foes, you might even wonder where's the action? Well no worries, in around 10 seconds the screen will be filled with a deluge of pixel foes who wish nothing more than to delete your sorry ♥♥♥ from the arena.\nTo combat these hordes of incoming foes you can choose 3 distinct classes, each with their own playstyle. The classes are Kensai, Gunner, and Warlock.\n\nThe Kensai is the most durable of the three but is restricted to using the blade only.\nThe Gunner has no defensive abilities besides dodging bullets, however she gains the ability to go full auto with her guns, like the saying goes, the best defense is a great offense.\n\nThe Warlock gives you the best gun right off the bat and lets you swing your sword, sounds pretty OP right? It is, to a certain extent, but you only have 2 health (Although you can deflect bullets leading to a debate if the Warlock actually is less durable than the Gunner.)\n\nIf you don't want to be restricted by class, running without a class is a good way to get into the flow for Ubermosh.\n\nPros:\n\nCheap\nFaced paced action\nSense of satisfaction when you do well\n\nCons:\n\nSpawns are wonky sometimes\nCan get repetitive with only one map\nGets frustrating if you force yourself too much\n\nWould I recommend this game? Hell yes, for the low price of 2.19 it's definately worth it, although you may wish to buy Ubermosh Black instead for a similar price if you are willing to devote 1 more dollar to this kind of game :).","March 17","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messmon/recommended/357070/","messmon","Messmon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messmon/","171 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUBERMOSH is a very fun arcade-style game where the player has 90 seconds to kill armed aliens and people and acquire a high score. That's basically all there is to it, and that's a major part of the appeal. It's a simple kill-everything game, and it does it well.\n\nSomething that I think should be changed is the display. The widescreen aspect ratio gives the enemies the perfect opportunity (which they take, frequently) to shoot the player the very instant they pop in by coming in from the bottom or the top. Changing the display to 4:3 and zooming out slightly would help greatly with this.\n\nOn top of the instant pop-in shots, another thing that makes rank progression difficult is the random nature of the game. Enemies don't spawn until 5 seconds into the round, and sometimes can't be found until around 10 seconds in. The enemy spawn rate will also change in the course of the round, I frequently find myself destroying a set of enemies then there's a large lull before more appear. It makes it feel like rank progression is based on the game's whims rather than personal skill when I can go 45 seconds and get about 100 kills sometimes and then other times go the full 90 and only get the same amount of kills.","June 1, 2015","true","3.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/recommended/357070/","muenzz","Love9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/muenzz/","322 products in account","UBERMOSH is a fun, but very little title. Basically it's a twin stick shooter with an arcade/arena style. You're nameless character (probably the woman in the title menu) gets send on a planet to wreck every single thing that comes to you. And they all come with guns. Story doesn't really exist in this game, goal is to survive as long as possible (a round, which lasts 90 seconds) while at the same time killing as much enemies as possible.  There are 3 options to kill enemies:\n\n1, Shoot them\n2, Cut them up with your sword\n3, Deflect their bullets back with your sword\n\nAs for number 1, there are a total of four guns in the game, 3 weapons that kinda get the job done and the 6 Shot Lasergun, that is so good that your character won't pick up any other weapon.\n\nAs for number 2, this option isn't really that recommended, as enemies usually only fire when very very close usually and this ends up losing one Respawn point, which are basically Health Points, or "Tries" in this case.\n\nNumber 3 is very interesting and can make the game pretty tricky, as you can combine Shooting enemies and deflecting bullets at the same time.\n\nThese 3 methods are part of the game and it's game modifications, which there are 4 of. You have the normal mode, a sword only mode which tests your skill in parrying Bullets, a Autofire gun mode that takes away your sword und reduces your Health points and a mode that starts you with the best weapon but you get the least amount of Health possible.\nFor each Mod you get a Medal in the main title screen if you manage to kill 150 enemies in time.\n\nI really liked the inclusion of these mods, as they do keep the game interesting, especially the Sword only Mod was pretty difficult at parts and it took me many retrys to finally rack up 150 kills in it.\n\nBecause this game is difficult. And you will die. Alot. Taking things like a constant shaking camera everytime you fire (which is pretty annoying after a while) and a sometimes frustrating camera (meaning you can not always see the enemies coming, causing you to run into them alot of times) aside, these guys come in masses. If you are not skilled with your sword and parrying, good luck dodging those bullets. On the Hard Boiled Option (changeable in the main menu right from the get go) you can also make more enemies spawn at once, which can make things even more tricky to handle.\n\nThe graphics are nice for what they are, i personally disliked that the maps are all basically the same design, a moon desert, where each time just the layout changes. A bit of variety in design would have been pretty cool for this game. Same goes for the music. Every stage has a different song, but that doesn't mean much when every song sounds basically the same. The lack of  guns and good use of them was also a bit sad to see.\n\nOverall i would say this game is ok. For a price of 4-5 bucks it is way too short and lacks the depth, length and variety that makes it truly stand out or interesting for a long while. If you got all the achievements you have basically seen everything the game has to offer really. If it is in sale though and you want a short, but nice little game, go ahead and purchase this.","September 18, 2015","true","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You should get it\n(it still needs lots of work, but its fun)\n\nLong review:\nLike i said, its really fun and fast, it actually makes you want to start over and over as soon as you die.\n\nIll start by saying:\nI know its in development, and thats the reason im going to express mi opinion of what could make this fun game an even greater game.\n\n- Problem when dying:\nSomething i found a bit annoying (its not  a big deal, but it bothers me a bit) everytime you die it immediately throws you to a screen saying you died then main screen. And also, sometimes you dont even know what kills you, you simply die  (even when you thought no one was around)\n\n- Probable Solution:\nAdd a screen in game when you die with the basic "Retry - Quit" Options.\nand maybe add a "Killed by _____" in that same screen.\n\n- More Game Modes:\n- Time Survival with 3 lives, killing an elite or boss (you will see what im talking about below) get extra time bonus, or a extra life, everytime you die you get -15 sec or something like that.\nA Game mode that will allow you to use the perks and abilities (see at the end of the review)\n\n- Problem Variety of enemies:\nits cool killing enemies over and over again, but since its a really fast paced game where enemies die in 1 shot (no matter which weapon you have, i will talk about this later) you start seeing the same enemies over and over again.\n\n- Solution:\nIm pretty sure this will be done, which is adding more kinds and types of enemies, but id be cool to see Elite enemies, maybe bosses? (which can handle way more than just 1 hit from any kind of weapon)\n\n- Problem Weapons:\nSame as enemies, nice weapons, specially the sword and the blaster that shoots purple thingys (which is op)\nI think you should have a reason to why pick up any other weapon, other than the purple blaster, since enemies die from 1 shot and that thing has an amazing spread just spam it = Win (i was able to survive and get SSS rank by sitting in a corner spamming that gun. Since there is no reason to why pick up a slow 1 bullet per shot gun"\n\n- Probable solution: Balancing weapons.\n*Rifle/Magnum - slow, 1 bullet per shot = Big Damage\n*Shotgun - decent spread, big damage BUT short range\n*Automatic rifle - lots of fire rate, very low spread, mid damage.\nAnd so on, you get the idea.\n\n-Problem Maps:\nSame, im pretty sure they will add more maps, but i think they should add more esthetic stuff to the maps, at the moment theres only 1 map and in only has these boring Tetris shaped walls and nothing more.\n\n- Probable Solution:\nWhen adding new maps or in the existing map, maybe add a few simple things to make it look better (depending on where the map is located at) adding stuff like wrecked cars, barrels, wrecked spaceships, stuff like that.\nMaybe we can have a map located inside a spaceship?, that would be AWESOME!\n\nOther Suggestions:\nBonus points -\nAdding  Multi-Kill bonus.\nX2 Points - maybe enemies drop the X2 bonus or if you keep killing enemies without stopping for like 2-3 seconds it keeps adding up?\n\nAbilites or Perks:\nGranade: After killing X number of enemies you will be able to throw a granade that wipes the screen\nShield: Grants you immunity to only 1 hit, slow recharged time. Killing an elite or a boss reduces the cooldown\nMelee: Grants you more melee range, after a multi-kill everytime you swing your sword it will throw a wave killing everything on the path.\n\nThose are some idea that i can think of that i personally think could be fun.","May 31, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/txcforever/recommended/357070/","txcforever","TxCForever","http://steamcommunity.com/id/txcforever/","764 products in account","I really really want to like this game but it still needs work in my opinion. First of all, the good part: The music is great, the art work is decent, the action is fast and fluid and the combo of energy weapons and swords that can deflect projectiles is a  pretty nifty concept (that we've seen before mostly in bullet hell shmups).\n\nBut there is one major issue that really needs to be addressed. The enemy spawning system is too unpredictable and random. There were times that enemies spawned right inside or just outside my field of view shooting me without giving me any chance of deflecting their shots or shooting them down. This plus the weird camera movement and placement (a bit too close at times) makes dodging attacks at times unnecessarily hard. I don't mind a challenge but making the game harder simply by having the enemies spawn completely random and with out restrictions is just cheap and lazy.\n\nStill, when the game works as it should it's damn good fun. Your weapons feel and sound powerful and killing enemies with them is extremely satisfying almost as much as killing them by deflecting their own bullets. Action is fast paced and fluid, rounds are short and sweet.\n\nWould I recommend the game to anyone? I'm not really sure to be honest. The price is pretty low, but on the other hand as it is, there's basicaly only one game mode and not much variety. Also the issue with the enemy placement is quite annoying at times. Keep it on your radar for a future purchase. The developers keep patching it consantly, so any possible issues with Ubermosh will be probably ironed out before long.","December 3, 2015","false","0.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/recommended/357070/","apochweiss","ApochsDotNet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apochweiss/","1843 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW originally posted at Apoch's Metal Review[www.apochs.net].\n\nWalter Machado, developer of last year's PC Action title Gearcrack Arena, returns with a brand new venture simply titled Ubermosh. While the follow-up release isn't quite done, Walter has gone ahead and made it available through Steam as an "Early Access" purchase at a nice budgetary cost of two dollars US (cheaper if you picked it up on sale around the time of launch). But, what exactly is it, and, even at this point in development, is it anything worth keeping an eye on?\n\nUbermosh is being described as "a shot of adrenaline", offering an experience similar to that of "a pinball table or a coin arcade machine" according to the game's "about" section. In its current state, you play as an unnamed protagonist in a Cyber Punk world with growing hordes of opponents you need to defeat in order to survive the imposed time limit. It's kind of like the atmosphere of a Shadowrun title laced with the core principles of Robotron 2084. The only difference is that, as time goes on, it seems to escalate into a Bullet Hell style offering sans the SHMUP style of gameplay.\n\nWhile it would work nicely as a twin stick shooter, this is more a keyboard and mouse operation on par with Alien Breed or Shadowgrounds, but in a tightly confined space. The keys allow you to race around the field, while the mouse moves the targeting reticle and acts as your mode of attack. The main goal is to deflect bullets from your foes in order to survive, not to mention acquire their ranged weaponry. Of course, if you're like me, you'll probably get more enjoyment out of slicing your opponents in half with your sword than shooting long distance with the various guns that become available.\n\nThe problem right now with this idea is that, when you fire so much as a single shot, you automatically pick up any new weapon you run over, changing the firing method. So, say you have a spread shot of some sort, and you prefer it or just have gotten accustomed to it this time around. If you run over another weapon, you might acquire a thin laser shot or bulky bullets instead, which changes the whole dynamic of your ranged attacks. A lot of this seems to depend on the enemy you kill as well, so avoiding their aptly color coded guns for the sake of sticking with the one you prefer can be a little more tedious when it comes to that shot of adrenaline you're looking for.\n\nRecently there was an update that added in a level boss. This enemy, when defeated, would drop a special gun that will never replace any others scattered about the battle field. It's a nice little perk that seems to have longer range and take out more foes grouped together compared to the single bullet deaths of these one-hit-kill enemies. Sadly, there's no major indicator of who the level boss is unless you know all the standard minions, which isn't too hard after a while since there seems to only be a handful of various character designs at the moment. The first time I even knew I had killed the boss was because I had a gun that acted differently compared to the others, not to mention could not be replaced by walking over any others. It would be nice to have some sort of indicator so that gamers know where that objective is within the swarm of enemies rushing you. It doesn't need to point off screen either, maybe just a little downwar arrow above its head when it comes into frame.\n\nThe amount of terrain also seems fairly limited right now, only keeping with rather flat color palettes within the randomly generated outdoors world. Hopefully in future builds we'll see levels inside or designs that better reflect the Cyber Punk universe this world is meant to take place in, but, for now, those flat, earthy tones clash with the brighter colors of enemies to help you discern foes to an extent. Regardless of how observant you are, you're still going to miss one or two wandered into frame or appeared out of nowhere.\n\nFinally there's the mixture of Industrial and Metal instrumentals that make up the soundtrack. The sound effects are decent for the eight-bit style Arcade graphics on display, and the faster speed and pacing of the horde growth are both well done to play up the adrenaline side of things. It's all just complimented by static, tribal drum rhythms, or a harsher, grittier battle soundtrack that many developers nowadays would have no problem slapping Alternative Rock songs onto to cater to a wider audience. It seems as though Walter is aware of just who will be playing this title and is focusing on making those individuals happy, something I thank him greatly for.\n\nSo, as it stands, this is a quick game of randomly generated terrain you need to run around in and destroy enemies by deflecting bullets or cutting them in half with your sword, only to pick up their guns and start blasting around, all within a very limited amount of time. For as basic a core concept as that is, Ubermosh is an incredibly fun little top down Action game that challenges you to beat your previous score with each new round. The title screen displays your top kill amount up to this point (though the last update reset that for me, so future ones may do the same), allowing for instant bragging rights among friends, or a challenge if one happens to surpass it while playing under your name. There's also an option for extras, but there's none available at this time, so there's that to either look forward to, or dread. Hopefully it's just for small things like community downloadable content alterations or simple gimmicks like options to make everyone have clown heads or silly things like that.\n\nUbermosh isn't the most expansive at the moment either, and there's clearly more to come from the roughly year long development the early access outline points out. Hopefully those future additions or alterations won't nerf the challenge or destroy the established classic arcade style game play that makes this idea as a whole work. There are many comparisons to the game Nuclear Throne as well, which I can't really comment on as I haven't played it yet. They do look similar, but that's all based on the few trailers I've seen. But, in the end, if you happen to have a couple dollars on your Steam account and want something you can kill five or ten minutes with, Ubermosh is definitely well worth it at this point in time. You probably won't run marathon gaming sessions, but as a casual pick-up-and-play offering, it's an intense little ride you won't soon regret.\n\nOverall Score: 9/10","April 14, 2015","true","0.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That full game could be awesome, but this is just 90-second snips of a trash arena. Lacking in graphics and variety, the solid combat isn't enough to justify multiple dollars and barely hours of gameplay.\n\nStory time: I picked up UBERMOSH early in development, mostly because I was one of many that got Gearcrack Arena for around $0.09 USD with a coupon. It was weird, confusing, obtuse, and somehow deeper than UBERMOSH. Reaching level 3 in Gearcrack Arena was quite a feat, mostly because the controls were so confusing. The music was great at least, and worthwhile for nine cents, so I jumped on UBERMOSH with the hopes that Walter Machado would improve. The core gameplay was improved and actually worked really well. However, UBERMOSH still has the content variety of a tech demo, and feels like a test for something bigger.\n\nThere are a few issues at play that are forcing me to restrict my recommendation. Firstly, the Gearcrack Arena game I mentioned is no longer on Steam. It turns out that Walter Machado stated somewhere that Gearcrack Arena was only a year-long experiment (for sale), and after that year, he removed the game completely. There's no store page to confirm if this was stated to customers, and I don't recall any notice of the game having time-limited availability. Owners can still download the game, but bugs and issues will never be fixed. I can't confirm the dates, but it seems like the game disappeared after Steam Refunds were enabled. Walter Machado doesn't seem like a bad developer, but I have to worry. There's no real reason to remove the game, other than not bothering to fix it. If it was intended to be a temporary trial, release it for free.\n\nIgnoring concerns of shady behavior, UBERMOSH is just too shallow. Arena generation is hard to notice, as the environment is just a big square with random blocks of brown walls. Enemies and guns are varied but feel the same. Class mods are just challenges imposed for a specific playstyle. The hitboxes feel very large, reflecting bullets 10 feet from your sword and getting hit from 3 feet away. After a few 90-second rounds, you've seen everything.\n\nUBERMOSH can be fun for a bit, and has great potential. The shooting and swordplay feels great, but it needs a full game behind it. I was eagerly watching patch notes, and immensely disappointed to see the game go from version 0.014 or so to "Final" by adding cards. It's an alpha still. Walter Machado's games have charmed me, and I want them to be great. But this isn't finished, final, or even worth a few dollars currently. Although he may suddenly remove the game when he starts the next one, I really can't recommend UBERMOSH until it has more than 90 seconds of neon on brown.","August 18, 2015","false","2.6"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","0"

The more I played this game the more it was obvious to me : a larger field of view (or the possibility to zoom in and out depending of preferences) would make this game much better, it's so damn obvious, go figure why it never crossed the dev's mind for all that time he has been working on this game.\n\nSome other cons :\n- Can't disable screen shake.\n- Can't disable controller vibrations.\n- The pixel art is made of huge ♥♥♥ pixels that look dirty (in a bad way) if you have a "high" resolution (mine is just 1920*1080) and the game can only be played in full screen.\n- Can't refund game, smd Steam.\n\nThe pros :\n- Music.\n- Sort of playable, but probably not for too long.\n\nAnd lol at the people who give thumbs down to negative reviews made for this game because "WHY DON'T YOU LIKE WHAT I LIKE ?

UBERMOSH is already leaps and bounds better than GEARCRACK (I say with an attempt at a sympathetic-to-the-consensus viewpoint), though I’m hoping that one of the new game modes planned for UBERMOSH will be reminiscent of GEARCRACK in having little to nothing explained (which was a throwback to games from the ‘90’s (a la System Shock 2, perhaps)).\n\nThe only legitimate criticism of GEARCRACK was that nothing was explained; go to the forums to discover that a lot of variables are determined by RNG. So people concluded that the (")hardcore(") aspects of the game were simply (")unfair(").\nI thought that was half the fun of GEARCRACK – I feel those who complained forgot just how much they paid for the game (not to suggest that price absolves a game of criticism, as Walter knows).\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/301480/discussions/0/616189742994052573/\n\nUBERMOSH plays much like GEARCRACK but in a much more refined and simplistic manner. There are (at this time) really no discernible nuances. You run around an arena with hordes of enemies pursuing you. You can deflect enemy fire; you can directly melee the enemies; you can pick up their weapons.\nGEARCRACK had enemies with shields that required you use certain implicit tactics to destroy them; limited ammunition; an incredibly short time-limit that assaulted you along with unbelievable barrages from the enemies as soon as you took an action.\n\nI've little doubt that UBERMOSH will have more complex features added later - it will not be nothing but a "serviceable diversion," as I called GEARCRACK - but, to be sure, (it seems) that is Walter's goal.\nPeople can complain about GEARCRACK and it's possible that the basis for those qualms won't necessarily be baseless.\nThe only complaint (thus far) that can be recorded of UBERMOSH (besides just how early of a version the game is in (clicking on "Extras" (where I would assume some sort of Options would be) does nothing but remind you "Non-final version")) is that "there's nothing to it."\nThis is a simple arcade game. Your goal is to beat your previous scores. The action is incredibly hectic and very fun. As it is, it isn’t necessary to have a levelling system, a customizable arsenal, a level select feature, etc.; the basic gameplay is such that progression driven by the self is enough to ensure fun (not to suggest "Good game Walter, we're content, you can be done with updates," lol). Any score you've previously achieved is wiped upon exiting the game; there's always room for you to get better at the game.\n\n\n...I actually regret buying this game while it is discounted. I just saw it and immediately bought it because I have hope that Walter Machado will continue to be a great indie developer and that he’ll achieve success.\nWalter is worthy of your support; the flak that GEARCRACK received is not applicable to UBERMOSH (and I contest that, though the criticism of the former wasn’t undue, GEARCRACK did not deserve the amount of criticism it received – those “Mixed” user reviews).\n\nI recommend this (and Walter’s previous) game.\n\nDISCLOSURE: I posted a screenshot of UBERMOSH on my profile. I like to show discounted games however I can on there - my Game Collector showcase was full - took a screenshot of my score just to have UBERMOSH shown on my page.\nThat screenshot has had 1 upvote; my review has No ratings yet.\nWalter Machado sent me a friend request. I have to assume it was... because of my screenshot? Or perhaps he has read my review and, in the interest of integrity, just did not vote either way on it.\nSay all that to say: I wrote this review (as with all my reviews) according to my own opinion - it was not endorsed in any way by Walter.","March 30, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","2"

This is not a deep or lengthy game.  Ubermosh is excessively simple, more a tech demo than a game and not a particularly impressive one at that as the 20 seconds of gameplay in the trailer covers the whole breadth and depth that the game has to offer.\n\nUbermosh is a top down shoot em up in the vein of Smash TV or Crimsonland.  You run around a fairly barebones arena shooting and/or stabbing a small assortment of guys and monsters, get hit a few times, die, repeat.  And that's it.  There's no unlocks, no story, no levels.  Just shoot, die, repeat until bored.\n\nUbermosh plays well enough,  The controls are okay on mouse and keyboards.  WASD moves, left click fires a gun, right click swings the sword.  Escape quits back to the menu, no confirmation, no pause menu.  The guns have some punchy sound effects but there's fairly little report of successful hits and nothing when you get hit - which can be very frustrating indeed.\n\nThe screen has a tendency to shake when firing a gun which, when combined with the very close camera, is annoying and disoreinting in the thick of combat\n\nThe game lacks an options menu completely so the the repetitive music is overpoweringly loud and the only recourse is to lower the game's volume in windows.  The only options in the game are whether to play on normal or hardboiled (hard mode) and which, if any, class mod you wish to use.\n\nClass mods add a minimum of variety by limiting what weapons you can use and how many 'respawns' you get (they're not actual respawns, but merely the number of times you can get hit before dying) but the Kensai is the only one that vastly varies the game flow as it removes your ability to use guns, which makes things significantly more difficult.  Reflecting enemy attacks with a sword swing is your only ranged ability and letting them get in close is dangerous, so you'll die a lot to enemies firing so close to you that they're impossible for all but the twitchiest of fingers to reflect.\n\nThe rest of the classes consist of getting the best scattergun you can find (there's a total of five-ish ranged weapons in the game), finding a relatively defensible spot, and clicking in every direction to kill enemies before they got on the screen.   You could, I guess only shoot at enemies you can see and stay mobile, but there's little point when the kills just get racked up.  Though the inability to rebind the controls hurts the Kensai class mod, mashing right click is surprisingly less fun than mashing left click.\n\nAt any rate, at the end you are either extracted or die.  The game over screen, such that is is, is very simple and incredibly abrupt.  It is often quite difficult to discern what exactly killed you because one moment you're dodging, shooting, and stabbing and the rest you're staring at a mostly black screen telling you you're out of respawns.  There are no death animations, not even a death sound.  Immediate cut to black and then back to the main menu.\n\nUbermosh describes itself as 'Cyberpunk,' or at least a lot of people think that it is.  But there's no real cyberpunk to it.  The main menu aesthetic fits the bill, but everything else exudes a more post-apocalyptic vibe.  Were I cynical I'd say that the cyberpunkish window dressing may have been chasing a fad.\n\nAt the end of the day, or more accurately the hour Ubermosh takes to lose its charm, you're left with a simple shooter that pales in comparison to dozens of other similar titles on steam and the tremendous praise it is receiving is mind boggling.  Don't waste your money, save up for Crimsonland or Nation Red instead.","November 28, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Worth the 2 dollars... the only things I hope to change or be adjusted....\n\n- Less screen shaking for being hit or shooting the weapons. As much as I love it, it gets a lil confusing when you're hit and trying to tell the difference for when you're shooting.\n\n- Better idea of your hitbox, I feel like at times I'm waiting too long for the bullet to come to me and the moment I think I can deflect it back I'm already hit. Maybe it's something I need to get used to but I feel as though it's hard to tell at times.\n\n- Kinda with the first point, better sign that shows you've been hit. Maybe a red flash to indicate you've been hit or something. It's rlly difficult to keep your eye on 4 lil triangles in the top right of the screen.\n\n- Game over screen... I know this game is meant to get high scores but the instant you die is like "THAT'S IT" and you have no idea how you died or what killed you in that instant. Not to mention winning = the same looking screen.\n\n- I'd love more modes or longer times to last. If anything, I loved this game's combat being so simple yet so addictive. The problem with that was the time limit and only mode that just brings you short time limits to get a high score. I'd love to see a story mode or something you can explore and kill stuff around with. A mode where you're not just fighting to survive and get a high score but a mode that let's the player slaughter for hours on end.\n\n- Multiplayer.... I'd LOVE a co-op mode, or even a 1v1 style match. Again this game has alot of potential and I don't see why it couldn't work whether it's a competition to get higher score or to kill each other.\n\n\nOverall I recommend trying this game out but just remember this isn't the final stage of this game. It's good but it can be alot better. Hopefully with everyone's support and investing into the early access it can be alot better.","May 26, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This makes it ideal for killing a little time.\n- Simple controls. Move with W,A,S and D, shoot with your left-click and melee with your right-click. It is configured for gamepads as well but I personally haven't felt the need to try.\n- Different character configurations grant some replayability.\n- Weapon effects are colorful and feel like they would indeed vaporize your foes.\n\nCons\n- The game suffers from some artificial difficulty. Enemies may spawn right on top of you and fire before you can react.\n- The screen-shaking effect caused by firing weapons or taking a hit. I get what the developer was going for, and I do appreciate that, but it becomes a hinderance when you start taking hits because your eyes can't keep up with the frantic action coupled with the shaking screen.\n- The camera can be your worst enemy. It follows your reticle a bit, but that makes it easy for enemies to move in behind you while you're trying to get a shot in the other direction. I also feel that there is never enough of a view at the bottom of the screen, and find myself firing blindly when moving in that direction so that I'm less likely to get surprised. That takes away the feeling that I'm skillfully fending off waves of enemies and leaves me feeling like I'm just spraying and praying.\n- The arenas don't really have any sense of variance. Flat ground with random squarish blocks for cover. At least a few different textures for visual appeal would be nice, but generally everything is brown on brown.\n- The weapons suffer from a lack of variety. It would be nice for them to handle differently so that each player could develop their own preference, but the fact is that there's no reason to not immediately try to grab the 'best gun' since it has a huge spread and is just as lethal as the rest.\n\nAll these things considered, I do enjoy the game and feel that it is worth buying, but maybe try to get it during a sale, when it's common to see it at 50% off, and may as well get the soundtrack while you're at it.","September 14, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/that3d/recommended/357070/","that3d","ThreeDee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/that3d/","121 products in account","By the time I was a kid arcades were becoming a thing of the past, if they weren't a thing of the past already. Growing up in the late 1990's meant that I was too young to experience the great communal arcade halls of legend so I had to seek shelter in every bowling alley, movie theater, and smoke filled restaurant closet in existence that held the remaining, publicly available, arcade games. As a small child, you had to risk life and limb, talking to the creepy middle aged guy behind the counter who's slightly balding, but still tries to work a mullet, so he can take you to a bizarre David Lynch inspired 'back room' with one Centipede cabinet underneath a lone flickering light bulb. Yes, I might have been scared for my life, but I'll be damned if I didn't spend hours behind that joystick, trying to beat the high score of every horny trucker, pot head and divorcee who bothered to play that machine. Fast forward to 2015 and I'm not entirely certain if those rooms exist any more, but if they did, Ubermosh would be an insanely popular hit.\n\nThe concept of this game is simple; the world has become so pure that the only form of entertainment people can gain is from violence. The players one goal is to fight their way out of a Hunger Games-like colosseum. This is as much story and canon that the developer, Walter Machado, gives you and I suppose that is all you really need.\n\nBefore I begin nitpicking the ins and outs of Ubermosh, let me make this incredibly clear, THIS IS A FUN GAME. The gameplay itself is condensed enough for anyone to understand and pick up and play in quick doses, just like a traditional arcade game. You get thrown into a top down bullet hell shooter with a sword that can reflect/cut through bullets and are forced to survive giant waves of bizarre enemies for about 90 seconds. This game sounds and looks like it was taken from the pages of a rejected John Carpenter screenplay from the 80's in the vein of Big Trouble In Little China, and the better it is for it. The weirder and more difficult Ubermosh gets, the more fun it is to play but this is where my biggest complaint comes to light; the game doesn't evolve much, if at all, from its initial concept.\n\nTo start with, the controls of this game are very tight. The response time is incredibly fast and there is just a touch of momentum added to the movement in order to make running feel weighted. That style of movement is very important to keep in mind when engaging in all sorts of combat because there is a small amount of delay when using your weapons in order to prevent spamming it. While some people might take issue with this, I thought it was a nice attempt to balance the combat with the multitude of guns you are bound to pick up through the course of your many playthroughs.\n\nAnd through using the multitude of guns that you pick off the dead carcasses of your enemies, you have to survive screens filled with aliens all trying to kill you. After I initially launched the game, it took me a solid 20 minutes of repeatedly banging my head into my keyboard before I could last 30 seconds if I was lucky. My perseverance ended up paying off for me because, in the end, my biggest run ended in a score of 169, and I'm still too proud of myself to reset my score in hardcore mode and loose what I worked so hard to achieve. While going on runs that end with beating your high score feels so fantastic, the more runs you go on, the purely skeletal structure of the game reveals itself.\n\nThis game could benefit from so much. For example, a larger selection of characters to choose from could add so much depth, adding a screen clearing ultimate ability for the one character you have could turn the tide of so many battles, and taking a minute to create load outs for each run you take can add a certain level of basic strategy, just to name a few. The reason I point these aspects out in particular is because I feel everything needed to add these mechanics is already in the game, but their absence makes the game feel disappointingly empty. Of course, the hope is that additional layers will be added in future updates, as long as Walter Machado continues to support his solid game, but there hasn't been any updates of note made at the time of this review.\n\nFor the purpose of covering all bases here, I do have to make a remark on the graphics. If I haven't hinted at it already, this game looks like the love child of the cover from REO Speedwagon's Hi-Infedelity and Joss Whedon's Serenity. The actual gameplay is built in your typical “Insert Number Here-Bit” style of almost every indie game out there today, but the menu art and character portrait are very well done with a lot of bright colors thrown all over the place. If this game existed in an arcade cabinet form, it would belong in the corner next to the bathroom of a seedy underground night club with flashy strobe lights where everyone wears neon glow sticks and does cocaine, or a laser tag arena. In a stylistic sense, Ubermosh achieves what it is trying to pull off, and pulls it off well.\n\nSo, without any further ado...\n\n(T)oo (L)ong; (D)idn't (R)ead : While built on a rock hard foundation of solid mechanics and masochistically addictive game-play, Ubermosh offers little more than its neon drenched looks.","September 15, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of good to be said about this game, but as it stands I'm torn on whether or not its qualities outweigh the fact that there's not an awful lot to say about it; the content simply isn't there (yet).\n\nThat being said, the foundation sure as hell is there, and I'm definitely keeping my eye on this one as it reaches further stages of development.

It's a pick up and play game that you don't need to get heavily invested in. Just start it up, start slashing, and when you inevitably die or run out of time you can do it all over again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lazermon/recommended/357070/","lazermon","lazer-3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lazermon/","236 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n> This is an Early Access review. This review was written during version 0,011. <\n\nThere will obviously be spoilers about the game has to offer in its current state but since it has no story-mode, and it is questionable if it ever will have one.\n\nIt has what you'd expect: a game, some gameplay, and room for content and improvement.\n\nThe developer (I assume there's only one since there is only one name in the field), Walter Machado, is pretty vague in his Early Access description as to how long the game will be in development, but he states: "The game will stay in Early Access until we have a final polished version of it /---/ Probably a year of polishing." so one can draw the conclusion that it will very likely not be finished until some time during, or after 2016.\n\nGameplay\nThe Basics: UBERMOSH is a fast-paced, top-down, arcade, cyberpunk arena-style sort of game game that, according to the developer, "UBERMOSH is an arcade game made to give you a shot of adrenaline in a couple of minutes, like a pinball table or a coin arcade machine." and I can personally say that UBERMOSH lives up to that promise, at least well enough considering that it is in Early Access and that many things are bound to be added.\nAll enemies are one-hit-kill, while you start with a few lives, a.k.a. "respawns", and no way of re-gaining them mid-game, so after getting hit four times it's game over.\n\nVariety: UBERMOSH has at least some variation in enemies and weaponry, but in almost all aspects (including weaponry- and enemywise), it seriously needs work. There are only four-or-so different types of enemies, about as many different types of slightly different weapons as well as your melee lazer-katana which you use to cut both your enemies and their bullets in half, only two game-modes where the second is a more difficult version of the first, and only one scenario. The good thing is that the developer, according to his comments in the Early Access description, is planning to add more of most of these things: "A more polished challenge, new enemies, more cyberpunk music, scenario features and alternative game modes.”\nFor example, it would be nice to see a specific Endless Mode, and I would also personally like it if it went slightly into roguelite territory with larger maps and procedurally unlockable scenarios, weapons, and maybe even unlockable different characters which different play-styles, and achievements wouldn't hurt.\n\nDifficulty: It's not particularly hard to complete - after just above half an hour I completed both of the currently existing gamemodes and earned, at my highscore, the SSS-rank in both cases, which for the record is not the highest possible rank. But completing it is only half the fun: as with most arcade-inspired games, the replay-value lies in trying to beat your highscore.\n\nEnjoyability: The game is in of itself not a bad game, as it was pretty enjoyable to me personally, and I think that it would appeal to most people who enjoy fast-paced arcade games, as long as you don't have something against the strong sci-fi theme. I can clearly see that the end result potentially could be a very good game.\n\nGraphicsBeing interesting at best, and weak at worst, the graphics are not its strongest point. However, in the theme of being a slightly pixelated, Cyberpunk type of arena on an alien-looking planet killing monsters and painting the ground in a variety of different colours of blood with lazer- and plasma rifles, it's not exactly graphically out of place. If you look at what it's trying to achieve in its presentation, graphically, I have to say that it looks pretty nice.\nThe UI is also not too shabby. It fits the theme and looks alright, but needs some work.\n\nAudioThe soundtrack generally consists of high quality electronic/punk music and is generally not only very enjoyable, but also fits with the gameplay, and additionally can be purchased separately as a DLC.\nThe sounds, including weapon noises etc., are not exceptionally good but are of generally high quality.\n\nPerformanceUnsurprisingly for its early development state, runs smoothly. I personally experienced no problems with the performance, and I haven't noticed too many bugs either.\n\nProblemsThis game is in Early Access for a reason, and that reason becomes very apparent as soon as you start up the game the first time.\n\nFirst off, it has no options menu. This means that there is absolutely no adjusting any sound levels, no manually changing the resolution or any other graphical settings, no adjusting the mouse sensitivity, or anything else. This should, according to me, be one of the top priorities for the developer but I cannot speak in his place on that matter, I will assume that it will be added at some point since not doing so woulf be a very bad move towards its customers.\n\nI also have a second, more specific, problem with this game, which may be related to the forced resolutions, is that the viewable size of the map is very small and as it moves slightly after the cursor, it really damages your peripheral vision and I'm not even sure how many times I have unexpectedly died because an enemy I couldn't see shot me. This would normally not be a problem, especially since games like for example Hotline Miami does something similar if you hold down the Space key (I believe it is), but here, the enemies can spawn from any direction and limiting your view can be utterly fatal, especially if you move around a lot which, let's face it, you should be in arena-type games.\n\nSummary\nUBERMOSH, a cyberpunk arcade arena game in Early Access.\n\nAspect        Rating        Comments                Gameplay        6/10        Enjoyable, but lacking                Graphics        7/10        Good at what it attempts to do.                Audio        8/10        Excellent, and fits well with the rest of the game.                Performance        9/10        Performance is not at all a problem.                Problems        5/10        Being in Early Access, it lacks important features.                Overall        7/10        Good, but lacking, which is expectable from Early Access.","June 7, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fast-paced nonstop hardcore-action, that gives you not a single moment, to breath or camp!\nThe game plays from a Topdown-perspective, where you play that hot, cool Cyber-Chick (that was the main reason, why I bought this) that shoots and slices in a 360 degree to survive the titular UBERMOSH-pit. For this, you can use guns, and you have a kinda cyber-sword, not only to cut enemies in half, no, more important, to "volley" back the projectiles, fliyng everywhere around, sometimes, It is almost like in those japanese DANMAKU (bullethell) games - we all love.\n\nEven if the game uses the hot Cyber-Chick only exploitative, also using the "cyberpunk"-thematics for the same reason - but in the end, it also could be any generic world etc, also, the chick is only here - as kinda an eye-candy, and even if it has not much of levels, no real story - just a vague idea of it, no replay value, I strongly recommend it, for those, who like a challenge. A very cool soundtrack, some few "mods" of the always same, repetitive, but still addiciting gameplay makes this a real hardcore-challenge for the perseveranced player. Even if you die a lot, you always came back - for a short stay in the cyber mosh-pit. If just that annyoing Gamepad-Vibration had an option to turn it "off".","December 14, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked it up on a whim because I got a coupon out of a card combination pack. It's not a game for people like me, who enjoy slow paced and casual games, but it is an absolutely great game that I can totally recommend. It's like a poor man's version of Nuclear Throne with less weapon options and less enemy variety, but it's twice as fast and feels just as solid.\n\nThis game has polish for how simple it is. It's a pick up and play game that you don't need to get heavily invested in. Just start it up, start slashing, and when you inevitably die or run out of time you can do it all over again. It's a tried and true formula that looks like old school but plays smoothly. If you have great reflexes and enjoy a challenging "score one-up-manship" game then give this a try.","May 23, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worth the 2 dollars... the only things I hope to change or be adjusted....\n\n- Less screen shaking for being hit or shooting the weapons. As much as I love it, it gets a lil confusing when you're hit and trying to tell the difference for when you're shooting.\n\n- Better idea of your hitbox, I feel like at times I'm waiting too long for the bullet to come to me and the moment I think I can deflect it back I'm already hit. Maybe it's something I need to get used to but I feel as though it's hard to tell at times.\n\n- Kinda with the first point, better sign that shows you've been hit. Maybe a red flash to indicate you've been hit or something. It's rlly difficult to keep your eye on 4 lil triangles in the top right of the screen.\n\n- Game over screen... I know this game is meant to get high scores but the instant you die is like "THAT'S IT" and you have no idea how you died or what killed you in that instant. Not to mention winning = the same looking screen.\n\n- I'd love more modes or longer times to last. If anything, I loved this game's combat being so simple yet so addictive. The problem with that was the time limit and only mode that just brings you short time limits to get a high score. I'd love to see a story mode or something you can explore and kill stuff around with. A mode where you're not just fighting to survive and get a high score but a mode that let's the player slaughter for hours on end.\n\n- Multiplayer.... I'd LOVE a co-op mode, or even a 1v1 style match. Again this game has alot of potential and I don't see why it couldn't work whether it's a competition to get higher score or to kill each other.\n\n\nOverall I recommend trying this game out but just remember this isn't the final stage of this game. It's good but it can be alot better. Hopefully with everyone's support and investing into the early access it can be alot better.","May 26, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As far as I can tell there is no unlockable content or any variety beside shallow classes .\n\nYou can switch between couple loudouts which have different hitpoints and weapons but there are no skins . I liked simple gameplay and pixel art but could classes at least have different colors ? Maybe change background ? Some stages ?\n\nMy main problem is that this game does not have modes to support High-Score gameplay . You actually have a freaking timer that prevents you from playing as long as you can .\n\nDecent game for Under $1 but what a missed opportunity .","May 14","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
