"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tournamentrules/recommended/239140/","tournamentrules","tournamentrules","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tournamentrules/","204 products in account","Glad to see the misinformed reviews have been thrown out of from the top page. For those who have said that Dying Light's day/night mechanic is not what they thought and that time doesn't actually change in the game clearly haven't played past the intro missions. The first two missions are obviously there to get you started, so they're not going to thrust a timed day/night cycle before you get the hang of the environment and the mechanics, and thus in the intro missions, time does not change if you don't progress the quest. Past those two missions, day/night becomes very real, and incredibly terrifying. /endRant\n\n\nGameplay:\nI'm sure it's been said before, but this is what Dead Island should have been. Everything from the parkour to the combat just feels incredibly fluid. Running around is great fun, and jumping into abandoned houses and exploring/finding loot is constantly fun. And this is where I got caught in my first night phase. I was running towards my objective when "oh look another shelter, let me go secure it," then "oh look there's an air drop nearby, let me go grab it," then again another shelter nearby, on top of random houses and zombies (sorry, "biters") to loot, and before I knew it, I got my last radio call telling me I should get to a shelter quick (mind you, the Tower warns runners a few times before nightfall to get home, but I just have to keep scrounging for loot). I checked my map and realized I was pretty damn far from the closest shelter, so I just booked it. This is where freerunning gets exciting. With how seemless and smooth it is to run around/through buildings and across rooftops, the run to my shelter didn't feel annoying or like a chore, but more like a challenge to find the smoothest route (very similar to Mirror's Edge). Long story short, night fell, I ♥♥♥♥ my pants and crouched my way from rooftop to rooftop, listening to the horrifying screams of the nighttime biters as I eased my way into my little shelter. I've since tried to go out at night and see if I can tackle a nighttime bonus objective of a quest, and I can tell you, as of right now, I am definitely not prepared... but I'm damn excited to finally face the challenge.\n\n+ Fluid, seemless parkour\n+ Combat is fun\n+ Enemy AI is surprisingly smart\n+ Terrifying and exciting night cycle\n+ Scavanging every nook and cranny for loot\n\nCharacters:\nSome characters are well-performed while others just aren't. Gazi's performance, in my opinion, is laughably bad, but I began to think that it may have been intentional? And Rahim... he must have played a lot of Jak and Daxter back in the day, all he needs to do is dye his hair yellow. Brecken, Jade and Lena are among my favorite so far, with Lena reminding me a lot of Cassandra from DA:Inquisition with her hair and accent. Overall, characters are decent, and that's all that really needs to be said, so far at least.\n\n+ Some interesting characters\n- Some poor performances\n\nTechnical:\nGraphics are gorgeous, and surprisingly undemanding even on my single GTX 970 with everything cranked to max and at 1920x1080. Though many report a huge framerate difference by changing the View Distance option, I can barely see much of a difference in-game with that option set to half or max. The only issue I've noticed is that very very rarely, when you're fighting biters with melee weapons, the game randomly hitches, then continues normally. It only happens in combat, but not often enough to be annoying and that might just be my system. Overall, everything looks great, and the graphics and effects are wonderful. For an ugly game, the visuals are surprisingly beautiful.\n\nSound:\nMusic is great, but my only comment is that the music that plays when you're outside has one part where a random singer begins to chant, and I swear it scares the crap out of me every time. Bashing biters with blunt weapons sounds very satisfying, and you can tell when you've hit the right spot, while hitting the chest is usually a muffled thump. I've yet to get a gun though (I've spent a lot of time just wandering around so I'm not too far into the campaign) so I can't comment on that. Also, make a little bit more noise and you'll hear bone-chilling screams in the distance of the more agile biters coming to get you. Very satisfying sound work overall.\n\nStory:\nI haven't gotten far into the story so I'll hold off until I've completed it to fill this section.\n\nI basically wanted to come out and say how much I'm enjoying this game and to tell people to ignore the false statements about this game and give it a try. If you liked Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you hated Dead Island, you'll like this game. If you're a fan of first person, open-world games, then I'd bet you'll like this game.","January 28, 2015","true","76.1"," 1,862 of 1,970 people (95%) found this review helpful 135 people found this review funny","95","862","1","135","48"

How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking "plenty of time" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to do, like this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* "sure I can do that, plenty of time still". Then only 5 minutes before night, I complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse. On the way I find a police van practically unguarded! Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies. After all it could be rifle ammo, or a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done looting, but oh ♥♥♥♥! it's almost 20:00, my watch is beeping, night is coming now! A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still it's too late, monsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back. Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am. Then glorious "pursuit evaded" message appears. Phew. I now pay attention to the search cones on the minimap and successfully sneaks back to the tower.","July 23, 2015","true","138.9"," 1,682 of 1,783 people (94%) found this review helpful 417 people found this review funny","94","682","1","417","43"

Sometimes I like just playing the game, so I can run\naround, across roof tops, and attacking zombies while talking to friends.\n\n- Co-op in story mode. Freaking amazing. No dumb lobby. Just click 'Join game' and bam,\nyou'll be thrown a few feet away from a friend without them sometimes even noticing you joined!\n\n- Single play and Co-op have a huge impact; co-op feels fun, slightly safer, and adds a lot in the form of friendly rivals! Single player feels way more tense and everything you do counts, making you second guess some choices, for fear or death. Night time in either mode is fun as heck, though four co-op makes it pretty easy.\n\n- Night and Day feel almost like two different modes. In the day, zombies shuffle around, falling off rooftops, being dumb, easy to avoid and kill. Night time? Get those UV Flares ready, and be ready to flee if they catch sight of you.\n\n- Even after beating the story, I keep coming back for more, as it's super fun.\n\n- Took me around 30 hours to do the story, which also included only HALF of the side missions. Still got a little over 50% left to go, and looking forward to it!\n\nTL;DR - Get the game, find friends to play with, enjoy the hell out of one of the few games worth it at full price.","February 9, 2015","true","48.7"," 1,048 of 1,114 people (94%) found this review helpful 71 people found this review funny","94","048","1","71","20"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tipster/recommended/239140/","tipster","Tipster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tipster/","466 products in account","Dying Light\nNote: Each field is weighted differently, and thus affects the overall score differently.\nField  Rating  Review    Graphics  9  A pretty game to look at for sure, though it suffers with some animations on the part of NPC humans, particularly when they are speaking. The environment is very well put together, and the general ambience of the game, especially at night, is fantastic.    Gameplay  10  I have never played a game that offered such satisfying zombie smashing. On top of that, you have a variety of ways to dispatch of the zombies.  The sound design is incredibly well done (save for the voice-acting, it is average at best), every smack of a weapon against a zombie is satisfying and has some weight behind it. Also notable is the parkour system in place in the game; It is extremely well executed, and gives an incredible sense of freedom to go where you want, and do what you want. The weapon system is reminiscent of Dead Island's, though gathering parts feels much more intuitive now. Missions feel varied enough that they don't come across as just "fetching" quests. They even serve to push you out of your comfort zone and into the dreaded night.    Story  7  A zombie game that calls zombies exactly that, for once. The story in Dying Light isn't anything spectacular, but it has enough interesting moments to keep you moving forward, wanting to know how things will turn out. Again though, this is a zombie game, so don't be expecting Shakespeare.    Multiplayer  9  Easily join up with four friends for some co-op fun which allows you to play the entire game together, main quests and all. Though frustrating at times that you must have EVERY player in the vicinity to start a mission, or even have dialogue with an NPC, the frustration is quickly forgotten as you get back to bashing zombie's heads in. Occasional co-op competitive events show up as you travel around the map, challenging you to beat your friends at killing the most zombies, finding the most loot, saving survivors, or racing to an objective. An absolutely hilarious blast of a game to play with your buddies.\n\nNote: I have not yet played "Be the Zombie" mode (5-players allowed, instead of just 4), so I will update this review when I have the chance to try it out.    Replayability  8  I thought that perhaps I would get tired of bashing zombie's skulls in, and jumping around the world. I have found myself to be pleasantly wrong in both regards. Dying Light executes these two mechanics so fantastically that I find myself constantly drawn to it, especially when friends are able to hop in-game with me. Though I can see the missions becoming burdensome and tiring after having done them a few times.    Overall  9.1/10  Of all the zombie games out there, Dying Light is number one on my recommended list. A well polished, extremely fun game by yourself, throw some friends into the mix and you have a winner. If you enjoy zombie games in the slightest, or even if you don't, give this game a whirl. Thanks to Dying Light, I find myself bummed out when I play other games that I cannot jump and climb so freely. You know something has been executed well when you find yourself wishing it was in every other game you played.\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","February 7, 2015","true","97.5"," 2,044 of 2,243 people (91%) found this review helpful 141 people found this review funny","91","044","2","141","63"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/239140/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","I've never been one for zombie games but this game changed my mind!  Below is a review of the single-player campaign (I don't play multiplayer so can't comment on these elements).  Hope it helps you. :)\n\nWhat is it?Dying Light is a superb open-world game (a mix of survival, first-person action and RPG) where the citizens of Harran (a fictional place in Turkey) are becoming infected with a rabies-related virus.  Your task (as protagonist Kyle Crane) is to locate research regarding a cure on behalf of the Global Relief Effort.  You join a garrisoned band of survivors in Harran and take on the role of one of their 'runners' (people who carry out the dangerous work of gathering supplies and carrying out other requests on behalf of survivors) as a guise while you try to infiltrate and locate a wanted man and some vital data.\n\nThe game's large, open-world environments are incredible - set in the slums of Harran and (later) Old Town - both locations offering a different style of parkour.  Your movement will be a mix of running, jumping, using a grapple hook or sliding down cables.  Oh, and the odd swim!  The parkour is fluid, easy and not over-fantasised (it is not beyond imagining that a fit and strong man could perform the moves the game offers).  The campaign itself is of good length and enjoyable, and there is a wealth of optional side missions and challenges to complete.\n\nThe game is divided into two scenarios: day and night.  By day, the infected and 'virals' roam the streets aimlessly (often in huge numbers) but don't present too much of a danger provided you keep to rooftops and higher areas.  At night though, everything becomes much more sinister!  Not only are the infected out in greater number, but a darker, almost indestructable breed of the infected comes out for the hunt.  They're stronger than you, faster than you, and would like dinner with you (you as the main course).  There is no other recourse but to stay indoors and sleep until daybreak, or dare to go out and use stealth and speed as best you can.  It's worth it because you'll get double experience points, but you might not last too long.  You have been warned!\n\nWeapons and upgradesThe game uses three large sets of upgrade paths for Crane: survivor, agility and power. You'll earn upgrades by gathering experience points in each of these three areas.  The weapon system is wonderful.  At first, you have nothing but bits of wood, table legs, the odd wrench here and there - with which to pummel the infected until they die.  But as your survivor experience points ramp up, so does the quality and power of  the available weapons and it won't be long before you're one-shot-killing the bulk of infected people.  Weapons can be upgraded with enhancements and buffs as you collect them, but they don't last forever.  You can repair a worn-out weapon only so many times before you must find or buy another in Harran.\n\n\nDifficultyFor more skilled players, a HARD mode has been added.  Good luck with that!  For the rest of us, I would say the difficulty is at medium level when playing on 'normal'.  You'll be in for some fights and reliance on parkour from the start, but nothing feels unachievable.  There will be enemies that at first will be too tough to confront head-on, but nothing is beyond reach.    At first, I tended to cling to roof tops and would become easily overwhelmed by the infected if I found myself in the middle of a street, but I didn't have to wait until too long before I was easily able to defend myself and reap all the resources infected bodies still carry once killed.  The only element of the game I didn't enjoy difficulty-wise was the small number of speed challenges (same sort of thing as the speed challenges in Assassin's Creed) but these are totally optional and nothing is lost for any player who prefers not to complete them.\n\nThe parkour is really nicely done - it's easy to imagine that it's real-world achievable for a fit and strong person without being beyond realism (no silly platformer manoeuvres here).  As for choice of controller, I actually found mouse and keyboard much easier for the parkour than my XBox 360 gamepad.  Both are supported and hot-switchable but I found Kb/M more accurate.  Overall, gameplay felt fluid and fun, with very few frustrating moments throughout the game.\n\nGame quality and lengthI have not yet seen a game world that is more detailed than this.  It's clear the designers absolutely loved what they were doing (the level of detail in even the least consequential things is astonishing).  The dust and particle effects are stunning.  The voice-acting of Crane is absolutely first-class and really gives personality to the protagonist.  I didn't feel many of the NPC characters were quite so strong, but they weren't bad either.  It took me over 100 hours to complete the game, but on average I take twice as long as the average gamer, so expect at least 50 hours of gameplay.  The story was enjoyable without being too predictable (a few twists and turns along the way) and it has left me wanting to replay the game.\n\nPerformance-wise, I only had problems with one area towards the end where framerates dropped and grass polygons were no longer rendering correctly.  Out of 100 hours, that was about 10 minutes of gameplay, but I'm running the game with a 6Gb nvidia Titan Black on a new 6-core i7, so there is a good chance there will be the same or similar problems on anything less than that (caveat: I did ramp up every single setting in the game) so you might need to dial back some things, but frankly, no matter what level of settings you use, you will still be impressed by the graphics.\n\nAnything not to like?While the side missions were varied and fun, I didn't much like the speed challenges as they really didn't fit well with the story and were a tad too difficult for bad gamers like me!  Sometimes, 'trap' zombies were placed purposely behind closed doors with no chance for the player to take avoiding action, resulting in immediate death; death isn't a huge problem (you'll just lose a chunk of experience points) but it felt a bit unnecessary to put these deliberate traps in the game.  Finally, there is a big announcement on-screen about being about to embark on the final part of the game (it's really just to tell you that while the game will end you will still be able to finish off other missions and such).  This totally broke the immersion for me (I would rather the game just flowed into that final sequence) but it's a petty thing really, demonstrating that there really isn't much to dislike about the game at all.\n\nConclusionDying Light is an incredible game.  Single-players are getting a LOT of game for the money here, and even at full price it feels like a bargain. Even if you're not struck by zombie games, if you like a GOOD open-world game, I really recommend it.  A huge thank-you to the developers for giving me a fantastic 100+ hours of quality entertainment!","May 23, 2015","true","194.6"," 341 of 363 people (94%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","94","341","363","17","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/239140/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Dying Light is an open world adventure horror game, developed by Techland and published by Warner Brothers, releasing in January 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. This game sort of came out of nowhere, it didn’t have very much hype behind it prior to release and it came as a welcome surprise to a usually quite month of the year for big game releases.\n\nThe game play in Dying Light reminded me so closely of Dead Island. You play in first person view as you explore the world. Of course, the world has been overrun by zombies. One of the changes to the “Dead Island” gameplay style is the parkour system. We have seen parkour systems used in games such as Assassins Creed and Shadow of Mordor, but Dying Light’s version knocks them all out of the park. A third of the gameplay is based around the running and jumping across the landscape – you are able to hide from the zombies when you are jumping rooftop-to-rooftop so it is really in your interest to get to grasp with it as soon as possible. There are times when you will be thrown into the combat situations; this is where the Dead Island mechanics come in – melee weapons are going to be your primary source of damage and they work exactly the same as DI. Your weapons take durability damage each time you hit, but you can repair them on the fly with the required parts. Once you get your hands on a gun, the odds swing dramatically in your favour, but you do get the downside of the noise it creates, and it possibly attracting even more zombies to your location.\n\nOne of my favourite mechanics Dying Light introduced though would be the dynamic day and night cycle. During the day time, zombies will act in their usual manner, whilst they are still a danger, they can definitely be managed fairly easily. Once it is night time though; boy oh boy, you better have your running shoes on! The zombies transform into a much more dangerous form, they can sprint, and see a lot further away, as well as their heightened sense of hearing – meaning you will find it very hard to by-pass them.  The day night cycle lasts for about 70 minutes in total, about one hour in daylight, and 10 minutes at night.\n\nGraphically, I am very happy with the quality of graphics on show. I was nowhere near able to push out the game on 4k, even on the menu screen my frame rate plummeted, and I even struggled on 1440p, so I had to make do with just 1080p with all of the settings ramped up.  The lighting effects, explosions, and scenery all look absolutely stunning. Textures are all high resolution and the animations of everything in the game are faultless. Whilst there is a lot of animations that can be annoying after the first few times, such as when you open a chest, you have to wait 2-3 seconds whilst the animation plays out of you opening it; personally I would have liked this to be skippable but it is a really minor issue.\n\nDying Light starts out in a very easy fashion, allowing you to get to grips with the game mechanics, and the tutorial at the start of the game introduces you to the game very well too. The parkour mechanic can take a little while to get used to as sometimes you will probably fall whilst climbing buildings because you aren’t used to the way it works and feels, but it just takes practice. The only time I had real issues with the combat difficulty would be the later stages in the game, when you are just getting hammered by hordes of zombies over and over again. Little tip; conserve your ammo!!!\n\nThe vast open world you are playing in very rarely leaves you with nothing to do; there are tons of side missions, collectables and loot to find. There are over 100 different melee weapons, and they can be modified in different combinations (over 1000 of them!). The side missions do seem a little but samey after a while. I completed about 13 or so out of the 44 before I finished the main story and this was because they are very repetitive. A few other optional objectives consist of finding relief packages which is where you race the opposite faction to get a supply drop, saving survivors from the opposite faction’s men attacking them, and the same for zombies. You can also go out of your way to find collectable items such as trophy’s and notes around the world.\n\nCompleting the main story and about a ¼ of the side missions has taken me just over ten hours. Right now I don’t have a dying urge to go back in and complete the rest of the missions, purely because of the repetitive factor, but I will be keeping Dying Light installed so that I can in the future as well as the anticipated DLC which will be releasing soon. The devs have reports that with all of the current content in the game, you should be able to push 50 hours. I struggle to believe that, I would say you can get about 20 hours out of Dying Light at the time of writing this.\n\nI didn’t have any technical issues. The game ran very well at 1080p at a steady 60 fps, the only time it dropped sub 60 was in extremely hectic scenes with hundreds of zombies and lots of explosions but that is to be expected. I played the game with keyboard and mouse, and should be strongly recommended you do not attempt to play with a controller.\n\nTo sum up, Dying Light is a really nicely done zombie adventure game. Personally I feel it is a much more rounded off game compared to the Dead Island series, and adds plenty of depth to the genre rather than re-hashing content that’s already been done before. The main story and core gameplay mechanics make’s Dying Light one of the standout games to be released in 2015 and I would strongly recommend this game to any open world genre fans out there.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyAijou/recommended/239140/","LadyAijou","LadyAijou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyAijou/","467 products in account","I don't often sit down and write game reviews, but I had to make an exception for Dying Light. It has been a very long time since I dropped $60 on a game and felt this good about it. I am a zombie game junkie, I play as many as I can. This one is hands down the most satisfying experience I've ever had. These are a few of the ways this game stands out to me as head and shoulders above the rest:\n\nCombat- The combat feels amazing in this game. From jabbing at things with pipes and wooden boards in the early game, to a slow motion decap later on, it just feels amazing to kill the zombies. They're an actual threat to you, and you can quickly find yourself overwhelmed if you linger in the streets. There are so many ways to dispose of them. About 23 hours into the game, I have several different guns, swords, axes, throwing weapons, molotovs, and a variety of combat moves that let me stomp on their heads when I knock them down. That's another thing I love so much. This game isn't just another start game, grab a gun, shoot everything game. You don't even SEE a gun till you've done quite a bit of getting your hands dirty. Guns also present their own danger. If you shoot a gun, or set off an alarm, you bring the attention of the masses of zombies in the streets. Not just one or two, they swarm you and it happens fast. The decision to pick off an enemy with a firearm is one you make very very carefully. There are genuine consequences to how you choose to confront your enemies.\n\nProgression - I can't say enough good about it. They have done an absolutely brilliant job with the balance and overall gameplay in Dying Light. In the beginning, the first time you poke your head out of the building you start in, you are terrified by the strength of the zombies, and they are everywhere. The entire game grows with your character. Searching boxes early on you get low end gear, but the stronger you get, the stronger the enemies get across the entire city. New zombie types start to appear, even in the daytime. Night time is just a NOPE! Unless of course you rock the stealth thing. I myself am too prone to running in wth my machete swinging. Eventually you are driven by the story and quests to HAVE to complete missions at night, and it's a rush from beginning to end. Loot gets progressively better based on your own progress, there are no "junk" areas of the game where the mobs become laughable and the loot even worse.\n\nThe overall experience- If you're an adrenaline junkie, you WANT this game. You learn very quickly that your life depends on mastering not only the weapons and combat, but also the parkour. You don't ever stop running and jumping, leaping to and from rooftops, over fences, cars and other obstacles. If you miss a jump, the horde will be right on you, grabbing and clawing and biting, and bringing plenty of their friends along for the snack. I would highly recommend this game to people looking for a truly action packed experience, this one is not for the faint of heart!!\n","February 28, 2015","true","44.5"," 217 of 236 people (92%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","92","217","236","11","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nutcrackr/recommended/239140/","nutcrackr","nutcrackr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nutcrackr/","372 products in account","Dying Light is a zombie game that focuses on atmosphere and player movement. If you have played Dead Island you already know the basic mechanics; craft melee weapons and bash zombies while collecting supplies. But Dying Light employs numerous changes that improve on this.\n\nAtmosphere is perhaps its best asset. The day-night cycle is a crucial component, as there are major changes to mood and gameplay as the sun sets behind the horizon. At night, the tension elevates as you experience reduced visibility and face zombies that are nimble, fast and deadly. You will be tempted to venture out at night for extra rewards. During the day, you battle hordes of shambling zombies that are fun to eviscerate with a broad selection of weaponry. The difference between night and day provides a genuine rollercoaster ride.\n\nParkour movement makes navigating the world immensely enjoyable. You are able to run, jump and climb over buildings with ease. You just look at a ledge and hold the jump button to climb. As you come upon zombie hordes you analyse the area quickly. Do you attack or use the environment to avoid danger? Various slides and kicks make dealing with zombies, and human foes, quite interesting. Traps placed around the world can be triggered to slow pursuers or distract zombies, giving you an edge as you learn the world around you.\n\nThe single player is surprisingly entertaining and lengthy, with side quests that are often better than those in the story. Characters are well-defined and memorable, with more effort given to justify the game world. You run between areas, clear safe zones, rescue people and collect items. Story missions might even feature shootouts in indoor levels. Progression comes via a skill tree that unlocks significant character upgrades. You will also learn to craft items like Molotovs and flares to make you more formidable against the various zombie types.\n\nDying Light is also a cooperative game and playing with others is easy. The basic cooperative action works well, aside from rigid animations, and you can undertake just about every quest from the campaign. You can even open your game to a 'zombie invasion' where another player joins and takes the role of a dangerous night-hunter zombie that can instantly kill survivors with a pounce. Your goal is to destroy zombie nests before you lose a certain number of lives. Whether playing alone, or with a group of four, this versus mode is actually good despite its relative simplicity. It gets hectic when four players are battling tougher zombies and running all over the open map while being pursued by a night-hunter that can summon exploding zombies.\n\nDying Light is a terrific zombie game that greatly improves the core mechanics from Dead Island. It emphasizes the world and how you move around in it. The changes between day and night are refreshing and memorable. There is a healthy amount of content that will provide dozens of hours of entertainment in solo or cooperative play. Dying Light mixes intriguing elements to craft a zombie experience that is entertaining, atmospheric, visceral, and frenzied.","February 15, 2015","true","40.2"," 244 of 270 people (90%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","90","244","270","15","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/malloryknox/recommended/239140/","malloryknox","MalloryKnox.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/malloryknox/","127 products in account","I played this whole game in co-op mode with 1 other player, so my review is based on the co-op version of this game.\n\nThe Positives\n\n-  PARKOUR!!!  Extremely fun. Even more fun in coop when you're racing across buildings and somebody jumps the wrong way and falls to their death. The movement is very similar to that of Assassins Creed.\n\n- The storyline.  It's engaging, dark and maintains your interest.\n\n- Kyle Crane , the protagonist, is a pretty cool dude.\n\n- The environment  is stark, eerie yet strangely beautiful.\n\n- The day/night cycle is really innovative and makes it EXCITING!  I cannot tell you how much I screeched on that first night, when darkness fell and suddenly 6 special zombies were howling and chasing me. It was terrifying and hilariously fun.\n\n- Upgrading weapons, when you know what you are doing, is fun.   So I can stick a little gas canister to my cleaver to make it set zombies on fire? Or add a small voltage so it electrocutes them? Yes, yes I think I will do these things.\n\n- Skilling up.  As in lots of games, you have skills trees where you can become more proficient in power, agility and survival. I really enjoyed gaining skills and using them to my advantage, particularly the agility tree, where you can learn to jump over zombies and the like.\n\nThe Negatives\n\n- Weapon degeneration.   I didn't like it in Dead Island, and I don't like it in this.\n\n- Weapons lacking... something.  Although this is a melee based game (guns draw zombie attention), I felt the few options for the guns (pistol, shotgun, rifle) were a bit boring. What I would have given to use a bow and arrow, crossbow, silenced weapons and the sort...\n\n- Item making.  For lack of a better phrase, I got quickly bored of fannying about looking for a small axe, a large axe, 3 pieces of string, 4 batteries, a blade and 6 metal parts to make a weapon that wasn't as good as the ones I could pick up at various points in the game.\n\n- Bland side missions and a quick main game.  We powered through the main mission in 13 hours flat because it was exciting, only stopping to do one side mission. Not because we were trying to speed play, but because we didn't feel the need to complete the missions - they didn't offer anything particularly exciting, just a bit of money that you can obtain from selling the 10000 pieces of string you pick up anyway. They weren't well 'advertised' either - we happened across the one we actually played by accident, thinking it was a safe house.\n\n- Co-op felt like an afterthought.  I didn't follow the development for this game very closely, so perhaps it was. It just felt very hastily put together. You play the same character, so there's just 2 of you running around, looking the same. I do understand why - you have to be Kyle to get the information, to take the calls, etc. I just would have preferred a different character to co-op with -  e.g. perhaps adding a couple of other characters from the Tower. I just felt that in co-op, 4 Kyle Cranes looks a bit silly.\n\n- You cannot complete the finale together. This one really bugged me. We had played the entire game together, working alongside each other, healing each other and occasionally laughing at one another's misfortune. It was a shared game. And then: You must play the final in single player mode. Whaaat? Having seen the finale, I completely understand why it can't be done cooperatively. Which makes me definitely think co-op was an afterthought. I would have really like to have done a joint finale, battling together against the bad guy to gain a shared victory.\n\nOver all, I really did enjoy this game in a co-op mode, and the hours I did get out of it were highly entertaining. I would recommend it, particularly if you enjoy zombie / survival games, and if the prospect of free running your way around a city whilst being chased by a f*ckload of zombies appeals to you.","February 19, 2015","true","20.4"," 178 of 208 people (86%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","86","178","208","24","7"

It is such a rush!  Visually its  pleasant to the eyes and the combat can be fun later in the  game when you learn new physical moves and can create weapons such as the exploding ninja stars.  The sound is well done.  If you shoot a gun in the city you can hear the stronger "28 Days Later" zombies coming your way from all directions.  And let me tell you, once night comes it's no joke.  The zombies become real strong and 'volatile' not to mention its tougher to run and jump from building to building because you can't see.  I obtained the elixir/potion creation ability early on and it made all the difference at night.  One potion allows you to see at night and this makes it easier to play cat and mouse and get more points for surviving the night outside a safehouse. Now to the story.

( Like a ghetto version of it but still good)\n+ Rpg system that feels balanced with 3 variety of skills that are leveled in different ways. Isn't easy to level. Max level is 24\n+ Addictive zombie head bashing gameplay using melee weapons (there are guns but rare), kill with traps and a handful of blueprint items\n+ Coop play with up to 3 other friends for a good times where this time it actually works out well\n+ Zombies in the game levels along with your level, they start off slow and stupid and gradually become powerful and dangerous\n+ Dynamic day and night cycle where morning is easy hunts while nightime the zombies gets even more dangerous and super intense.\n+ many gameplay elements such as the weapon color system and modded weapons were brought over from dead island. (The good stuff)\n\nCONS - Fps issues for some people out there which happens to certain hardware or could be a bug (Hopefully this will be fixed with patch and I will just get rid of this line\n\n\n- Dolphin Pinging for items and for searching for items breaks immersion a bit\n- When grabbing quests all players need to be nearby when it should be easy for one to grab quests for everyone.\n- Multiplayer hunter mode humans who sit in the safe zone and never comes out to actually play it, getting dropped by people joining a game\n- it is hard to be the zombie to invade games or can't find any games, they need to rework this.\n- No leaderboards for the multiplay\n- Zombie Ai has one super flaw which can only be seen when there are hordes of zombies, Not all zombies will be distracted or pay attention to the player but rather it grabs them randomly to attack while the rest ignores. Go up to a high area and throw firecrackers and molotovs to see this example.\n- Playing multiplayer zombie is really really tedious just randomly spamming to join a game, everytime you join one if another joins then it automatically kicks you out so you spam some more.\n- Qte's are lazy and when you get to the finale, well......\n\n\n(Other) +- Story starts great then goes  off slow but gradually gets better, many sidequest to do.\n+- - Sidequests are a bit tedious after a while but overall has a nice lore to them and some of them are excellent, just many of them aren't. They get better LATER in the game.

I didn't pay that much attention to it, but I did like the music and the sounds - they bring you in the atmosphere that you would want in this type of games.\n\nCombat:\n\nThe combat is okay.  At the beginning you rely on small one-handed weapons that don't deal much damage, but as you progress through the game, you get very good knives, machetes, and you can even customize your weapons and add things like poison, shock effects, extra bleed damage, and all that.  Later on you get your hands dirty with a pistol and 2 rifles (there are more, but I didn't really use them), but they won't be used that much because of the scarcity of ammo.  To be honest, I prefer it that way.\nAfter you progress through your levels, you can get good hand-to-hand skills like grappling, drop kick, kicking while sliding, stomping, and other, which almost remove the need of having any weapons at all if used correctly (I still use my old school baseball bat with shock effects just to be a boss).\nWhat I do not like about the combat is the AI.  Some AI, especially the humans, retreat very often.  They run against you, then they stop, then they just retreat slowly and you have to go chase them, which may take some time.\nDon't start thinking you will go rambo style at the beginning.  It will be hard to face more than one enemy at the time at first, but when you get good skills, you will be able to fight waves easily if you use them right.\n\nParkour:\n\nJumping from one building to another, climbing towers, or jumping over obstables will make you feel like you're playing a mix of Assassin's Creed and Far Cry.  It is very well done even though sometimes you can make jumps that are really over the bounds of reality.\n\nStory:\n\nThe best part for me was the story.  I love playing single player games, so I played the story all the way through by myself and I have to say it was fairly addicting.  Even though it is very easy to predict, in fact I knew what was going to happen at the end in the first 30 minutes, there are some things in the middle of the story, or the way the things you thought actually happen, that will surprise you.  You will not want to take a break because you want to know what happens next.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot talk about game optimization.  I'm running a GTX 980 SLI, an i7 4790k 4.8 GHz and an SSD, so the game runs smooth for me at max, but I can't tell about about mid range specs.  One thing I did not like is that I cannot (or at least didn't find a way to) use DSR (dynamic super resolution); when I switch my res to 4k, unfortunately the game doesn't really make it 4k but something lower.  I'll have to look into that.\n\nBugs:\n\nYou'll probably find a few bugs, nothing really serious.  The worst in my experience was getting stuck once, but I went back into the main menu, I pressed continue and I was 5 seconds away from where I got stuck and ready to go.\n\nConclusion:\n\nOverall the game is very, very good.  If you wanted a great Dead Island, here it is.  Great story, beautiful graphics and good gameplay.  Is it worth $60? Depends on how much $60 is for you (doesn't mean you have to buy it at $60 anyway...).  You  can simply wait for a sale and grab your copy.  It will be worth it. The main story is a good 15-20 hours (to me it says less because I played it a lot while my connection was down).  Then you have many side quests that will probably take a lot of time.  I do not regret my purchase and I recommend this game to my friends.","February 1, 2015","true","22.3"," 209 of 257 people (81%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","81","209","257","21","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/recommended/239140/","LeSharkeh","Schlechte ᖘlumm 🐝","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LeSharkeh/","375 products in account","Well after about 50 or so hours of playing this game and grabbing everything I pretty much can, I feel like I need to write a review on it! (With lots of Dead Island hate)\n\nShort review: It's basically what Dead Island should have been but mixed in with some Far Cry, Mirrors Edge, and a little bit of Assassins Creed elements.  If you want a superior Dead Island get this.\n\nLONG REVIEW TIME:\n\nPROS:\n\nBetter story (as far as a zombie game goes): As far a a zombie game story goes this is a lot better than Dead Island.  Basically- oh yeah SPOILER ALERT -you're a man named Kyle Crane who is dropped into the infected city of Harran to find some guy that has stolen a very important file from the GRE.  And guess what happens the minute you get dropped in? You get bit, of course, lazy pr^$k couldn't move fast enough.  There aren't many twists and turns in the story, but there are some very interesting parts here and there but not much else.\n\nCharacters: Compared to Dead Islands bland Characters, these actually have some soul to them (Take that for what you will) each one is pretty interesting, some are kind of bland, but not as bland as the ones in Dead Island anyway.  Each one seems to have some weight to it or at least some emotion.\n\nFighting the Biters: Fighting the zombies actually feels like it has some weight to it, with each hit you make, each gunshot, everything.  It doesn't feel as lifeless as it does in Dead Island with swings or with guns.  The hit sounds are solid, the impact and weight with each swing you make, the bone breaking for biters, everything, it feels pretty solid.\n\nScavenging for items: To craft good weaponry or even some distracting tools, you need items found throughout the world.  Aerosal, sawblades, chemicals, ductape, everything you find is useful in someway or another.  This is how you make throwing stars, strong elemental weapons, explosives, and more.  Plus my OCD says "GRAB EVERY DAMN THING YOU SEE."  Not only that but almost every single building you go towards you can go into and scavange for some loot, very nice touch that you can enter most of the buildings to get stuff.\n\nTraps: There are traps riddled throughout the world that you can use to your advantage, like a car trap.  It sets off the alarm and the zombies gather around it, after about 5 alarm horns it goes off with an electric shock, pretty much killing everything in the area around it.  Or like the electric fence, which makes a loud high pitched screech to draw enemies over, then zaps the fences below them with electricity, useful for dealing with enemies on your tail.\n\nDifferent enemy types: There are different enemies instead of just zombies.  There are the Spitters from Left 4 dead except they are even MORE ANNOYING.  Demolishers, which as basically just really big buff zombies that can knock down a lot of your health and get quite annoying.  The Runner Zombies, they are basically runners that have been infected, they're as fast as you, and can climb up buildings to catch you. The prison zombies (I suppose this is what they're called) they are basically just a beefed up version of the regular biters except with a big piece of Concrete Rubar that will hurt you with the swing and knock you over if you're too close.  Hazmat zombies that can't get caught on fire, but have a air tank on their back, hit the tank, and BOOM.  The Volatiles, they come out at night to patrol and can sense you if you get too close, this basically goes as a cop system like GTA, the longer they chase you the more will follow, and the longer they'll try to search for you if you lose them.  And then my most HATED ENEMY EVER, the Suiciders, which can kill you instantly if you are within like 2 meters of them.\n\nWeapon Variety: There are a lot of weapons you can get, each has it's own little property based off what it is, bone breaking, slicing off body parts, etc.  AND THE GUNS ACTUALLY WORK LIKE F%#KING GUNS.  Headshots apply to pretty much everything except for volatiles I believe, they do have some damn good sounds, and the impact of shooting a enemy is very rewarding.\n\nParkour!: How could I forget one of the most entertaining things of this game?  Years after Mirrors Edge came out i've been trying to scratch a very unbearable itch mainly because that game left me with wanting more of it, and since Dice is lazy with making the 2nd game, I kept hearing about this game and it has free running properties, thankfully it's done correct.  It doesn't feel like a mess, it feels very fluid, except for when you start off when you trip over every thing you see and grab onto, but it keeps you on your toes when you are being chased by the Volatiles.\n\nProgression/level up: Progressing with your level in this game is pretty good, there are 3 types of levels.  Survivor, Agility, and Power, and each is leveled up based off of what you do.  Survivor is for helping people out with quests, getting air drops and giving them to the quarter master for some experience, or exploring and helping people in need.  Agility is for parkouring around the place, the longer/more deadly the jump, the more points you get from it, meaning the more dangerous things you do the more point you'll get from it.  Power is what you do to hurt biters, can be throwing stars, your own melee weapons, guns, traps, anything, even just smacking the zombie with your fist will get you points for it.\n\nDay and night Cycle: people complain about the Day and Night cycle because it isn't introduced at first, which it isn't, but I think that's a good thing, I don't want to roam around at night not knowing what's gonna happen.  After a few missions it introduces you to the day and night cycle and it works correctly, plus all of your Power and Agility points are doubled at night since it's so risky to go out.\n\nCONS:\n\nTHE F#%KING SUICIDERS: I hate these damn zombies the most, not only are they a pain to get away from, they aren't obvious from the rest of the crowd.  Need a example?  I was on the bridge trying to get to the top, while walking on the bridge and going through the zombies, there was one with his back turned, I figured "Ah why not" I hit him, BOOM, dead.  Turns out it was a stupid suicider zombie, but THEY ARENT OBVIOUS ENOUGH.  They blend in with the common infected so well it just starts to get annoying, like if you're in a battle with lots of zombies and they are blocking your path and you have to kill them, and then a suicider just waltzs in behind them and you hit him you just screwed yourself because of it.  I'm not saying they should get taken out, i'm saying I wish they were more obvious to see and identify.\n\nThe grappling hook: This isn't a con becuase I don't like it, it works great, but it's Kyle when he uses it.  If you grapplehook to certain things Kyle I guess goes artard for a moment and doesn't want to grab onto whatever I aimed it at.  Like one time I aimed up near a building roof and hooked at the edge, but instead of grabbing onto said edge and climbing up he just decided he wasn't even going to try and grab it, and then just fell and broke his legs.  Good going Kyle, a%#$ole.\n\nThrowable items: Most of the throwable items are really useless, like later you can make burning and freezing throwing stars, yet burning is the best out of them all since not just zombies but the enemy Humans will start flailing around a little giving you time to attack.  And then the explosives, the only useful one is the Explosive firecrackers since they gather around it and blows them all up.\n\nCONCLUSION: After playing Dead Island and then Dying Light, Dying Light is clearly superior, and since i'm running out of a word length, i'll just say this, it gets a 8/10 singleplayer, and a 9/10 for Co-op, it's fun, it's entertaining, and I haven't gotten bored of it since.  I'm not going to let AngryJoe or Benjamin "Yahtzee" Croshaw get in my way of saying it's another zombie game.  It's a lot of f%$king fun.","February 9, 2015","true","64.8"," 164 of 195 people (84%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","84","164","195","25","6"

Techland created a zombie game in the vein of Dead Island, with huge improvements, but without the campiness.  The zombie world of Dying Light revolves around a great premise. The sidequests range from somewhat fun to damn cool. There are many different scenarios, and they are events and occurrences that would more than likely occur in a post-apocalyptic world. There are 44 side quests. While they may not be all worth doing, the player may be surprised by some of the adventures they bring.\n\nThe parkour is fluid and connected, while building off on climbing and jumping mechanics that makes free-running exhilarating.  It starts off slow, but once you get going on the agility skill tree, free-running is really fun. I highly recommend putting points in the fall damage mitigation, and forward roll. For instance, parkour/free-running has three stages of upgrades.  You start off as a novice freerunner, and as you progress through the skill tree, you become more athletic, therefore, traversing the world faster with less stumbles. These all make for smooth controls that are very responsive, and it does not miss a beat.  Fun times.\n\nYou can also combine abilities from different skill trees to perform combos.  For example, you can use "vault" on a zombie, followed by a "drop attack" for a satisfying combo finisher.\n\nIf you are trying to connect Dead Island and DI: Riptide to this game, it probably shares in common some visual art design, melee combat, without the campiness. But the melee combat has been greatly improved. The melee combat is extremely satisfying.The gameplay is where Dying Light shines. Gunplay is so much better too. Throw in free-running abilities, the three skill trees, and gameplay is a blast. Dying Light sports the best melee/parkour combat to date.\n\nAnd while I feel the gameplay is the best part of the game, Dying Light does many other things right too. In another light, the ending was predictable, although it could have been handled differently. I would have liked to see a twist in the story.  I feel like the premise of Dying Light could have served a multitude of story branches.  A missed opportunity, indeed.\n\nIt is one of those games that takes bits of concepts from other games like Mirror's Edge, Dead Island, Far Cry 3+4, and executes it well. It does not feel like you're playing those games per say, but it does remind you of them. If that makes any sense. It feels different, and more than enough to stand on its own.\n\nIf you guys have a chance, give it a try. But if you choose to focus too much on its flaws, you will  probably end up not liking it, and you will probably dislike it for the wrong reasons. I felt this way in the beginning, but this is one of those games that really grows on you. It is not amazing, but it has some spectacular moments.\n\nThe visuals are up to par with modern games, atmospheric and immersive, slick and smooth controls--button mapping is great to accommodate for melee combat and free-running, extremely detailed game world,  combined with satisfying melee combat complimented by three skill trees that enhance gameplay incredibly.\n\nThe sound design is excellent, from the cries of a zombie from several yards away, to a great soundtrack (some 80s/90s music),\n\nThere are many different zombie types--common, stronger common, special, and nighttime zombies all make for interesting enemy and A.I.  During nighttime, some common zombies behave more aggressively, and the nighttime zombies like the Volatiles come out on patrol.  Volatiles, like the more alert and aggressive common zombies, have a cone of vision that appears on the mini-map to show the player if they have been alerted.  A eye icon appears over the actual zombie on screen if they have spotted you, and the icon fills up with a red color indicator to show if you are being pursued. The zombie A.I. is smart.\n\nDay-zombies may not be much of a threat as night-zombies, but day-zombies can be a threat in numbers.  "Free-runner" zombies are former runners that turned into the infected.  They move and run faster, and they can climb objects and structures, unlike their common zombie cousins. They are more aggressive and they relentlessly pursue you until you put them out of their misery.\n\nThe physics is good, and it makes for some unintentional, hilarious moments.\n\nI highly recommend crafting and experimenting with every weapon, even if you feel like you will not like "throwing weapons" or "trap bombs." In this game, you're going to want to try everything. They're all fun to use, and they provide for cool gameplay scenarios you can come up with.\n\nAchievements in Dying Light are worth hunting, especially in co-op mode.  Take a little time to read through them because they encourage you to experiment and try different things. I am glad I looked through them. Point being is, get creative. Use your imagination and try to do everything. Experiment.\n\nNighttime is really intense because that's when the more hellish zombies come out and stalk you. You have probably read that other players have reported that the game does not feature real-time day and night cycles, and that is untrue. Early on in the game, there are a few story missions that introduce you to nighttime. I think this confused players. After you have completed those, day and nighttime cycle kicks in. Day lasts several hours, and nighttime only lasts for a very short time. And this occurs without story mission/side quests. You can fast-forward time by clicking on a bed (wait until night or morning), and go off on your adventure.\n\nHowever, I do take issue with the timer for nighttime. There could have been a setting to change how long nighttime lasted. Seven minutes isn't all that much, even though it can sometimes feel like "forever" with Volatiles chasing you across the city.\n\nThere are mini-games spread throughout the world of Dying Light. These include "challenges" that you can participate in, like a free-running challenge, killing a specfic amount of the infected in the quarantine zone, or a challenge scenario where you need to kill 40 zombies within a limited amount of time. It sounds simple on paper, but these challenges can be pretty entertaining in spurts and especially with a co-op partner.\n\nDying Light is one of those rare videogames that was designed thoughtfully. Single-player and co-op intertwine in harmony, and one mode does not hamper the other.  After having played over 50 hours of Dying Light, I can genuinely say that this is one of the best single-player/co-op campaign games out there. With Invasion mode and nighttime adding a whole new dynamic to zombie-killing madness, gameplay is intensified and it brings fresh new gameplay that would have been missed had it not been included.  It is one of the better games that have been released in recent years, and it definitely stands out from the crowd of new-gen games.\n\n9.0 out of 10.\n\n- Highly recommmended.\n- Huge improvement over Dead Island\n- Excellent and thoughtful single-player/co-op design\n- Extremely satisfying melee combat system\n- Great parkour that is fluid and highly responsive\n- Deep skill trees, and game mechanics like crafting and upgrades\n- Great visuals for an open-world game\n- Immersive and atmospheric\n- Cool characters\n- Solid writing for the most part, and good dialogue\n- Great premise\n- Many zombie types provide for dynamic gameplay\n- Excellent zombie A.I.\n- Innovative nighttime zombie gameplay\n- Excellent and responsive controls\n\n- Missed opportunities in plot twist\n- Ending was anti-climatic\n- Missed opportunities in potentially good scares\n- Main protagonist feels hollow\n- Most characters are forgettable\n\n\nCPU: i5-2500K @ 4.1 GHz\nGPU: EVGA GTX 970 Superclocked ACX 2.0\n8GB RAM\nOS:  Windows 7 64-bit Home\nNvidia driver version: WHQL 347.25\nResolution: 1080p","January 31, 2015","true","56.3"," 151 of 179 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","151","179","4","7"

You see, I didn’t like Techland’s last zombie effort, Dead Island, all that much. I found it tedious and repetitive. The crafting system was cool but combat was quite a drag. I actually disliked it to the point that, when I originally saw early Dying Light footage, and it looked a bit like “Dead Island with grappling hooks and parkour,” I dismissed it, thinking that it would retain the overwhelmingly tedious combat that was present in Dead Island, only making getting around easier.\n\nAfter about four hours of play, I can honestly say that I could not have been more wrong. Dying Light, while still presenting combat that takes effort, has removed the tedium by quite a bit. Sure, you won’t be killing zombies in one hit with a pipe but you certainly aren’t going to be watching yourself chip away at a zombie’s health bar while his friends attempt to overtake you the way that Dead Island and its semi-sequel did. It’s challenging, it’s fluid, and it really feels like you’re fighting something that has a fair chance of killing you if you aren’t careful.\n\nThis is helped quite a bit by the fact that the game provides mobility that I didn’t expect in combat, in addition to outside of it. In Dying Light, you can sidestep and backstep, as well as sliding at zombies, possibly tripping them, kicking zombies can send them flying if done right, or maybe just knock them down, you can bound over zombies that you’re fighting...the entirety of combat has been built around the idea that you’re a guy that would possibly want to get around fast. It’s not always about killing the zombies but, perhaps, just making sure that you have enough time to escape their grasp.\n\nAnd escaping will be an absolute joy, at that. Once you’ve kicked them down, or killed them if you actually had the chance, you can leap and bound over almost anything you can see. If you can see and reach a ledge, you can climb it. It is pretty much that simple. To say I was astounded at the sheer amount of scenery that I could scale wouldn’t cover it. The game rivals Assassin’s Creed’s openness while providing less automation, giving the player the utmost control over their actions. Even dropping down from one ledge to another, a simple action made extremely complicated in many games, is made extremely simple in Dying Light.\n\nAmongst all these great mechanics, you will be spending a lot of time scavenging, though. It is a post-apocalyptic game through and through. Resources for crafting medkits, amongst other items, will be crucial to survival. Simply bounding over enemies won’t always cut it. Eventually, you will slip and fall, or you will need something from a vendor, and, if you haven’t been scavenging, you might be screwed. Sometimes, you may even have to pick locks. The game uses a lockpicking system similar to the Elder Scrolls series, only a bit more forgiving. I was honestly a bit surprised that a system like that was used and not one based more on luck.\n\nThis is alright, though. Getting around is easy and scavenging is made easy by “Survivor Sense,” which is essentially a short-range radar for lootable items. If that weren’t enough, if you play in co-op, the game provides “Competitions,” such as collecting the most loot in a specific amount of time or doing the most damage to a larger zombie within a specified amount of time, that you can sidetrack to keep yourselves busy during a long bout of scavenging. Scavenging may be necessary but the game does everything in its power to break up the monotony of running from house to house, collecting things.\n\nSpeaking of co-op, it actually works rather well. For the first time in ages, there was no discernable lag during a co-op game, with one of the people being on the opposite end of the country from the others. I don’t know if they use some sort of lag smoothing techniques or something similar but they did rather well hiding even the slightest hint of lag. Every player’s movement is incredibly smooth throughout. It also doesn't hurt that they included in-game VoIP that worked without any extra setup.\n\nIt’s also well-designed in terms of gameplay. In addition to the Competitions mentioned previously, players can also sacrifice medkits to heal each other, as well as reviving downed allies. Players can rest easy about their loot, as well. Each player can loot each loot source independently. Zombies, lockboxes, cupboards, you name it; each player gets a separate set of loot from each. This is exceptionally welcome as the resources for critical items, medkits even more so than weapon repair materials, are scarce enough to begin with. Imagine four players fighting over a single player’s medkit resources. That doesn’t sound all that enticing.\nI wish that, at this point, I could talk a bit about the story but, put simply, four hours into the game, I still have no idea what is going on. All I know is that you’re undercover, attempting to get back some stolen file, and some of the local residents are less than reputable. The cast seems rather well-balanced personality-wise and I have yet to meet a character that felt boring or out of place, other than those that don’t talk at all, but the fact of the matter is that, four hours later, I still don’t have any idea what is going on in the city of Harran. It gives me a bit of hope, though, that the game will be lengthy and the story rife with commendable plot twists.\n\nNow, I’ve said quite a number of words about my thoughts on Dying Light after four hours of play but the most important of them come down to this. If you had told me that the first game of the new year to suck me in for a four hour first play session would be a zombie game, I probably would have laughed at the notion. From the outset, Dying Light exceeds all expectations and creates an experience that is genuinely fun and well-designed. It remains to be seen what will happen once my character has been upgraded a bit more but I am more than hopeful that it will only become more entertaining from here.","January 27, 2015","true","48.4"," 410 of 554 people (74%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","74","410","554","29","11"

A true masterpiece. Awesome parkour, epic combat, and plenty of zombies.\n\nParkour:\nPros:\n1.Smooth and responsive\n2.Really cool\n3.It's easy to get the hang of\n\nCons:\n1.Well it, um... it... um... nope, nothing.\n\nCombat:\nPros:\n1. You start off being a tiny little peasant hitting zombies with chair legs, pipes, and wrenches, but by the end you end up having machetes that set enemies on fire AND electrocute them! You start off feeling like a lost puppy, but by the end you feel like a god. That, my friends, is the best learning curve ever.\n2. The combat is crap and not very smooth when you have low level weapons, but when you have proper weapons the combat is awesome and smooth.\n3. You can hide yourself in zombie guts, Walking Dead style.\n4. Mother, ♥♥♥♥ing, dropkick. Nuff said.\n\nCons:\n1. You can't rip the heart out of a bandit and bite into it like an apple while his friends watch. (I'm looking at you Nexusmods).\n\nZombies:\nPros:\n1. The majority of zombies are slow, braindead, squishy toys once you get some decent weapons. Just don't let them swarm you.\n\nCons:\n1. Bombers.\n\nHope you found this helpfull.\nGood night, and good luck.\n\n\n\nEdit: Forgot to mention the story and missions because of how overwhelmed I was about reccomending the gameplay. (thanks to Cubbysablo for reminding me).\n\nStory:\nPros:\n1. It isn't Watchdogs.\n\nCons:\n1. It is quite short. Although that might be a pro in this case, I'm not sure.\n2. The main antagonist, Rais, is about as cliched as  (Honestly, there are only two good points relating Rais. One of which you encounter in one of the first missions.)\n3. The main protagonist, Kyle Crane, has the classic "nothing deserves to die" attitude, even though the gameplay focuses on you killing lots of things.\n\nMissions:\nPros:\n1. You can easily postpone quests.\n\nCons:\n1. A lot of fetch quests. The only fun thing about them is all the killing on the way.\n2. You are forced to run away from 7 foot skinless zombies, with visible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in the dark, in the third story mission. You can't wait for day though when they all go away, because Techland decided to disable the day/night cycle for the first few missions!\n3.

I was lucky enough to get a preview build from Techland, and finally a final copy earlier this morning. I have been playing the game in Offline mode for roughly 13 hours now - almost close to the ending in Normal Difficulty.\n\nA lot of people will tell me "This is just Dead Island but with Parkour.." Which would be true, but the game's characters, the storyline, the various side-quests and unique random interactions make this game far more magical than Dead Island could ever hope to be.\n\nThe only issues I have so far is the day/night cycle and the characters lip syncing and their mannerisms. The Day/Night cycle is AWFUL. I'm sorry Techland, but it is! You would think it is tied to a real-time day/night cycle...but it's not! It is cleverly marketed as a "Dynamic Day/Night Cycle," which is SOMEWHAT true. It is dynamic in the sense that the zombies get super aggressive at night compared to during the day, but the entire DAY/NIGHT cycle is tied to quests. It does not become night until the quest says so. Don't expect to stand around and it to turn night-time. Doesn't happen! It will be day-time forever as long as the quest dictates it will be. Severely disappointing and false advertising in my opinion.\n\nIn terms of character lips, I completely hate how "last-gen" the lip sync is to the animation of the dialogue. We should not have characters that seem like they have been generically dubbed over as they say "Something wrong?" and it could be "How is everything?" The audio just poorly matches the lips...very annoying. Secondly, I find the mannerisms unrealistic. When you are running from an intense night-time mode or having just been invaded by the hunter (which several devs did in my game as I believe I'm one of the few playing it along with some notable YTers, etc.) and you get to a safe zone - the characters proceed as if NOTHING happened. Like you didn't just come gunning from hell. They walk around casually...and tend to say the same thing across all safe zones. Poor.\n\nAll in all, the game is worth the buy, especially if you have the Oculus Rift DK2. I played it on the Oculus Rift DK2, and there were definitely dizzying moments to the game. I had to stop playing after 25 minutes. Perhaps its just me, but the character wobbling up and down as he runs may need to be adjusted to prevent people from vomiting in VR.\n\nHow much would I personally pay for Dying Light? $39.99. Not $59.99. I think a -$20 ding is appropriate for the two annoying issues that are definitely immersion breaking.\n\nPLAYTIME INFO: UNLOCKED by devs at 7 AM PST. Only 2 hours logged because of a different steam beta/program branch for early pre-retail access. PLEASE NOTE - the review went live at 12:01AM with 2.6 hours logged (this would be impossible for a non-video game critic as the game did not unlock until 12 AM PST worldwide) - so please do keep this in mind before insulting my integrity.\n\nUPDATES TO REVIEW:\n\nMany people have mentioned they have realtime day/night past the intro quests. I and many others do not however even after several hours into the game past the introductory quests. Techland may have to solve this issue as it could possibly be system specific or hopefully not random.\n\nUPDATE # 2:\n\nAfter reinstalling and updating  some files/verifying integrity and speaking with Andy at Techland - I finally have "dynamic" Day/night cycling. Why on earth it did not happen in 13 hours for me in my Day 1 playthrough = no idea. Devs had no answer for me either, and some of my friends are still struggling with it.  Again, these things become more apparent only after a lot of people get their hands on the game and different systems put it to the test.\n\nFor those saying I rushed, I assure you as I have before -I did not rush for the day/night cycle to have an impact...or maybe I did. I cannot be sure. I played it very normally - but focused solely on main quests. My point stands in DAY/NIGHT cycle being awful. Most of the game is day-time, with little to no variation in the actual day to night variance. As many have mentioned, the ratio of Day:Night is very large, so it's mostly daytime. They should have kept it realtime. At least the day/night is not tied to the quests solely, and I guess this serves as some reprise to my former statements in the review.","January 27, 2015","true","5.5"," 931 of 1,329 people (70%) found this review helpful 75 people found this review funny","70","931","1","75","75"

With some forgiveable failures and interesting genre meshes, it's a fun time if you can forgive the dumb story and lack of realistic parkour and survival gameplay.\n\nHighlights\nMost people like to call this "Dead Island done right", and I'd agree, but I'd also call it Assassin's Creed done right, and reference a few other games it beats in terms of mechanics and solid gameplay. It takes elements from lots of other games, and doesn't add anything, but enhances them to the point that they fit very well and add to the game.\n\n* The tech tree is basic but good, and works well as a progression and goal system offering useful and interesting additions and upgrades.\n* Parkour is basic but good, and makes you love running from building to building while escaping the grasp of the hoards.\n* The crafting system is basic but good, and gives you a desire to scavenge and collect.\n* The combat, exploration and world are all fairly basic with mistakes, but overall good.\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nThere are a few problems with Dying Light, and they're mostly what you'd expect from an AAA title, but they're mild enough, or the rest of the game is good enough, that they're forgiveable. Most of the problems and negatives of the game stem from the fact that it tries to be too many things, presumably because of the publishers demands, and the lack of focus on story or survival means this game doesn't become anything special.\n\n* The storyline is complete trash. The characters are one dimensional, often unbelievable, and even side quests have bland, boring plots and dialogue. There is no character development at all, and basically no arc or story curve other than perhaps a couple of characters from early quests being dotted throughout the second half of the game.\n* Small design mistakes are frustrating, for example locked doors being interactable but locked serves only to waste time. There are plenty instances of things like this that are small but jarring.\n* The voice acting is a mixed bag of fairly good and terrible.\n\nRecommendations\nPriced at £39.99/49.99€/$59.99 at the time of review. Personally I don't think any game is worth this much, but compared to other triple A's its pricetag isn't too inflated. It works out a quarter cheaper if you have friends and use the 4-Pack option. Wait for a saving of at least 50% for this to be better value for money.\n\nThe DLC scheme is a complete joke. The Ultimate Survival Bundle offers 2 Quarantine Zones, which were one of the most boring parts of the game. The Bozak Horde is worse, offering badly designed co-op trials. You can bet the 3rd planned DLC will be equally awful. In short, completely ignore the DLC.","April 8, 2015","true","117.4"," 107 of 130 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","107","130","6","7"

I love it. If you don't own the game already then this is why I think you should:\n\nSTORY\nGreat story line. Its not an "amazing" story, but its still good enough to attach you to the character and have you understand what is happening. You play as Kyle Crane, a GRE agent who was dropped into Harran to find a rogue GRE operative who stole a file from them, because he blamed the GRE for the death of his brother. You're told the file is a cure for the Harran Virus and you're sent to retrieve it at all costs. You drop in and instantly get greeted by a group of men who you later learn work for someone named "Rais." They start attacking you and Kyle shoots them, which draws in nearby zombies. The two living men (since you killed one) run off, and you are attacked by zombies. You get bit and are infected for the rest of the game. The only reason you're not a zombie is because of a medicine called "Antizin" which acts as a cure until the meds wear out.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nAmazing gameplay. Its a first-person, parkour, zombie, free-roam, shooter. Although using guns hurts you more then helps you, they are still useable so I'm calling it a shooter. When you start playing you literally have a pipe as a weapon. A. Pipe. You can find more weapons throughout the map lying inside of boxes that you can lock pick to open, or they can be on the ground. However, the ones on the ground always suck. If you have money, you can buy better weapons from shops inside of safe zones. Then there's modifiers for your weapon. You can add small modifiers which just boost a specific trait of the weapon, or you can find blueprints to make upgrades for them, like the Angel Sword. The Angel Sword adds medium fire and electicity damage to your weapon (Its awesome). For parkour you can literally climb ANYTHING, except for the border of the map obviously. If you see a bridge, then there's a way on top of it.\n\nRANKS\nIn Dying Light, there are three ranks that you can level up. All three of them have different ways to level up, and every level unlocks a new ability. There isd Survivor, Agility, and Power. Survivor EXP can be earned by retrieving air drops, completing missions, and saving survivors from enemies. Agility EXP is earned by parkour. Any parkour move you do adds EXP. Even climbing a small ledge gives you a few EXP. Power is earned by damaging enemies. If you slap an enemy then you get a very small amount of EXP. Killing an enemy obviously supplies you with much more. All three give you unique abilities like Survivor's Grappling Hook, Agility's Dropkick, and Power's Drop Attack.\n\nTIME OF DAY\nBelieve it or not, but the time of day makes a large difference in this game's gameplay. Not only is night time pretty much pitch black, but its so dangerous that EXP gained for Power and Agility are doubled. Being out at night time is only for hardened players like myself. Night is when special enemies called "Volatiles" come out. Volatiles will be the death of everyone that is unprepared. They are twice the size of a normal zombie, they are extremely powerful, and even faster then the player. The only way to survive them is to avoid them, or use hardcore parkour skills. They may be faster then you, but they can't jump through everything you do. You would need to climb building, slide under obstacles, and jump off of houses into trash piles if you want to survive Volatiles. My current Steam profile picture is a Volatile.\n\nMY EXPERIENCE\nThis portion of the review will be about every part of the game that I've witnessed and done. All in all, this was an amazing game. There have been times when I've raged, especially in hard difficulty, but this game is still my favorite. There are so many things you can do and see.\n\nI was once out at night trying to gaing as many Power and Agility points as I could and I watched a Volatile climb a lamp post, then fall off while he screamed. That happened twice in the same night.\n\nA different time I was out at night, I missed a jump and fell to ground level. While my character recovered a nearby Volatile saw me and started calling to every zombie in the area. They then all started come after me. I ended up moving so fast out of the area that within six seconds of the Volatile seeing me, I escaped.\n\nI was after an air drop, but when I got to it, Rais' men were already there. My plan was to headshot one of them with my assault rifle so that one was dead, and the other would be attacked by zombies that my gun attracted. I pulled out my gun and took aim. Right before I shot him, a Viral zombie came out of nowhere and attacked me. I killed him with my machete. Again, I took aim and another Viral attacked me, so I killed her with my machete too. This happened three more times before I finally just jumped down and killed Rais' men with my hand weapon instead of a gun.\n\nI beat the game on normal difficulty, and now I am doing it on hard. I find it strange that normal difficulty was harder for me then "hard." Must be because I was already MLG when I started playing hard. On normal, when you first meet a Demolisher I died a few times before I won. On hard, I killed it without dying at all.\n\nThose short stories and much more can happen to you. You can become Spoderman and fly across the map with a grappling hook, you can reanact "THIS. IS. SPARTA!!!" With the dropkick ability. You can kill mobs of zombies at once with enough skill and Power abilities. You can even kill a Volatile. Believe me because I've killed five at once. I rate this game 42/10.","July 21, 2015","true","61.7"," 1,201 of 1,768 people (68%) found this review helpful 2,070 people found this review funny","68","201","1","070","10"

I start looting nearby buildings because there is a nearby safezone. 21:00 comes and I'm still outside (bad idea), the safezone is about 100 meters away and I don't have very good weaponry. Surrounded by Volatiles I think "Well, I could just run..." (also, a bad idea) so I take off running towards the safezone with about 4 Volatiles behind me. Just as I turn a corner *BAM* I literally RUN INTO A FREAKING VOLATILE. After my ears are filled with epic music and the sound of my own heart pounding (and almost peeing my pants) I turn the heck around and start running the other way not remembering, the four volatiles I was already running from. To make matters worse, there aren't many nearby buildings I can jump up into. So i hang a hard left towards the safezone and I see it, the safezone. Relief starts to creep up on me when something else comes to my attention, how do I get in? Whoops, I didn't figure out how to get into the safezone beforehand. Realising my mistake and misfortune, I break for the nearest safezone that I can guarantee I can get into, the Tower. Which, is about 200 or so meters from me. After about 100 meters worth of running, jumping, screaming (like a little girl) and frantic button pressing, I finally lose them atop a building which has 0% visibility. Yup, I'm stuck in a building and can't see much of anything outside except the Volatiles. I decide that the best course of action would be to stealth my way back. After a while, (which felt like a lifetime) I come up to a wall that I may or may not be able to climb, problem is, there are 3 Volatiles with there sights juuuuust away from me. Every bone in my body, every instinct that I have, were all saying in concert, "RUN YOU IDIOT!!", and of course, I did the exact opposite. Something inside me froze my fingers and everything just stopped. After a short time, one of the volatiles looks STRAIGHT AT ME and does its horrible scream thing. Completely motionless, i sit there until it's finished and has turned around. I successfully make it back to the tower without dying and realise, I LOVE THIS GAME","December 22, 2015","true","49.7"," 56 of 59 people (95%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","95","56","59","21","0"

All rolled up in one airtight zombie slaying terrain flying package. 50% of story in one map, the other 50% in another. Plus night time gameplay (scary as ♥♥♥♥) makes it feel like 3 different game modes in one. Also, when playing with friends, you can turn everything into competitions. Get to the airdrop first, collect the most loot, kill the most infected. This is by far better than DI. And very fun to play. Even "be the zombie" multiplayer is fun. 9/10\n\nGood night, and good luck. No kidding.\n\nP.S. A couple additions after several of the same questions-\nQ-Are there any repair benches?\nA-Yes, but only cosmetic. :D You can repair when the weapon degrades, with each weapon having a set number of times you can repair them. Also, a perk increases the chances you won't use one of these "number values".\nQ-Special Infected?\nA-Yes. Ala "L4D" spitters, witches ( a freaky baby), 'bomber' zombies, and VOLATILES, the freaky night time super zombies.\nQ-Crafting?\nA-Yes!

When you arrive there you find yourself fighting against Rais and helping other survivors led by Brecken.\n\nThe story is this games biggest weakness. The story is beyond horrific, with much of the plot holes not making much sense. Not to mention throughout the game you meet a lot of characters and the game expects you to be emotionally attached to them in the more emotional moments in the game. But that is impossible when the characters you meet are incredibly stupid. Almost all the characters are useless and you find yourself not caring for any of them.\n\nThe gameplay is amazing and is  a massive step up from the previous Dead Island titles. The combat is way smoother and not as clunky as the combat in Dead Island. But of course the biggest reason this game is so huge is the parkour system. You can free run and climb up everything you see and it all works perfectly. It's incredibly fun just to take time off of doing main missions and just explore Harran at your own pace. The game also has a day and night cycle where during the night it's pitch black and more dangerous zombies emerge out of the dark corners of Harran. Early in the game night is the most frightening thing in the game as the zombies become stronger and faster.\n\nGraphics are top notch, everything looks outstanding maxed out, both the city and the slums are designed really well to fit the fast paced action of the game.\n\nThe CO-OP is also a big feature in the game, but it feels kinda out of place with this game. Every character is Kyle Crane and it sort feels out of place. Not to mention the Prologue and the end game are both played Solo only so don't expect to jump into CO-OP straight away.\n\nThe "Be the zombie" mode is also quite interesting. It's pretty fun to play as the zombie and it's also quite intense to fight the zombie as well. But there is a massive problem with this mode. It's incredibly hard to find a game, because as soon as you join a game the host drops out. But there is an awesome reward if you beat your opponent.\n\nThe soundtrack is beyond amazing. The soundtrack is awesome 80's synth music and makes you feel like a zombie movie like Dawn of the Dead and some great movies from John Carpenter.\n\nI played the game CO-OP from the start. To complete every main quest, side quest and every quarantine zone took me 23 hours. After finishing the game you can always go back and explore Harran. There are also a lot of parkour challenges around the entire city so you can go play those. Not to mention the "Be The Zombie" mode, there is a ton to do in the game so you can expect hefty amount of play time.\n\nThe game ran smoothly from start to finish. Never dropping any frames whatsoever, so if you have a strong rig, you shouldn't experience any issues. But there are still a ton of bugs, but nothing game breaking.\n\nDying Light is a great game and a major step up from Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide. While the story is horrific the game is fun enough to play through at least once.\n\nFinal Rating:\n8.5/10 - Worth Purchasing\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 3","true","23.5"," 54 of 58 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","54","58","4","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/recommended/239140/","jedo","Black Mage Jedo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/","3564 products in account","I like this game. The parkour and the combat system make it feel like a more polished Dead Island. Content-wise it's very meaty and you get a good chunk of story to go along with several challenges and side quests.\n\nThe game gets a bit too easy once you reach survivor rank 25 though. Weapons (when upgraded to the greatest extent) can kill Volatiles, Goons, and Demolishers in 1 or 2 hits. It makes the night phase a joke.\n\nAs of writing this review, there are currently a handful of achievements that are bugged and one is definitely broken. Various players report very different experiences when it comes to how some of their achievements are tracked. I had a friend who I played co-op with for the entirety of the game and he ended up 1 quest short on his progress bar (we were stuck at 44/45 while he was stuck at 43/45) even though we played every single quest together.\n\nThere's also a few glitches that were mildly annoying. I fell under the map once while travelling near a fishing village. A friend also has demonstrated the grapple hook glitch that pretty much sends you flying out of bounds.\n\nNow you may be thinking that with half of the interview mostly being about achievement bugs and glitches, I may not even recommend this game. Nevertheless, I'm still going to recommend it. I've enjoyed my fair share of zombie games and while the Dead Island games were kind of 'meh', I still enjoyed the open-world setting. Dying Light is a better version of Dead Island. I'm recommending the game because Techland's games are progressively improving. They just need to bring their A-game when it comes to the aforementioned bugs/glitches.","February 10, 2015","true","49.6"," 81 of 100 people (81%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","81","81","100","16","6"

The game also isn't linear which in its self is amazing and no need to feel rushed to do objectives.\n\nMissions?\nThere are several types of competitions, missions and such. The missions types for example escort,  quarantine zones, various collection requests/retrieval based quests, bounty hunting type of quest (Go kill so and so basically), and securing safe houses. There are also dynamic quests you can do such as hunt thugs, random crazy people attacking you at times, secure airdrops for loot, help survivors in trouble with infected, and even the miniboss fights with survivors.\n\nGameplay/physics?\nThe running, climbing, fighting, and surviving without dying as much benefits your character in levels. The levels are "Power" (fighting), "Agility" (running,climbing, jumping ect), and "Survival" (doing missions, surviving at night, turning in airdrops, and various side missions) are very intergrated in the game and are a must because they add features like ability to camoflage yourself among the infected sneak up behind them and break their neck. The leveling up and upgrading features also add a bit to the game. I mean like who doesn't want a sword that can electrocute and burn someone at the same time and be safe in your hands?\n\nThe physics can lead to some pretty funny and fun situations like climbing to top of a tower and finding a random zombie there and spartan kicking him off. It feels pretty satisfying watching the zombie spiraling to the ground and well of course dying. Then there are timeings where adding a impact blueprint to your baseball bat can lead to you slinging the zombie as if it was a homerun.\n\n\nBest moment of game\nDodged zombie on top of a tower\nFell from tower\nLanded luckily in garbage bag pile\nLooked up to see the zombie falling at me.\nPanicked, swung my sword, halved him in mid air.\n\n10/10 would slash falling zombies in half again.\n\nEdit: Found EXPcalibur early on broke it (Has like 8 durability or 8 swings/impacts into objects) but still overpowered baseball bat/sword using it to level my agility by throwing zombies off the bridge into the dark depths of the water below. Best weapon in game.\n\nEdit: 2/17/2015\nI know some of you have seen the "Mod" DMCA and such. However, they've recently added modding support and such for those of you who hadn't read on it. I've glanced at some mods and currently their mostly behavioral improvements on the infected to make them more.. aggressive or harder. However, there are some mods that I've read on that makes it more hardcore survival like reducing the amount of certain resources founds, making crafting more expensive, and also mods like increase in levels to like 40 in Survival (One of three skill trees that you have to level up). There isn't a workshop on steam yet so you will have to go gather information on mods via websites like Nexus.","January 31, 2015","true","84.2"," 70 of 85 people (82%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","82","70","85","23","4"

So I will just quickly sum up what I feel on the game so far.\n\nGraphics 9/10 - Although the game is hard to run at max settings even at medium settings the game is beautiful. The only thing I don't like is the film grain. Truly a "2015"  experience.\n\nCombat 8/10 - The combat makes you feel like you are really trying to bash somethings brains out. The stamina system helps with this factor a lot because of the struggle it takes to kill something without your stamina.\n\nMovement 9/10 - The parkour in this game really gives you the rush of doing parkour, running from the strong as hell night zombies is really an experience. Parkour is what lets you live in this game, without it you would be dead.\n\nAI 7/10- The AI in this game is outstanding. I love how the sound is a big factor to the zombies and they  will chace you for a nice amount of time, but i do wish they would go back to hunting you as soon as a distraction wore off.\n\nMultiplayer 9/10 - It works, thats all I have to say. (Works very well)\n\nFinal Verdict 8/10\n\nShould you buy this game? Yes. Its a good game if your PC can handle it.\n\nUPDATE 1: After beating the game I would like to say the mistakes of the game. One mistake is the game is just easy after you beat it. The game needs to be a lot more harder. A seconds mistake is you level up way to fast. A third mistake is the grappling hook is a little to strong, I think it should be only able to work on ledges above you and it should have shorter range. Over all the grappling hook removes the point of running away at night. So hopefully they will make the game harder, as for the grappling hook you can just not use it.","January 27, 2015","true","62.4"," 159 of 228 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","159","228","11","11"

It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland – it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. It could be similar to previous zombie-survival you had played like Dead Island maybe? But here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby.\n\n\nSTORY   Pretty interesting story.\nSpoiler alert!\nIn summary - Kyle Crane is GRE agent who is tasked with recovering data from the overrun city of Harran that could cure the virus rampaging throughout the city. The virus transforms the victim into a zombie like creature or into special mutations of that. After getting bitten inside the city, Crane has to blend in with one of the two main factions of the city, while staying undercover to try and recover that data. But he may have bitten off more than he can chew.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY    The FPS perspective makes it looks realistic and incredibly fun as in you are really exist in the game world where you roam an urban environment devastated by a mysterious epidemic.\n\nScavenging to craft - Make your own weapons, medicines and bold your pockets by looting some trashes, boxes, lorries, zombie corpses, and etc . Crafting also comes with delight various level weaponries.\n\nScavenge for supplies to send back to the safe zones.\n\nTeam up for missions in multiplayer mode - Engage in competitive challenges, or just run around and bash zombies together. It was fun; they even have mini challenges with your partner throughout the multiplayer mode to earn some achievements.\n\nInvade other people - in Be the Zombie mode. But it is sometimes frustrating because most of invaded players always immediately quit or even disable for being invaded.\n\nWeaponized your self - Discover a new rare blueprint is most blithesome feeling in this game. It’s so rare! You won’t expect it will be placed in that kind of place.\n\nYou are leveling up as you are surviving, parkouring, and beating some asses! Especially in the nighttime.\n\nSet up traps –  Players can also use environmental traps, such as spikes and electrified fences to kill the infected.\n\nThrowing stars, tomahawks, etc. are ranged throwing weapons that can be aimed and used to take enemies out silently from a distance. They are silent and do not summon virals, unless you use them to ignite a gas tank.\n\nExplosives are either in the form of grenades (thrown and explodes) or bombs (which attract then explode). They all cause noise and attract virals.\n\nMolotov cocktails spread fire where they're thrown and will ignite the infected. Can often spawn virals after using.\n\nSupport items each have their own role, flares repel zombies, firecrackers distract them, and the UV flashlight for stunning infected at night. There is less used items like the Pyza Suit which lets you glide.\n\nThe slow motion combat is gory and so cool!\n\nLast but not least, when you have unlocked grappling hook, here comes the spidey !\n\nCHALLENGE LEVEL   when nighttime comes everything changes. The zombies get faster and stronger and new mutations called, Volatiles come out to ruin your day. Good night and good luck.\n\n\nCONTROL   Dying Light control scheme seems pretty familiar and at the same time highly customizable, with a couple of unique elements. In high pressure situation your survival in the game will depend on your performance and how quickly you react, thus, if you want to improve your gameplay and effectiveness you should take maximum advantage of your custom key binding scheme.\n\nGRAPHIC   Really atmospheric and warm with a great depth of field. The blood and gory while slashing the zombies especially while slow motion are fantastic.\n\n\nREPLAYABILITY   Definitely will come back. Ive replayed a couple times – especially to finish all the side quests.\n\n\nWhat's New on The Following Expansion DLC    NOTE: The Following DLC is meant to be for a player who has finished the main story. Because, on this expansion zombies are a lot harder to fight. Hence, I highly reccomended to take this DLC to experience new area that will transform your Dying Light experience through new game mechanics, environments and challenges on top of the established core of what made Dying Light a break away success for millions of players around the globe.\nNEW MAP | AS BIG AS DYING LIGHT  For the first time, you’ll go outside the quarantine zone only to get thrust into a hazardous outback overrun by the infected and populated by pockets of survivors who consider outsiders just as threating. Dying Light: The Following is choke full of new environments, characters, quests, and secrets to discover.\n\nDRIVABLE VEHICLES | YOUR DEADLIEST WEAPON YET  Break pursuits and travel through the quarantine like never before. All-terrain dirt buggies are going to be your key tool to survival and getting around this hazardous countryside. Level up your new Driver Rank skill tree and upgrade your ride to create your most deadly and effective weapon yet. Fully customizable with specialized weapons, attachments, decals and paint jobs, your buggy is going to be your one-way ticket to zombie smashing mayhem.\n\nNEW STORY | WHERE WILL THE OUTBREAK GO?  Players will again take the role of Kyle Crane, and will be thrown into Harran’s outback region, rife with the infected, where they’ll encounter a mysterious, and seemingly all-powerful cult, capable of changing the face of Dying Light’s world. To infiltrate and unravel dark secrets of The Following, Kyle Crane will need to face all-new challenges and use his abilities to the limit.\n\nNON-LINEAR PROGRESSION | TRUST IS SOMETHING YOU EARN  To get close to the cult and unravel their secrets, players will need to earn the trust of the locals. Through various missions and tasks, players will be able to choose their own path for infiltrating the inner circles of the cultists. As you earn more trust, you’ll be granted more imperative tasks along with access to dark cult secrets which will help unravel the mystery that has taken hold of this once serene land.\n\nVERDICT   Highly recommended 9/10","July 28, 2015","true","57.1"," 40 of 44 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","40","44","7","0"

Unfortunately you miss your landing and you find yourself stranded, should I say hanging on the side of a building wall. In any case you manage to cut the strings of your parachute and drop awkwardly onto the street, where your tourist guides welcome you with open arms.\n\nThis game has the essence of Dead Island and Mirror Edge combined with the in-depth character options from Far Cry 3 and 4. Levelling up skills and crafting well needed weapons and other items the likes of lock picks to Molotov cocktails, and if you feel a bit festive just light up some fire crackers!\n\nThe controls are very easy especially if you have already played games like Dead Island or Far Cry 4.\n\nIn terms of combat, it is well done and depending where you hit the zombies you might trigger the slow motion (very briefly). Scavenging Zombies will be one source of finding useful items. Plenty of cigarettes and bottles of alcohol; after all, it is party time in Zombieland!\n\nWhat I find the most thrilling so far is night time. You really have to sneak around and make sure you are not being seen, otherwise you are going to have to make a run for your life - jumping from building to building and running as fast as you can to avoid DYING!\n\nGood graphics as you would expect.\n\nOh, one thing I find quiet funny is when you launch the game. During the loading process you will get the following comment:\n\n“All characters and locations used in this game are fiction. Any resemblance to real persons and places is purely coincidental”\n\nI am just wondering how they know Bob, my local Zombie who runs our corner shop!\n\nNow to the frustrating part of the equation – I experienced a lot of crashes to my desktop. Actually every 20 minutes or so before I did the following:\n\n1)	Put my resolution down to 1920 X1200 (I am running a GTX 980)\n2)	Disable Nvidia control panel\n3)	Turn off Vertical Synchronization, Nvida HBAO+, and Motion Blur\n\nNow, it seems to run better but I do have the occasional crash. For $70, I did not expect this to be truly honest. And just for comparison, I can run Far Cry 4 on 3840 X 2160 with everything turn on without a problem.\n\nIt seems to me this game was rushed.\n\nPositves:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Great idea (combining Mirror Edge, Dead Island)\n-	Nice graphics (could be better in higher resolution)\n-	Co-op or single player\n-	Play the Zombie\n-	Good cut scenes\n-	Plenty to do\n-	Achievements\n-	Trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Frustrating crash issues\n\nLook, if you can make this game runs smoothly it is fun and I am happy to recommend it. But I am also happy to recommend waiting until the bugs are fixed or the price is lowered.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadviper/recommended/239140/","deadviper","Arman Ossi Loko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadviper/","252 products in account","Do you know that awesome feeling when a game surprises you? Me too. Some developers (like the Alien: Isolation developing team) have done their job successfully and made me enjoy every single moment of playing their game. That feeling, dear people, is one of the coolest ones you can find (especially if you didn't expect the game to be great).\n\nSurprisingly, Dying Light ended up as a good game. Actually, we can talk about it as a spiritual successor to Dead Island, a game that always looked like a not really interesting open-world version of Left 4 Dead. The truth is, Techland has added some parkour elements taken from Mirror's Edge to Dying Light.\n\nThen, I decided to give it a try, and, believe it or not, the game is a good combination of those Left 4 Dead, Mirror's Edge and Dead Island elements, but some games like Dark Souls as well. Dying Light is actually a first person survival horror game which mainly focuses on zombies and some "parkour moving" with a really great dynamic day-night "relationship".\n\nZombies are pretty slow, "stupid" and not really dangerous. Well, that's so when it's day only. When the night comes, well, you better run for your life because "zombie parkour" is around, and zombies, that can be stopped only with UV lights, are about to attack.\n\nThe funny thing is, it took me a while to survive the first night after trying to escape an attack for a couple of times. Later, I realized there are some "circles" on the mini-map which indicate the zombies and their view radius.\n\nYou'll be able to find some really cool and epic zombies, but only when it's night. As mentioned above, don't expect much "horror fun" at days. Though, don't underestimate them and make no noise or their brothers and sisters are gonna take you down.\n\nWhat I have to mention whenever I talk about Dying Light, is that parkour. All these things (like the epic zombies and the night fun) would be pointless if parkour was badly done. Luckily, in our case, it ain't. Parkour, in my personal opinion, is the best part of the game. You'll be able to jump from one place to another without much effort and it's rarely gonna happen that a small brick will prevent you from reaching the goal (like it can happen in Assassin's Creed).\n\nBeside the great game menu and the map, which has been developed nicely, the game features modding tools. Techland seems to like the idea of seeing community-made content for their game, which I have to give a big PLUS. The developer tools (a.k.a modding tools) are for now pretty poor with options and possibilities, but soon, I am sure they're gonna be much better.\n\nOverall, Dying Light is a great and fun game that you can play even online. However, there are some cons which definitely shouldn't have occurred. The story as well as all the characters don't make much sense and should have been re-done before the developing started. There are many quests that seem pretty uninspired to me. Boss fights, well, need an improvement as they look pretty ""boring"" for now.\n\nFrom my view point, this game is definitely worth a try. Go for it if you like zombies, night and parkour.","July 14, 2015","true","3.8"," 49 of 60 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","49","60","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967692485/recommended/239140/","76561197967692485","^___^","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967692485/","138 products in account","It seems to me that Dying Light has found some kind of sweet spot, striking an ideal balance between zombie shooters and the sea of open-world crafting/survival experience games, most of which remain stuck into Early Access territory.\n\nDying Light's world is open, but not randomly generated - the base game's main two areas are gigantic with an extremely high level of detail. Each area was carefully thought out and offers plenty to do and to discover. The sense of freedom is further reinforced by the excellent "parkour" system, which essentially allows you to climb pretty much anything that can be grabbed onto. I was surprised by how easy it was to get the hang of it, Techland has really made it as intuitive as one could wish for, and the scope of what the system allows you to do easily outweighs its (very) few minor flaws.\n\nDying Light has a crafting system, but not the kind that will have you punch trees and pick up rocks for hours to build a shelter: it is limited to weapon upgrades, healing supplies and various kinds of combat equipment: throwing stars, explosives, flares, firecrackers to distract the zombies, etc. The amount of different craft parts and blueprints to loot still leaves you with plenty to do, but remains limited compared to more hardocre crafting games.\n\nThe combat in Dying Light is primarily focused on melee, with a huge amount of different weapon types that can be upgraded in various ways. It's not easy to get the hang of it, especially early into the game when you don't do a lot of damage; but it becomes quite rewarding later on, when the skills you've unlocked give you access to a comprehensive set of moves: grapples, stuns, takedowns, "drop attacks", etc. It's all very satisfying to use, but the zombies will keep you honest and it remains easy to get overwhelmed.\n\nThe ranged options are somewhat less developed. You only get a bow and three gun types, with scarce ammo drops and no silencer. Clearly, in most situations you're not supposed to shoot your way through; the guns are loud and the noise only attracts more and more zombies. This part left me wanting, more gun types and the ability to craft silencers would've been very welcome.\n\nSometimes, though, Dying Light turns into a corridor FPS for story reasons. This brings us to the story, and it's clearly not where the game shines. Despite the promise of the initial setting, the way the story develops is far from convincing. All the characters are stereotypes, and the lead is the only one with some degree of depth. The pacing of the action has its moments, but then you'll go to bed counting the plot holes to fall asleep. The side quests are a mixed bag but several of them were quite fun to do, much like the parts of the main story that take place in the open areas; it's really the more linear sub-areas that break the flow of the game, as they restrict your freedom in how to attain the objectives.\n\nWhat Dying Light has really nailed is the atmosphere. You never leave the first person view, from start to finish, and everything is done so that you'll enjoy losing yourself into the vast confines of the city. The immersion is further reinforced by the fact that it's very easy to die, and you'll genuinely be fearing for your life. This is especially true when you're outside at night, as stronger zombie types come out of their nests and will relentlessly hunt down the player once detected. This makes surviving your first few nights outside a very unique and satisfying experience. Other games have a day/night cycle but this is surely the most convincing one I've seen.\n\nMultiplayer is a mixed bag too. Coop is functional, and can be great fun, but the game isn't really designed around specific coop mechanics, skill synergies and such. Public coop campaigns have limited appeal, but going through the game alongside up to three friends can be pretty nice. There is also PvP support in the form of a "Be the Zombie" mode which lets you "invade" other people's sessions as a special kind of zombie, the "Night Hunter". It's very cool once you get the hang of it, with interesting gameplay on both sides. You even have a specific skill tree as zombie!\n\n\nBottom line: the scope, the ambition, the atmosphere of Dying Light make it a milestone in the zombie genre. Definitely recommended for a good 30-50 hours of single player experience, possibly a lot more if you're a completionist and/or with the multiplayer modes. It will sometimes infuriate you, but also make you feel things few other games do.","April 22","true","120.7"," 44 of 53 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","44","53","0","3"

The movement is fluid and just works so well. The pace and speed are on point, and the combat is incredible. However, don't expect to enjoy this game much if your player is under level 7, the weapons are too weak, and it takes 10 hits to kill anything.

Although extremely similar to Dead Island, it’s a more perfected version of the zombie slashing series. I feel that the added parkour and dynamic day/night cycle is what gives Dying Light a unique edge not only from Dead Island, but from all games out there.\n\nDebuting the new Chrome Engine 6, I was seriously impressed with the graphical fidelity of the game. The various weather patterns, lighting, and the overall quality of effects (explosions, decapitation etc), made me feel like I was finally playing a next gen game. You can tell that the game was built around the fluid parkour movement system, but at the same time they managed to create a believable world with realistic design.\n\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Dying Light is how relevant I found the upgrade system. Every skill felt like it had meaning and wasn’t just there as an option. I found myself using almost all the skills in normal combat throughout the 50 hour or so campaign. Techland advertised a 50 hour campaign and I can safely agree with them. It took me 50 hours to complete every quest solo, and complete several random encounters, and challenges (not all of them though).\n\nAs great as I found this game, there were some balance issues for me. The night sequences are supposed to challenge you against faster zombies, but I found myself either avoiding or escaping them all too easily. Towards the end of the game I was straight up hunting them down. Repairing weapons uses metal parts which are ridiculously common. The grappling hook made free-running obsolete and made the night sequences even more trivial. Be The Zombie mode is just a glorified version of Left 4 Dead’s asymmetrical multiplayer. In other words, nothing special with little reason to play it over the standard co-op. This will appeal to some people, but it really didn’t seem special to me. The Old Town level should have been the modern metropolis setting we get to see in the distance from the Slums level. It felt like an entirely different country instead of being consistent with the Slums level.\n\nOverall, you are definitely getting your money’s worth with Dying Light. Despite those few issues, there is plenty to do and plenty to keep you playing for days to come.","February 22, 2015","true","92.8"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","37","44","2","1"

In fact it's so exactly like Dead Island it's almost indistinguishable, with the exception of the parkour. At night everything goes to hell and the difficulty gets ramped up. You can unlock safe zones to sleep in, there's lockpicking, all in all it comes off as sort of a Assassins Creed (parkouring around) meets Bioshock (the macho-jerk character and storyline) meets Dead Island (gather/quest/craft/kill zombies), while your character does dumb plot-related stuff that you probably won't agree with but can't really control.\n\nThere's a skill system with many branches to unlock, and your at-first clumsy character will soon be flipping over zombies like a pro.\n\nMy only gripe, aside from the storyline being on rails (which I don't personally care about because I'm more interested in gameplay, which is solid), is that you can kick a zombie 1000 times and your foot will never wear out, break, whatever. Hit a zombie with a metal pipe 10 times and it's broken, and if you don't quickly repair it, it'll soon break. Your foot, meanwhile, outlasts pipes, knives, table legs, shovels, you name it. If you're going to put weapon durability in a game (which I don't like; do you have any idea how freaking hard it is to break a metal baseball bat? Especially with bones?) then you need to extend it to everything, and fists should sprain, tendons pop, all that, and your foot would break long before a metal pipe. Because of this, until you upgrade your skills the endless kicking and punching can make your character come off like some kind of inexhuastable, but physically very weak, Bruce Lee.","January 27, 2015","true","54.9"," 117 of 178 people (66%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","66","117","178","38","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/239140/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","While Dying Light isn’t a sequel to Techland’s 2011 release of Dead Island, it ought to be. If Dead Island was a proof of concept, where Techland taught themselves that an open-world, first person, zombie survival RPG was possible and fun, Dying Light is maturity of said concept. Dying Light is an ambitious game, one that takes this core foundation from Dead Island, and adds flavor from across a number of genres for AAA gumbo. Ultimately, Dying Light is a surprisingly focused and well put together game compared to its predecessor, even if it borrows most of what it brings to the table. There’s a lot that is really good about Dying Light.\n\nIt’s got a lengthy single player story, drop-in drop-out cooperative play, and a versus mode that pits player controlled zombies and soldiers against one another in Techland’s dense open-world playground. Dying Light is a refreshing spin on the zombie apocalypse story that’s been told and told again in gaming. Like its predecessor it has a lot of systems in place: a day night cycle that introduces survival and stealth mechanics, a deep crafting and loot system for weapons and gear, and a multi-tiered progression system that allows players to grow as the plot unfolds. Oh, and it’s got an incredibly fun parkour system that allows you to easily traverse the zombie infested world.\n\nThere haven’t been too many risks taken with zombie apocalypse games in the past. Dead Island, the 2011 title which Techland also made, had a very distinct flavor though. It’s the clear foundation for Dying Light, though many changes have been made to that formula, and it has been expanded on greatly. Like Dead Island, Dying Light is still not a game that will have you mowing down hordes of infected zombies. It’s a game about survival and stamina management, not a power fantasy. It’s a game where you feel lucky to find or craft a powerful new weapon, items that you’ll use sparingly going forward to give you your best shot a surviving when you absolutely must fight.\n\nPlaying as the capable freelance operative Kyle Crane, you are sent in to the fictional locale of Harran on a secret mission to locate sensitive information about the outbreak. Once you touch down, you’re bitten, then brought into the fold by a group of do-good survivors. Crane answers to The Global Relief Effort who sent him to Harran, but the majority of the gameplay revolves around helping this faction who’ve taken him in, avoiding and surviving the sea of zombies, and fighting against a strong force of rebels led by a warlord in the zone. While Techland doesn’t necessarily break the mold with its storytelling, open world mission structure, or delivery of said missions, Dying Light is constantly challenging players to survive in this harsh environment.\n\nThe biggest tool in the player arsenal are the parkour abilities. They give the player an edge on both the zombie and human factions, by allowing quick movements and traversal across the environment. Crane can scale buildings and make death defying leaps all over the massive map, allowing him to get out of trouble quickly. And while there’s certainly many times that you will stand and engage in the brutal combat found in Dying Light, this versatility allows you to outrun just about anything…during the day.\n\nAt night on the other hand, Dying Light changes considerably. More dangerous varieties of zombies appear, and its best not to be seen at all by them. Vision cones that are frequently found in stealth games come into play, and if spotted by these “Volatiles” you’ll be in for a fight. Well, not much of one actually. If they catch you after being spotted, you’ll most certainly die. If you do escape, you’ll earn bonus points towards your survival progression tree. Harran is most dangerous at night. Missions are best taken during the day, but many quests will have you venturing out in the dark, or you’ll just find yourself trying to wrap up a quest as the sun sets.\n\nThe good news is there are ways to remedy the darkness. You can go to safehouses and sleep through the night, venturing out when your chances of survival are better. You can use light traps throughout the city, or a UV ray to get out of jams. Safezones are your best bet, but they need to be secured though, and you can do that at anytime by clearing them of any zombies beforehand. The day/night cycle is one the most interesting mechanics in Dying Light, keeping each day feeling fresh, keeping each night feeling dangerous.\n\nDying Light is an open-world game though. While there’s a rigid storyline to be followed, you can play it any way you like. You can hit one story mission after another, or you can wander around the city looking for loot if you choose, picking locks, and finding supply caches. You can track down and secure cargo drops before the rebel factions get their hands on them. There are a myriad of side quests to be taken on as well. There are random encounters, safezones to lock down, towers to climb, and collectibles to be uncovered. There’s plenty to keep you busy in Dying Light. You can do these activities on your own, or with other players if you choose to invite friends to your private game, or open your campaign to the public.\n\nThe more you do in Harran, the more you’ll uncover in Dying Light. The more missions you take on, the more chests you open, the more loot you’ll find, the better weapons and equipment you’ll be able to create. The deep crafting mechanics from Dead Island have carried over to Dying Light, though you don’t need pesky workbenches to perform them. There are a ton of melee weapons to discover, modify, and use. There are also quite a few guns to be procured Blueprints will allow you to make modified weapons that carry specific attributes like electricity or toxicity.\n\nNow if this sounds familiar, it’s because just about every open world game follows a similar structure these days. Dying Light does get it right though. It feels focused, accomplishments feel worthwhile and something that build towards becoming stronger and more capable. The attributes and skills that you earn give a strong sense of actual progression. Instead of a map littered with side quests and items to collect that bear no impact on the player or the game, Dying Light feels like everything has a purpose and reason for being there.\n\nThis is the sort of attention to detail that’s found throughout Dying Light. A great presentation, solid gameplay elements like the brutal combat, traversal and crafting. It's cohesive, and carries over perfectly to the online aspects of the game.  In fact, it’s all pretty seamless if you choose it to be. Opening your game up to the public will allow other survivors to join you, or invade your world as a zombie. All the aspects of the single player experience are accessible in cooperative play, you can choose to tackle story missions, side-quests, or just mess around. Occasionally, you’ll also be offered group challenges, which are mix of dynamically created content and quest relevant tasks. All the while, you’re still building towards your character progression.\n\nDying Light is one of those games that could have easily disappointed. You know the type of game. The one that has a laundry list of features, none of which really work all that well. One that has a lot of things that sound ambitious, but never really pan out. It could have been that game, but it isn’t. What it is, is a surprisingly well put together open-world survival game with a lot of moving parts, all of which add up to something pretty fun to play. It’s not going to blow your mind in terms of story, and the mission structure of the campaign is certainly familiar, but Dying Light has cohesion between its parts that make it enjoyable. The day night cycle, the deep crafting, parkour and brutal combat, Dying Light attempts to be all things to all people, and does a better job than most at it.","February 19","true","103.4"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","28","30","2","1"

The side missions were really plain, and the story wasn't the best.  Some of it felt really .. .Anti-Climatic.  1 Death shocked me, But the other one, it took so long to happen (for those who play, you probably know which one) you were trying to finish the climbing / jumping event just to get on with the story.

The graphics remind me of Dead Island, just lighter.  The issue was with the graphics is , when we got to the last 2-3 side missions, all the cut scenes seem to bug out, the person talking was lending on nothing or facing the wrong way.\n\nMy finale Rating:\n7.5/10\n\nWhy so High? well I do love games that are co-op the whole story (besides first mission, and last)\nIf you can find a friend(or 3) that will play the whole story with you, go for it!

It's the perfect mix of parkour/zombie killing. Techland has improved on the formula they created with their previous game Dead Island, in almost every way, and added features that will surely be a mainstay in open world zombie games in the future.\n\nI will start off talking about the parkour and combat. The parkour is a more streamlined version of free running seen in games like Mirror's Edge and Assassin's Creed. The amount of verticality and player control this gives you is essential in a game like this, were fast movement and even faster enemies are needed and prevelant. Ocasionally there are moments were the parkour doesn't work as it's intended (mostly due to the late game unlock of a grappling hook, which hooks onto anything regardless of if you can actually climb it) but overall it's a great system that really feels like it's the next natural step in the zombie survival genre.\n\nThe combat, while simpler than Dead Island's analog swing system, is still a visceral, engaging, and tactile combat system that almost gives you the feeling of overpowering your enemies but the balance of power can change at any minute due to the games stamina system, were swinging too much or running too hard will gas you and let the zombies get the upper hand. The gunplay, is the weakest side of the games combat system, the guns don't feel as good as they should, comparitive to the excellent melee system. and there are no upgrades or custom blueprints for them, unlike the melee system which has really interesting and often over the top upgrades for weapons. The guns feel like a bullet point on the box that were added to satisfy a small portion of people who need guns in their zombie games, they absolutely could be better, and more time could have been spent making them a more viable and fun option.\n\nThe story is nothing to write home about, it's typical bad guy/bad organization doing bad things while good guy has to stop them, the cast is sort of interesting, with some stand out characters, but most are typical character types seen in many games before. The side quests have some of the better story interactions and characters in the game, they sometimes go in a goofy or outlandish direction which is fun compared to the serious, sometimes overly so, story quests.\n\nOn closing, Dying Light deserves praise for how well it's gameplay systems work together to take the genre in the direction it was naturally going, by adding an excellent combat system with a neccessary parkour system. I look forward to playing whatever Techland does next with the series and I hope other games borrow the features of this game and use them in theirs.\n\nPros\n- Very nice visuals, the slums and city look real and gritty, and the gore is top notch\n- Parkour is well done and feels right\n- Combat feels more streamlined but still incredibly satisfying\n- Some fun side quests make up for lack luster main questline\n\nCons\n- Main questline isn't great, it feels very generic and predictable\n- Gunplay isn't as deep or as fun as it could be\n- Minor technical problems occur (most have been fixed but a few remain, like a bugged achievement remains, while performance and a couple stuck quests have been mostly fixed).\n\n9 out of 10","February 21, 2015","true","57.2"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","34","42","2","0"

Though the only good character and the one  with the only good voice acting is the main character who is voiced by Roger Crag Smith (Chris Redfield and Ezio Auditore). Although my biggest issue is that the story just feels very cliche at like every big action moment and they don't try anything creative. Also the antagonist was being way too serious that it became very annoying to listen to him... Clearly he wants to be a Vaas character but fails so bad.\n\nGameplay: Best part of this game is how much variety there is in the gameplay. This is a survival game and you have to search throughout the city for items to craft your weapons and other items. There is even a leveling up system for both your weapons, agility, and survival abilities to unlock more perks, best perk of all is the drop kick. You can find blueprints throughout the game to help make even more interesting weapons and add boosters to them more powerful. The parkour system may feel wierd at first when your doing the tutorial mission based around it, after a while it becomes very fluid and responsive that you can pull off some very cool moments with the parkour. Melee weapons do have the same animations over and over again but killing zombies with them just never gets old that you just want to go through multiple killing sprees of zombies. Gunplay is honestly only ment for human enemies since the sounds of the gunfire will draw in zombies but the weapons are very well designed for either situation. At night time the game turns into a horror game that you have to run away from certain zombies that will almost instantly kill you. Side missions are more interesting than the main missions and you will spend a lot of time with it. The only problem with the gameplay is at the beginning of the game you don't have the most powerful weapons so they just degrade fast and takes forever to kill zombies.\n\nConclusion: Dying Light is a very well made zombie survival game and should be played by every fan of these genres. The story isn't really something you will remember or you probably are gonna careless about but it still offers a thrilling experience. At the start of the game it may feel harsh on you for having weak weapons and stats but later on it pays off. If you have a group of friends to play with this game would be a good option since it is co-op and you can play through the whole story together.\n\nRating: 8/10","May 5","true","43.1"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","32","39","0","3"

During the day you are playing a game of "the street is lava," parkouring through the rooftops only making a quick dash onto the street to scavenge supplies or make a more direct path to your destination while avoiding zombies. Any interaction results in a fluid combat experience that only escalates as your character levels up.\n\nNight brings many more challenges as your visibility is sharply reduced and the abundance and difficulty of zombies exponentially increased. You will need to move much more slowly and avoid detection by the larger zombies which will trigger a chase if they spot you. If this happens, run, dont fight, just run to the nearest safe house.\n\nEarly on, focus on leveling up your agility class as running and avoiding zombie hordes is your main tool of survival.\n\nOverall the gameplay is fun, fast and fluid. Crafting is nice but can get repetitive with the same items being scattered all over the world.  Graphics look nice but can be enhanced by removing the grainy look through some script modification. The game is not too well optimized for PC at launch (mainly for AMD users) but turning down your draw distance can help combat some of those FPS jumps. If you have an Nvidia setup (like myself) you should be well off for a smoother gaming experience.\n\nOverall I give Dying Light a 8/10 mainly due to some repetitiveness in item scavenging and distortion of how under powered  you are early on compared to late game but it is definitely a title worth checking out.","January 28, 2015","true","71.1"," 46 of 63 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","46","63","2","0"

I loved the original game, me and my boyfriend are currently in a two person game.This is a normal difficulty game.  Currently we're still in the slums (back tracking for sidequests) We discovered first off, you run a TON faster, it's almost like you have a natural speed boost, just without the stamina boost to match. We've also discovered that if you're in different outfits your character moves slightly different when standing still. The Ninja has a tigher, smaller posture, like you're ready to bolt off the nearest building and end up 3 blocks away. The Urban Explorer makes you look angrier, darker and well... angry just fits his tone to the character.  (Yes, we're the kind of nerds to notice the random crap like this xD)\n\nAlso, GRAPHICS, HOLY CRAP GRAPHICS! It's smoother, cleaner, prettier, the weather system REALLY shows. you can see individual rain drops hitting the ground/buildings/assorted random objects, the wind is cleaner, very realistic, the wind rustling through the trees matches beautifully.  The runners have an upgraded programming that makes them more intelligent (to a degree in terms of where they can climb) and... they seem faster and more aggressive. Alright... tried night mode, and whoever is in charge really needs to evict the new neighbors... They're quiet rude. It's changed a bit, the night stalkers are faster, meaner, deal more damage, come in larger numbers, summon larger hoards of volatiles and have gotten uglier. Not to mention, they're much harder to kill... I got stupidly lucky and managed to kill one from the back with 2 shots from the Golden Double Barrel but that seemed to have been a fluke and it took 10 shots for the next one. You either find the sweet spot, or you run out of ammo trying to find it. Make sure you're stocked up on night vision boosters, not being able to see now can be a death sentence when before it was just a minor annoyance to accidentally fall off a building.\n\n\nThe merchants now have pictures of every item they have for sale, so if you're looking at buying a katana you can see what it looks like. The new guns, we've so far found a golden double barrel shotgun (2550 damage) that will happily take out small groups of zombies, only downside is it only has 2 shots per load, so it's a slower weapon but the damage and destruction it causes are so worth it. Just as a side note on the shotgun... When you get this weapon, find a group of like 20+ zombies and just start shooting into the crowd, the reload is so fast if you're far enough away (about 20 or so meters) none of them can get you and you turn the entire street into jelly. The gun my boyfriend got is the Advanced Military Rifle (274 damage) which is replacing his Camo Military Rifle (137 damage) he can't stop raving about the damage increase and how it seems more accurate from the hip while moving. The Golden German Pistol (331 damage) similar accuracy and handling to the original German pistol but with more damage and a bit more accurate. Reload is similar to the regular German Pistol. The Engraved Semi-Auto Shotgun (2550 damage) rapid fire compared to the Golden (8 shots vs. 2 for Golden) not as good as the Golden Double Barrel it seems as there's a definite accuracy difference between the Golden and Engraved, Engraved having a slower reload time. But overall the shotgun has had some MAJOR improvements and will definitely be used more than it was in the original game where you could be 2 meters away and still miss the zombie... The Advanced Police Rifle (368 damage) basically the sniper rifle for Dying Light (at least so far without testing the crossbow yet) watched my boyfriend pull off a ~75m headshot on a zombie. Two shots to kill a runner, the handling when sniping "is sweet" (his words haha) but if you've got something up in your face it's just like the old police rifle but with more damage, awkward and misses some times. So far, if you find a gold colored weapon, it'll most likely just become your new best friend.\n(Note: None of these weapons have been upgraded or adjusted in anyway via weapon upgrades)\n\n\n\nIt was a bit of a shock to see the bow AND arrows for sale at any shop when we still haven't completed BOZAK, but.... they still suck for damage, accuracy, fire rate... it's a nice novelty weapon but otherwise... meh.  Looking forward to finding the crossbow. As for the zombies, the overall intelligence and aggressiveness of them seems to have been overall increased, nothing too crazy like "oh-my-god-I-ran-into-a-group-of-5-or-more-zombies-and-died-instantly" more like their "eyesight" got better and the crowds are larger, a LOT larger....  Random note, discovered you can put dents in the roofs of cars, chop down stop signs, do basic vandalism and the like.","February 9","true","106.8"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","27","33","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/239140/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","After 45 hours of being a citizen of Harran and completing the story and all story-related sidequests I put my police baton and machete to rest for a while - only for the time of writing this review! This is due to the fact that 25% of the achievements still remain - I have yet to spend more time with multiplayer as well as completing the challenges Dying Light offers.\n\nIf you do not know what Dead Island is:\n\nDead Island was Techland's first zombie FPS title back in 2011. While Valve's Left 4 Dead franchise put down the basics of this genre Dead Island was certainly a great boost - if you think about it developer companies create their rip-offs left and right nowadays.\n\nDI featured an open world environment with lots of missions to complete, 4 protagonists to choose from, craftable / upgradable melee weapons and TONS of zombies. All set on a tropical environment where all hell broke loose once an unknown virus had been released.\n\nThe story mode could be played by up to 4 players and fighting the horde of walkers included some RPG elements - blueprints helped us modify our melee weapons (mainly adding elemental damage to every swing) and killing yielded us experience points; once a new level was attained we could pick from lots of skills - all divided up into 3 skill trees.\n\nThe game had a long story but with mediocre characters and pretty banal dialogues. Still, it was very good and the story continued in a stand-alone expansion called Dead Island Riptide.\n\nIf you know what Dead Island is:\n\nDying Light offers the ultimate Dead Island experience! We can finally do all kinds of parkour techniques and by doing so reach the top of just about every building. This is something I missed from Dead Island - I did figure out how to jump on to vans (from a car) but it was pretty annoying that no climbing was possible. Later in the story we receive a grappling hook that further eases the movement to the point where it is almost too easy to escape!\n\nHowever, Dying Light features some pretty nasty undead creatures called the Volatiles. They only appear at night and can almost outrun our hero - they run and climb very fast and spitting deadly acid towards us is also in their repertoire. So, don't think for one sec that climbing makes the game very easy - there are some challenging side missions that primarily focus on nighttime adventures. Of course, during nighttime we can barely see anything - our quick sense allows us to see the Volatiles even through walls.\n\nThe story: Finally, we have one! Our hero, Crane, works for a government agency that drops him into the quarantined zone to find out who stole some secret files from them. There are 2 groups of survivors waging war against one another and Crane is about to make friends with both of them. While co-op gameplay allows us to roam the world in groups of 4 everybody looks like Crane - there's just one hero this time but more decent writing went into the game so we finally have a crazy protagonist such a story deserves. Also, human enemies are also good at fighting with melee accessories so you'd better buckle up and prepare!\n\nGetting XP in a game has never felt better! Dying Light - similarly to its predecessor - gives us 3 skill trees. However, all 3 can be upgraded parallelly as depending on what we do yields us different types of XP. Completing missions helps us achieve a high Survivor level while fighting zombies increases our Power level. You are just running around climbing / sliding / using grapple hook but not really fighting anybody or doing a mission? Don't worry, your Agility is definitely getting better! The game dares you to play at night as not only are you stronger but gaining XP is doubled this time.\n\nGoodbye, workbenches! Yes, you read it right: crafting weapons is now done on the go. Of course, you still need to find a place where you are not bothered by walkers but there are numerous safe houses you can unlock - or you can just get to the rooftop of a very tall building. Also, there's no rage this time but getting closer and closer to the bottom of each skill tree makes you pretty strong without it. If you want the hardest challenge you can choose a higher difficulty level and pick nighttime for all the parkour challenges!\n\nOh, and there are no cars, either, but since the roads are littered with debris and crashed vehicles who would want to cruise the highways when you can just look around and see how beautiful the game is? Sound design is excellent and the lighting / water effects are pretty cool. Severing the limbs of the walkers was already present in Dead Island but now we can see some changes done to the torso of the victim. Character faces also look better and now there are more variations as there are many NPCs asking for favours.\n\nDying Light is an awesome game! Disposing the world of zombies is the most satisfying I have ever experienced in this genre! The clever fighting system, the on-the-go crafting feature and a fully realistic day-night cycle make this game a memorable experience. The story is also much, much better: not Oscar worthy but some scenes will make you remember.\n\nI look forward to Dying Light's expansion, The Following, and hopefully Techland will pick up Hellraid and finish it next year (or the also cancelled or indefinitely-put-on-hold Dead Island 2).","December 6, 2015","true","52.9"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","20","21","2","9"

Amusing to play, beautiful to look at, terrifying at night and sometimes even very addictive to live, the latest from the parts of Wroclaw is one of the best things that accompany the words "survival" and "horror" that can be found currently in circulation .

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chucklesnchestnuts/recommended/239140/","chucklesnchestnuts","chuckles n chestnuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chucklesnchestnuts/","81 products in account","Disclaimer: At the time of this review I have not yet beat this game but I am at about 80% completion\n\nDying Light is a seemingly well-put together game made by Techland (the same group that made the Dead Island Game(s)) which seems to have a lot of focus on the fine details of combat in a would-be zombie survival scenario (all of the different evade moves and the night time dangers for example).  And seems to pretty much be a different and improved upon version of Dead Island (albeit Dead Island is a different game and has a different gameplay feel and varied combat aspects from Dying Light).  Dying light, in my opinion, has a well thought-out focus on weapon-dealing damage systems as well as a functional and fairly easy to use inventory system (although I don’t like the fact you can’t reload your firearms in the safe zones so you can top off ammo but I digress).  The combat is fun and satisfying (I especially like the mortal kombat x like x-ray bone breaking crackly sound and visual effects when you hit enemies a certain way).  And the enemy reactions are what you would expect and were programmed very well in my opinion.  However some of the aspects I have noticed in Dying Light that I do not like are the facts that a lot of the other specialty weapons you obtain thru quest completions and upgrades seem very obsolete and awkward (for example the shield, yes I do like it, but I feel it has an extremely limited use in that it breaks too quickly).\n\nAlso some of the combat moves in the upgrade skill tree seem somewhat clunky and confusing; such as the turn and evade and grapple perks although I found some use in them, they seem to negate their effects in that when I try to grapple I often get hit in the process which is what grappling is supposed to do (which is stop the attack).  I also think that some of the throwables seem kind of obsolete in that in times when you need them they seem underpowered and by the time you get upgrades for certain throwables your weapons are already doing enough damage (and you have firearms as well) that your throwables become somewhat obsolete (however molotovs and explosives seem to be fairly effective across the board), however this is not to say throwables are completely of no use though and some players may find a need for them despite their seemingly underpowered aspect (and when I say throwables I am mainly talking about non-explosive/molotov throwabales/consumables).  Overall in regards to items I do like the diversity in what you can create and use to help you in your adventures across Harran(although sometimes the choices feel overwhelming at times).  And I really like how the firearms (especially the aspect on how ammo is acquired) are a nice improvement over Techland’s predecessor game Dead Island (but don’t get me wrong I still like Dead Island!).  And of course the parkour aspect of the game is very fun and immersive and very nicely done.  Overall I do recommend this game, but be warned, if you already have Dead Island or Dead Island Riptide this game may seem just like an upgrade so purchase it at your own will.\n\nBelow is my pro/con breakdown:\n\nPros:\n*Nicely done combat system that feels satisfying (them breaking bones/fracture/crackly sound effects when you hit enemies a certain way are a nice touch).\n\n* Good atmosphere that leaves you in a state of fear and on your toes most of the time (night/day differences in difficulty...literally and figuratively).\n\n*Good inventory system and overall layout for ease of use in regards to your HUD and upgrade capability (no more workbenches!  Some of you might get that reference).\n\n*Good graphics and nice touches and details here and there throughout the game (such as the little animations when you pick up items and search objects for items).\n\n*Well done and engaging cut scenes that add to immersion and overall storyline that are an improvement upon Techland’s previous title(s).\n\n*Diverse (but somewhat seemingly obsolete) choices in weapons and utility items for the player to utilize (this is both a pro and con).\n\n*Parkour in a zombie survival game (yes this is a pro on its own, and I think you will agree if you play it or even watch it being played).\n\n\nCons:\n-Somewhat clunky upgrades in terms of functionality and practical use (the grappling move and turn-around-and-evade upgrades seem kind of obsolete as well as other upgrades/perks at times).\n\n-Somewhat obsolete item craft/upgrade options that feel clunky and just of no use at times (this is somewhat optional depending upon playstyle but I felt it was worth noting as a ‘con’ due to all the options. Which there seems to be a lot of, not implying many options are bad though, but when you have so many and your current weapons do just find it seems somewhat obsolete as well as some of these consumable/throwables seem underpowered as mentioned in my description above).\n\n-Diverse (but somewhat seemingly obsolete) choices in weapons and utility items for the player to utilize (this is both a pro and con).\n\n-Some classical glitches that make a return from Techland’s previous titles (you either laugh at them, or hate them) glitchy ragdolls and zombies at times along with some other minor glitches here and there but it’s not really that bad to be honest but some people might be annoyed by them (personally I get a good laugh out of most of them).\n\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n-1 clunky upgrades\n-.5 items seem obsolete in comparison to other weapons\n-.5 too much choices aren’t necessarily a good thing at times and can be clunky if not implemented properly\n\n((out of 10 (10 – 2 = 8) = final rating of 8/10)\n\nI give this game an 8/10, it’s a pretty decent and very fresh experience (the parkouring REALLY helps make it the overall experience it is) IF you don’t own another game similar to it (like Dead Island).  In closing, I recommend it IF you don’t own another game similar to it, but if you do, I still think the game is a decent buy.","November 23, 2015","true","87.5"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","22","25","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/c4l4ey0/recommended/239140/","c4l4ey0","C ~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/c4l4ey0/","54 products in account","Zombies and Parkour. One of the best new matchups I've seen in a game. When I first heard about Dying Light over a year ago, not only was I excited at the gameplay but also the possibilities and potential that this game has.  Now with it being finally released I was hoping to see that the game promised on what it would deliver... and it really did.\n\nYou can definitely see the Devs inspiration throughout the game, taking focus from Left for Dead, Far Cry and (obviously) Dead Island. Personally I could not believe the difference that this game gave me within the first few hours to the rest. To start off with I felt a bit.... A bit like I wanted to run before I could jump (in terms of Parkour) I didn't have the moves and it would take me forever to run around and scale across buildings. I was slow, low on energy and useless with weapons. It would take me from anywhere between 6-10 hits to kill a zombie, going through my stamina bar twice before eventually dislodging the undead brain. Towards the start of the game I was dreading that this was what the game was like - but further on when you learn the ranking system and start to level up and earn points to redeem skill.... it is like a completely different game. It is absolutely fantastic and a breath of fresh air for anyone that wanted to experience the zombie gamestyle again but with a different slant.\n\nCharacter progression is excellent in the game, and im happy to say that I was fairly pleased with the way that the story went - but more so impressed with the optional missions/side quests in the game, for me this is where the game shines. Very interesting and a diverse range of different challenges await. Alongside all these positivities are some negatives - noticeably the fact that in Harran you will see a certain head model put on 25% of the people throughout the game (you all know who Im talking about!) and the fact that some parts to the story are extremely predictable and a bit tedious.\n\nDying Light is gorgeous, there are many moments where you just want to stop what you are doing and appreciate the environment - the sun rays, the shadows, the change of weather... it really is nice. Just make sure to check your back before you do though as Harran is littered with the undead! Before game patches came out I had to manually edit the files to Dying Light to remove parts that I didn't like, the film grain being my main gripe. Now though its nice to see the Devs listening to the community and seeing what they want - now there is an option to remove film grain in game settings.\n\nMelee, dismemberment, blood, screams, satisfying? More than ever before. The first few hours of the game I felt like a fat slob that had never attempted to swing for anyone in his life, shortly afterwards through level progression I was becoming more and more the ultimate ninja warrior that I knew I could be one day! Delicately carving up zombies with a variety of highly modified & rare weapons. Maybe use my electrified sledgehammer to take out the knee caps? then move to my Korek Machete to aggressively perform facial deconstruction? Sure why not. Through a variety of weapons and equipment there always seems to be fun around every corner in this game.\n\nSo much more to talk about but I tend to leave my reviews at a similar level of depth, the last thing I wanted to mention was that Co-op with this game is an absolute blast and I would recommend all newcomers to give this option a go. The availability of drop in drop out with up to 4 people makes it really easy too. You can simply toggle your game to "Public" and within moments  you will see people looking for games and coming in to join your fight.\n\nOverall, really pleased with how this game has started and its provided me with so many hours of entertainment. I am looking forward to DLC to continue my Dying Light experience. Its rare to find a game that can mix different genre's so successfully but through this combination of horror and action, Dying Light is a solid recommendation from me and a great base for future games in the series.\n","February 19, 2015","true","95.2"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","26","32","3","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197985584715/recommended/239140/","76561197985584715","Siruss","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197985584715/","225 products in account","Probably the first game in at least a year that actually warrents a $60 price tag.\nThe game is COMPLETE. It has an entertaining story, with developed characters, and pretty decent amount of depth for the main story. There is emotions all over the place. Anger, humor, pity... It also progresses at a good pace. The challenges of starting, mid game, and end game are perfect. Harder zombies are introduced as you go along at just the right pace.\nFor the most part the controls feel pretty natural. However at times (when zombies lunge forward, or when you are dropping on them from above, or trying to exexcute a "finish") they can be a tad clunky, leaving you unsure when you were supposed to time the button press or where you were supposed to aim.. One time it may work, but not the next.\nI'm not a big fan of climbing around. The early A.C. games were fun because it was innovative, but once it became manditory and forced, I didn't enjoy it anymore. This game has just the right amount of forcing you to climb and "platform" around. Enough variety that it is different, but not annoying. Also not annoying is the respawns. Once you go through an area, it is pretty safe. Although there is freeclimbing to pretty easily avoid the zeds, once you clear an area it is pretty safe for the remainder of the game. Some stragglers but you really feel like to accomplished something after a big fight.\nThe weapons have some variety, and you can build a bit towards how you'd like to play with your weapons. I find the elemental additions to be a little more desired. 90% of the fighting is vs zombies, so some elements are pointless, and when you kill them you have to wait for the element to run its course before looting the body, or you will take damage. After the 1000th zombie, that's annoying.\nIt has a bit of Farcry, mixed with a bit of Fallout, and Dead Island (from this studio).\nI love the "Survivor Sense". It's a small area radar that shows you things to interact with. Really nice mechanic so you aren't running around trying to loot things you already looted, or trying to find the right spot to open the trunk. It's one of those elements that makes the game run more efficient. Not hold your hand, but cut down on time wasting.\nOverall, I love the game. I honestly can't think of anything that I really DISLIKE about the game, but I do have some improvements that I'd like to see.\n1) The main characters have very unique faces. However everyone else in the game is very generic. I've seen this one character's face about 10 times (he looks like my friend so I notice). Also the zed models are the same way. Maybe 5 unique models for the most common zeds, and then 1 model for each specialty zed. All in all you're killing less than 10 models of zombie the entire game.\n2) Sometimes the zombies feel hard to distract. It's like only 10 can focus on something at a time, and the rest just stand there. When using a firecracker, I'd expect every zombie from sidewalk to sidewalk to come to it.\n3) The "runner" zombies can get annoying. These are the ones that can climb and chase you, and come when there is a loud noise. I like them to keep you on your toes, but sometimes they just keep coming, one by one by one seemingly forever. I just fought a pack, and I want to grab the loot and move on, but the runners keep on coming.\n4) I spent the last 8 hours doing side quests. Although I got some skills from levels, the money/weapons seems to just scale. So it's all relative. Theoretically you could beat the game with the same ease at lvl 5 as lvl 30. I guess the point is just seeing the content.\n5) I wish it wasn't such a linear story. I had hoped there would be at least 1 decision to make that would make a difference. It also wouldn't hurt to maybe have some factions or relations of some sort. No decisions, no factions, and just freerunning around doing random stuff is not as fun as other "open world/sandbox" games.\n6) Multiplayer... Coop is okay.. But the "hunter" thing, just a huge annoyance. My first night in the game, someone dropped in and we did the Vs. thing. He was actually a kind player and told me how to fight him. It was a decent fight, but I wanted to get back to my game. Before I could turn it off, ANOTHER player jumped in. Fought again. Then ANOTHER.. By that time I said screw it and just left the game. That's just insane.. The reward is minimal and the annoyance is through the roof.. Probably the only truely BAD thing I can say about the game.\n\nIn conclusion, I'd like to say that this game has the polish of a real quality 2nd game of a franchise. Most times I see the first installment of a series and the best I can say is "it has a bright future", but this game is great RIGHT NOW AS IS. The next installment can just expand on this game, not worry about going back and fixing things.","January 28, 2015","true","20.7"," 35 of 48 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","35","48","6","0"

With surprising plots and twists that really keeps it interesting. This could however could also be down to random encounters (such as airdrops) that can turn a lazy stroll down the street to a gazelle race through the city or hide and seek that will have you scurrying around on all fours while waiting for whatever is hunting you to turn their backs.\n\nThe main Zombies “biters” are little better then a nuisance if you are paying attention, the only time I have had real issues is when I ran smack into a hoard while being chased by “virals” which are infected living that can give you a run for your money, very 28 days later like. That and there are a lot spoiler zombies that will have you worried (Volatile) when the sun goes down.\n\nHad a very “Fun” moment where 2 people had joined my game just as it was getting Dark, we were pretty much playing Sandbox. Running around and bullying the “biters” laughing and comparing different ways of killing them and the few “virals” that interrupted us. (Coop makes it a lot easier as you can gang up on more powerful zombies and watch each other’s backs)\n\nThis changed big-time however as the sun went down, we went from hunting to being hunted real fast. Trying to keep it together as a group when a hoard of virals are hot on your heals is both terrifying and hilarious at the same time, we ended up chased into an apartment complex which turned out to be a dead end. But thanks to great teamwork we actually held out till morning by holding a small apartment with one entrance, one person would heal and repair his weapons while lending an occasional kick while the two others held the Volatiles at bay with UV lights and everything from leg furniture to screwdrivers and wrenches.\n\nMost heart racing experience I have had in gaming for a very long-time, our elation at surviving however went south when we realised the battered and retreating Volatiles had been replaced by a hoard of zombies “biters” that swarmed the building we were in. Seeing your team being dragged down one at the time by a wall of dead flesh, before being pulled out of your corner and devoured was surprisingly enjoyable.\n\nOnly real thing I can put my finger on is optimization, the game doesn’t seem to be 100% optimized and if you have AMD graphic card you might encounter some FPS drops that shouldn’t happen. Hopefully this will be addressed in patches.\nIf not a 10/10 then defiantly a 9/10","January 28, 2015","true","28.2"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","25","33","5","5"

You need to reboot the grid before a select group of superhuman zombies who can only be described as nightmare fuel emerge from their hidey holes and rip off your ♥♥♥♥ing face like a swarm of zombie locusts.  You flip the switch and the screen completely locks up but the sound keeps going....whats going on? you hear a loud bursting of a door or a wall and what sounds like a boss monster.  You dont see any of that though because the screen is still fixated on the electric box.  Suddenly the game jumps to life and you see a zombie with a Rebar sledgehammer much like in Fallout swinging wildly towards you,  You have to kill this giant grizzly beast of a man on a time limit with the added benefit of him slamming down his sledge to attract more zombies. The only thing is that the game will periodically freeze frame while the game will play in the background.\n\nThats right folks you will be in the middle of fighting a horde of zombies, be near a environmental hazard you dont want to stand in or jumping from rooftop to rooftop like a ghetto Batman and the game will say "This looks like far too much fun for you to handle, let me just go ahead and kill you" and lock up.  This is a debilitating, crippling, game killing bug that needs to be sorted out immediately for the game to even be playable.\n\n\nBesides that fact the game is incredibly fun to play and makes a effort to build the world and make it halfway believable and not weighing you down or forcing you through the story like Call of Dookie or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game adaption of the movie Red Dawn, Homefront.  A lot of the models, textures, and game mechanics from Dead Island are copy pasted into the game but it doesnt take away from Dying Lights right to have its own name.  Aside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t bug this game can stand on its own and not pay any mind to the people who say its just Dead Island 1.5.\n\nI would put this game as a must buy for anybody who is a loot ♥♥♥♥♥, people who like sandbox games, or light RPG / combat mechanics.  I would sugguest that you just wait for the patch to get rid of the terrible awful frame rate drops before you pick it up so you wont rage quit after the game decides to freeze beside a soon-to-be exploding vehicle.

Ill get back to that later but lets talk about what I liked cause the dislikes are very few, but also very strong.\nPros\n\n1: The combat is fun for me. it was like they took dead island and revamped the combat in a way where the zombies are really dangerous in a crowd, human opponents are able to block and dodge fairly well, the special infefected need to be aproached carefully at first. the combat has weight, it feels like you are doing the damage proportial to you swing......later. at first you are a wimp, but you feel a little over powered by the end but i was still having fun chopping up zambies in crazy ways.\n\n2:The parkour kicks ♥♥♥. oh man, i love running around in this game and just seeig how far i could push it. when you get the grappling hook and roll ability, it feels like you can just jump from anything and never stop moving add this with the previously mentioned combat and its just fantastic.\n\n3: the night gamestyle was alot different from the day for me (obviously). the day night mechanic is pretty cool, and they pace the change between the two well. struggling to get a mission done before the night hits is alwayas tense from me and trying to navigate through the night for certain missions was also pretty scurry at times.\n\n4:multiplayer is just fun, but then again almost any game can be fun with friends.\n\n5:Fun upgrades- it seems like the upgrades really made you feel like you werent grinding for them, they came often and brought with them a slew of new abilities that realy spice up gameplay as well.\n\nCons\n\nCertain missions\n\nWhat do i mean? well lets start with somethign i HATE in games where you can level up and earn new abilities: Forced  downgrades for missions. I was just praising the grappling hook earlier cause it is a fun and cool item. so why would you take it away in some missions. I understand you wanna make it harder, but making a game harder by not also considering the upgrades in the added difficulty (cause if it was designed right the hook wouldnt matter) is lame. why would you give me some cool stuff to be like "Oh you cant use it here cause youre tired. but not so tired that you cant pull yourself up multiple times with your upper body and core body strength, cause thats not more tiring that firing a retractable hook." just saying guys. dont make me spider man then gimp me when it matters\n\nsecond: QTE. what the hell man? I loved the combat in this game so why ruin it by making the last boss a qte event? there was no other qte event in the whole game that i can remember correct me if im wrong  and not to hop on the ubisoft hatewagon, but why would you follow that lazy method? especially when you had a great little combat system already set up?  it boggles my mind.\n\nall in all the game is fun, double so when you have some friends together. despite my hate, and its a deep deep hate, for those two things, the game itself is really enjoyable.

However, some new DLC being released got me to boot it up for the first time. I wasn't sure what to expect but had read about free running being used that I had probably only seen before in Titanfall and Mirror's Edge. This actually goes great in a zombie game when sometimes you just want to get passed and complete a quest.\n\nThe weapons are very much like in Dead Island and you can craft and upgrade them. They all have limited uses so you can't get one powerful weapon and use it for the whole game. To help you there are guns, molotovs, bows and arrows and traps etc. You will also get upgrades for your toon to allow them to free run, fight and use resources more efficiently.\n\nYou can jump into other players games or get them to join you. At night things get a lot more hectic with the ability of player invasions starting a mini-game (if activated) where they are the infected and you have to destroy nests. You will need to rely on your UV light to survive, and probbaly one or two allies.\n\nThe story will keep you interested enough, and the various sub-quests will have you running around and interacting with various NPCs.

The combat system variety depends on skills that you gather by fighting through zombies, which is important depending on a players style when dealing with a enemy.\n\n+ Massive arsenal of weapons, from knifes to machetes, from machetes to axes, from axes to swords, from swords to King Arthur's meme sword.\n\n- During my runs through the Slums, I have encountered some texture bugs where I could see through the building. It wasn't much of a deal but still deserves to be pointed out.\n\n+ Developers have updated the game with free content during the year.\n\n- Some DLC's are either weird or to much of a challenge for the community.\n\n+ Expansion pack is coming out in case you think the game needs more.\n\n+ A pretty big map, fully lootable, including lockpicking, hidden caches, and puzzles.\n\n- Overpowered enemies at some stages.\n\n+ Easy crafting system, not much materials like in Dead Island. You get a blueprint and there's a chance you alredy have everything to craft it.\n\n+ Great fun in co-op after the "Be the Zombie" expansion.\n\n+Really good story\n\n- FPS drops at some points, but doesn't affect gameplay much.\n\n- Toxic community\n\nOverall:\n\nDying Light is a very good horror/survival game with a enormous size which promises a great succes for the developers to keep bringing new content to such a terrific game.\n\nFinal rating:\nDespite the FPS drops and some other not quite game breaking points I would rate DL\n9.25/10","December 30, 2015","true","32.8"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","12","13","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beeserker/recommended/239140/","Beeserker","BEEEEEES","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Beeserker/","145 products in account","Can be an enjoyable game, but not worth 60$ with all these problems.\n\nParkour control is inconsistent to the point of insanity:\n-You can grab one ledge but not another identical ledge in a different location.\n-You can catch yourself from a 3 story fall on a ledge with your arms, but you can't walk up a tiny slope on certain natural terrain, rooftops, or tents.\n-No way to hang down from a ledge, which would be extremely useful for getting into many entrances, windows, and porches that have overhangs.\n-Climbing down has unacceptably horrendous control. You must hit back ('S' by default) to initiate dropping down to a ledge below you - BUT you have a tiny window of opportunity to hit forward ('W' by default) to grab the hand-hold you are trying to drop down to. If you hold the forward key just a little too long, you'll grab the ledge then immediately climb back up. If you hit it too late, you'll fall to your death. It's hard to explain how profoundly stupid the controls are for climbing down - and you will need to climb down from deadly heights many times throughout the game. Get ready to plummet to your death thanks to ♥♥♥♥-poor controls.\n-Parkour interactions with the environment in general are extremely hit or miss. Vaulting over low objects frequently plays the vault animation, but you don't actually vault over the obstacle. Sometimes you grab onto things, sometimes you don't. Just about the only thing that is consistent is leaping up to grab the top of level high walls.\n-Despite being an inconsistent, frustrating cluster♥♥♥♥, parkour is required throughout the entire game.\n\nInvisible walls with areas beyond that look like you should be able to reach them.\n\nInteractable locked doors everywhere! Who doesn't enjoy a good un-cancel-able animation where you character pushes futilely against a stuck door! They even have an indicator on them when you scan the environment with 'survivor sense' for interactable objects.\n\nTons of film grain, visual blur, stuff that gets on your face and obscures your view with no way to shake or wipe it off - I mean these things hurt my eyes, AND THERE IS NO WAY TO TURN THEM OFF. Why developers? WHY! Why would you do this!?\n\nTHE FINAL BOSS IS A QUICKTIME EVENT.\n\n"You are arbitrarily too exhausted to use that Grappling Hook skill you invested so much time in getting" claims the screen as you sprint through a stage leaping, vauling, and leaping up hand-holds. Developers - that's laziest, most arbitrary, stupid thing I've seen in a while. I spent a long time to unlock that awesome skill and you just arbitrarily lock it in a situation where it would have been extremely useful to get around a tedious situation.\n\nHit a zombie 20 times, your sword is broken. Oops, you can only repair this sword 2 times - hope you find something else you like to replace this one you lovingly crafted with the modifier you gathered materials for. I'm not even joking here. I get that the developers wanted you to keep on scavenging and I don't have a problem with that - but this is the most arbitrary, stupid way anyone could have come up with to create survival gameplay.\n\nAll vendors sell everything for stratospheric prices, but stuff you sell nets a tiny pittance of is actual value. Like, selling something worth 20k might get you 2k - IF YOU HAVE THE PERK THAT IMPROVES YOUR SELL VALUE. Rediculous. Combine this with the fact that weapons wear out at a completely unreasonable rate and you are constantly playing inventory Jenga.\n\nYou can carry infinity + 2 wires, alchohol bottles, tin cans, nails, weapon mods, plants... but you can carry 4 ANYTHING ELSE at the start of the game. Even with all the capacity perks unlocked, it's not nearly enough space for weapons and equipment. Pretty typical for the extreme inconsistency on display here.\n\nNo map markers for the posters used to fast travel between the two maps. If you didn't play Dead Island, read a wiki, or just plain got lucky enough to notice this feature, you'd have no idea it even existed.\n\nExact same enemies as Dead Island.\n\nThere's a particular zipline over by the bridge that the devs put too low near some rocks, so you will be knocked off and probably fall to your death if you try to use that zipline.\n\nAll the human enemies have superhuman reflexes and will deflect 99% of any weapons thrown at them with their tiny pocket knife or whatever they happen to be wielding. I really am not kidding or being dramatic here. Don't even try to use throwing weapons against human enemies, it really is pointless! Note that you have to CRAFT these throwing weapons, and there is no way to recover them once you throw them. What the hell devs?\n\nHuman enemies are immune to damage while playing their 'duck to the side' animation. It doesn't matter if you are pounding your sledgehammer visibly into their nutsack - nothing happens because they are 'dodging'.\n\nHuman enemies are inexplicably TOUGHER THAN ZOMBIES. LIVING HUMAN ENEMIES CAN TAKE MORE AXES TO THE FACE THAN A ZOMBIE.\n\nHuman enemies are inexplicably immune to stun, and the descriptions on skills that are supposed to stun things don't make any mention of this at all.\n\nDecide you don't actually want to throw that item? Too bad, there's no way to cancel once you've wound up for the throw.\n\nGrappling sounds like a really cool perk, but activating it without taking damage is extremely inconsistent - like pretty much every other mechanic in this game. Sometimes you'll take damage, sometimes you won't, sometimes they'll just grab you anyways. Oh and by the way, you can't just grapple an enemy whenever you want, they have to be charging at you, attacking you (you may or may not take damage trying to grapple mid-attack - who knows!), or whenever the hell else the game randomly decides its going to allow you to grapple something. You have extremely poor control over where you fling zombies with a grapple, so it is often difficult to hurl them into environmental hazards like spikes - which is the only point of Grappling in the first place.\n\nAll guns have this bizarre 1-2 second pause before you can fire again anytime you get hit or after you reload. Hey guess what? There are extremely time-limited events where you have to use a gun - and all those un-cancelable 'pauses' add up fast.\n\nFor a main character that can manage such superhuman feats as scaling the side of a 10 story building by grabbing windowsills and literally throwing himself up to the next hand-hold or hanging for eternity from a ledge without ever tiring out - your character inexplicably gets out of breath by swinging a lead pipe a few times. You run out of combat stamina rediculously fast in this game. Two-handed weapons are practically unusable for this reason until you get very, very far into the combat skill tree.\n\nLots of unskippable cutscenes, dialog, segments where your character is having seizures and moves at a snail's pace (think gears of war radio conversations).\n\nImmediately after vaulting off an enemy, your view is locked to horizon-level, so you can't look down to see where you are going to land. This is extremely annoying, as one of the more useful features of vaulting is that you can land on enemies to knock them down, and the 2-handed weapon mid-air smash requires a certain amount of fall time so you need to not be over an enemy as you're trying to activate them or you won't fall far enough to activate the skill.\n\nThere are multiple areas that infinitely spawn zombies all around you out of thin air, right in front of your eyes. You literally see them pop into existence.\n\nThe visual effect of 'Survivor Sense' is pretty annoying + there's no way to turn it off + you will be using it A LOT.\n\nLots of cutscenes where the big villain is right in front of you, you have a weapon (possibly a gun) right in your hands...and you are forced to stand there like a stump in a cutscene while he monologues at you.\n\nLots more, but I'm out of characters.","February 2, 2015","false","57.9"," 681 of 1,237 people (55%) found this review helpful 107 people found this review funny","55","681","1","107","85"

It has free running and parkour similar to Mirror's Edge but with an actual game built around it. The combat and free running mechanics though are probably the most interesting part of the game, and have good progression along the skill tree, unlocking many new abilities, increasing your characters stamina and power.\n\nThe story has you play Kyle Crane, a freelance agent working for the GRE sent into the quarantine zone to identify a target and retrieve some intel but things go wrong and you become infected. Inevitably things begin to spiral out of control from that point and even though you try to play the hero everyone around you dies. The story is somewhat cliche and bland to a point, but the atmosphere and some of the side missions and characters you meet will more than make up for it. Overall the game has around 40 hours of content including random encounters, side missions, the campaign and hidden zones and areas.\n\nDying Light also plays host to many different types of enemies of which the truly tough and scary enemies only make an appearance at night and they will initially be far too much for you to handle but gradually as you level venturing out at night will become less of a harrowing experience.\n\nI definitely recommend checking this game out when you get the chance.","February 10, 2015","true","76.0"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","24","36","0","0"

Dying Light soon changed that expectation as I was jumping from rooftop to rooftop, electric shiv in hand, being chased by a group of particularly nasty Virals.\n\nGameplay wise, the addition of Parkour to what is fast becoming a stale theme adds a whole new dynamic, and against some of the nasties you come up against you're going to need it. It's entirely possible to stealth past hordes of the undead, only picking off the odd one or two who are blocking your goal, or even luring them away using the ingame crafting system.\nThe skill system adds a good amount of character progression and customization, offering three different trees which all level up individually.\nThe melee combat has a nice flow to it, transitioning from swipes and swings to crushing downwards blows, and each weapon has it's own handling style. Whether a sturdy length of pipe or a chunk of concrete and rebar pried from one of Harran's larger undead beasties, the results are satisfying, with all the right gruesome in all the right places.\n\nGraphically, everything set to high is netting me a Frame Rate of around 55 FPS, which, reading some of the other views is not as common as everyone would like, hopefully this will be rectified in a future patch. I generally expect a lower quality in open world games due to the amount going on at once, but I was truely surprised by what I was met with. Highly detailed environments and some great character design, though finding 5/7 zombies in a small pack all wearing the same shirt is a little strange, we'll just pin it down to a local football match and carry on shall we?\n\nIf I had any major gripes so far, they'd probably be focused around the co-op aspects. It's mentioned there are 7 runners left, so why do we all play as the main character from the Single Player campaign?\nI've had some noticable issues around the cutscenes while playing with friends too, occasionally one of them will jump a few lines ahead of the dialogue from the NPC, causing the cutscene to end early and leave others wondering what happened. Hopefully things like this could be straightened out in the future, they're certainly not game breaking, but can detract from the experience.\n\nOverall, I've been pleasantly surprised by Techland's latest entry to their zombie stab-em-up, and look forward to playing it more when I don't have to be in work in a few hours. With a few patches and a tidy up here and there, it looks like we could be off to an amazing start to 2015.\n\n\n","January 27, 2015","true","18.7"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","25","38","5","0"

Active developers still producing new free content months after release.\n\nCons: Shorter story line than Dead Island 1 (similar or maybe more than DI: Riptide though). fair percentage of people had hardware / FPS issues when game was first released but due to new patchs this should not be an issue anymore unless your hardware doesnt meet minimum/recommend specs in the first place.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supafastsc/recommended/239140/","supafastsc","Mr Breeze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supafastsc/","607 products in account","I've been playing survival horror since before Resident Evil and have played everything from that to Killing Floor, to Left 4 Dead, to Outlast, and more.  That said, there's rarely a game that is unique and fresh enough to really catch my interest for more than a few hours at a time.  This game fortunately is one of them!\n\nI am about 78% through my first play through and this game is amazing.  It comes as no surprise that there's some heavy Dead Island influence here which is easily explained away by reading that some of the devs from it helped produce this title.  In a nutshell it's Dead Island mixed with Mirror's Edge.  Parkour fighting in a fairly large open world.  I say that because it's not extensive like games like Stalker or other free roaming games, but the indivudual worlds and sub maps inside the city of Harran are big enough that the game doesn't get stale.  And yet the map is small enough that treking through it isn't tedious without some sort of fast travel system (which is not present in this game).  Edit there is one fast travel station but it only takes you back and forth from the first main map to the second.  You basically progress through the missions and side missions which are tied to an excellent story and decent character acting.\n\nAs you go along the way you can find or buy weapons which have a limited life but can be repaired a few times.  You can craft new weapons and upgrade existing weapons making them stronger, more durable, and easier to handle/swing as well as applying elemental effects that do even more bonus damage.  The weapon upgrade system seems like it progresses in good timing with the story as your progress.  You also gain the ability to use the items you find and upgrade and craft even newer more powerful and useful items.  This game relies heavily on scavenging as building upgrades for your weapons as well as crafting items are needed to perform the said crafting.   You use "survivor sense" to detect when you're near items you can acquire.  And the sense is color coded to the items as well.  So it's important especially in the beginning to search everything your survivor sense finds.  Oh and just like in Borderlands weapons are also color coded by damage/level and once again, Gold seems to be the top level weapon with White/Gray at the bottom with Green, Blue, and Violet levels in ascending order.  Naturally as you progress you'll find weapons in a higher color class do less damage so those of you who enjoyed the 2K weapon system in Borderlands will feel right at home.\n\nYou have 3 main skill trees each with their own experience points which is a nice change from one XP tree.  These will be your tools for survival and make you better at staying alive and more effective at killing zombies.\n\nSURVIVOR - A skill tree that you use to unlock abilities to craft new items, get an edge on traders for better deals, improve your abilities of searching and detecting items, as well as tricks for staying alive like camouflaging in zombie guts to avoid detection.  The final ability in the tree allows you to use all you've learner more effectively at level 25.\n\nAGILITY - A skill tree based on speed and well... agility.  Unlocking items in this skill tree will give you new abilities and techniques to run, jump, scale building, and improve your hand to hand fighting technique against zombies, as well as give you escape tactics when cornered.  This is all the Parkour aspect of the game where you basically learn to leap and bound from building to building effortlessly stepping on the heads of zombies, and grappling them and throwing them aside.  The final ability in the tree for level 24 is that you won't get tired from running or jumping.\n\nPOWER - This is the tree I focused on first.  while still gaining points on the other skill trees.  Unlocking items in this skill tree gives you the ability to kill more effectively and efficiently by giving you stronger attacks and unlocking new attack and kill methods.  One of the most critical skills here is the ability to kill a zombie when it's down.  In the beginning this was a life saver so I didn't ruin all my weapons.  After a while though you do get strong enough that you'll be able to take down clusters of zombies with a strong weapon.  The final ability in the power tree gives you the ability to swing your weapon and fight without getting tired.  This was the biggest deal for me so I can swing my weapon over and over when surrounded.\n\nI've put almost 60 hours into this game and it's a tremendously good amount of fun.  And even moreso if you do a couple missions or play the whole game in Co-Op mode with 2-3 freinds.  If the game seems a bit easy once you get leveled up there's a hard mode.  The DLC challenges are fun for a pass or two but not necessary to enjoy the game.  I loved the go anywhere and climb anything aspect of the game but have to say although the power challenges weren't too bad, I didn't enjoy the Parkour challenges as much as I do love freerunning in other games (because in real life I would just end up hurting myself LOL).\n\nI believe this game is one of those titles that earns the full pricetag, but if you can get a deal all the more reason to pick it up and enjoy!","July 19, 2015","true","99.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","1"

It's exactly as it seems from the trailers: a mix of Dead Island and Mirror's Edge. You'll spend most of your time running from rooftops to tiny ledges, gliding on ropes, smashing doors and butchering a million zombies. The game is VERY fun and exciting, you'll be surprised at how long the adrenaline can be effective: I've spent almost 100 hours under its effect :) Non stop action at its core.\n\nFor the characters and story it certainly doesn't top off Dead Island, characters have no charisma - including your main character who's really a lameass. The main story is meh and almost non existent, its dialogues totally bland. Music is good, not as good as DI's one, but still good. The surrounding and environment are more impressive in Dying Light though: huge buildings and slums mixed in a very realistic settings: little roads, shops, houses, dumpsters, stairs, etc. Sure it's really missing the exotic island beach theme feel but it's compensated with the crazy action. BTW you'ld better not have a fear of height because the second main map is even more geared toward the rooftop runs than the first one!\n\nMost of the quests are good though, some secondary quests really making up for the main story. I was surprised with the quantity of stuff to do, things to collect, quests to do, parkour runs, , blueprints and loot to find! Quests givers are spread out in the maps, there's also a lot of parkour races to do and a lot of achievements. The controls are perfect and very responsive (I used an XBox controller). There's several difficulty levels and even a new game +. Like in DI the multi mode isn't mandatory and you can play fully solo, with no other player entering your game.\n\nAbout the weapons, well DI wins this one, Dying Light's weapon crafting is pretty meh and slow to unlock in the beginning. Most of the blueprints are more or less hidden in the huge maps and you'll often trip on boxes containing them. However the weapons never seem that powerful, except for the last ones ofc. Zombies seem to have a huge pool of life (how ironic) and weapons wears off very fast. Be warned that the first 5 hours of the game (if solo) are VERY hard, mainly because you're totally helpless: no good weapons, unable to hit more than 3 times before panting, out of breath, unable to even run efficiently and having very few possible parkour movements. But you'll eventually begin to unlock some good skills and that's when you'll begin to really play. The game really shines when you unlock the grapple and you suddenly transform into Spiderbatman (yes, it's a huge bat with leg spiders *nods*), it really makes the exploration really really fun!\n\nCan't wait to grab the expansion when it goes on sale. I'm a huge zombies games fan, and this one is very good. I totally recommend it and really hope they make a sequel - or a ton of expansions, anything!","May 18","true","105.4"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","13","16","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikhagaming/recommended/239140/","Mikhagaming","M1kha【USG-Curator】","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mikhagaming/","147 products in account","Its like Mirrors edge and Dead island combined. I had a blast playing this\nTitle: Dying light\nGenre: Zombies, survival, FPS\nDeveloper: Techland\nPublisher: WB games\n\nFirst things first. this game is made by the same developers what made the dead island games.\nThose games compared to this game. This is basically a improved dead island but with a better and improved combat system and mirrors edge free running.\nDont get me wrong, its not a bad thing because the combat in dead island was clunky. Its still a little clunky but way better now.\n\nStory\n\nYou play as Kyle Crane. A GRA operative who is being dropped in the quarentine zone to get certain files back from a badguy. Later you find out its Rais. Just as I expected the game has its zombie cliches like everybody you start caring about around you sacrificing themselves to save you or so that you can get away. Which I personally hated. As for Rais. He is basically a wannabe Vaas character but way more depressing and kinda boring to be honest. but if you look around those cliches the story is still quite enjoyable as it takes you from the sewers to the highest towers and you can roam around in the open world city of harran filled with zombies. Also the voiceacting is well done. the only thing that I asked myself is why everybody you meet in the game has some kind of accent which annoyed me a little bit.\n\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gamplay has basically 2 mechanics. Combat and freerunning. these feel both smooth and I enjoyed just loading up the game to slash and crash trough the zombie hordes. As for the freerunning its pretty well made, smooth, fast, dynamic and fun :)\nas we are talking about dynamic anyway, there is a day and night cycle present in the game. At day the zombies are slower and not much of a treath except when they are in large groups.\nBut at night it all changes. Now you are the hunted instead of the hunter. which is scary but also pretty exciting as you ran across rooftops to escape the volatiles (stronger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombies who are fast as hell). This makes you think twice about fighting them because they are pretty strong.\noverall you have a lot of different weapons you can find by looting or killing enemies. The weapons range from Basic baseball bats to Rifles and shotguns.\nThe shooting mechanic is decent enough. The game stands out with its melee combat though.\n\nCo-op and multiplayer:\n\nYou should already know this but there is a multiplayermode where one of the players can invade another players game at night to stalk him and kill him. This is called  be the zombie.\nIts a fun mode but it gets boring fast if you dont play with your friends.\nThe more fun part is the co-op greatly integrated in the singleplayer mode. Your friends can just jump in and out of the game, you can play the entire campaign together or just have fun doing running and fighting challanges together.\nThere are up to 4 slots for the co-op gameplay.\n\nConclusion & final verdict\n\nI really enjoyed this game and am excited for the content they are going to give us in the future. Although the story isnt the best part the gameplay makes up for it. And its fun as hell to play with friends. I really recommend this if you like a good zombie survival game. ( or if you actually liked dead island).  Its like Dead island without the bugs and with better gameplay overall!\nThe story isn't anything special and the voiceacting is decent. Even with a flat and generic protagonist the game is still quite enjoyable once you get to the parkour and zombie action.\n\nMy final verdict for Dying light is a 8.7/10. A great experience for every zombie fan out there\n\nWant more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games! Follow UltraShock Gaming's group curators here!\n\n\nPS: there are some bugs in the game but nothing major or gamebreaking. most being connectivity problems with co-op.","April 11, 2015","true","48.4"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

The gameplay, story, visuals and characters are, in my opinion, great.\n\nHowever, I was disappointed when a lot of gameplay elements weren't added into the final game. In the E3 2014 gameplay, they show the player along a wall horizontally before smashing in a zombies head. There is no horizontal wall running in this game, I guess the devs decided to scrap that feature :(\n\nThe only other disappointing thing for me is the lack of side quests. There are 44 side quests in total, however, they make up for their lack of quantity with their quality. The majority of the side quests actually have significant stories with new characters and interesting events, rather than just being "Give Taheer 10 insulin"-style missions.\n\nI'm not that good at making in-depth reviews so this is pretty much the end, should you buy this game?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nOh and sometimes it's hard as hell to find a game to invade in the "Be The Zombie" lobby, that's a pain in the ♥♥♥ but yeah, great game.\n\n9.5/10","February 24, 2015","true","203.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

With various problematic scenarios such as encounters with Rais as the antagonist. The more you get into the story the more you get to dwell deeper into the challenges he always throws at you (as the bad guy he is) but doing the side-missions you get more information about how Rais was before the epidemic which is some cases you feel a bit of sympathi about him but yet hate him for the psychopatic ♥♥♥♥er he is.\n\nThe story is also interesting as they made it pretty good with showing several scenarios which would probably happen if this was for real too, there is much twists with people you will get attached too and which will meet horrible fate's where you are the witness for it. The protagonist (Kyle Crane) also responds almost in sync with how i would feel and respond especially how the mains story started and how it progresses when the truth is starting to surface.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe gameplay is really fun. its a nice balance between fighting and running as different scenarios requires different tactics. sometimes there is a fight you cant win(you could try go YOLO on some of them) so you need to run past them and there is time when you cant run from a fight and need to battle it out to get past them (Example: Inside of a barricaded house searching for supplies and some walkers is coming in from the only entry to the house).\n\nThe quests are pretty decent, some character are easily forgotten (im talking about side quests) and some arent and a few of the sidequests you complete will reveal some additional story and it could be of anything like the outside world's current state and view of this epidemic, your enemies backstory which could question if they really are a bad guy (Rais will always be a psycho♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but the one's working for him) and even story of your own escape from that place.\n\nAlthough after i have played this game all through then i want to add that the feeling against zombies being scary and dangerous at first quickly disappears as for getting somewhere about lvl 5-10 in agility and power makes you a bit overpowered and at the end game you can almost one-shot everything that moves.\n\nCombat and levels\n\nThe combat system is pretty balanced, adds to the difficulty with the stamina system that drains pretty fast. and also that your weapon have durability that also drains and in a tight situation where you're out of stamina and your weapon is broken (and you need to fix it) can be your first death.\nCombating other survivors(Rais men) are also a challenge. When you get to higher levels in power then you can kill almost without a problem but it's countered by more enemies will be present as more deadlier zombies will show up (Runners, Frogs, Hazmat's, Bombers, Demolishers etc.)\n\nThe leveling system is quite fair too as you dont progress Too Fast  and you also level up in 3 areas and at a different speed depending of how you play\n\nAgility - You get experience by running and doing more parkour moves, Skillpoints in these area generally decreases the limit to your parkour and will make you run,climb and regain run-stamina faster as well as unlocks new active moves such as, vaulting over your enemies, sliding as well as adding combat mechanics for those moves (slide --> LegBreaker)\n\nPower - Fight zombies to become better,Tankier and stronger. Also unlocks new attack moves for you to use, also after some levels it will increase your damage and give you more stamina to work with in combat.\n\nSurvivor - Typical all around skilltree where points improves generally your survival outside and gives you new possibilities to craft new items which will help you out. also gives you some skills like better prices at store's, craft boosters (which are op imo) etc etc.\n\nThe night gameplay\n\nThe nights in dying light also changes the gameplay style you have to adapt for survival. "nightmares" comes out at the time and you must play with more caution else everything is coming at you. Hell several when i managed to avoid them and stumble across a normal zombie is just beg for my life and hope the ♥♥♥♥er doesnt make to much noise so the nightmares notice me.\n\nBut after a while when you get used to the "game rules" of the night it doesnt get very scary, you just have to be more careful when running around as you unlock more safehouses which means you can easily escape the nightmares and get rid of the pursuit. You can still easily die due to minor mistakes\nand nightmares are still something you want to avoid but as you know how they act and how you should counter-act it then you can run around almost freely and only to notice that if you screw up once then that will be the end of you if not you figured out something real fast\n\nZombie Mode\n\nZombie mode is fun and entertaining, it's quite balanced as the zombie you play as is fragile as hell (1 or 2 hits and you're dead) and if you're caught from a UV flashlight of a human player then you are pretty much screwed if you dont manage to fall back (Some active abilities helps you with that).\n\nThis means the player who plays the zombie must adapt to an assassin type of gameplay and try to isolate or catch a human player who has let his guard down. Some abilities such as the spit is just what it sounds like, you spit then it explodes after a short delay and the effects of being caught with the spit is like from  left 4 dead zombie The boomer and hoping the little chaos you create will open up an opportunity to catch one in the chaos.\n\nYou have your own set of a skill tree as a zombie which gives you new active abilities as well as upgrades to them.\n\nTo find a game as the zombie is quite hard as people have set up internet lobbies but leaves the session as soon as one joins, which i dont really get as if you dont want to get invaded you can still turn it off while still having a co-op game public\n\nTL:DR\n\n+ playable with the lower requirments (still good graphics)\n+ Combat system is fair,fun and satisfying for each kill\n+ Parkour bruh\n+ Good balance with running and fighting for survival (depending on the situation)\n+ The night forces you to a different playstyle (if not you're going YOLO-Mode)\n+ Leveling system doesnt progress to fast but not too slow\n+ Good and interesting story as it progresses\n+ Levels are well made and polished\n+ Side-Quests are interesting and some of them adds insights to the Storymode\n+ Finally Difficulty is here (Hard Mode)\n\n- Getting a game as the zombie is hard\n- After some hours in the game the night gameplay doesnt get very "scary"\n- Survivor's Sense is a bit overpowered but yet extremly helpfull (not accounting Hard mode)\n- cant say there's much replayability (hopefully the season pass will add more good content)\n- Gets pretty easy after some levels in both agility and power\n\nThis is the final version of the review and will not be further updated until more content has been implemented.","February 15, 2015","true","101.0"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

Parkour is heavily incorporated into the game: run and jump over obstacles, climb over buildings, or use a pretty cool grappling hook all to escape from or gain the advantage over the zombies. The combat system features limited durability weapons with status effect and stat upgrades and a variety of ranged weapons ranging from your average pistol to a semi-auto shotgun to a crossbow. The dynamic day and night system works well and effectively introduces a horror element during nighttime runs. The newly introduced Legend skill tree is pretty grindy.\n\nThe Following expansion is a standalone expansion that throws you into the city's countryside also filled with zombies. You get your own personal buggy that you maintain, repair, and upgrade. The zombies are a lot stronger this time around. It sets itself apart from the original game. It is included with the Enhanced edition.\n\nPVP lets you play as a Night Hunter with its own skilltree to fill. He can move around with his infinite grappling hooks and instakill enemies with his tentacles. Haven't tried much of the PVP to be honest but would look like fun for someone looking for that zombie PVP fix.\n\nPretty significant downside is its less than stellar optimization especially on AMD hardware.\n\nGet it when it's on sale, it's worth it.","April 19","true","90.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

However, the people who are praising this game saying how amazing it is obviously have a much longer honey-moon phase with games than I do. Either that or the ones who think it's so amazing are 10-15 years old. Let's be real -  This game is good, but it's defnitely not one of those games you start to play and it gives you chills because you have had not had such a great experience in such a long time or ever; to me that's what would justifying something "amazing" and if that is not what would justify amazing to you, maybe you have lower standards, but it's far from "amazing" no matter what your standards are, trust me. It's a GOOD game, nothing more, nothing less. Depending on how much you ♥♥♥♥ around or don't ♥♥♥♥ around and run through the game there is a good 20-40 hours worth of play time. Once you beat it, there isn't much to do besides try to max out the skill tree. You can finish the side quests, challeneges and that's about it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/quantizational/recommended/239140/","quantizational","Quantization","http://steamcommunity.com/id/quantizational/","894 products in account","I've anticipated this game for a long time but elected not to purchase it on release due to a lot of triple A games not being so good lately. (*cough* AC: Unity, Evolve and Lords of the Fallen *cough*) Of course, the moment I decide to do that the game I wait for turns out to be good. There will be no spoilers in this review but I may accidentally mention something that would give away late game content so if you are wanting your experience completely unspoiled, take my word for it that the game is good and leave this review now. Otherwise, hello.\n\nOkay so let me start off by saying; this game is effing excellent. I must admit, from the gameplay I'd seen and the reviews I'd read, I was expecting a semi-decent FPS survival that would take maybe 10 hours to complete with some repetitive hack and slash combat that had been over-hyped and blown out of proportion like most other triple-A games these days. I admit it, I was dead wrong.\n\nLet me get the only two negative things I can say about this game out of the way. The multiplayer is pretty unbalanced, (although having someone join your game is a blast,) and the performance is sometimes lacking (fixed with Dying Light Manager 0.10a, google it for more info. It may have been updated to a newer version by now.)\n\nThe graphics in this game are so, so beautiful. During the day the shadows are gorgeous and at night the game has such intense and terrifying shadows that even though it is really difficult playing at night time, I still end up doing it just to enjoy the game's wonderful aesthetics.\n\nI'm not huge on "horror" games, but this is the perfect mix of terror and action for me to enjoy without freaking out and quitting. (I'm looking at you Dead Space.) I hate slow paced horror games but since this game is always moving forwards, I could actually enjoy the scary areas a bit more than I can in other games.\n\nThe movement system in this game is fantastic, every time you jump onto a ledge or platform you immediately have 3 other options to jump to, which in turn have 3 more and so on. Freedom is the word when it comes to parkour in Dying Light and there is nothing more satisfying than jumping 150 meters down into a pile of garbage only to take no damage.\n\nDying Light was built on Chrome Engine 6. I have to say, I love this engine. Zombies have amazing ragdoll physics and being able to cut a zombies head, leg and arm off on one swing, then kick each individual part around just adds to the immersion. To this moment, if I see a zombie at a ledge of a building I will run up to it and kick it off just to watch it fall to the ground; no exceptions. It is glorious.\n\n10 hours into the game and I still hadn't even found a gun yet I was enjoying the game immensely, guns are just a bonus late game. The progression in this game is absolutely perfect, you start off using sticks and wrenches to attack things and you mainly avoid zombies, but by the end of the game you are an absolute zombie murdering monster complete with a grapple, guns, super powerful melee weapons that slice zombies into two pieces with a single swing and the ability to go all the way across the city without stopping or touching the ground. (Still scary going out at night time although the monsters are a bit more manageable.)\n\nThe skill trees in this game are really well thought out with almost every skillpoint you get changing the way you play the game. No more of that, "5% damage increase while wielding 2h weapons" etc. You always get something meaningful, like a new ability, increased jump distance or a new finisher. I also like that there are 3 skill trees rather than just 1 and they are all leveled separately. So you have to go and do parkour to level up your agility tree and you have to engage in combat to level up your power tree. The trees are pretty damn big too. At 22 hours into the game and I was only 14-18/25 and it gets slower as you level, but like I said, almost every single level up adds something useful to your arsenal. Not to mention that the final perks on each tree are extremely useful so that adds incentive to level all your skill trees.\n\nThe story itself in the game was pretty good, but the real depth I got out of the game was the side missions. That being said, the actual campaign goes for around 17 hours so there's that. There are so many side missions all with interesting rewards and interesting storylines. You can also find survivors around the world and just sit and listen to them talk, they give insight into how the outbreak happened and a lot of them have clever things to say that will get you thinking. Clearly someone put a lot of effort into the dialogue for this game.\n\nOverall I'd give this game an 9/10 and if the performance was a bit more optimised I'd be giving it easily a 9.5/10. I highly recommend you get this game if you are at all interested in survival FPS games. It's worth it.\n\nTL;DR: This game is fun and has zombie babies in it.","February 13, 2015","true","53.7"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","2"

The story overall was enjoyable and far more in-depth than your standard zombie game.  It had its twists and turns and, as a huge zombie fan, I can say that it definitely brought some new elements to the genre.\n\nThe combination of the open world and the parkour results in a very fun traveling experience especially after you've leveled up your Agility path and gained some special techniques to go along with it (like leap frogging over zombies, using a long-range grappling gun, and being able to run up a flat surface for a short distance).  I don't recall having played a game where I enjoyed traveling from Point A to Point B so much.\n\nIn addition to the Agility path, you are able to level up your Survivor and Power paths.  Survivor gives you the ability to make chemical boosts and grenades, cover yourself in zombie guts to sneak by other zombies, and craft shields out of materials that you've scavenged along the way, among plenty of other unique passive and active skills.  Power is the fighting-based path which gives you additional abilities to use with your weapons. as well as enhacing their effects overall.\n\nAs for the most memorable aspects of the gameplay, the day and night cycle plays a massive role in Dying Light.  I found myself literally afraid to be out at night as the areas outside of safe zones were FAR more dangerous than they had been during the day.  Also of note is the crafting system which is basically an improved version of what was found in Dead Island - scavenge materials and craft grenades, medicine, tools, etc. and use those same materials to MacGyver your own unique weapons, like a baseball bat with nails (simple) to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sword that carries a strong electrical current and light enemies on fire (insane).\n\nThis is the Skyrim for zombie fans.  I highly recommend this to fans of zombies, RPGs, open worlds packed full of side quests, and parkour!","March 14, 2015","true","40.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/239140/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","What can feel like a spin off of Dead Island, definitely doesn't mimic it's style when it comes to being complete. The edges around this game are smooth in the sense that there are no "lucky jumps". If Dead Island had the parkour movement Dying Light did, that game would be better. If Dying Light incorporated more vehicles, this would definitely blow Dead Island out of the water.\n\nDying Light follows a story about a fellow named Crane who was dropped into an infested zone. He is under cover for an agency for their espionage work. They are attempting to gather intelligence regarding what is happening. Crane finds himself saved by two characters and eventually is offered to join in with their crowd of survivors known as "The Tower". Besides being able to do main story line quests, side quests are also available to enrich the experience. Moreover, side quests do not feel redundant or cheap. They feel like they actually give you a purpose and boost in stats.\n\nThe game's controls are phenomenal and can be somewhat comparable to Mirror's Edge control scheme. Parkour is highly hailed in this game and it is rightly so. Jumping from a lower ledge to a higher ledge may seem impossible at times as you may find yourself directly underneath the area you would like to go. Upon looking at the edge (even from underneath or any normal ledge), the camera and your cross hairs sort of shift to indicate this ledge can be grabbed onto. Referring to my earlier remark of being found underneath a ledge you'd like to climb, the camera still can fixate onto a ledge (even from underneath) and the character even leans slightly to add realism. The parkour scheme was done excellently and doesn't feel cheap what so ever. The only thing is you can't really drop down from ledge to ledge. Going up is not a problem but going down is a different story. The player needs to look for garbage piles or wooden roofs to jump on to break the fall. This is a neat addition, but can be a bit annoying for some gamers as that control to go down isn't there. The player may however take one hand off the ledge to look around. Besides a good running/jumping scheme, Dying Light features a multitude of weapons.\n\nWeapons can be upgraded and even modified with certain items that are picked up. A pipe can be turned into an electric pipe which stuns an enemy (or two) upon impact. Weapons can also be deconstructed to recycle for more material. Weapons can be from giant hammers, motlov cocktails, to even fire crackers to distract zombies. The fighting scheme is pretty neat and is somewhat immersive. I feel that they could have done a better job introducing a bit more control to the player rather than swinging wildly while pressing RT. None the less, wherever the cross hair points is where the player will land the shot. Some head shots also show an x-ray of the zombies skull and spine and temporarily slow the game a bit. Kicking is also featured in the game (which doesn't require stamina to use). When I was fighting on a rooftop I was attempting to kick enemies down it. The kicking motion itself is okay, but how the zombies react is slightly questionable. It takes a few kicks sometimes to get a zombie on the ground (which is ok), but if I nailed a zombie in the head with a kick I expect them to go flying back and certainly off the roof. This wasn't exactly the case as small curbs would inhibit entire momentum of certain zombies flying over the edge. It is possible though after a few solid kicks to send someone flying. The inventory/map menu is extremely simplistic and extremely UI friendly.\n\nI absolutely love every detail except for one small thing, I'd like to be able to equip my weapon from this menu too! Yes I know I can do it in game, but when you have a horde of zombies running after you, time doesn't stop while selecting another weapon. This in a sense adds a bit of security for the player when under stress. Again, not a big deal but I'd figure to point it out. There are three main skill sets to upgrade which add an RPG element to the game, survival, agility and power. Survival offers the player more when roaming around freely to look for objects or to craft better objects. Agility provides for quicker movement and improved climbing skills. Power has to do with direct engagement with zombies and can improve abilities and add new abilities such as being able to drop kick. Each skill set gains EXP as you directly use either of the three while playing. Spread out throughout the map are safe zones. These zones can be unlocked by killing all the zombies within the area as well as securing the zone (closing the door, turning on power etc...). Also spread out are UV traps, where the player can activate them when nearby.\n\nMultiplayer is a great addition to already a big game. It can be annoying for a few as when you are going through a campaign quest, you may be interrupted by a game. I really like the fact they allow you to be the survivor on top of being able to be the zombie.\n\nGraphics are on par and feel next gen. There is quite a bit of detail put into the game but some graphics or tiles look bland. Recycling bins never seem to change as I'm guessing everyone threw out the exact same stuff in the trash. Either than that though, the game can offer some awesome views from exceptional heights. Sounds are good, especially when making a solid impact with a metal pipe against a zombie. They have also added day and night into the game, where at night "crawlers" or zombies with significant power come out to play. Day game play is quite different from night, as at night you'll try to creep around more and make less noise whereas day, you don't really care how loud you are.\n\nI like this game, and the fact they incorporated co-op and multiplayer is a definite notable feature. Local co-op would have been nice too but who knows, they can't make everything always amazing.\n\nFor future Dying Light games, please add a method to get down buildings once you scale them! It's a cool feature to be able to jump from a crazy height onto a pile of garbage, but maybe some of us just want to drop down a floor. The melee fighting scheme is awesome, however there needs to be more control and responsibility given to the player. I want to feel like I'm in charge of where the character is swinging their arm. They did a good job in impacts overall, but it doesn't exactly feel right sometimes when knocking enemies back with a blow. Adding a "light" melee hit and a "hard" melee hit would also give the player a bit more to choose from. Weapons do this as is as some are bigger than the others but I'd like to have control over this. State of Decay also took a unique step when it allowed players to build up their home bases. Maybe this isn't quite the issue here, but some sort of introduction towards that would enrich the gaming and RPG experience.\n\nIt would have a higher rating if it was more open in allowing the player to use the environment as shown in Dead Island. I do miss driving a truck, and I wouldn't mind trying a motorcycle.\n\n\nRating : 7.45/10\n\nScreenShots :\nVisual\n\nGetting a boot off the edge\n\nSeems impossible but you can jump up to get to the next floor... check the following screenshot\n\nI made it up. You can also peek around as your hanging off the ledge","July 11, 2015","true","17.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I am a zombie grinder, I am the zombie terminator. I am Legend.\n\nAll of that said, and despite all the QQ around the AMD systems (which is my case), I've had absolutely no problem whatsoever with FPS, quite the opposite. The graphics are close to the best I've seen.\nThe soundtrack will keep you wondering if death is upon you, or just around the corner.\nThe gameplay is incredibly good, as you can "visit" most of the buildings, and you can parkour your way around Harran.\n\nObviously, not everything is perfect, and to me, the biggest disappointment is the story itself. It's amazing until near the end, where it just feels it's being wrapped up quickly, leaving some loose ends, and wondering you what the heck just happened.\nUnless their plan is to continue the story with Dying Light 2 or some DLC, the ending is quite meh, whereas the rest of the story is quite good, making you shed a tear once or twice. Them feelings...\n\nThe crafting part of the game is quite regular, and you've plenty of options to make your killing weapon of choice even more deadly, and prettier. From bats, to axes, to hammers, you can use anything to kill a zombie. The combat system is nice, and the guns feel a bit awkward, which just leaves you more excited to melee everything down, and feel the blood and guts hitting you as you hack and slash your way to the top. Top of something, that is.\n\nIf you are looking for a "survival" game, there's not much survival to do here, as you can pretty much skip sleeping the entire game, eating only helps regening some health, and there's no drinking or anything similar. It's, however, a scavenger heaven, since you can find loot pretty much anywhere. loot cave ftw\n\nI'd easily recommend this game to anyone, as it's quickly climbing to the top of my all time favourite games.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nGameplay: 9/10\nSoundtrack: 9.5/10\nAI: 8/10\nStory: 8/10\nOverall: 9/10","March 2, 2015","true","76.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

Dying Light really brings out the fear factor of the zombies, unlike the previous Dead Island games. Not only at night, but in the day. You start going rambo into a crowd of zombies? You're going to notice your character being unable to tackle all of them soon enough. The fear of dying becomes very real very quickly.\n\nNight has to be the worst though. If I'm not in co-op, I don't dare leave the safe zone for fear of being chased to my inevitable death.\n\nThe gameplay is one of the best zombie games I've played in a long time. Performance is quite low at release, and safe zones can't be unlocked for the most part, but everything else has been awesome. I look forward to Techland's dedicated focus to patching this game into perfection.

I know it's starting to become more of a generic zombie killing game, but the idea of adding parkour (similar to Mirror's Edge) makes this game a little more interesting. Dying Light has put a lot of good time and effort to make a very solid game, and for it just coming out, the performance was a lot better than I expected.\n\nPros:\n+ The variety of weapons that are in the game can take bashing zombies over the head a fun time for you.\n+ Smash, shoot, burn, or drop kick zombies to get out of situations or if you're in the mood to kill a bunch of them, there are many ways to do so.\n+ The parkour aspect in this game is great for getting out of sticky situations.\n+ Upgrades to your weapon can increase greatly and can help kill zombies much quicker.\n+ Crafting weapons and equipment is definitely useful when it comes to being out on your own.\n+ 3 separate skill points give you a variety of level ups to become a better runner.\n+ Night time in this game is very difficult, but exciting at the same time.\n+ Characters, textures, and distant buildings look amazing at which this definitely shows a 2015 game!\n\nCons:\n- Side missions are kind of annoying.\n- Climbing over walls or vehicles leaves you vulnerable to attacks.\n- Sometimes bashing their skulls more than 10 times just isn't enough and that wastes your weapon's durability.\n- FPS dropping once I left tutorial (fixed it by lowering quality which stinks! :(  ).\n- A lot of features in this game isn't original and seems like a bunch of games mixed into one.\n\nI'll throw this in here hopefully someone has experienced this issue, but throughout the game, my audio starts distorting when either I'm talking or randomly in the middle of combat. It happens frequently and it just sounds like the voices turn robotic for just a little bit.\n\n","January 28, 2015","true","54.3"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","26","43","3","0"

Mindblowing. Not more of the same. Nope. 2 extra skills you can work on and one of them is 'Driving'. The scenery has changed to farmlands and the map is BIG! So you realy need your car (Buggy) and you can upgrade it when you climb your driving skill. You'll damage your car driving over zombie's and you'll burn fuel. So you'll need to repair once in a while and you'll have to search for fuel and gear in abandoned cars. Lots to do in this DLC. O...new weapon. Crossbow. It's great! From best zombie game ever to best zombie game ever+. No way another team is ever going to beat this one in the near future.\n\nEdit: After 47 hours of taking my time and enjoying this game I'm getting a second stage...there's more...o joy!  Didn't saw that comming. I didn't mention that this game is pretty scarry at times in the review I wrote a couple of months ago. So, it's scarry at times. At night you're just game for the hungry mob out there. It's great. I played some hours with other people and they were all very nice, patient and helpfull. This game is good in all the right places. Best zombie game out there. In a review someone said that it reminded him of Farcry with zombies. I agree.\n\nDead Island kind of game but with climbing and 'Free Running'. Part of the team that made this game is also responsible for the Dead Island games. This one is better though because you can climb all the buildings and do some free running. The three skill trees are a bit better too. The punnishing system when you die is also well thought of.  Points are being deducted from one of the skill trees when you die so you'll be carefull. It's a little bit tough to get into but when you get going there's lots of fun and thrills here. I suggest that you buy the 'Ultimate survivor bundle' with the main game when you start. There are some blue prints for weapons in there that realy helps you on your way. Very good zombie game this is. If you want to spend time in a nice zombie game and you don't know wich one to buy with Dead Island I and II also in the Steam shop.....they are all very good games. But buy this one. Less buggs and more freedom of movement.","September 26, 2015","true","158.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

These aren't all that great. They're good, don't get me wrong. Just not great,\n\nFor the monsters there's maybe about nine different things to kill. There's your run-of-the-mill zombies, slightly faster run-of-the-mill zombies, exploding things that can kill you in one hit, spitting things (because we can't have a zombie game without something spitting some noxious green goop at us), big guys with concrete clubs, bigger guys that like to throw rocks at you, screaming children (zombified of course) and faster, stronger run-of-the-mill zombies that only appear during the night time. On top of that there's also desperate survivors that you're supposed to feel bad about carving up (but I didn't) and about an entire national army's worth of armed thugs for you to kill. Maybe with my lack of remorse when carving up other humans I'm supposed to feel like I'm the monster? I dunno.\n\nThe parkour is what most people were looking forward to this game for and honestly? It's good. You're able to make your way across the city any way you want to. On foot of course as Crane seems to be the only person in the city that doesn't hold a valid driver's licence. I did have a few minor problems where I couldn't grab a ledge similar to others I had grabbed hundreds of times because I was looking a millimetre more downwards than what was considered by the game to be acceptable. Then the game suffers from a virus (Haha, get it?) that I like to call Assassin's Creed Virus (I'm not great with names) where I can leap off as tall a building as I like so long as I land in something considered to be soft. In ♥♥♥-Creed this would be the wagons of hay, in this it would be a pile of trash bags that could be full of dirty, hepatitis-infested needles for all I know. These things are rather minor I admit, but it does break the flow of the game a bit I feel.\n\nGraphically the game is sound... At bits. I've seen a few things in game that would have been embarresed to be seen in even a PlayStation 2 game (Take a look at the crate of... onions? I guess? When you're in The Tower.) It seems designed for consoles too I feel. The menus have a nasty habit of returning to the very top after you press enter or click on something which caused me to craft the wrong thing a few times and it also seems to be poorly optimised for PC. I bought my computer back in September 2014 and it was top of the line at the time and I had to lower the graphics and view distance just to play the game.\n\nNight Time was hyped up to be some sort of terrifying ordeal that you'd be extremely lucky to be able to survive if you decided to ignore the screaming voices of protest in your head and venture outside in the dark but from the moment you get the grappling hook night time just isn't scary. It's like when you were afraid of the monsters under your bed as a child but when you finally get brave enough to look you find that it's just an old T-shirt, a dinosaur toy and your mum's old vibrator that had been left on the "on" position. Okay, that metaphor wasn't clear. Night starts off as being genuinely scary, not as terrifying as other reviews say or as terrifying as it was hyped up to be, but that was only because these scary old T-shirt, dinosaur, mum's old vibrator monsters seemed to have no weakness. By about mid-game night is no scarier than day time. You can have strong weapons to fight if you need to and the grappling hook lets you escape from most chases with ease.\n\nThat's another part where the game breaks down a bit. When you unlock the grappling hook. Most of the enjoyment in the game is deciding which route you should take to get from point A, through point B, up point C and to point D. But with the grappling hook you pretty much just zip from A to B with no real thought or sense of danger and as said before it lets you break pursuit with ease. The grappling hook also takes away from the satisfaction of solving a climbing puzzle by yourself because you can just skip most of them. (Puzzle is used very loosely there!)\n\nCombat seems to be another huge sticking point in other reviews. People keep mentioning how most fights are better avoided or how it's dangerous to fight your way through to a different area but to be honest it's really not. There's this massive bridge swarming with infected and I was able to clear the entire thing using a few molotoves, a handful of home-made exploding shuriken and a couple of machetes, and then there was enough loot left lying around afterwards for me to enjoy being king of the dirty survivors for a few weeks.\n\n\nMy review does seem to be very negative, and that's because it is mostly. The developers really let themselves down in certain aspects but at the same time I can't help but enjoy myself while playing. Despite the flow sometimes being broken, the sense of real freedom you get while running from A to D is something that I've never experienced before in any other video game. The combat is fun at times and honestly pretty funny at others. The graphical issues were sorted by just changing my settings a bit and night time was genuinely scary. But only for the first few nights.\n\n"Dying Light" is a fun enough game to play on your own but I feel that the game really comes into it's own when you play co-operatively with some friends. My friends and I were able to pull off some amazing team-work that just wouldn't be possible during single player. Everyone you play with has a slightly different play style, you might be working with someone who likes to stealthily sneak past all of the infected, or you could be playing with a gung-ho gun-nut who shoots everything that moves and then some things that don't move just for good measure. One of the coolest parts of the multiplayer is just watching your friends get from point A to point D. While running you could see one of your friends on the streets below you sliding into an impossibly small gap to evade a fast zombie while at the same time you could say a black rope appear just above you and see another friend use it to grapple their way to the next building.\n\nI've given the game a lot of flack and deservedly so, it is the game we all expected it to be, just not as good as we had hoped. Given time I hope they update the game to iron out some of the more minor inconveniences.\n\nMaybe I've been overly harsh? Maybe not. Overall I'd give it 7/10. 7.5 at a push. It's a really fun game, just don't go into it thinking that it's going to be the best game you've ever played.\n\n\n\nTHIS LAST PART DOES CONTAIN SPOILERS ABOUT THE LAST MISSION OF THE GAME!\n\n\nMy last gripe is put at the end, and appropriately so. The last mission has an exhilirating, genuinely fun chase followed by tedious climbing rigged with lots of insta-death scenarios which I was able to get over. The last fight however is something I am not able to get over! A quick time event is not something that should replace a last boss battle! You've spent the entire game building up hatred between these two characters and genuinely making the player feel like he/she should hate the villain, but you don't let us kill him ourselves! Quick time events do not count as boss battles! The ending itself was kinda lazy too in my opinion.","January 31, 2015","true","92.3"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/recommended/239140/","archy18","Archy Senpai [RTOZ]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/archy18/","1440 products in account","This is the best zombie game I have ever played, and I would definitely say that this was well worth the price. Sure, a couple of bugs have been encountered: stuck in the ground a couple of times, and falling through the map too, but even then, the situation generally ended up being quite humorous. Much of my playtime has been co-operative, where my friends are more dangerous than our enemies, but that's possibly just the playstyle of me and my friends, laughing all the time.\n\nWhat I most love about this game in comparison to other zombie games, is the actual emphasis on survival. You do not start with a half a dozen guns and unlimited ammo. Resources, especially guns, ammo, and med kits are very rare, and you must be careful with your decision making. And even melee weapons eventually get worn out and cannot be used any further, with a limited number of repairs as well. This all contributes to making this game quite difficult, with a huge emphasis on survival. The difficulties you encounter in facing enemies, be they zombies or humans, especially early on, make this a standout game - you cannot stand and deliver, and just slaughter hordes of enemies. And thus, the focus is on running, and escaping, and using the terrain. Crafting is fun, with a huge variety of mods and other things that you can create - experiment! Everything has its uses... if your backpack can fit it all.\n\nAnd the movement is where the game particularly shines. Much has been said of the parkour, and it is everything I expected, and much more. From jumping over walls, from roof to roof, along ledges, and climbing and sliding all over the place, the movement is fluid, fun, and incredibly rewarding. There is also an incredible impressive use of momentum here, too, where to slow or to stop could be very costly. Very responsive controls, the free-running is extremely exhilarating, especially if you are trying to escape at night. The survival element of this game is emphasised by the day/night cycle, where the night is actually quite a scary and dangerous place to be - you really do not want to be caught out at night. The graphics and audio, combined with the scary night-only Infected, make the night a very dangerous, yet potentially rewarding place to be - this is because of the extra skill points available during the night.\n\nThere is a large variety of enemies within the city of Harran, both human and zombie, which leads to a need to be careful in what you do, and how you do it, in order to deal with them, while also being careful not to draw too much attention to yourself. There are some quite intriguing special zombies, although it is getting always getting harder to design original zombies as the years pass. Even when you do find a gun and ammo, you may not want to use it and stick with melee weapons - gunshots draw the Infected like moths to a flame, so there is a huge trade-off - unless you're willing to take on all comers - are you brave enough? Do you have enough ammo? Have you got a back-up plan? And there are other environmental hazards which may draw enemies to you by letting off far-reaching sounds, be it a car alarm or exploding gas bottle, or something else.\n\nThe graphics look fantastic, and the city, characters, and models of the weapons and mods all look brilliant. The open world nature of the map is also very attractive, with a charming appearance accompanied by plenty to explore and do. But it is the audio, including the voice acting, which really stands out for me. Dying Light contains some nice though not award-winning performances, though some people had amusingly odd accents for the game's European setting. The score was fitting and atmospheric, particularly when at night, or otherwise occupied in conflict, or at some potentially climatic point in the campaign. The sound effects are also very well done too, from the sounds of zombies, to the impact of melee weapons.\n\nWhile the plot was quite cliche and somewhat predictable, the fun elements are all there, ably supported by an intriguing cast of characters, who all perform their roles admirably. The game also offers an interesting insight into the anarchy which could descend given the absence of law and order. There is also a very wide variety of interesting side quests to complete, should you wish to. The game's finale, however, is Bittersweet. Without spoilers, the game's end feels lackluster in comparison to the heights reached by the rest of the game.\n\nI would also like to give a special mention to the RPG-elements of the game. I really, really like the leveling system implemented in Dying Light. Unlike traditional leveling systems, where everything you do gives you some exp, which you then arbitrarily decide to put points into various Skill Trees, in Dying Light, there are three separate skill trees, and you unlock more options in these Skill Trees by doing thing related to those skill trees. For example, completing quests or rescuing survivors will contribute towards raising your Survival Level, while your Agility skill tree is improved by parkour and Power by combat.\n\nWith a load of content, and genuinely incredible gameplay, alongside a host of other great features, this is definitely a very highly recommended game, especially if you like zombie games.","February 6, 2015","true","104.9"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","23","38","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngfmj/recommended/239140/","fngfmj","Wafflecopter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fngfmj/","75 products in account","Decided to change my review to a more serious one, because why not.\n\nPros:\n-The resilience of the zombies: I distinctly remember setting a zombie on fire with a fire weapon. It was still walking around so I decided to cut it's head off. (It was technically dead by this point) It was still walking around after that so I decided to cut it in half. The torso was still on fire and walking around so I decided to cut the legs off. It wiggled around for a few more seconds and then finally died. So much for putting things out of their misery.\n-The side quests: They can be very fun to play, but they actually have some good  twists in their own story, and they sometimes foreshadow what is going to happen next in the main story quests\n-The atmosphere: Harran feels very much like a dead city. Flaming cars, occasional screams, hordes of zombies everywhere, and even dead silence\n-Mods: One of the few AAA games I can think of that actively encourages modding of the game. There's already a lot of custom maps for the game in the Steam Workshop, including a couple that parallel Techland's work in terms of quality, and there's the possibility for other kinds of mods further down the line (ex. new weapons, blueprints)\n-Night time: Techland isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around when they say "Good night, good luck". The game changes from a zombie slasher to full-on horror once the lights go out. Predators called Volatiles come out only at night, they are nearly impossible to kill, are very fast, and can often kill you with a single hit.\n-Hard mode: Some people complain that the game becomes too easy towards the ending half, this fixes that. "Survivor sense" is limited to seeing Volatiles through walls at night, normal zombies become much more damaging (killing in just 2-3 hits), medikits do not regen your health instantly, and certain items become harder to find. This mode addresses most of the issues I list in the "contriversial" section\n-Game looks pretty good graphically: Very good textures, amazing foliage, and nicely detailed weapons. Apparently the lighting is based on physics, I don't know what that means but it looks beautiful\n-Pack mentality of the zombies: If you kill one zombie, there will probably be two or three more that come around a corner and try to eat you\n-Uniquely balanced firearms: Sure, you can use a pistol to kill that zombie, but there will be a group of Virals (fast zombies) that will come for you almost immediately\n-Surprisingly tactical melee combat especially when facing other survivors: The enemy survivors are very, very smart. They can block your hits, dodge them, kick you, dodge your kicks, throw knives at you, and knock the knives you throw at them out of the air (but you can do all of that, too). This requires you to time your attacks well since they can beat you to death very easily if you only try to attack\n-The physics in the game are amazing: For some reason Techland decided to add actual weight and momentum to your player. This means you can jump from the roof of a van, land on a zombie, and you will crush it under your own weight, leaving it's head vulnerable so you can beat it in with a gas pipe. Also, you can dropkick a zombie into a car, and if it hits headfirst, it will die.\n-The map design: Techland has designed certain subtle paths for parkour you can take, which flow very naturally\n\nControversial (aka some people hate it, some like it):\n-The way the weapons hit enemies: It seems like Techland decided to treat the weapon in your hand as an actual physical object with weight and force. This means that all weapons in the game feel REALLY, REALLY GOOD. A blunt weapon will likely stop in it's place when it hits an enemy, which feels realistic and pretty brutal when you're trying to bash a zombie's head in when it's laying on the ground. If the game triggers slow motion, you can sweep the camera around, and hit other zombies in that sweep without touching the mouse button. However, this has a bad side effect - if you have a weak weapon like a pipe and there's an enemy standing to the right of an enemy you want to hit, the weapon will likely bounce off of the enemy on the right and will not touch the enemy you want to hit, which can be very frustrating.\n-The parkour system: People have praised the parkour system as the best of the new generation so far. However, I feel like there are some problems with it very similar to the problems that most parkour systems have, like things you should be able to grab onto, but can't. Trying to grab onto something below you is a HUGE pain in the ♥♥♥, usually it ends up with you flying off, then mashing the spacebar trying to grab on again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Usually you don't end up where you wanted to go. However, in just about every other movement, it feels pretty natural and flows nicely.\n-The damage the weapons do towards the end of the game: You start the game off with a pipe for a weapon. It does 24 damage. You will likely end the game with a katana/machete/longsword/shotgun. These things do upwards of 1000 damage. The enemies' health do not scale to the weapons you have, so, you can just slice through hundreds of infected with no problem, and can even kill Volatiles with just a few hits. However, this doesn't compromise the way the weapons feel. Somehow, the weapons still stay incredibly satisfying throughout the entire game.\n-The plot: The antagonist is pretty cliche, he's someone from the Middle East who is terrorizing the people of Harran during the infection. The guy you play is pretty cliche as well, he's an American who just happens to be really good at parkour as well as killing zombies, even though he's never done either of those things before. However, outside the rivalry, the plot does take some interesting twists and turns, questioning the morality of the "greater good" and whether or not Rais (the antagonist) is really your enemy.\n\nCons:\n-The motion blur is overused: It looks like Techland decided to put motion blur on literally everything. This makes it very hard to appreciate the graphical beauty of the game with it on.\n-Some enemies are almost impossible to kill without taking damage: There's a strong enemy with a giant piece of rebar in the game. His main attack is hitting the rebar on the ground, which creates a shockwave that takes away most of your health. 30% of the way through the game, the size of that shockwave doubles. Before, you could easily dodge out of the way, now, it is close to impossible.\n-The controls for throwing/grappling an enemy are very awkward: Alt & W/A/S/D at the same time. I'll let you try that one.","May 9, 2015","true","171.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehBluebear/recommended/239140/","TehBluebear","Bluebear","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TehBluebear/","294 products in account","Fantastic, and this is coming from someone who doesn't particulary like zombie games or films.\n\nHaving also played Techland's earlier open world zombie slash/hack/stab/<insert killing adjective here>-em-up 'Dead Island', it's clear to see where the basic building blocks of Dying Light came from. Yet where Dead Island shambled and stumbled, faults chiefly lying with a clunky feeling combat and not much of a feel of progression, Dying Light is a fast zombie. Combat feels lithe and fluid, and you never feel out of options when you suddenly find yourself in a pickle. Jump over the zombies. Do a sliding kick through the zombies. Become unto a whirlwind of bladed death (well... death v2.0 I guess) to the zombies. And then make your escape while cackling with sheer glee as you bound over cars, scramble up walls and sprint across rooftops.\n\nThe controls are spot on in this game, and I'd go so far to argue that using a keyboard and mouse actually feels better than a gamepad; a rarity in a market so centred on consoles (for a game of this type at least). The city of Harran looks brilliant also, the first time you see the dawn sun filtering in between buildings, revealing corpses strewn about is a sight to behold.\n\nThe character skill progression in this game is a wonderfull thing, and perfectly balanced. Your first tentative steps outside the safety of the tower block, you really do feel threatened, and combat leaves you breathless. But as you improve skills, you do start to feel very confident in piling into a mass of zombies that would have left you gibbering with panic at the start of the game, and coming out alive at the other side. While certain skills and abilities may feel powerful, there's still just enough vunerability remaining to not make it feel like the game is holding your hand.\n\nI adore this game. It takes the absolutely fantastic feeling of parkour from Mirror's Edge, introduces zombies and a well thought out combat system (and I haven't even mentioned the weapon crafting/improvement yet), and melds it all into a nice tight, cohesive package.\n\nMaybe you're like me, not a massive zombies fan, and you're sat on the fence because of it. Put the zombies to one side of your mind, and get it for everything else. Imagine that they're clowns or something. Ok, that might not have helped.\n\nI'm guessing now is not a good time to also say there's Bad Things lurking about at night time also? What's that? You've already bought it?\n\nOh.\n\nWell.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherry__/recommended/239140/","cherry__","Cherry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cherry__/","320 products in account","tl;dr It's just Dead Island 1.75. With parkour, drop kicks, and a slightly better story.\nIs fun, but littered with many problems. Not quite a 60USD investment, but worth checking out.\n\n**Warning: This game has very bad optimization for AMD cards and chipsets. The game can run fine on medium settings, but setting your View Distance to a higher amount or even setting Textures to High can destroy your frame rate if you are not using a Nivida GPU with an Intel CPU. But even then, the game may lag.\n\nIf you liked Dead Island but hated how "co-op" it felt because your character had little input in the story and it was just "the group", you might enjoy this more. Crane is a lot more engaged than the protagonists of Dead Island, which is pretty nice. However, his personality is lacking and all over. Oddly enough, he starts getting interesting during a story mission half way through the game, but the following mission has him making wise-cracks the entire time.\n\nEven though the story is better than Dead Island, it is still very predictable, incredibly cliched, and hilarious most of the time. I mean, the game craps its self in the most glorious ways for no reason. If you think something is going to happen, you probably already know what is going to happen. Also, Rais is a good villain in the sense you hate him and just want to kill him so you can make him shut up. But he's really a terrible villain with no real logic behind his motives and he's probably Russian just so we could have that Cold War grudge against him as well. There's a side quest where you have to track down a serial killer in the Old Town that has a more interesting antagonist than Rais because you can believe he's actually crazy.\n\nThe urban exploration is really the highlight of this game; getting around can be very fun when you start upgrading your agility and especially after you get the grappling hook. Many of the towers you can climb really are fun to scale and even feel like you are there with both how good the game looks and how well it handles ambient noise. For instance, while climbing a radio tower, you can hear the steel beams creak and sway in the wind. Also how Crane constantly adjusts himself while on thin ledges really add to the feel that you are a human doing these things, unlike most games where you feel like you are playing as a box. I say this game would have been perfect if it had no zombies or story and focused purely on the parkour.\n\nHowever, the parkour is not without fault. Sometimes, Crane refuses to grab onto ledges while scaling and that can result into accidentally falling to your death (which also is your number one cause of death). Also Crane is just so slow when you start the game. Yeah, he's just a guy; but he is also a special agent and he doesn't really feel like he has had any physical training besides "Above Average Strength and Stamina". I suggest not sleeping at night and just let the Volatiles chase you around while you get double XP and get to a safe zone for the agility bonus until you get the first intermediate upgrade. Even then, just play at night anyway because the game becomes more fun.\n\nThe combat is simultaniously one of the worst but best part of the game. It's either frustrating because the big enemies have incredibly big AoE attacks that you have to dodge 2-3 times in one direction to maybe dodge (even though you may still get hit), or too easy because the same big guys can be killed in two or three well placed hits with an upgraded mid-game weapon or a vanilla late game weapon. For how realistic the game looks, it's crazy how cartoony the fighting is. You should be disgusted that you just kicked the hipbones out of a zombie's body, but holy crap you just kicked the hipbones out of a zombie. The combat skills you get are hilarious and are very effective; you can dropkick a zombie and send him flying like he got shot out of a cannon, or you can kill a zombie by grabbing his head and gently turning him to the right, or you can kill a zombie by jumping off a roof and slamming an axe through its body with enough force to create a shockwave that sends every zombie in a 3m radius flying.\n\nEven then, the game put a lot of focus on the melee combat but forces you into firefights frequently in the main story. There are only five guns to pick from (two handguns, two rifles, and one shotgun), and they never scale in stats. That rifle you found at level 11 is the exact same at level 25 although it now costs more because it is orange. Also you'd imagine that since you can find the same guns all game, you can find the same melee weapons too, but apparently there's weapon extinction. I have a blueprint I never used because it needs a baseball bat and I never found a baseball bat all game and now I can't ever find one because they are "Low Level" weapons. I can fill all 18 inventory slots with Katanas and Khopeshes though!\n\nI feel like the game blows its load on "Visually Interesting" very early then doesn't pick its self back up again until much later for how muddy and brown almost the entire game is, and then Old Town just feels like Italy which felt out of nowhere, because apparently the Harran World Games were to put it "on the map", but Harran was a global trade center for hundreds of years and a huge oil export with a rich cultural history.\n\nThis is the most well off apocalypse I have ever seen. You will get an abundance of cash and supplies only a few hours into the game. Just by playing as a kleptomaniac, you will never run out of anything you need besides String (at least in my experience, I only found about 20 pieces my entire time playing the main story, but started finding it all over after I beat the game). I'll even go so far to say that if you need ANY supplies right now, you could just add me and I could throw 20 of something at you and still have too much crap. You can even cross the bridge to get to a medical outpost and get about 25 medkits and gauze (as well as several police vans and ambulances to lockpick) inbetween missions and always have enough supplies.\n\n\nI do find it very funny that the game tries to set up that the supply drops are a massive point of the game and the focus of survival, even though they stopped after two hours of playtime for me. Then they become far too common in the Old Town district (I found enough supply drops to get over 205,000 survival experience just by running around for an hour-- Not counting the XP you get from liberating the drops as well).\n\nI also find it hilarious how often Crane gets his cover blown for how he is supposed to blend in and be a secret agent.\n\nI will say the impression I got from early videos of the game was that you were just in the quarantine zone already and had to fight other survivors to get to the supply drops to survive, which I thought would be very interesting; seeing how people would act when supplies are low and there are zombies everywhere. But we barely get that and the game is just littered with random neutral survivors you have to save from time to time. I won't go so far to say that Techland again didn't deliver what they promised, but... They didn't exactly deliver what they promised, again.\n\nEdit: This is what max level feels like.","February 20, 2015","true","71.7"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","16","25","0","0"

From the creators of the Dead Island franchise, Techland parts ways with Deep Silver and team up with Warner Bros. The end result is truly the best zombie survivor game I have ever played. Fans of the original Dead Island and Riptide will notice similarities with some of the crafting, weapons and looting, but this is by no means a remaster of the original title.\nThe game boasts the best movement I have experienced in any modern day FPS. (I use the term FPS very loosely, firing weapons in the game draws unwanted attention). The parkour element brings an exilarating angle on exploration and evasion, and is incorporated into the game seamlessly. For me this was a huge selling point, the fact that it also contains multitudes of psycotic zombies is just a bonus!\nThe game itself is stunningly beautiful, the city just begs to be explored extensively. City design and layout is done well, so you can take full advantage of a fun playground to test your parkour skills on. You are also rewarded for creative thinking, in terms of combat and movement.\nOkay, now a quick word on the zombies! With a plethora of titles on a very tired and clichéd genre, zombie games can find it hard to stand out from the mundane and mediocre. This title stands shoulders above the rest. In most zombie games, I am never really scared of dying, and just go about business as usual...hacking, slashing and shooting. Not so with Dying Light.\nThis was the only zombie game that was terrifying for me. Yes, you still get the slow, mindless shamblers in large numbers, plus a variety of other undead denizens. But the game transforms like some horrid nightmare, showing you it's true form, as soon as that sun sinks below the horizon. That is when the zombies show their unabated strength, speed and cunning as they run, jump and climb whilst alerting others to your presence. I advise doing as much as you can during the day when they are weakened by the sun. Going out at night does have its rewards, but at great risk.\nIt is also best to play this game solo for the first play-through for a solid horror experience.\nThen team up with friends, as the terror level significatly drops when you have a buddy or two watching your back. The great thing is you not only get the blood racing from zombie encounters, you also have numerous heart-in-throat moments with the climbs and jumps you perform.\nI highly recommend this game for any zombie or parkour lover. So let the heads and limbs fly, may your hands always find that precarious ledge...and venture forth into the night if you dare!","September 1, 2015","true","77.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","6"

And it's pretty well made - closest implementation to the fantastic movement system of Mirror's Edge I'd seen by the date.\nFighting zombies is, of course, also an option - if not for loot, then for survival. And the combat system although somewhat similar to Dead Island is quite much more fast paced and visceral. Oh, and throwable weapons actually are useful here.\nAll of that is wrapped up into nice leveling system with three talent trees - survival (general skills), agility (moving skills) and power (fighting skills). Some of the skills are unique and pretty interesting (e.g. grappling hook), while most of them are disappointingly plain upgrades (e.g. weapons durability degrades slower).\nAnd then you have to balance between day and night, because those times feel like two completely different games. At day most of zombies are dumb, slow and, well, boring. At night unless you act carefully (or sleep in a safehouse), you'll get you ♥♥♥ bitten off pretty quickly.\nThrow in couple of competing factions, very good voice acting, pretty large world, random events, challenges and all those other open world things - and you'll get a pretty solid game. There's nothing new in it, really. But it's so well made that it's a joy to roam around.\n\nOn the downsides:\n- Engine is still not very well optimized, FPS tends to randomly sink for no apparent reason\n- Some NPCs faces are reused a bit too much (although the voice acting is unique, which feels even stranger)\n- Night zombies are not too much of a threat once you'd figured out how they think and move\n\nBut if you do enjoy some first-person zombie survival - then this game is definitely one to take a look at.\n\nA bit more in-depth look in the video:\nhttp://youtu.be/unZ9G2wfGYI","February 2, 2015","true","43.1"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","19","31","5","0"

In my review below I make lots of reference to Dead Island and while I hate to say it, those comments are now irrelevant, Dead Island has nothing on this game. This isn't just an evolution in gaming, it's an evolution in story telling.\n\nLong version:\n\nNothing can describe this game other than perfect. It takes everything that was amazing about Dead Island; the ambience, the exploration, the story and the crafting and adds more to it. The only thing Dead Island lacked was flawless gameplay, it was buggy and filled with graphics glitches, but Techland have really learnt from that experience and they've taken everything that worked and fixed everything that didn't! This game is like a slap in the face for the Cryengine, the graphics are OUT OF THIS WORLD.\n\nI can also forgive Techland for delaying this game to work on the free-running because it was definitely worth it; the exploration in this game is unlike any other because literally, if it looks like you can climb it, YOU CAN.\n\nAnother impressive apsect to Techlands work is the emphasis they put on the zombie; in Dead Island they really made zombie's a threat again, unlike other zombie games where they are basically harmless obstacles that you need to knock over. But in Dying Light they've upped the ante again, you REALLY don't want to confront a zombie and that's just during the day, don't even talk to me about night-time! Which brings me to the day and night cycle; this is the first game where it really affects the game. Taking your character out during the day is completely different to taking him out at night. The game brilliantly conditions you to fear the night and believe me, YOU DO. It's easy to lose track of time when you're working a mission and when you suddenly hear the warning over the radio that it's almost night time, it like a kick in the guts, and then you gun it for the nearest safe zone.\n\nThere are only two issues I have with the game; the first is that the Be The Zombie mode is slightly unbalanced and consequently no-one who is playing a human takes the challenge against a hunter, but this is merely a matter balancing the hunter a bit and as soon as its sorted out, it will be amazing. My second problem isn't actually a problem with the game but more of a grievance; I loved Dead Island and this game should've been Dead Island, I can't imagine how amazing this game would be if it were set Bonoi, but that takes nothing away from this game and it's not Techland's fault; Deep Silver are just morons.\n\nUltimately, this game has all the amazing intrigue and charisma that Dead Island had, but adds to that some of the best graphics I've ever seen, an amazing parkour system and a truely dark, disturbing and terrifying experience.\n\nTechland are becoming the masters of zombie games.","January 29, 2015","true","40.0"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","20","33","2","0"

It’s an effective free running survival horror game. The story is absolute crap, but the music, sound design & creature animation is outstanding. It’s fairly well paced too, as it gave me new areas to explore just as the first map was starting to feel old. The first hour or so of the game isn’t too exciting, but the further you get into the game, the better it gets. It doesn't show everything it has going on right off the bat like some games do.\n\nI found the second half of the game more scary than the first. With new types of monsters, and an excellent second area to explore, the tone they were going for was executed with great effect. If only the story was better! It commits the worst offense, which is to be boring. I could feel myself nodding off during cutscenes, wishing they’d just get it over with. The story mission designs weren’t too bad, and I loved the music. It just had the least interesting villain in history. He even looked generic, with a face so devoid of interesting features I was struggling to take in his looks even while staring directly at him. Same could be said of the rest of the cast. Even Ubisoft at their worst do better than this. But I guess it’s still a step up from the story in Dead Island. That had a story so bad I remember staring at cutscenes, mouth agape at the incomprehensible ♥♥♥♥ that someone had written, and then animated.\n\nWhat was missing from the story is characterization. You have no idea who the main character is, who the employers are, who your friends are, or who the enemy is. You know their names and what they look like, but that’s about it. It’s as thin as it gets. The protagonist is forced by his employer to do morally questionable acts “for the greater good”. But because you have no idea where he’s coming from, it’s hard to care. What’s at stake for him? This story and setting needed much more work. It leans heavily on cliché, which has a sleep inducing effect on the audience, without any meat to the story. When exploring, the music, sound and visual design creates a deliberate tone. You can “feel” what the developers were aiming for with this game. But they seem to have underestimated just how much work you need to put in on the story and cutscenes to not make them horrible.\n\nThe reason this game isn’t a complete disaster is because of just how much stuff is in this game, and because of how strong the other elements are. The music is like Hotline Miami and Far Cry 3 Blood Dragon, evoking the feel of 80s movies. And the sound has all the subtleties you expect from AAA games, like how the world seems to have layers of sound based on how far you’re elevated from the ground, giving you different types of wind sounds.\n\nDuring the first half of Dying Light I felt I could only recommend the game with several caveats. But as I got further into the game I felt myself becoming more enthusiastic about it! It’s quite an “emergent” game, ie it’s a bit chaotic in a way that’s rare in newer AAA games. At one point I wanted to get into a building, and luckily a hostile human had spawned nearby. He was attacking zombies, and as he made noise the hordes kept wandering away from the building towards him, clearing the path for me to run inside. An entirely unscripted event, and just one of a ton that I saw during the game. This element of chaos, coupled with the free running system kept it fresh all the way to the end. It never felt like a slog, or that it overstayed its welcome, which is relatively rare in big AAA titles. If you like the idea of free running in a zombie infested city, with escape sequences like those in the late parts of Mirror's Edge, then you'll probably have a good time here.","February 8, 2015","true","18.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

The game feels well-paced in terms of story and activities and balanced in every gameplay aspect. Skill progression is mostly enjoyable and worthwhile along with the functional crafting system.\n\nIt is true, however, that the game is an ultimate hodgepodge of gameplay mechanics burrowed from dozens of predecessors with not that many new ideas, but the end result is worth it.\n\nAlso the game fully supports Dualshock 4 (Playstation 4 controller) with the correct button prompts without any additional software requirements (no need to emulate Xbox controller, for instance).","January 28, 2015","true","24.6"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","16","26","4","0"

I guess that's interesting. Apparently this game is basically a better version of Dead Island, but I never played that so I don't have any reference there.\n\nStandard-ish zombie plot: Zombie plague, lots of people die, survivors among the undead who are even worse, government assistance that's really shady and unhelpful, etc. The main character you play as is kind of interesting in the sense that he starts out as a hidden agent just doing a job and ends up getting much more invested in what happens thanks to plot events. Also I'm soo glad there wasn't a romance, because it sure looked like that's where things might be heading.\n\nGameplay? You kill zombies (and people) as well as do alot of first person platforming. Ok. My dislike of platforming (due to my lack of skill at it) is well-established in past reviews, but those were THIRD PERSON platformers. This is much worse. Some of the climbing parts of this game really annoyed me. The combat is a bit middling too in the sense that your weapons break constantly and your character seems to run out of stamina far too easily. It was only when I gained access to some decent weaponry and a competent amount of supplies that things started to tilt in my favor. I do like how guns have the trade-off of being good but also being a lure for zombies, even if it did mean that most cases where I used guns in the open world ended with me having to flee after generating a literal mountain of zombie corpses. XD\n\nThere's also this day/night cycle where you get more XP at night, but it is considerably more dangerous. I rather liked it, even if your only real options are to either run as fast/stealthily as you can or funnel the zombies into a buiding with only one entrance and use that as a killzone until dawn. The latter pretty much ate through all my ammo. XD\n\nSo how is the game? It's decent. Platforming can go to hell, the main villain who is doing a bad Joker impersonation should have died in a fire instead of how he ended up dying (Spoiler: the bad guy dies), and there never was enough alcohol for my Molotovs... but it was fun. Or rather it became fun once I had leveled enough that I could buy ammo from merchants and therefore use guns regularly despite them attracting zombies. Maybe I just like violence more than running around a city scavenging for string and other parts to craft things. I'd rather use those things!\n\nAs for all the online stuff, I have no clue. My internet is being a horrific pest lately and keeps dropping connection. It's really depressing. :(\n\nI think i'll play it some more, but not to do all those damned side-quests. Rather... because roaming around a city filled with the dead has it's fun moments. Woohoo violence!","March 13","true","27.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/King_Wiley/recommended/239140/","King_Wiley","King Wiley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/King_Wiley/","137 products in account","Short version:\nThis is the best zombie themed game I've ever played. If you are looking for a good zombie game, stop now and buy this game. Enemy variety, tons of weapons, fantastic platforming, solid combat, great horror elements, at least 50+ hours of content. 9.5/10. Buy this game!\n\nLong Version:\nI have to give credit to the developers of Dying Light. In today's era of everyone complaining about nothing being original and developers mainly trying to fulfill these complaints, the developers of DL knew what we REALLY wanted. A solid game that takes the best of many other games and fuses them into one.\n\nThe core gameplay is a FPS platformer much like Mirror's Edge, but with a refined system allowing you to climb on basically anything. As a general rule in this game, if you can see it, you can go to it. This alone makes the otherwise normal-sized map MUCH larger than it appears, adding lots of depth to exploration. Later into the game, a grappling hook mechanic is introduced, which will make you feel like Spiderman, zipping around the map with ease.\n\nThe combat is extremely solid and mainly revolves around melee. I feel this is a much more accurate representation of a zombie outbreak when compared to titles like Left 4 Dead (no running around with machine guns with near-infinite ammo). Guns are rare but powerful, and handle well in combat. In this sense, the combat resembles Dead Island a lot, but feels more refined to me.\n\nThe item system is based off a color-coded rarity mechanic similiar to that found in games like Borderlands, which allows you to know if a weapon/item is worth picking up at a glance. On top of this, weapons can be upgraded and modified, adding an extra layer of depth and customizability. Most weapons fit into 3 groups: One handed, two handed, and guns (guns cannot be modified).\n\nThis game also involves heavy RPG elements reminiscent of Tomb Raider, with 3 seperate skill trees devoted to parkour, combat, and quests. Characters won't necessarily be unique, as at the higher levels, all skills can be purchased, but this definitely adds more depth to an already massively deep game.\n\nThe story is fairly generic, with nothing really shocking or surprising. This is to be expected though, as the zombie outbreak story can only be done so many ways without becoming ridiculous (looking at you, resident evil). As referenced by the title of the game, the story involves the now-familiar 'zombies are more aggressive at night' idea. In addition, special 'volatile' zombies appear, which are extremely deadly and will chase the player around, adding an element of horror to this. The player is encouraged to brave the night with special bonuses to XP occurring only at night, and certain missions only completable at night.\n\nIt goes without saying that the graphics are georgous, as this is definitely a next-gen game in that sense. The visuals are solid and consistant, with a full day/night cycle, weather effects, fancy-but-not-intrusive film and blur effects, etc. The sound is fantastic, adding to the overall theme of the game, and definitely contributing to the horror at night.\n\nThe 4-player co-op works great, little to no lag, and is very fun. Only issues I've had are some microphone issues, but are relatively minor. The multiplayer PvP is a little odd but not bad. I don't have much experience with this mode so can't comment much on that.\n\nI was extremely surprised at the level of polish and depth in this game, with only tiny little nitpicks here and there. It is very apparent that the developers looked at successful mechanics in popular games (Mirror's Edge, Borderlands, Tomb Raider, Dead Island, etc) and integrated similiar mechanics into their design, resulting in a game that feels completely rounded. This game flew under my radar when it first released, and I received it as a gift for christmas 2015 and started playing it with no prior knowledge.

It's not only zombies there are gangs, mutant running things and huge tough ones. The gear in the game is really brilliant, there's just so many different items, craft parts and other upgrades. You want a katana that electrocutes, poisons and burns zombies? you got one! There are plenty of ranged weapons too, from crossbows to a revelver the choice is yours. The story is quite good, not just hero saves the day, plenty of dark scenes too. This really helps the game in becoming very atmospheric, with a constant spooky feel you never feel safe, even when you're in a safe zone. The game is also very well balanced, to start off it;s hard and as you move along it's also hard: only at the end of the following do the zombies seem to get easier.\n\nThe game runs perfectly, I'm on a GTX 960 and an i5 at the moment, running at a constant 60+ FPS. The game has never crashed once and I've experianced literally no bugs. The only problem is when things get cluttered up with hordes of zombies, although this is VERY infrequent.\n\nIn conclusion this game is amazing, fast paced and fluid action combined with the huge amounts of variety in weapons makes for a very sucessful game, which is a must for any survival, parkour or zombie fans!","May 27","true","40.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's time to review the new zombie apocalypse game that so many people are playing and talking about: Dying Light. I've had a taste, and I want more, but will you? Read along and hopefully find out. I'm not going to tell you everything, and I'm trying to avoid any serious spoilers, but I will give you just a taste so that you can judge for yourself. Please keep in mind that this review is current as of the date of publication, but I have no idea what features may change, improve or get nerfed after this point. I am not including in this review aspects of the DLC, but I may review that later. Or not.\n\nIf I had to give just a brief idea of what this game is like, take a little bit of Fallout 3, just the tiniest taste of Crysis, a dash of Skyrim, a sprinkling of Far Cry 2, a little more FC2, toss in some inspiration from L4D2, and then top it all off with some Mirror's Edge, and you might get an idea of what this game is like. Maybe. Also throw in some optional asymmetrical fps with some rather unfortunate choices on the part of the developer to get even closer to the full experience.\n\nYou start off parachuting into a situation in a quarantined city somewhere seemingly in the Middle East. You have to find that one guy that your organization needs you to find; you know the one. You get infected, and you need medicine. That's how you're compromised, and that's how you begin working your way into the local sitch. You make yourself at home and begin doing odd jobs to improve your standing, gather intel, and make reports back to the peeps in charge in the rear. You can probably guess where this is going, so that's all I'm going to say about the back story. If you don't get medicine regularly, you get sicker and could possibly turn. So far it hasn't affected my gameplay as much as the same mechanic that was used in Far Cry 2, but I haven't gone very far in the main story line either. In the relatively brief time I've played this game, I've only had convulsions the one time.\n\nYou spend all your time climbing, running, jumping, ducking, dodging, and generally trying to outmaneuver, overpower, or out-think your opponents. You constantly have to think about where you're going next and how. The game has freedom, but with it also comes a terrible price. Sometimes you choose wrong, and it hurts so bad when you do. Conversely, when you choose well, and it works, it feels really good, too.\n\nYou get three skill trees, each with a different focus--one for gear, one for agility, and one for power. The things you do build your skills in the respective area, and if you want to get better at something, try doing it repeatedly or things closely related to it. Craft items and you'll be able to craft more items. Take on zombies one on one in melee, and you'll get better at it. Try extreme stunts, and you'll become a world-class parkour... -er (actually, the proper term is "traceur" if you didn't know... I didn't).\n\nYour opponents are a blend of frightening zeds with some specials mixed in who will not always stand out at a distance the way they will in L4D2. Once you know what you're looking for they will be all too apparent in most cases, but there is a slight learning curve involved. Yes, the big guy with the insane hammer is easily spotted in any crowd, but the little screechy ones not so much. There is a level of unpredictability to every encounter. One guy goes down with a single blow, another saps your weapon of its remaining strength. Be wary of that. Weapons can only be repaired a few times. Also, if you upgrade a basic weapon, apparently you cannot then use it as part of crafting an advanced weapon. And when you can no longer repair a weapon, don't forget to dismantle it for the spare bits.\n\nYou can find a lot of loot everywhere you turn, but most of it (especially the better stuff) is behind locks that you can pick. If you've played Skyrim, you shouldn't have any issues doing this. I've heard Thief players should also know what's what. If you've played neither of those, watch a video before playing your first time to get a sense of how it's done. If somebody says you need tons of picks everytime you go looting, don't listen to them. You only need tons of picks to practice with until you're good. Skyrim players who've already cut their teeth on these locks should have no issue even with the toughest locks in this game.\n\nDuring the day it's a parkour rpg with FPS elements, but at night, if you're out, it's totally stealth. At least until you know what you're doing. Bold precision pays off in this game. The developers have relied on player fear to a good extent, but how can you know the limits until you have tested them. Climb to the top of that communications tower. You never know what you might find. Plan your exit strategy and then hit that guy with the tank on his back. After he explodes, if you survive the swarm that will descend upon you, you will come out the other side stronger for it. Stronger or more agile, or both. Make your painful mistakes early on, because if you wait until later, you will feel the pain as you lose tons more points as a higher level character dies for the mistake of not being bold early on. Clear all your safe zones straight out from the prologue before you complete any quests. I did it my first day after the prologue, with the exception of the last one which was too well defended.  I think the daylight cycle might be tied to story progression and perhaps even side quests. Also, another pro-tip, if you're stuck, consider leaving the game and coming back because there are still glitches and bugs to be worked out. Can't reach a certain post from the roof of that one building? Maybe you're not supposed to. Trust me and see.\n\nIf you want to know what awaits you in the dark, play the Be a Zombie mode. You get to play as the Hunter, which feels like a cross between a vampire or werewolf and Venom. You get to play as one, that is, if you can find a match where people don't automatically leave as soon as you join. In my experience almost every one of the matches where I was actually able to stay and play, the human players knew what to do. If you decide to play this mode, expect some frustrations as a result, from the learning curve or from the game mechanics or from the matchmaking system. Being the Hunter is fun, but frustrating--until you get better at it. And you will get better if you stick with it. I feel the system is kind of limiting and almost misleading, because you aren't playing as any of the other zombies, only the Hunter.\n\nOne of the poor choices I feel the developer has made is seen in the multiplayer part of the game. You have extremely limited options in controlling online game play, and the game doesn't distinguish between sides. Say you go into Be a Zombie mode and open your game to public games online, when you go back into your solo campaign, it's not solo anymore. You have to go back into online settings and set it to solo once more. I wonder if this isn't part of the reason behind the large number of players who quit when a Hunter joins their game. Also, apparently, though I have yet to play with friends on co-op, I can tell you the voice communications in multiplayer are set to be strictly always on or always off. No push-to-talk. Perhaps they will fix this in the next patch. We can hope. Until then, better consider your third party options for game chat. Headphones, people. Wear. Your. Headphones. And play in a quiet area or turn off your mic please, for the love of all that is good and true.\n\nThere are ugly sores on the backside of this game. The repetition of certain dialogue branches when you walk past certain NPC's is irritating. The feeling that I've played this game before, especially when it feels a lot like those other games I listed at the beginning of this review, is a little disappointing. But where the game shines, it shines. I'm out of characters...

And I dont just mean the end of the game, I mean the end of my time with it, lets say from about 50% onwards.\n\nFollowing is a long and I hope thorough review of the game. I could go on for many more pages than I will here because there is much to talk about but I will try and focus on major points as much as I can..\n\nPlease remember, this is my opinion, some folks will agree with me, some won't, but dont flame for flames sake. Try and keep it decent, I like a good reply as much as this review\n\nSo whats right with it? Well, in the beginning you feel part of something, you have a direction and a reason for being. You make some friends, and while the storyline is not the greatest, the acting and general pacing are good, engaging and you feel like you actually want to help, to succeed.\n\nFinding out about the games many mechanics is immensely fun, from your first parkour lessons, to learning to electricute  zombies with fallen powr lines and puddles is all very satisfying. Killing the zombies themselves is satisfying, and I can honestly say that for the first 3 or 4 days (around 4-6 hours each) I rated Dying Light as one of the very best zombie killing experiences.\n\nThe skill system is clever, varied, and most of the skills are actually fun to learn, allowing you to develop a 'style' of play.\n\nOne of my absolute favourite things about Dying Light is how much havoc it lets you cause by giving you as many materials as you could possibly need to craft the games many different zombie killing utilities. You are never short of anything, and I really believe that more open world games shoudl be this way. Sure, make a player search for these things but dont make them rare as rocking horse ♥♥♥♥... The more you allow a player to make molotovs, the more he will use them and have infinite fun doing so!! Well done on this devs of Dying Lght, a great great choice!\n\nYour first time at night is VERY memorable, (as are many of the other times, but that first is the charm) and doing every side quest feels fun and somehow non repetitive. The miriad of ways you learn to kill a zombie keeps the game fresh for a long while.\n\nAround 50% however the game for me began to sour... (spoilers from here - if your undecided and dont want to read the rest of the review because of the spoilers know that I do recommend the game, if only for the first 30 hours or so, its well worth the asking price. if you like killin zombies enmasse ten buy yourself a copy!)\n\nOk so for those that stuck around.\n\nAt first it wasn't very noticeable because the variety was still there but as you progress in the game you begin to notice just how much the zombies seem to take the same amount of killing no matter what weapons you use... This 'leveled creature' way of making games always leaves me scratching my head. I simply cant understand why developers make games that level with you? All this does is make 'upgrading' utterly pointless. (well other than you will die horrendously if you dont!)\nI had weapons in my inventory that did 200 damage, 300 damage and 400 damage. Each of these weapons (if aimed right) took 1 or 2 hits to kill each zombie. So whats the point of finding and making 'better' weapons if you never see any real improvement in them because the zombies level with you?? For god sake devs of today.. Learn this does not make a game fun! Whats FUN, is when you can return to an earlier place in the game and wipe everything out with a single swing! Thats the feeling of 'progression' which simply dies with leveled creatures!\n\nOk, ok, so open world has to deal with this ability to go anywhere at anytime somehow.. Is leveling the creatures the way to do it? NO!! Put tougher creatures in in other areas.. Make it impossible for  new player to traverse certain areas until they 'progress' the reason we all play - progression.\n\nAnyway, you get my point, this game is bad for it!\n\nThis game is also bad for changing the rules on you. At first you are very scared of the virals, these are newly turned zombies who still have all their motor skills intact. They can run, they can climb, they are not stupid and mindless... They are scary!\n\nAt first.\n\nThe rules change around the 50% mark again, and rather than 'noise' bringing them, they just seem to be everywhere, and come whenever they want to. Curiously around this time the other zombies seem to now explode after dying, sending toxic goo all around that hurts you if you get caught in it. This 'explosion' is the catalyst for bringing more virals! Sorry, but his is DUMB! Why change the rules!? If they player makes noise, expect company, this is a great mechanic, fun to think 'oh ♥♥♥♥' I made loads of noise! But creating excuses for them to be there is poor, and a seemingly lazy way to make the game harder.\n\nThen comes the introduction of the harder zombies, the ones with big heafty weapons they smash on the floor creating shockwaves that send you flying! These guys are slow, but tough! Early on, its virtually impossible to take them out without a lot of running in and getting a hit here and there. Later they become utterly ridiculous in difficulty and just there to make the game harder. Not 'tactical', just harder for the sake of it. Again this feels like a half ♥♥♥♥♥ attept at making the game harder...\n\nDont even get me started on the exploders!! They hide around corners, and even lightning reflexes wont turn you quick enough to get out of their explosion range. I wonder sometimes what Playtesters do all day.. because they obviously dont provide decent feedback.\n\nNow before someone starts flaming me here about wanting the game made easier.. NO I DONT. This is not about making anything easier, its about being more clever in the first place with what your creatures can and cant do. Make them scary by all means, make them tough as nails, but dont make it frustrating, like the fights are here in dying light.\n\nIt feels i'm getting on a bit of a downer with the game here and please understad that I did enjoy it, I just get tired with the same old same old type of development. Keep games fun, fair, and exciting... Dont set out to ♥♥♥♥ off your player base.\n\nSo what did I not like...\n\nThe halucination sequence with Jade.. Honestly!! Who thought that was a good idea!! It was CRAP!\n\nThe tower climbing... Kinda on the fence about this because the controls worked well, and it was satisfying but death was often just annoying, and  paths were blocked often just for the sake of it.\n\nLeading on from that, even the games hero starts to shout phrases such as 'Oh you gotta be ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me!!' because even HE is fed up with the way the game just seems to want to '♥♥♥♥ with you' The cable snapping in the radio tower?? Why did it snap? Whats the reasoning behind this??\n\nAs the story developed I felt it got more and more ridiculous, there were times I wished for the feel of the beginning of the game, where things had passion, and made you feel something. But when you find yourself at the finale running through sewers being chased by everything the game has, where one slip-up (which was often as simpe as a 'clip' by a creature) would send you plumiting to your death, you feel less and less attached to the game, and more that it IS a game, one you want over... The restarting of this sequence with every death by the way was a hideous development choice!\n\nThen the last fight with our buddy Rise... timed key pressing, Really?? This is a developers idea of a good ending? Simply horrendous. One of the worst endings I have ever played I am sad to say.\n\nSo, here we are.. TL:DR\n\nIt has enough greatness to make it a fantastic experience. It is however marred by some horrendous development choices and a story that by half way you no longer care about. (which is a shame)\n\n8/10 for me..","February 8, 2015","true","46.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

Techland outdid themselves with this one -- you can consider Dying Light a perfected version of Dead Island (the first sandbox zombie FPS, I think). Graphics, sounds, music, atmosphere, script -- everything was perfected, and released with practically no delays (something for Ubisoft to learn here).\n\nIf you don't know what to expect from the game, watch the E3 trailer -- the game is *exactly* like the trailer. Which is so hard to believe, actually, isn't it? Well, trust me: I've tried everything they were doing in the trailer -- and it works perfectly: throwing zombies, setting traps, jump-kicking, throwing weapons, running through your course of traps from infected, looking back at them, setting off your traps...\n\nAnd by all means, try the co-op mode, AND the "Be The Zombie" mode -- both are absolutely amazing. Co-op in this game is a lot better than in Dead Island (it was meaningless there) -- I can tell you this much.\n\nThis game deserves the highest rating, this easily can be the game of the year, I honestly mean that.

The crafting system is very basic, but better to have a basic crafting system than none. The upgrade trees was something I found alarming because though I do love RPG elements, I was afraid the game would become too easy with all these upgrades. However, the game managed to keep the challenge at a rate that always kept me at my toes even with a ton of upgrades. As for sidequests, they are actually kind of interesting in this game. Even a fetch quest can become fun through dialogue or challenge.\n\nThe Bad (VERY MINOR story spoilers)\n\nThe variety of opponents in this game is too low imo. But that becomes nitpicking. Because the biggest flaw this game has - is actually the personality of the main character. Though the story isn't that great or imaginative, I would consider it kinda good for what you'd expect from a Zombie game. The main character however, is a nightmare.\n\nYour character is a whiny, unprofessional ♥♥♥♥♥ who gets emotionally attached to the doomed people of this ruined city. He cries when a story character dies, as if he cares. I had to roleplay that I was faking it. The main character is introduced as an agent whom sole purpose is to retrive a file. Then he starts crying and caring for the people in the city instead of doing his job. The white knight in shining armor of your main character becomes tiresome and obnoxious as he spews out ultra-moralistic crap as if he was the human embodiment of self-rightiousness. The main villain is also uninteresting and cliche and suffers the opposite, by being completely void of humanity and just "evil for the sake of evil".\n\nTO SUM UP:\n\nThough I personally never cared about graphics (i still consider Fallout 2, Morrowind and ff7 the best games out there) the graphics in this game is really good. But you need a decent rig.\n\nThe gameplay itself is great. It is fun despite being repetative.\n\nCrafting system and upgrade system is good.\n\nThe challenge is not so hard that it becomes overly frustrating, but neither as easy that you risk to become bored.\n\nEnemies are varied enough, but just barely, there should have been 1-3 more types of enemies.\n\nThe story itself is average, but better than I expected for a zombie survival. Side quests are surprisingly satisfying!\n\nWhat really pulls the score down imo is the lack of some things in the story, like joining factions or faction vs faction assault/defense in the storyline, NPCs you genuinely care about etc.\n\nBIGGEST OFFENDER is the main character and the main villain, they are both horribly written and it is impossible to symphatize with either. Your character is too "good" on the morality scale, at the point of it almost becoming repulsive. The main villain is unimaginatively written and is the standard one dimensional "evil for the sake of evil" boring archetype. Near the end of the game I hated the main character more than the villain.\n\nAll in all, 7.8/10 - I recommend this game.\n\nIf you like sandbox games, zombie apocalypse scenarios, survival games, horror and RPG elements and have a good PC, you will probably find this game worth the money. Do not however - expect the story, the main character or the main villain to provide any intellectual or emotional satisfaction on any level unless you are younger than 16 years old.\n","February 10, 2015","true","57.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The storyline is a bit dull and generic but I think most of us expected that if it was anything like Dead Island. The game runs silky smooth but thats not to say you will not need decent hardware to run it, this game is a graphical powerhouse and you will need a good setup but assuming you have the hardware you shouldn't run into many gameplay issues. The city is beautiful, the layout is great for parkour and has a really wonderful sense of chaos and beauty. The quests are entertaining but from what I've seen so far there are not many memorable characters. Overall I feel the game is worth it, if you were a fan of Dead Island you will most likely enjoy this.\n\n8/10","January 27, 2015","true","20.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Runak2/recommended/239140/","Runak2","Runak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Runak2/","1303 products in account","Well I just finished the game and it was quite a ride.  One of my biggest complaints about most zombie based games is that the stories are usually pretty weak, and a lot of this has to do to the necessity for co-op experiences. Dying Light has one of the best single player campaigns (although you can certainly play co-op) I have ever played and much of that is you become Kyle Crane, a GRE operative tasked with recovering a stolen file regarding the viral outbreak in Harran.  The main missions guide you through quite a few individual missions, each one advancing the story. The story is quite good as you keep wanting to see more but you also have a plethora of side missions helping other survivors in many different ways. The mission design for both main and side missions is so varied that I don't think any really felt the same.  And best yet, you really feel like you are helping the survivors when you complete these missions, as many of them sound like realistic requests during a fragile fight for survival.\n\nThe comparisons of a cross between Dead Island and Mirror's Edge is not far off.  The parkour elements really shine in this game, and as you level up your agility you get access to more and more abilities that make you even better. It's quite a rush to run full flight jumping from rooftop to rooftop, executing quick climb and jump moves, and sliding under low hanging obstacles.  The combat feels very much like Dead Island with a crafting system and modification system very similar. You must collect blueprints to expand your crafting and modification options; many become available as you spend survival points (which is mostly gained by completing missions or returning supply drops), or by finding blueprints in the world or by completing side missions or protection missions.  Your combat ability is handled via power points, which are gained by hitting infected and killing them in a myriad of ways. Spending power points gives you access to different combat abilities like power swing, whirlwind with two-handed weapons, and death from above which impales an enemy when you are above them.\n\nDuring daytime the game can be challenging as there are a lot of different special infected much like Dead Island. Come nighttime though, and all bets are off.  The game becomes more of a stealth game as you try to avoid volatiles, the most powerful infected in the game.  Early on you have no chance of killing one of these but as you reach higher levels and get access to better weapons with super modifications you can end up killing them in one power swing. The problem is, attacking a volatile or being seen by one immediately alerts every other volatile in the immediate vicinity. The speed that these volatiles close in on you and pummel you to death is astonishing. You may wonder why bother playing during the night as you can just sleep at any safehouse until the morning. Some missions require you to do them at night like the early one where you have to restore the full power grid at three substations. The other reason is all power and agility xp is doubled at night, which really makes a difference as I found agility to be lagging behind survivor and power xp.  Also, the longer you survive at night the more bonus survivor points you will get once morning comes. I found I rarely ended up sleeping until morning, preferring to maneuver myself to specific locations by jumping between safehouses, trying to stay unnoticed by the volatiles but occasionally alerting them and booking it while throwing UV flares to slow the pursuit down.\n\nOverall, this was a fantastic game that was so fun it was hard to put down.  There are a few framerate issues where the FPS would drop to the single digits for 10-15 seconds until eventually clearing up. The graphics are gorgeous, the animations fluid, and the gameplay top-notch.  The game works well with both keyboard/mouse and gamepad. I played with a gamepad mostly because 90% of the time you are fighting with melee weapons and I like the feel of the gamepad in that manner. If you like action/adventure games with good stories, a plethora of gameplay options, and the freedom to do what you want in the order you want, then I highly recommend this game. It's worth it at full price.","February 6, 2015","true","48.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","2"

The variety of melee weapons and monsters, along with some genuinely creepy settings (repeatable quests are spooky!), make this one a real winner. The distinctive of DL, besides it's quality of production, is the addition of massive quantities of parkour. As a rule, I don't like jumping games, and I never got totally great at it in DL, but there are some acrophobic thrills in this game that'll make your blood run cold. I don't know if any other game has tempted my fear of heights like this one. Your capacity to climb and leap is superhuman, but not fantastically so. The only place parjour really annoyed me was on the cliffs. I realize the developers may have wanted to create some limits and bottlenecks, but it is frustrating to have your parkour, and grapple, simply not work sometimes because you're not supposed to go over this particular cliff rock here...\n\nMore serious than the Dead Rising series, DL does have crafting, but you won't find any electrified rakes here. You also, although heroic and epic often, you will not be plowing down hundreds of zeds at a time. Taking on a stack of 10 will require maneuver and savvy, even with a good weapon. In a standard of the genre, one on one they are weak -- but in packs, can be dangerous. (Not to mention the really big ones.) The story is deep, more serious than many other zombie first person games, and you may find yourself caring about some of your NPC colleagues, although -- for an open world situation -- you are limited in how you can engage them. The dialogs are story driven, so you won't be getting married, bringing allies with you into battle, etc. This is not zombie Skyrim.\n\nThe difficulty curve is somewhat steep as you get started, with the early weapons lame enough you'll find yourself tapping on a single zed many times before they fall over. If you've got friends who are able to give you some good weapons early, it will change the difficulty dramatically. Get a weapon that does several hundred damage, you'll see slo-mo swaths as you cleave a zed, or multiple zeds, in every stroke with pieces flying in multiple directions. In DL, as your survivor score goes up, the (melee) weapons you find do also. One of the really nice features is when someone opens a box or vehicle in this game, every member of the party gets to draw something out.\n\nThe boss fights in DL are not great, but there aren't a bunch of them -- by far the majority of the action is within the normal systems of the game, which are excellent. But, as off tactic as some of the boss fights are, I did find myself caring about what happened in them. That shows the effectiveness of the story, the dialogs, the characterizations, and the settings.\n\nIn summary, if you like zombies, this is a can't miss. I'm still waiting for the day I can play a PC zombie game where you can recruit friends and allies, build realistic forts, and build resources for a community. But, DL does the low intensity thing very well, and the parkour thing was an unexpected add-on for this genre. This game will have you holding your breath sometimes, as when you face a Demolisher, or get caught out at night, or run out of med kits, or scale the side of the bridge. Those thrills are authentic and a credit to the game and the genre. DL also allows you to mow down a lot of zeds and feel proud of yourself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wackyflip8/recommended/239140/","wackyflip8","Wacky Flip8","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wackyflip8/","123 products in account","This was a great survival-horror experience.  I have completed the story to its fullest; here's my opinion.\nThe graphics were a marvel if you have the system to run it at higher settings but the optimization quality here is sadly subpar as the "View Distance" slider was the only true catalyst for a better or worse framerate.  Even with the view distance set at just below the halfway mark, there would be a rare occurence of HORRENDOUS frame drops.  I have no idea why these occured as I have been in rooms with about 40 zombies in this game without an issue and has about 4 occasions where the game dipped to about 10fps during a grapple sequence.  Yes, 10fps.  Really took me out of the experience.  Besides these issues, the city is gorgeous.  The world is littered with cars, debris, gore, the undead, and still manages to look beautiful (especially in "Old Town," unlocked about halfway through the story) with its tall buildings  and the sense that this was once a thriving, elegant city.  The voice acting was pretty good all around but it had its weak moments with a couple of side characters.  And the sound.  The sound in this game is sure to immerse you as the undead growl from a distance, each melee connects with a satisfying crunch, the slight sound of wind as you parkour your way up rooftops and through safe zones, and quite frankly I enjoyed the sound immensely.  This is all backed up with a pretty good story.  I actually had a motivation to continue with the story and did very few side quests throughout my time with it.  I only really developed a slight connection with one character besides the protagonist but I wasn't fond of the villian.  There are a couple of boss fights.  They give you a good arena to battle and offer a good challenge, but one of them feels unfair when the enemy is able to throw axes THROUGH walls.  Luckily, it wasnt enough to kill me, but it was mildly infuriating that he was able to defy the laws of physics to damage me.  The conclusion to the game was more or less satisfying, as what you expected to be an epic boss battle turned out to be a quick time event.  As to avoid spoilers, thats all I have to say about that.  Now the gameplay.  This game has extremely addicting melee combat.  It does start off slow with the weak weapons and the whole take-8-hits-to-take-out-a-single-zombie-for-the-first-4-hours bit, but once you get going the game gives you a great sense of progression.  You'll start seeing zombies being dispatched more quickly, an abundance of arms flying to your left and right, and finish each fight off with a well-placed swing to the neck and watch the heads roll.  There's a variety of weapons, whether your busting heads into pieces with pipes or sledgehammers or simply decapitating the undead with a sickle or a machete.  The ragdoll physics are quite entertaining, too.  I found myself dropkicking a LOT of zombies off of rooftops because its just so enjoyable to watch them spin and distort themselves before inevitably landing headfirst into the concrete 50 feet below, leaving chunks of brain spewing all around them.  Another core element of gameplay is the parkour.  People have referred to this game as Mirror's Edge+ Dead Island, and for good reason.  Navigating the rooftops is a breeze and I've only had a few moments where I couldn't climb a wall I previously thought was possible to scale.  You can jump quite far, too.  I kept asking "Can I actually make that jump?"  Yes, I could make that jump.  The last major element to the gameplay is the day and night cycle.  During the day, the zombies are really just wandering the streets with no real goal in mind until you confront them.  Still, they can overwhelm you in numbers, especially when a viral is among their ranks.  A viral is just a fresh infected-you'll hear a human voice go "Please" or "Stop" as you bash their heads in.  It adds a layer of humanity to the game, and you almost feel bad for having to put them down.  It is a necessity to as virals run at a faster speed than even you and can climb buildings.  They also appear during the night.  The night is absolutely terrifying in my opinion.  I have the sense that every zombie is looking for me and only me.  The elite zombies, or Volatiles, are a higher mutation of the normal zombies and essentially cant be killed unless you have an ultraviolet flashlight on hand, which really only stuns them.  The night almost completely switches all of your gears to stealth.  You do not want to be caught in the line of sight of a Volatile or a Viral, and even a normal zombie is tougher during these hours.  Unless you have a mission, your best bet is to flip on that flashlight and navigate your way to the nearest safezone; most of which have to be liberated, so make sure you are close to one or you'll have an experience like me where I cleared a safe zone as the night began.  What a terror-ensuing experience.  This game is quite punishing, also.  This is a good thing as most modern games are an actual walk in the park.  I enjoyed its difficulty, but I do wish there was a slider.  The game takes away experience points for dying, which I felt was a little much especially when I died from those Exploders.  Almost every single exploder I've come across, undead with inflated guts that explode when they're close enough, has killed me.  I'll just be doing a story mission and open up a door and OH GOD ITS ONE OF THOSE RUN AWA-...You are Dead.  I felt they could have limited its power as it doesn't even take out zombies as often as they take me out.  Overall, this game is a great experience because of its great visuals, though with its problems, amazing sound design, and fluid, tense, and satisfying gameplay, though unfair at times.

The variety of melee weapons and monsters, along with some genuinely creepy settings (repeatable quests are spooky!), make this one a real winner. The distinctive of DL, besides it's quality of production, is the addition of massive quantities of parkour. As a rule, I don't like jumping games, and I never got totally great at it in DL, but there are some acrophobic thrills in this game that'll make your blood run cold. I don't know if any other game has tempted my fear of heights like this one. Your capacity to climb and leap is superhuman, but not fantastically so. The only place parjour really annoyed me was on the cliffs. I realize the developers may have wanted to create some limits and bottlenecks, but it is frustrating to have your parkour, and grapple, simply not work sometimes because you're not supposed to go over this particular cliff rock here...\n\nMore serious than the Dead Rising series, DL does have crafting, but you won't find any electrified rakes here. You also, although heroic and epic often, you will not be plowing down hundreds of zeds at a time. Taking on a stack of 10 will require maneuver and savvy, even with a good weapon. In a standard of the genre, one on one they are weak -- but in packs, can be dangerous. (Not to mention the really big ones.) The story is deep, more serious than many other zombie first person games, and you may find yourself caring about some of your NPC colleagues, although -- for an open world situation -- you are limited in how you can engage them. The dialogs are story driven, so you won't be getting married, bringing allies with you into battle, etc. This is not zombie Skyrim.\n\nThe difficulty curve is somewhat steep as you get started, with the early weapons lame enough you'll find yourself tapping on a single zed many times before they fall over. If you've got friends who are able to give you some good weapons early, it will change the difficulty dramatically. Get a weapon that does several hundred damage, you'll see slo-mo swaths as you cleave a zed, or multiple zeds, in every stroke with pieces flying in multiple directions. In DL, as your survivor score goes up, the (melee) weapons you find do also. One of the really nice features is when someone opens a box or vehicle in this game, every member of the party gets to draw something out.\n\nThe boss fights in DL are not great, but there aren't a bunch of them -- by far the majority of the action is within the normal systems of the game, which are excellent. But, as off tactic as some of the boss fights are, I did find myself caring about what happened in them. That shows the effectiveness of the story, the dialogs, the characterizations, and the settings.\n\nIn summary, if you like zombies, this is a can't miss. I'm still waiting for the day I can play a PC zombie game where you can recruit friends and allies, build realistic forts, and build resources for a community. But, DL does the low intensity thing very well, and the parkour thing was an unexpected add-on for this genre. This game will have you holding your breath sometimes, as when you face a Demolisher, or get caught out at night, or run out of med kits, or scale the side of the bridge. Those thrills are authentic and a credit to the game and the genre. DL also allows you to mow down a lot of zeds and feel proud of yourself.

Dying Light takes everything great from Dead Island and massively improves on it.\n\nAt first glance, upon being let loose in the sandbox that is Dying Light, you may think the map is small.  I know that was my first impression.  As you explore the city and further the story, you find out just how large the map truly is.  About halfway through the main story line, you will open up another large city area.  The word density truly takes on meaning when you begin exploring this location.  The game opens up more and more locations, including challenge areas (sort of like dungeons in Skyrim) as the game progresses.  Interior locations are numerous, almost mind boggling at times, especially in Old Town.  There are sewers to explore as well.  Transition areas and hidden caverns also help to increase exploration time.  Old Town is really 3 maps stacked on top of each other as there are layers and layers of places to explore.  The Following expansion provides another area to explore, even larger than the main game.\n\nAnd explore you shall.  If you played Dead Island you remember how many times you had to loot that hard shell suitcase, which came in different colors to "spice things up." This became incredibly stale as your eyes became used to scanning for that same container, among just a few others.  With Dying Light, looting shouldn't get too stale as the game presents more and more "containers" for you to loot, such as cupboards, trash cans, crates, locked boxes, medicine cabinets, dressers, and of course the bodies of those you slay.  The game will despawn bodies after a while but will drop a "loot package" on the ground for you to loot when you feel safe enough to do so.\n\nLoot is numerous and the amount of melee weapons you can wield is staggering.  Just like Dead Island you can modify your weapons by attaching enhancements which increase power, stability, and or durability, as well as, elemental effects.  Speaking of durability, at first you will be annoyed with this.  I know I was.  But after a while, as you find a greater variety of weapons such as rifles and pistols, you won't have to repair nearly as many times as you did at first as your arsenal will grow.  Each melee weapon has a limited amount of durability, then it breaks.  But again, you won't grow too attached to weapons as you'll have an infinite supply of them waiting to be looted or crafted.  Yes, you can craft weapons and some of the best ones are hidden throughout the world as blueprints.  Dying Light has quite a few easter eggs and hidden locations for you to find, adding even more density to an already deep game.\n\nGunplay is also great in Dying Light, a big improvement over Dead Island.  The rifles sound "meaty." I highly recommend completing Bozak's Horde though.  It's a challenge where, once completed, you receive blueprints to Bozak's Bow.  This bow is great and is better than the ones added in The Following expansion.   You can craft or buy arrows for it and you can retrieve your arrows most of the time after firing them.  Any game with bows as a weapon has my interest right off.\n\nThe best way to describe what you can do in Dying Light is to compare it to GTA V.  There are so many things to do you will often get distracted and forget what you started out for.  Air drops add another layer of fun as they seem to entice you to put on hold your current task to get to them first.  I remember that at one point I was trying to sneak into an area at night, attempting to avoid nightstalkers, and an air drop was initiated not too far from me.  But in Dying Light, nights are dark, and I kept arguing with myself over whether or not going for the air drop was smart.  I decided to take off running for it and alerted the nightstalkers around me by accident.  I was almost there, I could see the airdrop.  Almost there...I popped flairs around the air drop and the nightstalkers paused for a moment, screaming and clawing at the air.  I hastily popped open the drop and looted it.  The flair went out and the nightstalkers closed in and ripped me to shreds.  Ah well.  Maybe next time.  These are the kinds of moments Dying Light can provide.  Tense, rewarding, and at times dangerous.\n\nI won't spend much time discussing the parkour element of the game as that's well known to everyone thinking about buying it.  Let's just say that the parkour/player movement in this game is leaps and bounds (pun intended) better than ANY game in its genre.  Movement is fluid once you get used to it.  Add a grappling hook, which you get later on, and I'm sold...the movement and freedom in this game is liberating and will make it hard to go back to any open world game that restricts your movement.\n\nI found the characters to be as interesting as they could be, considering the "zombie apocolypse character archetype" has been used to death (pun intended) with the vast amount of zombie games out there.  But, I remember all the main characters as they are engaging and sometimes funny enough to be remembered.  Many other reviwers have commented that the characters and story are boring.  I haven't found them to be so at all.  The voice acting is well done and varied enough to keep you engaged.  As you explore the city, you'll encounter survivors that are there saveable but some that are just waiting to tell you their story, adding to the lore of the game.  It's touches like this that make a world feel as engaging as this one does.\n\nI have yet to finish the story as I am having so much fun playing in this sandbox.  Perhaps I never will finish the story.  If that becomes the case, I won't feel cheated at all because it will have been my choice to just roam, kill zeds, loot, and explore to my heart's content.\n\nZombies are not difficult by themeselves.  But, Dying Light's dense environments provide so many spots for zombies to hide that you can't ever get too comfortable.  Loot that extra box at your peril.  Killing zeds is extremely satisfying.  Sometimes I find myself snapping out of a 30 minute 'kill fest" where I swear I was in a Kill Bill scene.  Speaking of Kill Bill, you can use a katana in Dying Light!\n\nOverall, I can truthfully say that Dying Light, plus its recent expansion called The Following, has and will continue to provide more return for my money than the last 5 games I've bought on Steam.  The possibilities with this game are endless and when you add seamless multiplayer/coop to this discussion, you can see why Dying Light is worth the asking price if you like zombie or open world, "do whatever you want" type games.  If you're a gamer that likes to take your time, explore, loot, get distracted, etc. then I wouldn't be surprised if it provides you with 500+ hours of play time.  I highly recommend this game and the season pass which includes all DLC.\n\n10/10","February 12","true","128.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Techland managed to keep what little good features Dead Island had and improve them by bringing them over to the spiritual successor. Before I go into the endless bashing of Dead Island (the premise is nice but the execution was awful), lets stick to what makes Dying Light a great zombie game.\n\nUnlike you run of the mill zombie games, Dying Light regular zombies are not your average slow-moving-arm-flailing-brain-hungry humanoids, wanting nothing more than to land on your bullets or melee weapons. They are scary, they are numerous and they will try to kill you. Their most important quality is numbers however. They'll plentiful and since weapons degrade and guns create noise which will attract the improved Virals (think of 28 days later fast zombies) , going into a square with 100 of them is not the best of ideas.\n\nDying Light creates a very good atmosphere where you're not just a guns blazing supersoldier going on a bloody rampage against them. You're a survivor and you need to survive. That means getting resources, spending them wisely, sleeping the night off or even fight through the night for some extra XP. The game manages to convey the feeling of helplessness into the player in a beautiful tone.There's a variety of special enemies, the most formidable being the so called Volatiles, disfigured monsters of the night who will chase you relentlessly throughout Harran (the city in which the vanilla game takes place).\n\nThe game's strongpoint is the parkour mechanics. Future games will most likely begin to incorporate this new feature and nothing would be better than game developers taking notes on how Dying Light manages the freerunning mechanics. It's super easy to learn, to control, very responsive to your actions, and adds a brilliant way to make perfect use of your environment. I've played game with freerunning mechanics and nothing comes close to Dying Light's system.\nAdmittedly the grappling hook gets little buggy sometimes, but it's a small price to pay for an otherwise excellent system. Every rooftop, every lamp-post, even corner of the building can be your haven, your battlefield or your grave. Absolutely astounding and it carries over into the Following as well although in a much less degree due to the vehicle mechanics.\n\nThe game features an XP system, in 3 categories (5 with the Enhanced Edition/The Following), which include your fighting skill, your survival and your agility (running&climbing). XP is earned by doing quests (the game features a lot of sidequests with their own mini arcs and characters, ranging from being a little bit on the funny side, to some being just depressing), killing enemies, running and climbing buildings and collecting resources from airdrops. The day/night feature of the game, allows you to get double XP during night, however during night the Volatiles will appears to make your life a living hell.\n\nHowever Dying Light is not without its faults. Guns feel pretty weak and are very limited (vanilla game) however in The Following they were improved dramatically, doing more damage and having more guns to choose from. If you plan on playing Multiplayer co-op with friends, be adviced that the final mission of the game can only be played solo. Why was that a thing? Completely pointless, I mean I can sorf of understand due to the reason that the ending of the game fall unfortunately into the dreadful category of QTE(quick time events). Why oh why did you ruin an otherwise good story, with a QTE near the end I'll never understand. And of course, if you're playing with friends, you better disconnect and finish the game on your own, cause the game won't allow you to do it with friends. Big disappointment.\n\n\nThe Following is the sequel of the story of the original game. You play in the outskirt farmlands of Harran, where you meet a different set characters. The most important feature is the addition of a the buggy.\nThe buggy feels a little bit... of foreign agent in the Dying Light world. You do less parkour and use it for transportation since The Following takes place in open rural area with few buildings. Not to say that there isn't freerunning in The Following, but is much less than the vanilla game.\nThe Following adds two more extra trees to gain XP in, driving and Legend levels. Driving can be maxed very easily and very quickly just by running enemies over and the Legend levels include passive bonuses on your characters.\nDon't get me wrong, the Following a pretty good addition to the game, adds around 20-30 hours of gameplay and it's definitely worth its money.\n\nAt the same time however, some of the characters feel more shallow than the ones in the vanilla game but the worst offender is the story of the game and it's absurd ending. No spoilers but the ending was bad. Like really bad. Mass Effect 3 bad. And of course you cannot finish it in a Multiplayer session with friends. You gotta do it solo. Again.\nThere's no real villain in the Following. The story feels rushed, some things are unexplained or just make no sense with the story of the game and the ending features a deus ex machina which has no real connection to anything you'll encounter in the vanilla game and the expansion.\n\n\nLong story short: Dying Light: The Following - Enhanced Edition is well worth its money and its a definite recommendation for people who feel a little bit of "zombie-game fatigue". It's mechanics are greats, it has a pretty decent story (up until the ending of the Following), it looks pretty good, it sounds pretty good, it's very immersive in its atmosphere and you can play it with friends! (up until the final mission). Not without its flaws but the gameplay outshines almost everything.","March 9","true","56.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Now, being from Florida, you'd expect me to freak out and panic and scream about how badly I want to kill myself because my hands are cold or something but you'd be wrong. I hated the heat. ♥♥♥♥ the heat. at least in the cold you can just put more clothes on. In the heat? you can only take so much off before the cops bring out the black censor bars (for those of you that don't know, you are 100% allowed to get fully naked in florida because of the heat, but the cops have to be called so they can bring out black censor bars to stick to your body. I know it sounds weird but it was a good thing. It was still too hot though. and you can't just take off your ♥♥♥♥ing skin when you're too hot. Florida ♥♥♥♥ing SUCKED. you were either near the beach, or in a ♥♥♥♥ing swamp. The more north you went, the more "southern" the people got. It was a nightmare). But that's not what I wanted to talk about. long story short: I enjoy the cold and the snow even though I was born and raised in florida and even if yawning outside makes my nose burn like hell for 20+ seconds. SO back to what I had actually wanted to say... The house I live in is literally RIGHT across the street from some.. woods. forest? I don't know the ♥♥♥♥ing difference. the point is I can walk right across the street and instantly be surrrounded by a lot of trees. In those woods forest ♥♥♥♥ place there lives animals I have NEVER Seen in my life (in person). they would be "Deer". Now, sure, we HAD deer in florida... but have I ever seen one there? No. As far as I know, they didn't exist there. you NEVER saw deer there. You were more likely to see alligators than deer (and that is not an exaggeration). So when we got here, I saw deer for the first time and they are ♥♥♥♥ing COOL. I remember my first time seeing them here was at like around 2am when I finally decided to get to bed (yes I have a terrible sleep schedule. I always stay up until at least 2am. I'm slowly dying as a result but I refuse to change), I looked out my window and BAM. there were TWO deer outside. It was the best moment of my life (at that point). And it's funny becuase I thought seeing TWO deer at once was lucky and a lot of them to see at once, but the other night I saw 8 outside my window. EIGHT! Man, back in florida I was missing out. Never going back there. ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ state","March 8","true","107.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

It's a bit of a reminder of the Left for Dead series since you can play a mode that allows you to be one of those Night time terrors that I myself prefer to stay away from unless I'm really feeling froggy. You can hack, slash, shoot, trap zombies. Heck you can kill them in so many different ways that It takes a ton of gamesplay to get bored and the Parkour abilities I think, are exhilerating.\n\nHowever, One downside that I found made the game not so much less enjoyable but more of a chore if you want to complete everything Is the mechanics for shooting weapons. I couldn't put my finger on it exactly but when using guns, it really didn't feel like any FPS of shooting game I've played so I had to get used to the shooting mechanics. It would prob help If you could fire guns in true FPS mode with iron sights or sights.\n\nAll In all. I would give this game a 4 out 5\nI would definately recommend this game.

All what I write here is MY feels on the game. By the way sorry for my english, I'm from Poland :D.\nImportant note:\nI haven't completed the whole game yet because it's so fun and I don't want to complete it so fast :).\n\nIntroduction:\nDying Light is an open world zombie survival horror FPS game with great parkour elements. Game is like a mix of Mirror's Edge parkour style with Dead Island slashing zombies gameplay style. Game feautures 4 player Co-op and you can complete whole campaign with your buddies or random players. There is also 4vs1 Be the zombie mode which lets play as the night hunter :).\nStory:\nI don't want to spoil anything, so I will tell you only first minutes of the game but just in case SPOILER ALERT!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are Kyle Crane, GRE agent with special classified mission which you will see on yourself ;). You are dropped to Harran city but the situation got little complicated. I won't tell you the rest because story is interesting and you need to see it on yourself ;).\n\nI don't want to get you bored so quickly so I will go straight to Pros and Cons :).\nPros:\n+ Amazing and satisfying gameplay that gives a lot of fun.\n+ Parkour is AWESOME and it's better than in Mirror's Edge :D.\n+ Interesting story( at least for me :) ).\n+ Very good optimization.\n+ Nice graphics and sound effects.\n+ Good soundtrack.\n+ Co-op and Be the zombie mode.\n+ Atmosphere.\n+ Good voice acting.\n+ Lots of secrets and Easter Eggs.\n+ Many little side stories.\n+ Main and side quests.\n+ Day and night cycle which completely changes the gameplay.\n+ Weapons wear out.\n+ EXP system and character skill tree.\nand more :D\n\nCons:\n- Lip sync is  sometimes weird :D.\nI can't remember more. Maybe some little bugs that are hard to find ;).\n\nFinally I wanted to say to all that have doubts about Dying Light . BUY this game, it's so EPIC, you won't regret this decision :).\nThank you for getting to this point of my review :).\nP.S. If you don't need cards from Dying Light I will be honored to take care of them :).","February 15, 2015","true","88.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacktes/recommended/239140/","jacktes","Res","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jacktes/","543 products in account","A joyously fun game with a lot of glaring issues holding it back from true greatness.\n\nIt brings to the table an exceptionally enjoyable combat system which feels like what Dead Island's combat should have been in the first place, while adding the wonderous addition of parkour elements to the combat and in turn making everything feel much more dynamic, though combat slowly becomes easier over time against normal zombies, but it gets balanced out by ne, stronger special infected. The infected slowly get introduced throughout the story and become part of the open world thereafter. Though combat can become repetitive and frustrating at times, with some enemies taking more hits than they really should.\n\nThe storyline is very predictable and fairly poorly written, though at the same time oddly charming and engaging in a Resident Evil kinda way. Where while the story is ♥♥♥♥, you still wanna see it through just to find out what horrible line or event will be demonstrated next. Not much else to say here.\n\nQuests are decently varied though sometimes a bit repetitive in nature. There are a lot of basic fetch quests, but there's also quite a few scripted story based quests with an interesting layout and areas exclusive to the mission. Side quests feel like other story quests instead of basic small side things. They can become fairly engaging and enjoyable, though yet again may become repetitive.\n\nThe parkour system is implemnted quite flawlessly and is one of the best elements of the game, it feels silky smooth gliding from building to building, or from zombie to a roof of a far. Some of the most enjoyable parkour elements I've experienced within a game to date.\n\nMy absolute favorite element of the game is the nighttime though. It turns it into one of the most threatening and intereting experiences within open world games, an experience usually only seen within scripted linear experiences.\nThere's nothing more exhillerating than quietly sneaking past the large infected to get to an air drop, before being seen and having to run like all hell to a safe house from a horde before being taken down and killed. Absolutely wonderous.\n\nVisually the game is absolutely gorgeous. Wonderful lighting, wonderful shading, wonderful models, wonderful animations. Sometimes shoddy texture work does not detract from the beautiful world Techland has crafted.\n\nPerformance wise the game runs alright currently. Though pre-patch it ran like complete ♥♥♥ on hardware that should be able to run it perfectly fine. THough even post-patch it still has issues utilising all CPU cores and using SLI properly.\nThere's also the fact that AMD/ATI users are basically ♥♥♥♥ed by Techland's optimisation for their hardware.  WHich is a major issue.\n\nThe game sadly lacks its own charm and personality. Instead feeling like another new AAA game. There's nothing truly memorable about it. Dead Island had some ridiculous memorable stuff such as Sam B, the wonderous jumping animation and the silly yet unique style. This game has Crane unsure of what to do before proceeding to be silent during actual gameplay. While Dead Island had the characters doing their own ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ yet hilarious one-liners, screams and moans.\nIt just feels oddly generic.\n\nOverall it's a game full of ideas, some which it fulfills and some which it stumbles with. It takes a lot of elements from a lot of games, and does some well and some poorly. There's a lot of technical issues and the game can become fairly repetitive.\n\nThough ultimately, what is here is a very entertaining and ambitous, though not memorable, game from Techland.\n\nI give it a 7.5/10","January 30, 2015","true","52.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I played through the whole game with a friend and I can say there wasn't a moment where I was getting bored of it, My friend and I mostly trying to avoid the main quests and mostly just screwing around/doing side quests had a blast and thought it was very unfortunate when there wren't a many side quests to do in the Old Town part, but the recent addition of Hard mode made it 10x more challenging and 10x more fun. We honestly could say we were getting bored of the game when we were able to one hit Goons, but with hard mode that was instantly fixed, even the normal zombies were made a challenge.\n\nThe story focuses on Kyle Crane who is an agent sent in by the GRE to get files back from survivors who supposedly stole them, but to Crane's findings they actually were not the ones who stole them and so in turn he started helping them out, and thats pretty much how the introduction to the game starts. The story itself has a couple cliche moments but not enough to make the story predictable. There are a good amount of plot twists and parts that are honestly very sad when you realise what is happening.\n\nOverall I would rate it:\n8/10 Singleplayer\n10/10 Multiplayer\nSeriously, the addition of Co-op was probably the best thing this game has.\n\nMy friend personally gives it:\n7/10 Singleplayer\n10/10 Multiplayer\n\nWe have gotten a full enjoyment of the game and I can say that all these hours I've spent in this game are well worth it.\nThanks for reading.","March 14, 2015","true","70.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","2"

So far, as of typing this out, I have enjoyed myself well beyond what one could. The atmosphere is enjoyable. The game presents a challenge that most games do not provide. The storyline has been nothing short of immersive.\n\nThe game is essentially if Dead Rising and Borderlands had a child and somehow Mirror's Edge was romantically involved.\n\nMy ratings so far?\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nReason for rating: There are a few graphical glitches that could be easily remedied with a bit of investigative coding and some of the options are much too overpowering that could be toned down a pinch or be given an option for a lower setting. But for this, the natural bloom and shading makes the game much more menacing when playing, especially during the night in-game, which is -exactly- what I'd expect from something with a dramatic, eerie toned game like this.\n\nStoryline: 7/10\nReason for rating: To start, the negatives are far outweighed by the positives. The storyline was engaging, however short it was, though my gripes with certain parts could be very notable, further dragging down my potential rating for this section. Subtlety felt lacking in certain parts of the game, especially during the end. Though the aspect was expected, perhaps different approaches could have been made to meet the main points in the story. With that being said, the storyline kept me hooked until one of the end missions.\n\nGameplay: 8.75/10\nReason for rating: So far, the enjoyment out of searching for secrets, better gear, and beyond, is what makes the game for me. I absolutely adore open worlds and a good questing system, as it allows for the ability to immerse yourself further by forcing you to explore and see the city of Harran as it is now and get ideas of what it was prior. The crafting system feels familiar yet different in how it's approached. My only bother with crafting like this is that I cannot set macros or access some form of GUI to craft on the fly naturally.\n\n\nMy major gripe about this game isn't about the single player aspect, but the multiplayer. When poking and prodding at the "Be The Zombie" game mode, the biggest issue I noticed was the ease of absolutely demolishing the zombie player. While, yes, a good player will not be killed too easily as the Night Hunter, the ability to play "well" is based on what abilities you have at your disposal in comparison to your [up-to-four] human rival[/s]. This makes leveling up extremely hard as the Hunter if you're up against any more than one human player unless the players are foolish enough to split up or you're abusing the system with friends.\nBalance is a -must- in any game, no matter the mode. Without allowing more health to the Hunter with more players in a server and allowing any level of player into a server, the mode leaves much to be desired and makes it painful to play.\n\nOverall, this game, as it stands, despite my biggest spit towards it, is definitely up there in my biggest recommendations.\n\n\nEDIT: Made amendments to my Storyline rating.\n\nADDENDUM: Will add much more when I can buy more DLC to give my view on the game as it stands.","May 23, 2015","true","129.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

I had expected it to be almost like L4D2 With checkpoints and bland zombie killing But it suprised me with it being completely open world with side quests and missions available, It's exactly like single player but with 4 people, Very well Done.\n\nOverall Experience: 10/10\nABSOLUTELY visually pleasing in Day and night cycles, They hit the nail on the head when it comes to the dark and eerie side when exploring in the night, it actually has me on the edge of my seat screaming at my montor when the volatile zombies come after you and it's just an escape for your life.\n\n11\10 MUST buy.","January 29, 2015","true","27.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

There are even some weapons that can't actually even break in real life.\n- No suppressors to craft/use on guns.\n- Stealth is really, but REALLY poor in this game. When you sneak up behind someone you can't snap his neck or even kill him with 1 slash in the head. They are supposed to die right on the impact because they are not aware of it.\n- Low presence and finding rate of firearms in the game. You simply can't make a zombie game without firearms. Guns are rare in the game and they said that snipers would be available. I couldn't find a single sniper throughout the whole game. Its more a hack and slash game. It gets pretty repetetive slashing zombies all day. I already heard rumors about a DLC weapon pack, if its true I just have one thing to say. Please, no.\n- Theres no primitive way to survive, like making bows by using a hatch to get wood from trees. Its all about scavenging.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI recommend this game, but it still needs a lot of improvement. This game has a lot to prove due to its active developement team that works on the complaints of players and future additions to the game.","January 30, 2015","true","19.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","5"

Considering this is Techlands first big project, the little issues that do exist are excusable. I'm very much looking forward to their future projects.\n\nMy overall marks are:\nGraphics - 9/10\nGameplay - 9/10 (would have been 10 if it wasn't for AI issues)\nStory - 8/10\n\nOverall, this is a great game that has enjoable combat mechanics and a decent story. My one other issue is under spoiler alert, which is to do with the end game.\n\n****Spoiler Alert****\nSomewhat disappointed that the final fight amounted to hitting certain buttons when told to in an interactive cut scene. It would not have been hard to design the final fight to be a full on melee battle or gun fight. However, the lead up to that fight was intense and exciting.\n\n\nUpdate 28/1/15:\nStill no patch but have managed to get the game to run with an acceptable 30 to 45 fps while out in the open world. Did this by dropping the view distance down to nothing and turning off HBAO. Enjoying the game now, just wish I didn't have to compromise on the graphics.\n\nIn terms of the game, it is pretty good. I have some gripe with the AI of human NPC's, when going for an air drop I just throw molotovs at them; the NPC's that don't get hit by the molotov just stand there and watch their buddies burn to death. Also, some of the zombie AI is iffy, I have seen human NPCs stand next to zombies, side by side, neither of them attacking the other. The only other negative is that most of the male characters look the same and some of the voices do not fit the faces, so much so that it is comical on occasions.\n\nBut the game is enjoyable, killing zombies feels good although human AI is predictable. The parkour element is well put together. It may seem that I have more negative to say about the game than I do positive but at the time of writing this I have only played for a few hours. The purpose of this update to my review is to give some feedback on the game itself as my original review was about its poor optimisation.\n\nAt this stage, even with all its flaws I do recommend this game. I will extend my review at a later date.\n\nBeware AMD GPU users, the game may not run very well with your GPU, even if you have a high quality one like I do.\n\n\n\nOriginal Review:\nRight now the game is unplayable as when I am outside my FPS drops below 25. Running with an AMD FX8350 and Radeon R9 270x. Seems to me from looking at the rest of the reviews, this game has been poorly optimized for AMD systems, regardless of what all the Nvidia fanboys are saying.\n\n\nAll those having the same issue, go to this link:\nhttp://en.support.techland.pl/support/solutions/articles/4000042573-creating-dxdiag-file\n\nSend them a dxdiag file to help them fix these problems more quickly.","January 27, 2015","true","47.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","20"

The movement feels abit restrictive and in some parts...unrealistic. But you won't notice this unless you are capable of parkouring Offline.\nThe combat feels similar to skyrim, but not entirely the same, you cannot do magic here and you are limited to holding 1 item in our hand at a time.\nThe scare aspect to this...it's just meh.\nThere is weapon detoriation in this game, but unlike most other games..you weapon only has a certain number of repairs it can do until it is worthless.\nThe death mechanic in this game is a joke, you only lose points, which by the way are easily earned back.\nThe story is sum'ed up to "bad-guy vs good-guy" cliche.\nThe online is great for Co-op campaigns but it sucks for zombie invading. Co-op campaigns get a average of 1-3 peps joining you. Trying to invade someone's gets a average of 1-2 games to invade per 10 refreshes.\nThe difficulty is none existant.\nThe maps are clearly designed give you that feeling of "I'm in a city" but I didn't feel that, I just felt like I was running through a maze most of the time. But the rooftops makes travel alot faster, too fast in my book...Oh and the slums map seems like it gotten the most attention, old town and such just seem like they were rushed.\nthe lack of attire and character choices just bothers me. I like being able to play other characters and have many costumes, not be restricted to just 1 character and like only 10 or so costumes to pick from.\nThe crafting is shares similarities to The Last of Us.\nThe game only autosaves...there is no "save button" here. The game will save whenever you either sleep or get a loading screen or unlock a safe house or when you complete a task.\nThe game also has no fast-travel, so most of your game will consist of running/ jumping.\nLastly, the client. The client is stable. During my playtime I never had the game crash once. But, the game does refuse to start in fullscreen mode for me...Oh and the game only works properly for Nvidia Graphics cards, Amd is outta luck here.\nTl:dr\nit's a good zombie hunting game with parkour. just not a good story driven game.","February 19, 2015","true","33.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

So far I have barely played into 15% of the story as the sidequests have be going without it feeling like a chore. Day/Night cycle works very subtly and works well. Personally, night does scare me. Even knowing the Volatiles position as they're marked on your minimap you will constantly check your back and when you get chased it becomes very tense. I find the night to be quite balanced, as the volatiles run faster than you but climb slower so you have to take advantage of the mirrors-edge style parkour that the game perfectly placed in, making it a much more interesting version of Dead Island with the free roaming aspect of it - quite unique to input a parkour system into a zombie game, but it was definitely a good mashup. I myself am not even a horror fan and I enjoy this game - it doesn't try to be scary, and usually isn't - fans of Action/RPG games will definitely enjoy this, even if you found Dead Island to be dull.","February 4, 2015","true","43.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/239140/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","I'd appreciate it if you checked out my blog, where I do reviews, giveaways, and more: https://gandhigaming.wordpress.com/\n\n\n\nI think we can all agree, 2014 was definitely not the best year for gaming by a long shot. And even though it gave us gems like Alien: Isolation or Shadow of Mordor, it was arguably one of the worst years of gaming ever. Dying Light is the first "major" release of 2015, and I was worried for this game because I thought the 2014 curse would still linger on and affect this game.\n\nLuckily, I was wrong. Very, very wrong.\n\nNow, although I enjoy Dying Light, it has various flaws to the game that doesn't make it the ultimate zombie experience we were all looking for. But that being said, Dying Light is a great game and an awesome way to start 2015, and it makes me think that this year will be much better than 2014.\n\nGraphics\nProbably one of the best things to Dying Light, the graphics look absolutely stunning on PC. Every little bit to the game is detailed. Don't believe me? Check out some of these screenshots I took:\n\nhttp://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/541896836997986793/D10F15E8921F2BD6BFF6FB7E2191E84224205244/\nhttp://cloud-4.steamusercontent.com/ugc/541895566612870024/11FFA702F3E89B9735B1A77FC8647D96F91D5BD2/\n\nThis game continues to wow me with how beautiful the game is and even rivals modded Skyrim. The atmosphere, which may seem to make the game look like a generic 90000000 zombies vs. 1 man is actually a bit dark and depressing. No, it's not anywhere near as bad as say The Last of Us, but it isn't cheery. And when night comes, things get intense quick. You can barely see, which means you'll have to use your flashlight, but then in the shadows a Volatile (a superzombie of sorts) will be watching you and trying to strike you. On my very first night, I was running back to my home base, which was somewhat far away, and my heart was racing when I heard one of those things scream. I didn't bother looking back and I had an adrenaline rush. Luckily, I made it back. But this proves that the nights are hectic, intense, and heart-racing. The graphics and atmosphere to Dying Light are some of the best I've seen in a while, and it was done right.\n\nGameplay\nDying Light is a bit different from zombie games in the fact that it uses parkour to get around. And this part I was very worried about, because all the parkour games I've played had god awful parkour, not to name any names. And for the first 5-6 hours or so, I thought my fears came true. However, I got adjusted to the controls and it turns out that all of it is silky smooth. The parkour is great, and jumping from one building to another never felt so nerve-racking and exhilarating. The combat is also good in this game. Instead of going in guns blazing, you have to plan your way to get through a horde of zombies. You can sneak past them with firecrackers or some other distraction, take them out from a distance and use molotovs, or maybe you are just that crazy and you want to go in and kill them all (although you probably won't survive to kill three). The game is over the top in some ways, but it still keeps a sense of realism and doesn't ruin the fun. For example, you have combat stamina and your character can get worn out, giving the zombies an edge. Also, guns are extremely rare to find, and I didn't get one until at least 9hrs into the game, and bullets are even rarer. Weapons can break, you can upgrade them, etc. As for the night mode, it is only scripted to change in the earlier missions, but then the time is free and night can come at any moment. The game is difficult to an extent, the other zombie types make the game much more interesting at night, and the list could go on and on and on. My one issue, however, is that once you get your hands on more powerful items, the late game becomes very easy and the experience can be ruined, killing the atmosphere and immersion. But besides that, overall, the gameplay is smooth and it was executed well.\n\nStory\nIt's pretty obvious that this would be the game's low point. I figured this would have a cheap story, and I was right. A one-dimensional protagonist I can't seem to become interested in, and one-dimensional characters everywhere actually. Jade is the stereotypical heroine, with her "I'm 1000% more badass than you" style, Dr. Zere is all about "saving the world" and doesn't get any further than that, Rais is a brutal leader (you don't say?), must I continue? It's a generic save-the-world plot that I can't get into. However, I will give credit to the story for being depressing, because many people (won't name anyone specific) die left and right. Few zombie games seem to understand that it's no easy feat, and so kudos to the writers for keeping that in mind. I don't want to elaborate any further because I'm sure you know where I'm going with this. Generic story, one dimensional characters, boring protagonist...\n\nAudio\nThe audio is good but nothing to write home about. The zombies actually sound somewhat scary and not silly, so that's something worth noting. The voice actors aren't bad either, but the characters are still one dimensional. I also like the fact that the soundtrack doesn't use guitars to make it seem depressing or heavy metal/electronic mix to make me mistaken this game for Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. Yes, it has a mostly electronic soundtrack, but it isn't upbeat. It's slow, somewhat soothing, and fits the mood. Not only that, but because the game takes place in Turkey, it adds a few personal touches to make the soundtrack even better.\n\nReplayability\nThe replayability seems somewhat good. Co-Op is a blast to play and can bring hours and hours of fun, plus finding all the clever easter eggs can be quite enjoyable. You can also try and get all the god-tier weapons and then kill the most deadly zombies in 1-2 hits with no problem. At this point, this is where the replayability begins to fade. As I stated earlier, once you get all the good stuff, the game becomes too easy and kills any atmosphere or suspense. Not only that, but Be the Zombie mode was one of the key reasons I bought this game and it turned out to be very boring and unbalanced. Playing as the zombie is fun, but the survivors with Survivor Sense already won pretty much and it ruins the stealth and suspense buildup the game mode attempts to offer. The replayability though isn't that bad and I may play a few hours postgame to do a few things.\n\nVerdict\nDying Light is not the best game I've played in 2015 so far. However, it's still a blast to play and worth the money if you're fine with a few flaws with the game. In the end, I recommend Dying Light to any big zombie gamers out there, and I'd be more than happy to buy this game again and replay it through.\n\nGraphics- 10/10\nGameplay- 8.5/10\nStory- 4.0/10\nAudio- 7.0/10\nReplayability- 6.0/10\n\n.:7.9/10:.\n\n+Smooth parkour\n+Stunning graphics\n+Fun co-op\n+Intense night mode\n+Keeps a sense of realism\n\n-Be the Zombie mode is boring and unbalanced\n-Generic story with one-dimensional characters and boring protagonist\n-Late game becomes very easy and ruins all suspense","April 5, 2015","true","23.0"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It was pretty good right? Well the fine folks at Techland have released another tasty undead treat into the world, a stealthy, action, parkour, survival zombie treat in the form of Dying Light.\n\n\nCity of the Dead\n\nIn Dying Light the undead plague has emerged, but the powers that be have responded quickly and contained it to a small area, the fictional city of Harran.\n\nQuarantined off from the rest of the world and relying on vital air drops courtesy of the Global Relief Effort, the situation inside the city continues to deteriorate, and if HBO’s The Walking Dead has taught us anything, it’s that you don’t just need to worry about the undead, other groups of survivors can be for more deadly.\n\nThis rings true in Dying Light as a gang mentality has gripped the crumbling city of Harran where two prominent groups are vying for supplies whilst struggling to survive the undead, but all is not lost...\n\n\nKeep Taking the Pills\n\nWhilst there isn’t a cure, there is a medicine (Antizen) that the infected can take which delays the turning, as long as they keep taking Antizen they’ll be ok, however the only source of this medication comes from the supply planes flying relief missions over the city.\n\n\nGoing Down\n\nThe game opens with your character preparing to parachute into Harran whilst receiving instructions from his employer over a radio; it seems that there is a survivor in the city that holds some very sensitive information, information which cannot be made public and it’s your job to retrieve it.\n\nYou’ll then find yourself falling through the sky towards the infested city, but things don’t start off well at all!\n\nA hard landing and an encounter with the locals (both the alive and dead varieties) later and you’ll be bitten, infected and dragged to the first safe zone of the game. This is where you man hunt truly begins.\n\n\nRunning Man\n\nFrom this point you’ll be meeting new characters and trying to earn their trust by running missions for them, and I literally mean running, the big thing that sets Dying Light apart from the Dead Island titles is the “Free Running” game mechanic.\n\nYou’ll be tearing across roof tops, leaping alleyways and scaling the sides of buildings.\n\nThe safest way to stay alive in Harran is to stay off the ground; a casual walk down the street will see you surrounded and overwhelmed by zombies quicker than you can say “Assassins Creed of the Dead”.\n\n\nLong Jump\n\nIn the increasingly crowded zombie gaming genre this parkour style of play is hugely refreshing and better still it is exceptionally well implemented.\n\nWith a gamepad in hand, you’ll find the controls are really dialled in, look where you want to go, hit the jump button and there’s a good chance you’ll make it, it’s not only intuitive, it makes you feel like a free running bad ♥♥♥!\n\n\nDo me a Favour?\n\nThe missions themselves are the usual mix of “go there”, “kill that” and “fetch this” quests that we know and love, completion of which will give you the experience you’ll need to level up your various abilities enabling you to hit a little harder and jump a little further, you might even learn some new skills along the way.\n\n\nBe Crafty\n\nDying Light also boasts a pretty deep crafting system. You’ll be rummaging through bins and patting down corpses like a perverted Womble looking for the things that every day folk leave behind.\nThere are plenty of crafting recipes to learn, from Med Kits to Molotov’s there’s a plethora of useful items and weapons just waiting for your crafty hands to bring them into existence.\nI can’t overstate how useful a well placed Molotov is when you’re in a tight spot.\n\n\nZombie Farm\n\nAll zombies are not born equal in Dying Light, the recently infected will move a hell of lot quicker than the common stale variety of zombie you’ll see shambling around.\nYou’ll discover zombies that spit, zombies that explode, radioactive zombies in hazmat suits, and plenty of others, Hazmat is a dangerous place to explore at any time of day.\n\n\nThe Dead of Night\n\nBut at night, that’s when things really become scary. The whole atmosphere of the game changes when night falls, it’s much tenser and you really want to stay out of site, stealthily moving from one secluded spot to another. You really don’t want to attract any attention at night.\n\nThere are super fast zombies lurking in the darkness and you’re going to have trouble outrunning them. The pitch dark makes your parkour aerobatics much more difficult to pull off as you rush through the streets, the feeble pool of light from your torch dancing along the landscape in front of you.\n\n\nSleep It Off\n\nBeing outside at night is a serious business, but you do have the option to sleep through the night in a safe zone if it all becomes a little too much, although some missions will require you to go out at night, there’s no avoiding it completely\n\n\nDead Pretty\n\nIn addition to the daytime being slightly less stressful, being out in the sunlight gives you a chance to drink in the scenery, the city of Harran can be a visually stunning place to explore.\n\nFrom the sun bleached rooftops to the ominous darkness of the underpasses, everything about Harran exudes atmosphere, the whole city feels alive, which is no easy feat for a city full of the dead!\n\n\nDead End\n\nIf the Dead Island games were the warm up act then Dying Light is the main event.\nWith  glossy visuals, satisfying combat mechanics and an outstanding parkour system, Dying Light is a fantastic game and the city of Harran is a beautifully realised setting begging to be explored.\n\nYou should take the time to visit, just don't go for the night life, it's dead.\n\n\n\nFor the full review and others please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com","April 11, 2015","true","14.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

The ability repertoire ends up a bit limited though and different weapon types don't do enough to change things up. Upgrade and crafting systems are both underwhelming and nothing that interesting can be done with them. Honestly, even no crafting system at all would be better than this because you wouldn't have to pause to craft mundane items all the time.\n\nThe first impression is good but you may quickly lose interest once you realize that most of the game is spent doing fetch quests and lockpicking containers for pieces of string and vendor trash.\nI'd still recommend trying it out after a few price cuts, at least if you have someone to co-op with.

The concept was excellent, and a lot of the time, the game delivered.\n\nPros:\n- Excellent visuals got me standing on a rooftop just looking towards the rising sun (just before jumping down and bolting because some ♥♥♥♥♥ *** Viral is chasing me), although, I did have to run on medium textures as the mere 2GB frame buffer of my GTX 960 (don't even say it) had the game stuttering\n- Free-running mechanic is, in my opinion, the best of any video game (beating AC and Mirror's Edge)\n- Excellent combat system, making me think about how to best use the available stamina to either kill all of the zombies in my vicinity or run\n- Wide range of weapons (plus some interesting modifications)\n- Hilarious drop kick\n- Brilliant Easter Eggs (my favourite was the Plants Vs. Zombies one)\n- Interesting variation of zombies (demolishers were a particular pain in the ***)\n- Excellent community had me make a couple of Steam friends\n- Brilliant PvP gameplay, really gets you thinking about tactics to get the kills (especially on the zombie side)\n- Good skill tree system allows well progressed development of in-game skills\n\nCons:\n- Mediocre story with a disappointing QTE ending (although, in terms of plot, I don't think the ending was all bad, just enough to want me coming back for more)\n- Disappointing characters with no real depth (I'm looking at you, Crane and Jade). I just didn't feel connected to the characters (although, I found myself a little moved at  Rahim's  death)\n- Dumb ♥♥♥ villain with a philosphy and physique ripped straight out of Far Cry 3\n- ****ing torch\n- Lack of content in terms of missions (approximately 45 in total)\n- Little emphasis on stealth (especially with human combatants)\n- Lack of character customisation, possible inclusion of character creation (although, with developer tools being released, at least outfits should be fair game)\n\nI would have liked to see more focus on specialisation rather than maxing out all skill trees, would have allowed for a greater variety of gameplay styles (I'm more in the mindset to avoid zombies and hit hard and fast on reduced numbers when I have to).\n\nI love this game, and I will continue playing it in coop and PvP. I sincerely hope they release a DLC continuing with the story (or branching off and creating a new one). I don't agree with the hate on this game's ending.  Going to Dr. Camden and curing the virus would have been way more anti-climatic than the current one.\n\nProps to Techland for the excellent game (and leaving the ****heads at Deep Silver for the disappointment that was Dead Island).","March 27, 2015","true","105.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I am a sucker for detail, and this game really has it, you can really feel how much polishing and effort went into this game, the physics based combat provides plenty of fun ways to kill zombies, mostly consisting of kicking and drop kicking, the character movement feels smooth and is genuinely fun. The skills and leveling feel very rewarding, running around at night is scary but it's made worth it in XP gains. This game is a 10/10 when it comes to gameplay, not many games provide the level of satisfaction that this game does.\n\nPerformance is this games weakest point and what initially kept me from buying this game. On a R9 270x my fps gets pretty bad fluctuations, the good thing is that it's only in the beggining where it's unbearable, after you get away from the towers then gameplay becomes smooth.\n\nThe story, quests, and dialog feels 'realistic' and interesting although being a little predictable. My only real complaint is that I recieved a quest to collect 3 100lb bus batteries, the giver made specials notes about it being heavy and requiring ape like strength, but when collecting the batteries they went into my inventory just like any other item.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gleb_vga/recommended/239140/","gleb_vga","gleb_vga","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gleb_vga/","638 products in account","One playthrough, just finished.\n\nOK, this is a solid First-Person Errand Boy Simulator. With a zombie theme.\nThe general gameplay is of a well-known type: Run across town, get things done, don't get killed and don't kill yourself by accident. The story is pretty good, especially so for the zombie-themed game, the atmosphere, especially in the beginning, is fantastic - later you'll become a sort of Conan the Barbarian in the Zombieland, so the appeal of the grim and agressive zombie-infested environment will move from appealing to tedious. As usual, I'd say. Still, quite enjoyable, solidly build and exciting game.\n\nGood things:\n+Mostly nice and compelling story with a good pace. The protagonist, Crane, is, simply put, a nice guy to have around when you play. He is quite vocal, to the point that his attitude sometimes happen to mirror the player's emotions - oh, the frustration of moving through the zombie hordes to get one stupid keycard... it almost brings down the forth wall, in a good way. Also, he is not entirely stupid, which is a grace - you won't feel that "Oh snap, why my character's idiotic perosnality is forcing me to do all those dumb things?!" feeling all that often, only episodically, and those can be forgiven, perhaps. The antagonist is a wink to the Far Cry 3 "madness and chaos philosopy" with a bit of a refreshing twist.\n+Crafting is not too sophisticated, it doesn't stand in your way, just look at your blueprints page from time to time to get better weapons, as you accumulate necessery resources. You may indulge yourself in a hunt for specific crafting parts, but they'll all come to you in time, all the same.\n+Parkour mechanics really shine here. Almost every horizontal surface that's not electrified or covered with wire is good for climbing. Just jump and grab whatever you reach - there's almost always something. No focus-breaking "oooh, grab me!" highlits, no cumbersome controls - less frustrating dumb missteps. Personally, I tend to be wary of parkour in games, but here it's actually enjoyable! The addition of the grappling hook helps mitigate the tediousness at the later stages.\n+Night/Day change. Night is scary, especially at the early stages. Not only there are super-deadly Volatiles out to hunt at night, but the darkness also makes is much harder to navigate, do freerunning and deal with zombies of general variety.\n+Character progression. You get points for different kinds of general gameplay activities and level up often enogh, just as you go around doing things. The extra abilites you earn are useful and evern add some fun to the repetitive action of zombie-hacking/evasion.\n+Just big enough map.\n+Nice visuals.\n+There are different types of zombies. Some of them can even do parkour, so don't expect just to walk above their heads!\n+Pretty solid ending.\n+Challenges are entirely optional, for those who are into that sort of thing.\n\nA bit of ranting about not so good things:\n-The general failures of zombie theme are here, although masked masterfully. The number of zombies doesn't really add up with any estimate you can make regarding the number of city residents, at least if you count the houses in the areas you can access.  Zombie design gets repetitive despite all the efforts of dressing them differently. And yes, judging from what can be seen of the zombies in the game, heavy military vechicles and gradual refortification of the city districts would deal with them... all in all, the whole zombie theme is not all that believable, as usual. But we still love the genre!)\n-Towards the end, the story starts to drag a little bit, although it does get good for the final moments.\n-As already noted above, your protagonist will become the heroic zombie trasher, hacking them with wickedly modified blades and stomping their heads with mighty army boots. Ah, also, you'll be Batman with that grappling hook of yours.\nSo, for the special story missions, which are supposed to be hard, the game will awkwardly strip you of your power by suddenly forcing you to deal with infection-caused exhaustion. Just ten minutes ago you kicked any ♥♥♥ in town, and now you are a shambling wreck, just in time for the story twist.  Yeah, and no grappling hook, make do with jumps! Oh, come on!\n\nIn summary, surpisingly good game, definitely worth a try!\n\n","February 8, 2015","true","43.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I'm also tired of zombie games that are made by poor and bad developers. Dying Light however, is a good game. Though made by the creators of Dead Island which might turn off most of you guys.\n\nIf you're worried that this game will be not worth your time because it's made by the same creators of Dead Island, drop your worries right now. This is a good game for real this time. To be honest, I also like Dead Island a bit despite it's unfinished quality.\n\nNow before I continue, let me put a spoiler warning because, I'm going to be explaining the story right now. Skip this if you don't want the story spoiled.\n\n**SPOILER ALERT**\n\nYou play as Kyle Crane. Working for the GRE which, I think is a secret government agency. Your mission being you have to receive private information from your target and kill him. As you arrive in town, things go to hell and you get infected. After looking for a shipment containing crates of antizen which surpresses the symptoms of the infection, GRE contacts you saying that you have to burn some the crates. Kyle didn't want to, but was forced to. Hours of doing favours for the survivors that saved him, he's now in a constant battle between the trust of the survivors that saved him and his boss on the radio.\n\n*END*\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay now. To be expected, it plays a lot like Dead Island with new features. There's the epic parkour system. If you've played Assassin's Creed before, it's kind of like that except in 1st person. The game starts out a little slow as you're really vulnerable to the zombies when you first start out. Especially when it turns dark and super zombies start patrolling the streets.\n\nIf one super zombie spots you while you're out at night, you better get out of there right now. There's no sense in running since they run faster than you. They can also parkour like you can. Fortunately, there are ways of dealing with them to prevent them from chasing you.\n\nAs you survive, you get different experience points depending on what you've been doing. If you run, jump and climb a lot, you'll get Agility XP. This allows you to perform better tricks at getting around the environment. If you hit and kill zombies, you'll get Combat XP. Which allows you to perform better and deadlier attacks. Yes you do get Combat XP just by hitting them so, there's no need to finish the zombie off. Though you get extra Combat XP for doing so.\n\nFinally, there's Survival XP. This is achieved through helping out your survivors. Which include completing quests, bringing them supplies from airdrops or helping other survivors that are in trouble. You'll also get Survival XP based on how long you survived through the night without dying. Oh and there's one good reason about being out at night. If you can stay out of the way of the super zombies, the XP you gain will be doubled for Agility and Combat. Like if you get 15 Agility XP for climbing over a fence at day, you'll get 30 instead if you do it at night. But remember, night is very difficult.\n\nNow the combat is just like Dead Island. Smack at the zombies face until it stops moving or its head explodes in to a gooey red paste. Though don't swing too much or else you'll tire out. Now here's another good thing. There's regular stamina and combat stamina. Regular stamina is only used when you sprint and run around while combat stamina is only used whenever you swing your weapon. This is good because, there will be times where you'll have to dodge out of the way whenever you run out of combat stamina. No dodging doesn't use combat stamina thankfully. Also like Dead Island, you can add elemental upgrades to your weapons and as well as modifications that add bonus stats to your weapons. Though weapons only have a few slots of modding and weapons will degrade until they break if used too much. Not to mention they only have a few number of repairs before repairing does absolutely nothing. Once you used all the repair slots on the weapon, it's time to get a replacement. Not everything lasts forever and this is especially true to items in real life.\n\nThe graphics is amazing. The sun glares beautifully at your face and the destroyed and dark urban scenery really makes you feel sad for it. The sound is great too and it can even make you scared and really make you get goosebumps. Which I think is cool because, it adds a good horror element to it. The characters of the game also make you want to care for them. They have a good purpose for staying alive and even the main villain on the game makes you wish the guy was dead. He does a fantastic job at being a villain.\n\nThe co-op is also good. Running around the environment, completing quests and killing zombies together is really fun indeed. Also, there's a new mode called "Be the Zombie" mode. This allows players to play a super zombie that also gets stronger just like when you play the campaign. These player controlled zombies are tough if you're very sneaky. You have to be a predator. Stalking your prey and waiting for the exact moment to strike. Not to mention this allows players to invade other player's games. It's just like in Dark Souls whenever you get invaded by a red spirit. Though you do have the choice of turning off invasion like a pansy if you want.\n\nAlso the special zombies from Dead Island are also back. The slow walking biters, the fast running infected, the big zombie that wields a big stone rebar, the acid spitting spitter and the exploding bomber. These add more to the difficulty and tension to the game as you need to be careful when facing these special infected.\n\nNow you guys might be wondering what are the bad things to this game? You make it sound like it's one of the best games ever. Well, that may be true but, you do have a solid point. It's time to get down to the nit picky and discuss the bad parts.\n\nAs I've said, the game starts out slow and it's a bit difficult. The game only gets more interesting the further you get through the story. You also can't do co-op unless you complete the prolouge chapter first as well.\n\nThe game also has a few frames per second issues so you'll have to tone down the graphics just a bit to get a stable FPS.\n\nThe controls on the keyboard can take a while to get used to but, fortunately you can also use a 360 controller if you want.\n\nThe other bad factor is that this game borrows a lot of mechanics from other games. The obvious one being Assassin's Creed with it's parkour system. You can also perform a leap of faith if you see a pile of blue trashbags. It also has a mission where you have to climb up an antenna tower and turn the power on once you reach the top. Which is very similar to Far Cry 3 when you climb up a tower to reveal part of the world map. Thankfully, this only happens once after completing the quest for it.\n\nYou'll be grinding for XP a lot if you want to have any advantage at surviving this game. Even more if you do things during the day time. So this might turn off some players that don't want to spend hours trying to get stronger.\n\nThe co-op is really hit and miss. Since there's a lot of players that have already gotten very far into the story and are a lot stronger than you are. Which means, the co-op is not really balanced to fit newer players. Also, if these kinds of players give you overpowered weapons, it could really ruin the experience and fun of your game. So try not to accept weapons from them.\n\nThere's also no fast traveling system except when you're in co-op. One player can teleport to another player that's waiting to advance a quest but, that's just about it. There's also no vehicles so, you'll be running from point a to point b for countless minutes. But thankfully, there's a craftable drink that allows you to run faster and jump farther. It also gives you unlimited running stamina too.\n\n\nShould you play it? YES! It will suck a lot of hours out of you. Trust me.","February 24, 2015","true","65.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","1"

Nothing spectactular, but nothing I would consider trash.\nDead Island Riptide comes along, and one third of the way in I quit playing and sold the copy i had bought because of how much I hated it. I absolutely hated it. I hated the sheer tediousness of the whole thing!\n\nNow here you got Dying Light... made by the same guys who made 1 of the 2 games I've ever quit and sold because I hated it.\nAnd this game... is just, amazing.\nIt's so amazing.\nNo, it's like... REALLY amazing.\nPeople are saying "Oh the story is crap! The story is crap!" but I've had zero issues with the story.\nIt's a game.. with zombies. That doesn't exactly open a whole lotta doors in which way your story can go.\nUsually it's "Everyone dies!" or "There's hope for a better tomorow!"\nBut the way they set it up is refreshing.\nA quaratined zombie infested city.\nNot "One of many quarantined zombie infested city" ... the only one.\nThe infection started here, and it was contained here.\nAre you hunting for a cure? Nope! Scientists are already working on a cure and a way to surpress turning into a zombie is already developed.\nAre you trying to get out of the zone? Nope! You went in there as a volunteer!\nThe zombies are just, THERE! Your character has his mission, his objective, and the zombies? Occupational Hazard at best.\nThis whole game feels like a real-world scenario if an outbreak occurs and the military win in a fight against the zombies. It's not some movie cliche "Oh the military got overrun!"  Nope. They lost one checkpoint because of electrical issues and had a backup plan already and now have the city locked down with no infected getting out.\nThe characters you meet, the missions you do, the little details... it's all, wow.\n\nAnd when you stare off across that bay from the rooftop of a 21 story building at night, seeing past the bridge the navy destroyed to seal off the city... and you see the horizon filled with skyscrapers, all lit up with power in an area that is still going about its day normally and planes fly by every now and then, while you and other survivors are behind concrete walls with the fires below and screams of zombies all around trying to kill you and the others... the feels man. The feels.\n\nMy only concern is...\nTechland raised that bar pretty fregin high now... is Dead Island 2 already doomed?","February 6, 2015","true","30.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steafun/recommended/239140/","steafun","Steafun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steafun/","283 products in account","ENGLISH:\n\nThis game is a selective one. If you liked Dead Island you will probably liked this one too. Because it gives you;\n\n-Parkour system which also means more freedom while rushing around.\n-Basic level customization of weapons that you will find it easy to understand and apply.\n-Day and Night cycle that gives you the true meaning of zombie rush.\n\nGraphics are ok. Because when you are on the high settings there isn't really anything to bother you. Since gameplay is so smooth that sometimes you ignore the graphics. Also after updates game's stability boosted , I only countered 1 or 2 crash to desktop with my over 70 hours. I gotta say that I enjoyed both Dead Island and Dying Light.\n\nIf I had to write bad side of the game that would be ;\n\n-Totally cliche characters that we don't even embrace.\n-Short storyline\n-Ending feels empty.\n-Some minor glitches/bugs while freerunning on the narrow passes.\n\nHard mode and "dead is dead" simply makes the game more fun but you lack of vision makes you little bit upset. So I advice you to complete the game on "normal" then go for a real fun at "hard" with "dead is dead" mentality.\n\nThere is a huge upcoming DLC and I believe it will add much more fun to game.\n\nTÜRKÇE:\n\nOyun olması gerektiği şekilde çıksaydı adını Dead Island 2 olarak görebilirdik. Ancak yapımcı anlaşmazlıkları vs. derken oyun yapımcısı olan Polonyalı şirket WB ile anlaşıp kendi oyununu çıkartacağını açıklamıştı. İyi yapmışlar diyebilirim.\n\nOyuna gelirsek Dead Island oyunundan hoşlandıysanız bu oyun hoşunuza gidecektir diye düşünüyorum. Çünkü ;\n\n-Çatılara tırmanma vb. gibi bir çok özgürlük sağlıyor. Şehirde istediğiniz gibi dolaşabiliyorsunuz.\n-Silah yapımı karmaşık değil gayet sade ve iş görür biçimde. Çok komplike şeyler yapmayı hayal etmeyin yani\n-Gece ve gündüz değişimi oyuna çok farklı bir hava katıyor. Geceleri özellikle zor seviyede inanılmaz çılgın atıyorsunuz.\n\nOyunda çok fazla hata almadım. 70 küsür saatlik süremde 1 veya 2 kere masaüstüne attı yani ben kendi sistemimde test ettiğim kadarı ile gayet akıcı , stabil bir oyun oynadım darısı alanların başına.\n\nKötü taraflarına geleceksek ;\n\n-Karakterleri hiçbir şekilde benimseyemedim , çünkü çok klişeler.\n-Hikaye çok kısa , yan görevleri yapmazsanız bitirmeniz 9 saati bulmuyor. Ancak yan görevlerle 30-40 saat garanti.\n-Oyun sonu hakkında spoiler vermek istemiyorum ancak hiçbirşey hissetmediğim gerçeğini atlayamam.\n-Çatılarda , dar geçişlerden geçerken tutunamama vb tarzı sıkıntılar yaşayabiliyorsunuz bu canınızı hayli sıkıyor.\n\nOyunu öncelikle "normal" zorlukta oynamanızı daha sonra "hard" zorlukta oynamanızı öneririm. Çünkü direk "hard" zorlukta başlamak ölüm fermanı gibi birşey çünkü oyunda bazı bilinmesi gereken detaylar var. Zombiler genelde diğer oyunlarla aynı tipte olsada bazı zayıflıkları ve güçtü tarafları var bunların bilinmesi özellikle oyun geceyken çok işinize yarayabilir.\n\nBunun dışında zor modda tek ölüm hakkınız varmış gibi oynarsanız oyunun gerçek hissiyatını alıyorsunuz "gıdım gıdım" yürümek deyimi yerini buluyor özellikle zombilerin nefesini ensenizde hissettiğiniz zaman.\n\nİşin komik tarafına gelecek olursak , sabah "laylaylom/gel lan buraya" diyerek kestiğiniz zombiler akşam bir "Kara Murat" edasıyla çatılardan bacalardan zıplayıp hayatı size zehir ediyorlar. Zaten alırda geceye girerseniz dediğim bu lafa gülmemeniz işten bile değil.\n\nİyi eğlenceler.","November 28, 2015","true","117.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/extrmeme/recommended/239140/","extrmeme","smarg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/extrmeme/","165 products in account","Wow.\nThe reviewers were very, very wrong.\nSo, i'll just go through a few things first.\n1. The story is not ABSOLUTE GARBAGE. Sure it's generic, but some characters scan be likable, it's logical(to an extent) and it fills its position well.\n2. It doesn't get boring. The brilliant mechanics here make it a joy to play. Don't take my word for it, look at the people with 30+ hours barely after release.\n3. I love the human combat. If you use(abuse) the dodge mechanic, it makes the melee fights interesting versus the skull crunching of zombies.\n\nAnyway, a few thoughts of mine on the game were that albeit the map looking awfully small, the verticality, claustrophobia, terrifying night mode, and imminent danger while on the ground leaves it constantly new, as you're moving too frantically to really pay much attention.\n\nThe parkour is absolutely fantastic, with a well worked out skill tree that has very fair progression. It's fluid, fun, and quick, compensating for the hordes of versatile undead.\n\nSpeaking of the zombies, I love them. Unlike most gorefest games, these zombies are rarely easy to kill. They're resilient and persistent, making sure that you always second guess that escape plan.\n\nNighttime is absolutely brilliant, the startling shift of atmosphere and gameplay is jarring and great. The volatiles are terrifying, and I have never enjoyed such a chase as the ones in this game. With the freerunning here the pursuits are pulse pounding and fun. Never have I loved the eerie violet glow of UV lighting more.\n\nMultiplayer is fun, the night hunter is terrifying. The invasion idea is great. Playing as the zombie is fantastic as well.\n\nWeapons are good, I hate the speed at which they break, but it adds a sense of conservation and urgency that's important. Upgrades are interesting, guns are rare enough and dangerous enough to nearly be useless, and the melee produce such a satisfying *crunch* that I rarely use guns anyway.\n\nSoundwork is great when it isnt the voicing. Lots of groans, pops, crunches, etc make it feel real.\n\nHarran is a great setting for this. Really.\n\nKICKING\n\n\nOverall, the story's failings are made up for in excess by incredibly addictive gameplay. I may not have played much yet, but I have had more fun than in any game from last year in it's entirety.\n\nEDIT: Quick tip: there ARE bugs. Right now i'm stuck where I need to open an elevator, but the doors stay shut without allowing me the command. Watch out for bugfixing updates and wait it out for that if that's your thing.","February 3, 2015","true","43.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Nothing spectactular, but nothing I would consider trash.\nDead Island Riptide comes along, and one third of the way in I quit playing and sold the copy i had bought because of how much I hated it. I absolutely hated it. I hated the sheer tediousness of the whole thing!\n\nNow here you got Dying Light... made by the same guys who made 1 of the 2 games I've ever quit and sold because I hated it.\nAnd this game... is just, amazing.\nIt's so amazing.\nNo, it's like... REALLY amazing.\nPeople are saying "Oh the story is crap! The story is crap!" but I've had zero issues with the story.\nIt's a game.. with zombies. That doesn't exactly open a whole lotta doors in which way your story can go.\nUsually it's "Everyone dies!" or "There's hope for a better tomorow!"\nBut the way they set it up is refreshing.\nA quaratined zombie infested city.\nNot "One of many quarantined zombie infested city" ... the only one.\nThe infection started here, and it was contained here.\nAre you hunting for a cure? Nope! Scientists are already working on a cure and a way to surpress turning into a zombie is already developed.\nAre you trying to get out of the zone? Nope! You went in there as a volunteer!\nThe zombies are just, THERE! Your character has his mission, his objective, and the zombies? Occupational Hazard at best.\nThis whole game feels like a real-world scenario if an outbreak occurs and the military win in a fight against the zombies. It's not some movie cliche "Oh the military got overrun!"  Nope. They lost one checkpoint because of electrical issues and had a backup plan already and now have the city locked down with no infected getting out.\nThe characters you meet, the missions you do, the little details... it's all, wow.\n\nAnd when you stare off across that bay from the rooftop of a 21 story building at night, seeing past the bridge the navy destroyed to seal off the city... and you see the horizon filled with skyscrapers, all lit up with power in an area that is still going about its day normally and planes fly by every now and then, while you and other survivors are behind concrete walls with the fires below and screams of zombies all around trying to kill you and the others... the feels man. The feels.\n\nMy only concern is...\nTechland raised that bar pretty fregin high now... is Dead Island 2 already doomed?","February 6, 2015","true","30.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DG97/recommended/239140/","DG97","Traenarn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DG97/","116 products in account","TL;DR - This game in my opinion is easily the #1 in its genre and there is very little reason to skip it. Offers fun gameplay and combat with good variety.\n\nIf you want an open-world zombie ''survival'' game, this one is the best in the market. Hell, even if you just want a game that contains zombies, this is the best one you'll find.\n\nNow, i put ''survival'' in quotations (or whatever its called) because you collect things around the world to craft bombs, weapons, med kits and all that. It's not entirely survival and if anyone claims so, i would disagree. It is sort of post-apocalyptic which makes it look survival, but there is no nutritional crisis, where you'd have to go look for food before you starve, so in my opinion its not a survival game.\n\nThe game is well-ported in my opinion, i have a pretty bad PC and can run it quite fine, and the graphics are quite pleasant too (you need to know what settings to tune down though).\n\nWhat can be annoying for some here is that all weapons are degradable and will be destroyed to uselessness as you use them. You can repair them, but only for a fixed amount of times. What's good with this system however, is that it keeps your weapon variety going and keeps the game interesting in combat to a slight degree (This becomes less of a struggle as the game goes when you can obtain really good stuff too easily).\n\nThe zombies are really braindead, but you have some empowered ones that can be pretty tough at times. At night time, you'll have some extremely hard monsters to deal with and its almost never recommended to be out at night unless you want a huge adrenaline rush because it can be insanely hard, sometimes scary. In a nutshell they're really fun to fight.\n\nStory has some plot to it but i assume its nothing special, since people never take stories in open world games seriously as far as i know, but i enjoyed the story. It was nice to follow it along, and it made you feel pretty important, though you're more like just a running slave.\n\nThe side-activities arent as interesting but if you want to punch more zombies, they're quite nice. Some involve parkour and gathering aswell.\n\nThis game supports lots of mods, and there is even custom games where people create their own maps. As soon as we get more content in on this, this could be tons of fun with others or just alone. I'd say this the core ''end'' game you'll be spending your time with after you complete the story, unless you wanna mess around some more over there.","September 27, 2015","true","41.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I bought it when it first came out so it was pricey. If you play the game and follow the main plot, you can finish the game quite quickly. I suppose the game play design is quite good as I find myself playing the plus level, then hard, then hard plus. And my next plan is to play the game without any weapon, Not sure if anyone has done this from the very start. There are already videos on youtube with player using bare hand but he or she is max out already.\nThe co op side of the game is fun if you play with friends. Playing with someone you don't know can be frustrating but then again, it can be fun if you don't mind roaming around.\nIn the game, there is an invasion mode where other player can play as zombie and "invade" your game. I have to say, I was bored with that mode after being invaded for the third time.  I don't know. I found myself just hacking away something that don't move... OK, if you are playing invasion mode on your own, it may be a challenge but in coop mode, I find it a little boring.\nBy now, most bugs are fixed which is good as you cannot duplicate your best weapon or upgrades. So, you will have to keep an eye on your weapon. I started playing the game when some bugs were there to allow me to duplicate stuff. That actually shortened the playtime.\nAll in all, the game is fun to play. I really like the parkour bit. This makes this game stands out from other zombie game. I played Dead Island but I never played it a second time. I played this game over seven time because of the parkouring bit.\n\nEdit: Now with the update of Enhanced Edition, NOW we are talking. This is what the game should be from the beginning. With the nightmare mode, it becomes one of the best games I have played since I joined Steam. Some may complain that it is ridiculously hard due to some of the new features of the game but I call it a real challenge. Almost all exploit glitches have been rid of, apart from the dupl glitch in PS4. Well, there bound to be someone who will look for a way to beat any system or shortcuts, however you call it. Well done, Techland.","May 21, 2015","true","958.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Well, Techland has done just that, it's just that none of the concepts really work that well and all the issues from Dead Island are still prevalent.\n\nYou kill fast zombies, slow zombies, strong zombies and exploding zombies. You make molotovs, grenades, medkits from items you find in the game world. There's quicktime events and unlockable skills and you've seen them all of this stuff before in some form or another, in any game you've probably played in the last decade.\n\nI can't think of a good reason to recommend this game to anyone. At release it is horribly optimized and runs like crap, I've seen all manner of glitches and been victim to countless, cheap deaths. Killing zombies is about as unoriginal as it comes these days and the only time this game is worth picking up is if you see it in a bargain bin and even then, that's a stretch.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pq12LWVk0uA\n\nThe Following however, is a lot more enjoyable, with a driveable Buggy, a different environment to explore and some new weapons and enemy types to play around with.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strelokgunslinger/recommended/239140/","strelokgunslinger","strelok","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strelokgunslinger/","404 products in account","Dying Light at first glance will remind you of Dead Island, with its focus on melee combat and the destruction of countless hordes of zombies, but on top of the similarities, there are vast improvements with its fluid gameplay, endless content and striking new mechanics.\n\nDying Light follows the story of an undercover GRE [Global Relief Effort] agent named Kyle Crane who is dropped into the infested city of Harran, a fictional city hinted to be situated in Turkey. Crane enters the city by C-130 tactical jump and stumbles across a group of armed men, following this first short encounter a zombie horde attacks and you are quickly rescued by two other people. These two people are apart of a community situated in an apartment building nicknamed ‘The Tower’ by its residents. From there you have your primary objective of finding extremely sensitive data which a GRE rogue agent has stolen and your superiors need it obtained. Whilst you tackle the task at hand you also will be asked to help people in the city which play a role as side missions within the game, these add to the stories related to the many interesting characters and give you a better sense of the trials and tribulations of the surviving people of Harran.\n\nThe controls and movement throughout the game are phenomenal and could be compared to Mirror’s Edge, personally, I would say it is a lot more freeform and has an emphasis on freedom and exploration. After all, Techland hired David Belle as a consultant to work on the games Parkour design and motion capture. David Belle is a French film actor, choreographer and stunt coordinator and is considered the founder or the leading pioneer of the Parkour, coining it based on his training and the teachings from his father Raymond Belle. Movement feels fun and the absence of vehicles at the start of the game [later on that] is not something that Dead Island fans will miss as getting places on foot is endless fun.\n\nAmongst the carnage of infected you will also have to battle against humans too and to help you with that you will have access to a plethora of weapons, upgrades, and tools that all can be modified. Blueprints can be found around the city to unlock the ability to craft custom weapons from items you pick up whilst on missions. There are three main skill trees to upgrade which add an RPG element to the game, survival, agility, and power. Survival assists in general abilities in relation to exploration. Agility provides for quicker movement and improved Parkour ability. Power relates to your engagement with enemies and the types of attacks against enemies that can help do insane amounts of damage. Gaining XP is pretty simple, for Agility all you have to do is move, climb, jump and travel distance. For Power XP all that is required is hit zombies, kill zombies in new ways or just shoot them down with a hail of bullets. To get survival points it is a little less constant, it’ll require helping out recovering supply drops for the friendly survivors and completing certain tasks for them.\n\nTime of day makes a huge difference in this game’s gameplay. Not only is night time near pitch black, but it’s so dangerous that EXP gained for Power and Agility are doubled. Being out at night time is a matter of risk vs reward as death is likely to happen. Nighttime is when special enemies called ‘Volatiles’ appear. They are twice the size of a normal zombie, they are powerful, and faster than the player. The only way to survive them is to avoid them or use the verticality of the city to help escape them by shifting direction.\n\nMultiplayer is present in the form of 4 player coop and separate modes including 4 players vs volatiles [be the zombie mode] and Deathmatch mode, which was introduced in later patches. There is an invasion system throughout the campaign, players can invade your single player game with a volatile hunter and it can really keep you on edge, of course, this is a toggleable feature.\n\nDying Light runs on the Chrome Engine 6, one version up from Dead Island’s Chrome Engine 5. The visual improvements are obvious as soon as you launch the game, even on a console. Improved 3D sound, x64 High dynamic range rendering, higher resolutions shadows and within the first year of its release the developers released the ChromEd tool to allow for map/script making.\nModel Detail is one key visual feature that stands out over previous Techland titles, this is mainly obvious due to the enhanced zombie/creature detail — but also can be seen in the environment, Harran has a very realistic mix between Northern Middle-East and Eastern European architecture.\nBozak Horde DLC\n\nThe Bozak Horde is a challenge/story DLC that adds a new weapon to the mix. The player wakes up in a small room and is told by the mysterious man called Bozak that a bomb has been attached to your leg and you are required to follow his dangerous and increasingly difficult requests. Through the DLC the player must attempt to complete 20 trials in the Harran stadium which will lead to the weapon unlock and some more story to add to the rich world of Harran.\nThe Following DLC\n[MINOR SPOILERS]\n\nAfter completing the main story campaign of Dying Light, Kyle Crane learns about a cultist group who seems to be naturally immune to the virus that effects Harran without the need for Antezin. They are living in the ‘Countryside’, the rural outskirts of the main city.  In order to gain information about the immunity and gaining the cult’s trust, he must assist the survivors living out in the ‘Countryside’. This DLC adds a wealth of content, including a minimum of 16 hours of story content, the ability to drive and upgrade a Dune buggy [also added to multiplayer], some new weapons including a Crossbow and a new map that is double the size of all other maps combined. The game at this stage gets a breath of fresh air with the addition of new characters and a new landscape to traverse. There is a new ranking system that also relates to Trust with the immune Cult group and also a later patch that unlocked much of the previous level cap, allowing for new upgrades and customization within the game.\n\nIn conclusion, you are looking at an extremely immersive game that will keep you entertained for hours, this is the game that Techland wanted to originally make during the Dead Island development and finally with the assistance of WB Games they could. The game will take around 28 hours to complete with the DLC content taking up to 18 hours to complete\n\nStory 7\nSound 8\nGameplay 9\nVisuals 9\nValue 9\n\n8.4 / 10\n\n...

Like really all you need to craft early on is about 20 med packs, and you really don't need to do anything else. As a guy who really despises games who throw in crafting just to make it a selling point, it was reasuring to see that it wasn't a main focous of the development.\n-Bashing heads dead or alive is so satisfying, really just seeing these litte buggers collapse to a well placed dome swing is just so rewarding in of itself.\n-Mod suport!\n-Night time is absolutely horrifying. During my time in the game I've never wanted to land once on the ground due to fear of what lurks below.\n\nCON:\n-Horrendously unoptimized. I've got a decent machine that can at least run these current gen types of games at high graphic levels, but all graphical features are either off or set on low.\n-Freerunning isn't 100% ready, so you'll either be making jumps you didn't want or fall to your death multiple times.\n-The game itself feels like it needed another month to squash out these bugs, though to their credit the dev team has been patching the game every 3 or so days, so at least they've been taking care of their baby (unlike most AAA games released these days).\n-The main story really isn't something to sing praises, plot holes galore, uninteresting, tries to force emotion by taking lives of characters that aren't really estableshed, and the main villain acts like he's so deep and understands that humans are scum bla bla bla.

The story is amazing, as well. Some performance issues here and there, but they are SLOWLY releasing patches to fix most of the stuttering/FPS drops that occur, although I didn't have a huge problem with it. Not super high replay value, but to finish up lose quests, there is a free roam at the end of the game, for anyone that is wondering. Most all games have a free roam at the end, now.

But now that I've just finished the campaign, I can say no less than that this is the best Zombie-survival game I have ever played so far!\nNot only is there a great combination of combat and parkour that mix up with each-other in a very awesome way, it also has a very good story that really dragged me in and almost made me demand myself to finish it.\nThe graphics look absolutely amazing and the movement is very smooth but still challenging at some times (so not always too easy).\nEspecially in the beginning parkour is not gonna be easy, but you earn skillpoints as you make progress to unlock better stamina, parkour skills, weapons and combat techniques and even a freaking grappling hook!\n\nParkour isn't just there because 'it's cool', but you're actually gonna need it to survive as the street are sometimes literally crowded up by zombie-hordes!\nLot's of very cool and modifiable weapons, from standard pipes and wrenches to machine rifles and fire-hatches.\n\nAlso, this is the first game that actually gave me a bit of 'the chills' at night.\nIt's not just like the lights go off and it's just a bit darker. No, it can get really flipping dark.. Sometimes you really aren't able to see a damn thing without your flashlight!\nBut that's just a small detail considering that at night, the zombies get more aggressive, start to hunt you down and lots of stronger, faster and smarter zombies get out of their holes.\n\nAll in all i'd say that if you're in to survival, zombies, a bit of horror, a good story and/or parkour, really don't hesitate to buy this game!\n\nAnd the best part is; I may have finished the campaign the other day, but i'm still able to play co-op with my friends and just have some fun or do the actual campaign with them!\n\nOnly thing that could've made this game even better are a bow and arrow and maybe a bit less loot as it's really easy to find certain things.\nAnd they maybe could've developed some characters a bit more in the story.\n\nAll in all, i'd say 9,2/10!\n","February 10, 2015","true","54.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Across my entire library, I only had one other zombie game. It's simply not a genre I care about because I generally find zombies to be fairly boring enemies to fight.\n\nBut after poking the reviews and seeing a lot of comments like "20 hours played, 15% of story complete. 10/10", this implied that there was more to the game that it seemed. Indeed, I took a chance and dropped the full 60$ on this and I turned out to be fairly surprised, and pleasantly so.\n\nFor me, what sets this apart is the ability to parkour around. This makes traversing the cityscape a lot more interesting and keeps this game from being a boring slog "Point A to Point B" with some zombie-smacking in between.\n\nWhat I continue to love most about this game is how it's multi-genre'd. After a few hours of play, by day, you'll be a powerhouse with weapons that will be able to one-shot the standard zombies (If you aim properly). Daytime is scavenging/questing time.\n\nBut by night, it becomes a prolonged stealth mission. Double experience gain, a few quests that can ONLY be done at night, and enemies that will destroy you regardless of levels and weapon statistics, if you allow yourself to be 'alerted' for too long. Every night is absolutely intense and it's just great fun.\nAdd to the fact that once you encounter "Bolters", enemies that will literally flee at the sight of you, hunting them is like an assassination mission as you can only kill them by sneaking up behind them. You could shoot them, too, but have fun with its four Volatile buddies that like to hang out.\n\nSo what's keeping me on this game is the variance it offers. Traversing the land is fun, slaughting zombies en masse is great, and sneaking around at night is an intense and great experience.\n\nI've been recommending this to most of my friends.","March 6, 2015","true","77.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So, where does it differ? Well, the graphics and general tone of the game are a lot grittier and darker than Dead Island. Think of this as the Empire Strikes Back to Dead Island's Star Wars.\n\nThe looting and melee part of the game is very similar. You pick up, trade, craft weapons and use blueprints to upgrade them and so on. They increase in damage as you level up and unlock rarer varieties.\n\nThe free-running is unique here - I don't think I have ever seen it done in a first person game before. It is both a blessing and a curse. It's a blessing because when it works, it works really well and gives a new depth to the game that would not have existed without it. It's a curse because it can be extremely fiddly and disorientating. Sometimes things just don't seem to work as well as they should and simple things turn into frustration inducing annoyances. It's a real shame too, since the system is *almost* good. Example: want to climb down and hang on the ledge? Forget it, something this simple is possibly the most frustrating thing you will ever do in this game.\n\nThis game also features a unique night-time experience where you must run, dodge and hide from powerful super-zombies during night time. Unlike the normal Z's, these ones chase you and can run just as fast as you can. When they catch you it's game over - so a race for the nearest safe-zone ensues. This part of the game really fills you with panicked adrenaline and mixes up the pace of the game. It is a welcome and interesting addition.\n\nThe (side) quests suffer from the same thing they did in Dead Island - fetchy and boring for the most part. There is one exception that I have found so far. In order to tell you about this I will just explain what happened to me:\n\nI was tasked by a man in the "tower" to power up 2 electricity generators in town and then head to the main distribution center and power that up. There was a catch - the center is crawling with Z's - I mean, hundreds of the ♥♥♥♥ers - and that's not all, I have to do it AT NIGHT time so that all the Z's get fried when I power it up.\n\nFirst I went and powered up the other 2 sub-stations with little issue. When I reached the main one I think my exact words were something along the lines of "holy ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥". There WERE hundreds of them. I gingerly scouted the area (in the day-time still), to see what I was going to do. There was a small entrance in the fence at the front and no other way in. I also didn't know which of the buildings I had to reach to turn on the generators. I dashed through the fence and jumped onto a van. A horde surrounded me within seconds and I was trapped. Fumbling through my inventory I fashioned 2 molotovs and let rip. The Z's burned and I jumped down. A second massive horde approached and I jumped back onto the van. I spent a few minutes trying to thin the heard, but after a time realised this was not going to work. Low on health, weapons all broken I decided I had to make a break for it. I jumped over several Z heads and ran for an opening, hoping it would lead me somewhere. Z's where everywhere and I was dodging and jumping past them. I came to a fence and vaulted over it. The area was "safe" and had a building. I went in and found the generator I was meant to use - some good luck that this was the right building. Problem was, it was day-time. Fair enough, at least I knew where to come now. I marked the location that I was standing on my map and made my escape. I headed to the nearest safe-zone where I slept until night time...\n\nNight was here. It was pitch black. I couldn't see more than 2 metres in front of me without a torch - yet the torch attracted zombies. Great. It's okay, I knew the terrain now and I had a custom waypoint set. All I had to do was get there without anything seeing me. I made my way to the station, slowly, avoiding all the "super-z's". When I got to the station my heart sank - one of the super-z's was pacing along the bit of fence that I had to get through. Bugger. Checking my inventory I found a couple of firecrackers. Hmmmm. I chucked some in the opposite direction and it vaulted over to them, attracting some of the massive horde inside as well. This was it. This was my moment. I ran. Jumping over the van, onto some z-heads. I got stuck on my planned route because there were too many of them. I had to think fast as they were everywhere. At this point I had little choice, I had to turn my torch on to see what was going on. I did. All the Z's turned and began after me. I climbed up a nearby generator before taking a running jump into the enclosure. Running to the building I slammed the door behind me and turned on the generator. I made it, phew. The sound of electric fizzing outside caught my attention and I went for a look. Sure enough, most of the horde was now being fried. One more firecracker left, I chucked it and made my escape. On the way out a super-z noticed me and gave chase. I was clambering up buildings, over fences, through houses to make it to the safe-zone. I picked up about 4 of these super-Z's on the way but finally managed to get the the safe zone. I lit up a cigarette and congratulated myself on a job well done. "You see, preparation is key, bur?", I said to myself.\n\nThat's a side quest. It has turned out to be my most memorable moment in the game as of yet. When it works, it works really well. This story above however, is not the only way the game works sadly. A lot of time is spent running from point to point doing meaningless fetch quests and trying to climb buildings (and failing) over and over again. It does suffer because of this and the tedious running from point to point doing nothing but boring quests drops my score down from a 8 to a 7. Sure, I can skip this content, but I would miss out on a good chunk of the game as a result.\n\nIt's a real shame that you begin to become OP later in the game, as the "survival" aspect of the game's early hours where you are scrounging for supplies and having to come up with genius plans to tackle the horde are it's strongest, definitive moments. As the game progresses, this gets thrown out of the window and you are left with another zombie smasher game with free-running tagged on.\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","April 7, 2015","true","26.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I also didn't know which of the buildings I had to reach to turn on the generators. I dashed through the fence and jumped onto a van. A horde surrounded me within seconds and I was trapped. Fumbling through my inventory I fashioned 2 molotovs and let rip. The Z's burned and I jumped down. A second massive horde approached and I jumped back onto the van. I spent a few minutes trying to thin the heard, but after a time realised this was not going to work. Low on health, weapons all broken I decided I had to make a break for it. I jumped over several Z heads and ran for an opening, hoping it would lead me somewhere. Z's where everywhere and I was dodging and jumping past them. I came to a fence and vaulted over it. The area was "safe" and had a building. I went in and found the generator I was meant to use - some good luck that this was the right building. Problem was, it was day-time. Fair enough, at least I knew where to come now. I marked the location that I was standing on my map and made my escape. I headed to the nearest safe-zone where I slept until night time...\n\nNight was here. It was pitch black. I couldn't see more than 2 metres in front of me without a torch - yet the torch attracted zombies. Great. It's okay, I knew the terrain now and I had a custom waypoint set. All I had to do was get there without anything seeing me. I made my way to the station, slowly, avoiding all the "super-z's". When I got to the station my heart sank - one of the super-z's was pacing along the bit of fence that I had to get through. Bugger. Checking my inventory I found a couple of firecrackers. Hmmmm. I chucked some in the opposite direction and it vaulted over to them, attracting some of the massive horde inside as well. This was it. This was my moment. I ran. Jumping over the van, onto some z-heads. I got stuck on my planned route because there were too many of them. I had to think fast as they were everywhere. At this point I had little choice, I had to turn my torch on to see what was going on. I did. All the Z's turned and began after me. I climbed up a nearby generator before taking a running jump into the enclosure. Running to the building I slammed the door behind me and turned on the generator. I made it, phew. The sound of electric fizzing outside caught my attention and I went for a look. Sure enough, most of the horde was now being fried. One more firecracker left, I chucked it and made my escape. On the way out a super-z noticed me and gave chase. I was clambering up buildings, over fences, through houses to make it to the safe-zone. I picked up about 4 of these super-Z's on the way but finally managed to get the the safe zone. I lit up a cigarette and congratulated myself on a job well done. "You see, preparation is key, bur?", I said to myself.\n\nThat's a side quest. It has turned out to be my most memorable moment in the game as of yet. When it works, it works really well. This story above however, is not the only way the game works sadly. A lot of time is spent running from point to point doing meaningless fetch quests and trying to climb buildings (and failing) over and over again. It does suffer because of this and the tedious running from point to point doing nothing but boring quests drops my score down from a 8 to a 7. Sure, I can skip this content, but I would miss out on a good chunk of the game as a result.\n\nIt's a real shame that you begin to become OP later in the game, as the "survival" aspect of the game's early hours where you are scrounging for supplies and having to come up with genius plans to tackle the horde are it's strongest, definitive moments. As the game progresses, this gets thrown out of the window and you are left with another zombie smasher game with free-running tagged on.\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","April 7, 2015","true","26.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

How often have I not decided to go do this quest a few hours before sundown thinking "plenty of time" only on the way to the objective I stumble on some other stuff to do, like this dude that wants help retrieving his fishing rod or something. *Looks at sun* "sure I can do that, plenty of time still". Then only 5 minutes before night, I complete the mission and reallize how close to evil night I am. Frantically begin sprinting and parkouring for the nearest safehouse. On the way I find a police van practically unguarded! Knowing how good the loot can get in these police vans I just gotta open it and get the goodies. After all it could be rifle ammo, or a new shiny weapon! Im usually not more than a minute or so picking the lock. Done looting, but oh ♥♥♥♥! it's almost 20:00, my watch is beeping, night is coming now! A few hundred yeards from the safehouse still it's too late, monsters emerges and I need to slow down and try to stealth my way back. Jumping over a fence I dump down practically in front of a dreaded volatile. Knowing it can rip me to shreds in seconds I flash my ultra violet lamp in it's general direction and decide to beeline straight for the safehouse. Several horrible grows tearing the silence behind me and action music fills my veins with adrenaline as I sprint for my life. From the growls I gather that several volatiles have joined in the hunt. Jumping down into a shallow wide crevice with a cracked concret pipe running in the middle I quickly slip into the pipe and crouch down in the corner hoping no one saw me go in. The monsters are shambling around on the outside with the distinct sound of them breathing. Sounds like air being sucked through shredded meat. But I think they don't know where I am.

You will most likely begin your journey of bloodshed approaching a slender female zombie, wearing sexy short shorts, and a bikini that barely covers her (  .  Y  .  ) 's As you repeativly smash her face you realize just how satisfying it is to crush the skull of things, you begin to name your victems, often times finding resemblences to close family or real life rivels. I know it was at this point that I realized, I really love smashing skulls.\n\n=Pro's=\n\n-Everyone says this game is poorly optimized for amd, however both my I7 and I5 run the game smoothly on highest settings, those idiots just don't know about AMD drivers. the game is beautiful,\n-Very detailed ambiant settings, you really get drawn into your environment.\n-The music fits every situation perfectly, really showing the severity of each situation.\n-The voice acting and lip movements are spot on and flawless.\n-The character development throughout the game is smoothe, at the begining you really do feel like a rhino with three legs, and over time you begin to evolve into a zombie skull crushing roof hoping majestic feline of wrath.\n-Story seems good so far (not 100% through) will update after completion.\n-The Parkour is very smooth, (after of course you die a few times in frusteration trying to get used it) Many games have tried Parkour movement style and failed in the past, its about time we see a studio do it right.\n-Cons-\n\n-Controller support is good except the ability to remap. kinda hate RB being jump, just seems dumb.\n-For some reason their is a grainy texture to the graphics, i didnt notice this in any of the streams or gameplay trailers. this is for both AMD and Nvidea,  its very mild but none the less I feel it took away from the quality of the graphics.\n-very limited character customization, Yes you can choose perks and such to meet gameplay styles, But you are stuck with Crane, no female characters, no large black guy with pink dreads, no unique character features, I looked forward to playing a game like this and being able to look down at my hands only to see a large pair of (  .  Y  .  ) stareing back at me, worst part is, multiplayer with 4 of your friends, you are all wearing a extremely untactical bright neon yellow shirt, (Granted this can be changed with a small selection of outfits,)\n-Lets not forget the 10 yr old who invades your game as the night hunter, absolutely wrecks your group of friends, then proceeds to brag about he has used his zombie <==#3 to ♥♥♥♥ all 4 of your moms... while eating poptarts... nothing new here as the poisonous troll community we often encounter in video games has moved its way to dying light.\n\nSummery\n\nThat aside, this game is very well polished, I feel a few features it lacks can be made up for with the smooth launch, unique gameplay, and lack of bugs. This is one of the few games in the last 3 years that had a semi bug free release, starting 2015 off to a great year.  I feel this game is worth ever penny of the $179 that i spent for my 3 friends, and hope to get a ton more laughs and enjoyment from it. overall I give this an 8.7/10  best parkour game out there, one of the top 5 zombie RPG's out there, and there is a ton of room for updates to further improve and optimize the game.\n","January 27, 2015","true","43.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larrythebrony/recommended/239140/","larrythebrony","Larry's Berry","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larrythebrony/","339 products in account","At the end of the day, as much as one is inclined to, it is difficult to find fault with a game like Dying Light.\n\nAesthetically, the game is a pleaser. In terms of performance on the PC platform, save for the fps related issues on release week, Dying Light performs respectably even on a mediocre rig. On a high-end rig, Dying Light chugs along at the highest settings with nary a hiccup. As for its gameplay, the action in Dying Light is fast and fluid. Combat is flashy as well as impactful, and killing zombies has never felt more brutally satisfying. The parkour mechanic, which is your character’s main form of locomotion in Dying Light, is also somewhat intuitive, save for a few logical inconsistencies. If your gut tells you that a bridge’s truss is traversable to reach its top, you are unlikely to be wrong. Scaleable aspects of a building are very well-differentiated from those that you can’t interact with. Thus whether it is crisscrossing Harran’s rooftops, or climbing to the top of a clock tower to catch the setting sun, Dying Light’s parkour mechanic makes it both hassle-free and a pleasure to explore its vast and interesting setting. There is no mistake about it, Techland has done an admirable job here: Dying Light is one hell of a game to play, whether alone or in a group.\n\nUnfortunately, Dying Light has about as much of a heart or soul as the cold and ruthless GRE boss that your character works for.  I could blame the game’s lack of spirit on its poor storyline, as many other critics have done. I could also blame it on the half-arsed supporting characters that the game seemingly throws at you by the dozen, only to then either arbitrarily kill them off or to leave their relationship with your character hanging by a thread and incomplete. Rather I am going to attribute it to Techland’s failure to make any of the interesting features, that it implements in a seemingly laundry-list like manner, into a mainstream component that properly defines Dying Light and what it stands for.\n\nTake the game’s setting in Harran for example. Yes, Harran is a vast and spacious open-world in which players can explore to their hearts’ content. Yes Harran is both beautiful, in a morbid kind of way, and immersive. Yet Techland barely utilizes it to further engage and immerse Dying Light’s players. There is a wafer-thin amount of dynamic events in Harran, which usually exists in the form of survivors fending off zombies, or Rais’ goons sitting idly on top of one of the air-supply crates which the game sporadically generates.\n\nHarran also remains the same dreary and worn out place that it was when your character first stumbled into it like the ‘experienced’ secret operative that he is, until the moment you dispose of your main nemesis and complete the game’s main storyline. Converting one of its zone into a safehouse may result in you visually pushing or toppling a couple of shelves or cupboards over, as a form of barricading, but there is otherwise no obvious visual cues that suggest Harran is changing or evolving as a result of your character’s actions. Neither does its inhabitants become better off as you fulfil the usually tedious tasks that they set you out to do. An extreme example is the game’s escort missions, where completing one of them merely returns the relevant NPC that you successfully protected back to his or her starting spot, ready to offer you the same mission again. As a result, playing in Harran can occasionally provide a disconnected experience, one where you realize that nothing your character does ever truly matters.\n\nOn the other hand, do I think that Dying Light is a game worthy of your money, even at full-price? Yes it is. The game is extremely well-polished and has a good amount of content for you to sink your teeth into. Parkouring your way through the game’s numerous side missions is also an addictive experience. I can’t count the number of occasions where I had originally set out to spend 15 minutes on one of the game’s side mission, only to have those minutes turn into hours as I explore, craft, and decapitate or bash zombie heads in.\n\nIt’s most unfortunate that Dying Light’s absence of a heart and soul, as a result of Techland’s relative lack of ambition, means that it will remain a game that is a distance aways from being a truly great one. This in itself does not detract from the fact that Dying Light is through and through an entertaining game to play. And entertain you it most certainly will.","February 6, 2015","true","71.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game has gone on and became instant classic to the gaming community been playing the game for a while and I can never get bored except for just killings the infected up.  Been looking into the new download content the developers are promising more stuff to do and is they keep this up this game will never die hinting that they are still the number one in the zombie killing and parkor gaming business.  I've really been impressed with all the work in this game it has really gone a long way since it was announced and now everyone knows techland and will keep the promises to all gaming.  For those who waited I feel bad because you would never feel the experience of playing the best game released this year for the first time with everyone across the world when it was released because it was just awesome.\nAlmost 50 hours beat it once doing another playthrough got to say i'm still dig this game really crunchy melee some gunplay and lots easter eggs plus humor. In all this was my favorite pre-order every it was all worth the hype behind tthey allowing modder to toy and make better with the game i'm still recommend play and getting a friend to join in all the zombie fun!!!!!!!!\n\nUpdate:\n1.5 patch new hard mode which gives the game a really nice immersive feel to the game more enemies and loot is rare to get good loot can say played it for 5 hours and i got to say the dev's are really keeping the game alive i'm glad the game was a sucessful as it was all the wait was really worth it and if you haven't grabbed a copy join the the group because it's really fun and will always give you a feeling of entertainment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nGame play\n\nReally simple kills of these build weapons survive all goes together but even worse at night the zombies are really fun to fight and runaway from also the missions that you can play will keep you busy for a while lots of game play hours plus lots of Easter eggs.\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThe feeling of being chased by infected individuals is terrified but also trying to fight the living to is really more frightening the game really goes into the depths of how the apocalypse could be as the world gets infected that music really suits the game.\n\n\nAlso feel free to leave a comment so i know what i could work on my reviews","January 27, 2015","true","219.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The zombies are very satisfying to kill with the nice detail gore to it. There are plenty of side quest to do and they are not really repetitive but rather fun and sometimes very rewarding to do.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/yesaye94/recommended/239140/","yesaye94","Sir Yesaye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/yesaye94/","145 products in account","Well, Where to begin with Dying Light.\n\nAfter finishing the main storyline with plenty of side quests that I missed, I can safely say that this game was quite something.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'm not quite sure where to start with this review so I'll just start with the good stuff first.\n\nIt holds good variety in weapons and zombies, As well as various human enemies, Both military and non-military. The parkour is, in my opinion, pretty smooth, Maybe not to Mirror's Edge standard but it gets the job done nicely. Combat feels very satisfying and well done, Especially with the dismemberment of body parts. Graphics aren't too bad, Even at a low resolution, The game still looked very pretty on my computer, though others may disagree. The variation between day and night offers a nice change in the gameplay, One minute you're a zombie killing badass, The next you're a wimpy baby hiding from corners and climbing rooftops as if your life depends on it, Because 9 times out of 10, it does.\n\nA few very small but noticable features in the game add to it's charm, Such as the three seperate skill trees, Survivor, Agility and Power, Each having unique perks that help improve the way you play the game (If you're not too busy dropkicking Zomboids off the rooftops to notice them). The menu's are similar to Dead Island, So those who played that should instantly be used to it, Though it's easy for new people to understand. Certain NPC's in the game can offer some valuable loot and a weapon completely for free,  Crafting feels very well done with the different varieties of blueprints you can find throughout the world or earn through quests (Flaming, Electrifying Sledgehammers FTW!) And it's open world gameplay with two different areas to explore: The Slums, where you start the game off and play about 70% of the game, The other being The City, Where you travel to during the main storyline and has much, much bigger buildings.\n\nI personally haven't played Multiplayer with any of my friends who also own the game but from the few random dudes who have joined my game whilst I play, I would say that the Multiplayer runs quite smoothly. As the host, It gives you plenty of oppertunities to set up challenges for you and your friends to complete, Such as kill the most zombies or find the most loot and whatever else the game decides. I do have a personal recommendation if you intend to go public online when you're playing so random people and friends can join you, TURN OFF ZOMBIE INVASION. If you don't want to be CONSTANTLY invaded by super zombies trying to munch your face off, Turn this off. If not, You'll most likely find yourself being invaded every 5 minutes with NO ONE to help you, You'll be left alone and have quite a disadvantage, Though if that's your kind of thing, Go right ahead.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlenty of good stuff to say about this game, Now for the bad stuff...\n\nThe story isn't great. Pretty much throughout the entire thing, You can already see what will happen from miles away and most times they do. The characters aren't too interesting and some are completely forgettable, Even though this game tries at times to make you feel something for the characters and make you feel connected to them (I'm looking at you, Rahim.)\n\nThe game takes a little while to bring out the different enemy variations, Which mainly consists of you having to play through the main storyline before you even see mutated zombies in the world and even then, You rarely notice any or don't pay enough attention to notice them, the most I've seen is the normal snappy bitey zombies, Some Viral zombies which come when you make noise (The super fast ones in daylight) and the big hulking fellas with metal rebars usually standing around in one place.\n\nAnd I cannot finish off this review without mentioning The Final Boss of the game, The psychopathic dude who has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off, Killed your comrades and ultimately made your life terrible in this zombie apocalypse. It comes down to that final moment, you finally reach the top of his mighty tower after scratching and clawing your way past zomboids and virals and falling to the dirt many, many times. A cutscene comes along, You and your enemy face off and what do you know? QUICK TIME EVEEEEENT!!!!\n\nYou could see it coming a mile away, A God Damn Quick Time Event for the final boss. Please bear in mind that other bosses in the game that you fight, The Main Boss's Right Hand Man being just one of them, You fight all of those in the game normally, Dodging and leaping and slashing and dying a lot. But oh no, Not with this final boss, They treat you with a nice little QTE right at the end and you could EASILY see it coming a mile off. A dissapointing ending, In my opinion.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWell, If you could be bothered to read through all my rubbish, Welcome to the end! ~Confetti and Fanfare~\n\nSo, Final opinion on Dying Light.\n\nAlthough it has a few faults in the game that can be noticed with ease and may annoy a lot of players, Especially that damn final boss, Does it make Dying Light a bad game? Not. At. All.\n\nIt's Fun, It's Satisfying and it certainly lived up to my personal expectations when I first heard about it and got excited to play it.\n\nIf you're a Zomboid fan, A Parkour Fan or you just like to slice dudes up and dropkick them from rooftops like a total boss, I HIGHLY recommend Dying Light to you. Some may argue about the asking price of this game but from what I've played and seen, I personally think it's worth it.\n\nDying Light has been, In my opinion, A great start to a new year of gaming, I only hope that developers can keep this up for the months to come.\n\nUntil Then, Catch ya later, Folks!\n\nGood Night And Good Luck!","February 2, 2015","true","88.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","2"

In Dead Island, you played a pansy who tripped on shoelaces and could barely step over a brick; but not John! Now Sinamoi can show you his running and climbing skills as well as tackling anything that gets in his way.\n\nEven his mighty skills are put to the test however; common zombies tend to group up more (instead of 5 or so, you can get groups of 10 or even 20.) and the specials can present more of a threat.

There are three different skill trees that level independantly; this gives the player more Sinamoi action and less time theory crafting!\n\nFor those who liked Dead Island but thought it was a bit too buggy and not enough Sinamoi, then I would definitely suggest this game (though maybe at a sale.)

Yes it is a zombie game with a simple story line and simple objectives through the game. The main story is very simple, the company that created the game will use the well known elements of other zombie apocaliptic games and recycle them in the main story. As a matter of fact the side quests are also running from point A to point B.\nThe graphics and the animations are great, and although you may experience some random lag now and then when playing on ultra settings it is a gorgeous trip through slums and a detailed city areas. The map is about 3 times bigger than that of the original Dead Island.\nOne of the new elements introduced in Dying Light is the addition of free running. You will hop through roofs and obstacles while gaining ability points to level up your character in the 3 different skill trees. The leveling of your character depends on: mission objectives getting complete, slauthering the infected (or human enemies), or free running. There are again many different weapons you can combine and craft through the game and yet again the weapons will break relativly fast so the game forces you to change them or repair ofthen.\nThen there is the night gameplay, which makes the game hard and you will need to sneak around to prevent being chased by mutated infected cratures that will kill you in about four hits. The night is very dangerous and totaly different from the day cicle. Yes there is a constant day/night cicle in the game, which changes every houer.\nIn conclusion Dying Light is an upgreated version of Dead Island with some fresh elements and dull mission objectives, however if you like sandbox games this is a fun game to mess around and an addition of night survival elements.\nThe game is also very long with tons of sidequests and challanges to do!\nGood:\n- Graphics and overall presentation of the menus.\n- Many fun ways to slauther the enemies\n- Day/night cicles change the gameplay\n- Tons of quests and challanges to do\n\nBad:\n- Human AI can be aweful and gets stuck in corners\n- Mission objectives are dull (but the stories of survivals are cool to hear)\n- Some performance issues and some strange animations (fixed in patch ----)\n\n83/100\n\nUpdate:\nThe game performance on PC have been improved and many glitches where fixed add another .4 to the score now.","February 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapid_rider/recommended/239140/","rapid_rider","Rapid Rider (SHPUK)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rapid_rider/","352 products in account","Dying Light Co-op Review\nFirst and foremost, this review will be concentrating on the co-op side of Dying Light.\n\nA Quick note about solo playAs a single player game Dying Lights atmospheric tension and challenges are just what you would want from a survival horror game. The squalid and zombie infested environment of Dying Lights Harran somehow manages to retain a certain beauty and the  wonderfully crafted world draws you in making you want to explore every inch. The combat, weapon systems and movement are  beautifully balanced to offer players a challenge without being too tricky to master with a little practice. The night and day cycles require different approaches as night sees a clear advantage swing to the zombies. This game is more about being a  savvy player rather than all out hack and slash or bravely running away as both elements will be required equally, along with a healthy dose of stealth and cunning depending on the situation. There is plenty to keep you busy too with over 50 hours of game play. For the best experience set your gamma up correctly and play in the dark with headphones, it really ramps up the  tension and immerses you deeper into the game.\n\nAs with most games these days you get a bevy of unlockable skills which you will soon come to rely as you progress and wish you had from the start. However the best tool by far is the grappling hook as it makes moving across the map and escaping the undead really flow. Unfortunately, you will need to put in at least 10 hours of game play before you unlock it.\n\nCoop - My Take on itThis is my review proper, the coop play of Dying Light and where my opinion seems to differ widely from everyone else. I will  say it now, I am not a fan of the co-op in this game. While some elements work others don't and at times it is more multiplayer PVP than it is coop. I increasingly found co-op annoying and more of a hindrance and an intrusion rather than a help. It's far from bad and it has its place, but, for the most part it is not what I would call true co-op play.\n\nDying Light supports drop-in/ drop-out co-op for up to four players. The entire campaign is playable in co-op, and there are special co-op challenges.\n\nCombatOkay so you got me on this, (with the exception of "Be The Zombie" element which I will come to shortly) co-op combat is actually that as you can't fight each other and can work together killing zombies. However, this brings me to my main problem in co-op combat, it's too easy. Enemies do not scale with the amount of players and it rapidly changes the game of survival horror to hack and slash zombie clearance.\n\nBe the ZombieThe introduction of "Be the Zombie" is great if what you want a PVP multi-player combat element. It can be hilarious if you are playing with a few friends. However, the intrusion of random players in your game can be frustrating, even when they are not being the zombie and on your side there are some real idiots out there. Go afk for a second or start playing with your menus, etc., and before you know it your dead. I found this element novel at first, but it soon gets old and you find yourself in the menu system opting out of this. "Be the Zombie" is  definitely not a co-op element, but is a multiplayer PVP element.\n\nStory QuestsDying Light was built with co-op in mind and Mission progress is saved across all players’ games, which can cause problems  when joining a session which has progressed further down the story. This is most notable if you have a group of friends who regularly play and some of you play more often than others. Some of you can lose out on blocks of Story mode and associated  achievements.\n\nChallengesAgain, these can be fun, especially when playing with a group of close friends, however, they have absolutely nothing to do with co-op play and are purely PVP and yet bizarrely are only available in co-op play. It makes no sense and they break the flow and tension of the game and soon get very annoying. For me co-op play is all about working together and helping each other and these challenges force you into PVP events that I do not want in my co-op experience.\n\nRandom Events and LootAnytime a dynamic drop hits the map all players get to raid the cache of medicine and supplies. True to its co-op claim,  friends can help a downed ally and all the loot you find is unique to each player so there is no squabbling over drops so this works well.\n\nCharacter customizationCharacter customization options are poor, so don’t expect to be able to play specific roles or even tell each other apart during the early stages of the game.\n\nNo Local Co-OpThe lack of a local co-op option is a real surprise as this game would be well suited to a local co-op play between people in the same room playing on split screen. Ideal for keeping the older kids busy or killing some time with your partner etc. But alas, no such option exists.\n\nOverviewTechland, the makers of Dying Light vociferously shouted about it's co-op play as being one of its big selling points, but  for me, actual co-op experience is severely lacking. Now I love a good PVP game when I am in the mood, but when I am not "I do not want PVP shoved down my throat".\n\nIf you want some competitive PVP while playing Dying Light then it should work well for you. However, if like me, you want a proper co-op game, either look elsewhere or ensure that you lock down the menu settings to allow friends only and agree beforehand to stay away from challenges.\n\nCaution, co-op is switched on by default.\n\nHowever, if you want a great single player survival horror game, this just might be the one for you. Just remember to disable those co-op options and enjoy Dying Light how it plays best:\n\nGamma set low, playing in the dark with your headphones turned up. A great solo game.","June 2, 2015","true","93.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

You will most likely begin your journey of bloodshed approaching a slender female zombie, wearing sexy short shorts, and a bikini that barely covers her (  .  Y  .  ) 's As you repeativly smash her face you realize just how satisfying it is to crush the skull of things, you begin to name your victems, often times finding resemblences to close family or real life rivels. I know it was at this point that I realized, I really love smashing skulls.\n\n=Pro's=\n\n-Everyone says this game is poorly optimized for amd, however both my I7 and I5 run the game smoothly on highest settings, those idiots just don't know about AMD drivers. the game is beautiful,\n-Very detailed ambiant settings, you really get drawn into your environment.\n-The music fits every situation perfectly, really showing the severity of each situation.\n-The voice acting and lip movements are spot on and flawless.\n-The character development throughout the game is smoothe, at the begining you really do feel like a rhino with three legs, and over time you begin to evolve into a zombie skull crushing roof hoping majestic feline of wrath.\n-Story seems good so far (not 100% through) will update after completion.\n-The Parkour is very smooth, (after of course you die a few times in frusteration trying to get used it) Many games have tried Parkour movement style and failed in the past, its about time we see a studio do it right.\n-Cons-\n\n-Controller support is good except the ability to remap. kinda hate RB being jump, just seems dumb.\n-For some reason their is a grainy texture to the graphics, i didnt notice this in any of the streams or gameplay trailers. this is for both AMD and Nvidea,  its very mild but none the less I feel it took away from the quality of the graphics.\n-very limited character customization, Yes you can choose perks and such to meet gameplay styles, But you are stuck with Crane, no female characters, no large black guy with pink dreads, no unique character features, I looked forward to playing a game like this and being able to look down at my hands only to see a large pair of (  .  Y  .  ) stareing back at me, worst part is, multiplayer with 4 of your friends, you are all wearing a extremely untactical bright neon yellow shirt, (Granted this can be changed with a small selection of outfits,)\n-Lets not forget the 10 yr old who invades your game as the night hunter, absolutely wrecks your group of friends, then proceeds to brag about he has used his zombie <==#3 to ♥♥♥♥ all 4 of your moms... while eating poptarts... nothing new here as the poisonous troll community we often encounter in video games has moved its way to dying light.\n\nSummery\n\nThat aside, this game is very well polished, I feel a few features it lacks can be made up for with the smooth launch, unique gameplay, and lack of bugs. This is one of the few games in the last 3 years that had a semi bug free release, starting 2015 off to a great year.  I feel this game is worth ever penny of the $179 that i spent for my 3 friends, and hope to get a ton more laughs and enjoyment from it. overall I give this an 8.7/10  best parkour game out there, one of the top 5 zombie RPG's out there, and there is a ton of room for updates to further improve and optimize the game.\n","January 27, 2015","true","43.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

Yes there is a constant day/night cicle in the game, which changes every houer.\nIn conclusion Dying Light is an upgreated version of Dead Island with some fresh elements and dull mission objectives, however if you like sandbox games this is a fun game to mess around and an addition of night survival elements.\nThe game is also very long with tons of sidequests and challanges to do!\nGood:\n- Graphics and overall presentation of the menus.\n- Many fun ways to slauther the enemies\n- Day/night cicles change the gameplay\n- Tons of quests and challanges to do\n\nBad:\n- Human AI can be aweful and gets stuck in corners\n- Mission objectives are dull (but the stories of survivals are cool to hear)\n- Some performance issues and some strange animations (fixed in patch ----)\n\n83/100\n\nUpdate:\nThe game performance on PC have been improved and many glitches where fixed add another .4 to the score now.","February 19, 2015","true","0.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The way parecore, survival, and weapons are incorperated are brillant. sure, theyre are other games similar to dying light but DL just as a little more parecore, this is true, but also far from the truth. dying light is such a brilliantly put together story and charaters. I bought this game for 20 dollars on sale before 'The Following' was released. in my opinion the main game it self is not worth 60 dollars, but i would pay no more than 40 dollars for this game which makes me think i basically stole this game. one of my favorite parcour/zombie/openworld/shooter experience i think i will ever have\n\nreview for 'The following' : i payed 20 dollars for the following when it was released but if i didnt have the main game first both together would have been well worth 60 dollars. the following adds WAY more story that expected. tons of side missions and bounties which adds hundreds of hours of gameplay. the story is very well put toghter with a crazy twist ending. they really nailed this dlc. everything you would want with a 20 dollar dlc. (the buggys are great too!)\n\ndying light main game: 7/10 awesome game, boss fight was under whelming, characters could use work\n\nThe Following: 7/10 everything you would want from a zombie game dlc. its bigger than you think\n\noverall 7.5/10 dying light is a great game with great dlc content and still lots of hours ahead of me","April 22","true","79.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

The gameplay is good, but there are several extremely lacking, and boring design-choices. I still recommend it, but not at full price, and not for vanilla gameplay. Here's my opinion. (it should be spoiler-free)\n\nThe game leans too much on the Casual gamers. The MC becomes more or less SUPER-HUMAN quite early to the point that the gameplay becomes boring as you can either flatten everything in your sight or outrun every possible threats.\n\nDuring the day, normal enemies post little to no threat, too little in numbers with their minimum aggressiveness, and stupid AI. There are several special enemies, but they are not really a threat, as most of the time, you can easily spot them from further away without provoking them, as you won't find much 'distraction' from other normals.\n\nNight can be overwhelming at first, but after a few hours, you will find that it is quite easy. You can't really die unless you clash right into enemies, or run in long flat route.\n\nYou will notice many inconsistencies during the game, making it feels like the developer changes some of their design-choices midway, but forget to make it consistent through the whole thing. (they did)\n\nHard Mode is still lacking the difficulty it deserved, still, a nice addition for vanilla.\n\nCOOP gameplay is a joke. The game puts 4 SUPER-HUMANS together, making the game much easier, and lost its charm quickly, as 4 of you slaughtering (bullying) through the hordes of 'punching bag-style' enemies.\n\nHowever, there are difficulty MODS that will change that, and make the game fun to play, especially with friends. It can be a little glitchy at times, but it won't stop you from playing.\n\nTL;DR The game is good, but can be easy, and boring fast as a result from design-choices. Get some difficulty mods, and friends to play with ;D","January 3","true","49.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sektor527/recommended/239140/","Sektor527","Sektor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sektor527/","161 products in account","I'll simply start by saying that Dying Light is -- hands down -- the best open world game I've played in my entire gaming career. In fact, it's fast becoming one of my favorite all-time games (and I've been gaming since the '80s).\n\nAs opposed to others in its genre (Assassin's Creed, Sleeping Dogs, Red Dead Redemption, Skyrim, ...), this game does not propel you from one mission to the other, having you grab for fast travel at every opportunity. No, you'll be crawling through the streets or jumping across roofs to try to get to your next mission alive! The in-between is just as much fun -- if not more so -- than the actual missions.\n\nWhich is not to say that the story is bad, far from it. You'll find yourself engrossed in the unraveling story line, meeting interesting and colorful (and every now and then comical) characters, with voice acting well done ... finally!\n\nAdd on top of that a seamless parcour gameplay, four completely different parallel RPG-style skill trees, a crafting system that finds the perfect balance between having to search for new material and using awesome weaponry -- until they are broken and you either repair it or build something new --, fantastic mo-capped animations for monsters, a tense and exciting day-night cycle, and to top it all off -- the lush cherry on the delicious whipped cream -- an unbelievably stunning graphics engine.\n\nOh, and the zombies are sufficiently creepy and so very believable! This game has my heart pumping with fear, excitement, and relief dashing for the nearest safe zone while a viral or hunter is chasing me down. Something that hasn't happened ever since I played Thief in '98.\n\nAnother thing I need to mention: every other game I've played like this is only really exciting for the first couple of hours. After that, I rely on save games to get away with recklessness and, given enough tries, complete whatever task I'm undertaking. Not so with Dying Light. Death is not permanent and you'll respawn in the nearest safe zone, but you will lose plenty of survival skill points, making you fall behind on that skill tree. That's incentive enough to be careful and make for a continuously tense and exciting game.\n\nJust one piece of advice, though: turn of the minimap and take your time to try to learn the layout of the city by heart. There are plenty of landmarks that help you find your way. This greatly improves on the immersion and gameplay.\n\nPro:\nBeautifully hand-crafted open world. Not a single thing looks like a repeated pattern.\nPerfect open world gameplay. The game is playable without a minimap (and much more exciting for it) and because of the danger around every corner, you don't constantly feel like you want to fast travel.\nStunningly beautiful graphics. Make sure you have a high-end machine for this.\nGreat story and characters. You feel empathic and enthralled within the first five minutes.\nIntense zombie horror atmosphere. It's as close to the real thing as you can get.\nRealistic skill point system. Gain skill points in Agility, Power and Survival, by jumping/running/climbing, fighting, and completing quests, respectively.\nDiverse skill trees. Each skill tree has many interesting and useful skills, both passive and active. Choose your preferred style of play.\nEngaging item crafting system. Unlike most other games where crafting is fun for the first few hours and then gets way too easy and overpowered, Dying Light continuously forces you to make new weapons and gear, because the more you use them, the more you wear them out.\nDiverse weapons. Pimp your melee weapons by making them stronger, easier to handle, or more durable. Add electric, fire, poison or bleeding effects. Or use the very powerful firearms that kill your enemies with one shot (hopefully), but will attract many more with the noise it produces.\nCon:\n... I'll let you know when (if?) I see one.","May 5","true","50.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

So here's a serious review.\n\nBefore I start, alot of people with AMD cards report bad fps, so be aware of that.\nActually check the system requirements before purchasing, so you don't end up complaining about hardware problems.\n\n- Pros/Features-\n+Decent story, there are still ridiculous and bizarre side quests. There are some really colorful characters in this game. But honestly, if you have a sense of humor you'll get a good laugh out of some parts of the storyline.\n\n+Parkour, allows you to navigate the enviroment in a very different way, viral zombies can parkour as well and are pretty decent at it.\n\n+Survival senses (Spider senses?) If you press the Q button, your survival senses kick in and will basically show little markings on lootable objects/items that you can pick up or interact with.\nSome people may find this a turn off, but honestly, there is ALOT of looting in this game, when your running from zombies, or low on time, it's helpful. It also shows the waypoint, so it's easy to figure out where your supposed to go without checking the map constantly. Overall it's a nice feature, and extremely helpful.\n\n+Crafting is very simple, create shurikens, medkits, molotovs, even beneficial boosters which are created with herbs. (Such as improved night vision, or damage resistance) As well as blueprints which let you modify weapons you already have, and add pretty devasating effects. Very similar to dead Island with the blueprints, except there are alot more. Some even let you put multiple elemental effects on a single weapon.\n\n+Weapon mechanics work well. Different weapons have different amounts of upgrade slots. You can add things like "Crusader" or "Juggernaut" to your weapon to increase handling/durability etc. on top of this you can upgrade with blueprints you find such as fire, electricity, and toxic. similar to Dead Island, but a step up with the new upgrades. You can also repair your weapons using tool parts that you loot. Eventually the weapon will break, but it's nice that you can repair and delay the inevitible.\nYou can also dismantle weapons which gives you 1 or a couple repair parts.\n\n+Control over the combat. With the skill tree upgrades you can unlock the ability to dodge, unlock new weapon moves. Grapple opponets, dropkick them. You can also kick zombies/humans into spikes in the enviroment, and even use traps found in the open world such as electric fences, car bombs, and more.\n+The player can also hold up to 4 different equipments at a time (Shurikens, grenades, molotovs, UV light, etc.)\n\n+3 different skill trees, level up independently (Agility, Power, and Survival.) Everytime you level one of these up you can pick a skill which gives access to new crafting items, unlocks new moves such as the dropkick, or increases speed and whatknot. There's quite alot of upgrades.\nPower is increased by fighting enemies, you unlock combat moves for weapons among other things.\nAgility is increased by doing parkour, jumping, etc. Unlocks moves like the dropkick, also increases stats.\nAnd survival is increased by doing quests and recovering airdrop packages. These give alot of upgrades like making crafting more effective, learning new crafts, and also unlocking moves. When you die you also lose survival points, which makes it more intense.\nOverall the skill system is really good in my opinion, they can each go up to level 25.\n\n+Looting feels good, honestly I think they nailed the RPG feeling of just getting tons of loot.\nYou can go in alot of the buildings, picklock chests. Most of these buildings have locked doors, so you have to look around and find different entrances such as going through a roof door, or lifting up the garage door.\nThe human enemies will drop melee weapons, if their using them, as well as throwing items.\nAnd even the special zombies have some weapons you can pick up which include the concrete rebars and sledgehammer.\n\n+Special zombies are actually pretty interesting. It basically has the suicider from Dead Island still, but their are spitters which lob poisonous exploding bile (extremely annoying) And concrete rebar wielding zombies which are like 3 times the size of a normal zombie. Even the hazmat zombies are cool, they sound grim, and explode on death.\nNight zombies, are brutal...and yeah I stay away from them.\n(Very much a stepup from Dead Island with some of these zombie variants imo.)\n\n+Guns are a HUGE improvement from Dead Island. They handle better, and actually kill the targets instead of them just soaking up bullets. Exception to this is some of the special zombies, which depending on the type can take alot more bullets.\nThe guns are somewhat overpowered because of the availability of ammunition, but they cause major noise which usually attracts alot of zombies.\n\n+Human combat is intense, most of the enemies wield different weapons, can throw knives, and will dodge accordingly, they can even block items such as throwing knives unless you time them correctly. The gunplay here is also improved, they die quite easily from bullets, but if they are wielding guns they can kill the player just as quickly if given the opportunity.\n\nThis is my experience with the game, I came into it expecting a mediocre game and ended up getting an awesome open world experience. If you like killing zombies, parkouring, crafting, making awesome weapons, exploring an open world, just buy the game and play it. Develop your own opinion.\n\n- Cons -\n\n-Experienced quite a few crashes throughout my gameplay. A couple during cutscenes, and alot over the course of just traveling/doing missions. Nothing game breaking though, thankfully the autosave works out. Still, it's annoying having to reboot the game.\n\n-No manual save (This is a big deal to me) I really hate when games leave you with an autosave feature and no manual save. Haven't had any huge problems with it yet, but it would be nice to be able to manually save.\n\n-Some people report AMD card problems.\n\n- No vehicles, but parkour is more fun in my opinion, didn't really have a problem with no vehicles.\n\n-"Resize buffer failed" Not sure what this means, but this has crashed my game about 5 times over 13 hours. Thankfully the game autosaves, and I haven't lost any of my loot to it yet. Still it's extremely annoying and needs to be fixed.\n\n-Most of the time when I load my save my character says "OH ♥♥♥♥!" I don't really consider this a con, but it's pretty entertaining.\n\nI can't think of any, i've been playing for quite a while and haven't run across any game breaking bugs. I'll add more cons if I do find some though.","January 28, 2015","true","32.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

For starters the main story line is not extremely long to a point where the player is confused and it's not too short to where the player would become bored or finish it fast. Next if you love brutality or killing zombie guts this game is not going to disappoint with over 50 known weapons that kill in their own unique way or the characters own abilities not to mention all the throwable weapons that do multiple things. Another thing I really love and enjoy is that the open world aspect is one where you have so much freedom you can practically do anything you want. Lastly I find the PvP or night invasions to be a very fun activity to do with friends. All in all I truly love this game and if you are able to run this game and you like open world zombie killing games ((or a fan of Dead Island)) then Dying light is a game you should get.\n\nGood Night and Good Luck","January 19","true","459.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/recommended/239140/","Jamfrost","Jamfrost Jamiro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamfrost/","623 products in account","Dying Light is a mostly fun zombie-slaying game that utilizes parkour. It's brought to you by the creators of the first Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, Techland. Dying Light outshines Dead Island greatly, even with its launch issues. It features better writing, a greater sense of verticality that works well with the parkour and grappling hook, skill trees that make progression feel more significant, graphic and enjoyable combat, a fearsome night, some bugs, and questionable design decisions that did not sit well with me.\n\nThe story has one main protagonist instead of a cast of four a la Dead Island. You play as Kyle Crane, an undercover GRE (Global Relief Effort) agent sent to recover a file lost within the city of Harran. As Crane, you bear witness to the insane brutality and sadness that affect the survivors of the devastated city. Dying Light managed to present an okay, passable story that did not make my eyes glaze over as if I were one of the undead. The main antagonist was crafted to be obviously evil and fond of diabolical plans which came off as cheesy or cliché at times. The writing lacked the finesse to not be predictable. However, some of the side-quests were very well done with how they portrayed loss and grief. On the other hand, the game definitely could have done without the useless find x number of item side quests that served no purpose or told any stories.\n\nDying Light's world is generally fun to navigate due to the winning mixture of parkour and well used vertical space. Although, sometimes you will find yourself falling down and taking damage due to learning what can and cannot be grabbed, a feeling that's amplified with the use of the grappling hook. You will need to learn how to use its lock-on on ledges before channeling Just Cause's Rico Rodriguez since you can grapple onto most surfaces, including the ground. Unfortunately, Kyle Crane cannot use the grappling hook on zombies. The parkour keeps on improving as you level up the Agility tree and chain maneuvers. Do you want to vault off a zombie and dropkick another zombie into spikes or vault off a railing to drop two stories below, avoid damage by rolling, and then continue to run about? It feels like Mirror's Edge's lite with its own style, but no wall running.\n\nThe world of Dying Light uses height well. The first major area in the game is in a poorer part of Harran filled with shops, abandoned vehicles, cheap housing, incomplete skyscrapers, a large highway, a sweet bridge, radio towers, a coast, and open areas to run across. The second major area is dense with buildings which plays very well with the grappling hook and jumping around in general. I greatly enjoyed hopping between two story lampposts to cross a plaza or scrambling up buildings to avoid Volatiles during night. Yes, there are radio towers, but during those sequences I thought the game produced a nice sense of height as wind sounds and camera tilting worked to make me nervous. I think only three of them are part of the critical path for the story, so do not worry.\n\nThey did a good job with making the points in the skill trees feel significant. There are very few skills that have mundane percentage increases and focus more on adding more to the gameplay via new techniques or recipes. You can end up with throwing stars that can freeze zombies, a spinning attack, an upgraded slide to break knees, or the ability to squash the heads of enemies frolicking on the ground. Skill points greatly affect the way you move, fight, and items you can craft.\n\nThe combat has a slow start, but turns into a slaughterfest as strikes start cleaving enemies into two, horizontally and vertically. They could have balanced it better to make the beginning more impactful and prevent the p. I found a great amount of joy in using advanced abilities to destroy hordes of zombies and pesky humans. The humans tend to be much more dangerous when engaging them in melee, especially early in the game. However, you can easily dispatch them with molotovs or grenades if you do not have a firearm handy. I popped heads like watermelons, drop kicked zombies into various environmental hazards, lured enemies into traps, and much more. There should be enough gore in Dying Light for the zombie enthusiast. The zombies come with a bit of variety too. You have normal zombies (Biters), Virals (the runners), Goons, Volatiles (the scary ones), Toads, Bombers, Demolishers, Screamers, hazmat Biters with explosive gas tanks on their back, and Night Hunters if you allow pvp. You will not be killing Volatiles in the beginning. They have multiple attacks and need to be weakened before attacking them. Co-op makes them less scary once your group has decent weapons and support items available, but carelessness will still result death. Co-op is a fun and silly experience with occasional desync hiccups that result in weird physics on bodies.\n\nThe night in Dying Light creates an unfriendly environment filled with tension. The night makes zombies more aggressive, allows Volatiles to come out of their nests, and introduces a four level alert system. The more trouble you cause, the higher the alert level becomes causing many angry zombies to converge on your position. I would recommend carefully killing some regular zombies during the night because experience for both Agility and Power are doubled with a bonus to Survivor level as night ends. Co-op tends to trivialize the night experience if everyone is packing flares unless it is a level four alert. The grappling hook also makes night easier until you miss the ledge of a three story building during a chase. God help you if that happens.\n\nThis game had some issues upon release with many of them resolved. They are still working on additional issues. You can read through this thread to see a comprehensive list of different bugs: http://steamcommunity.com/app/239140/discussions/0/604941528488544773/ I personally experienced four bugs: a waypoint that wouldn't disappear from the map, a ledge on an optional radio tower that sent me out of bounds (I could swim back in), being unable to interact after killing enemies with a gun and then switching weapons (patched), and the inability to reach max Survivor level. Not bad with a system that did not meet minimum specs except for RAM.\n\nThere were some design choices that did not do the game justice here. The sound design for the guns felt flaccid because they fired as if they all had suppressors. Then the game had a few, annoying deaths that made me bitter. They tend to happen in this manner: you go into a room and a Bomber bursts through a door and kills you instantly or you open a door and are greeted by a Bomber or two. At one point in the game, they change the behavior of a hazmat zombie so that it runs toward you and detonates. That kind of design adds nothing to the gameplay or enjoyment of the game. Co-op can help mitigate those situations, but not always. Thankfully, the number of those incidents remains below ten. The game make use of too many camera effects with the long lasting water effect that blurs your screen for far too long irking me the most. There are no options available to turn those effects off. At this time, you will need to mod them out and a good place to start is http://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight/ I know some people do not like those obnoxious effects or film grain. Weapon variety suffers from blunt weapons leaving the weapon pool at higher Survivor levels. Finally, the ending was mechanically disappointing and completely out of place.\n\nDying Light is not a perfect game. It has its flaws, but it is much, much better than Dead Island and is much closer to achieving that wonderful zombie slaying game I have always wanted. The improved movement adds so much to the game when it comes to combat and navigation. The drop kicks are fantastic.","February 9, 2015","true","56.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I also tried out the "Be The Zombie" mode, and found it to be interesting but not very impressive. It felt very much like playing the alien in Aliens VS Predator (minus the wall crawling mechanics of course).\n\nOverall, I'm sure I'll sink a few dozen hours into the game as I did with the Dead Island series.\n\nUPDATE:\nI have been enjoying this game, but have two painful issues to report...\n1.) When you play "Be The Zombie" you can not invade a friend's game the same way you can co-op. They did not use the same friends awareness menu. That REALLY Kills the feature. Now, you can see games near you (low ping) that you can jump into, but not being able to play with friends easily really, really sucks.\n2.) During cut scenes, I very often hear the speech, but the animation time slows down or continues for a few seconds after the audio is done. So it really saps the immersion when this occurs.\n...still, I am enjoying the core game. But am VERY disappointed about the Be The Zombie mode not being readily available through the same CO-OP menu.","January 27, 2015","true","43.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

After playing and beating the game I can say this game is definietly a good purchase depending on a couple things.\nIf you want a TL:DR check the botttom first thing out of the way if you have AMD DO NOT buy this game it is not optimized for it in the slightest wait for a patch if you are using amd and want to play this game. Despite what people say about there being fps issues and it not being optimized that is true for the most part but blown out of proportion if you turn your view distance down your fps is fine. Now that that is out of the way for the sake of my sanity im going to make a simple pros and cons list with some mentions in between. WARNING there will be some minor to medium story spoilers within this if you wish to skip these just watch out for when i have the spoiler warnings and read over it.\n\nPros\nlike dead island with parkour but in a good way\nParkour is fluid and doesnt feel glitchy\nHas a decent story time I clocked in about 25 to 26 hours in my first playthrough (I have not done new game plus with my friends yet so that will probably add about another 20 hours minimum to the game)\nBe the Zombie is a fun gamemode that is an excellent addition to the game\nThe graphics are pretty good especially at night the lighting effects on high are great.\nNight time is actually scary even later in the game\n\n\nCons\nNot optimized for AMD users in the slightest\nAlthough I said i clocked in 25 hours for the story that is including be the zombie time and side missions. The story is disappointingly short if you only do the main story with a couple of side missions getting you maybe 6 to 7 hours.\nThe grappling hook makes it really easy to get away from the volitales (AKA the night creatures) that said it still can get intense in a high even star chase.\nAt the moment be the zombie matchmaking is broken and is hard to get in to a game making it where usually when you finally get in to a game unless someone was already in the game with the host doing co-op it will be a 1v1. Making it unless the human really knows what hes doing makes it a really easy win for the night hunter.\n\n\n\nSide notes\nThe grappling hook to my surprise isnt something that has an infinite amount of uses you can use it two times then it has to recharge. I was worried when i saw it it would remove the parkour mechanic entirely which luckily it doesnt and if anything adds to it.\nThis isnt too big of an issue for me to count this as a con but the uv light can be buggy at times for both sides wether its you shined it at the hunter and it doesnt register or, as your pouncing a human they can somehow shine the light on you.\nFinally something that i found cool myself is that when repairing a weapon you can see visually the metal or other materials you added to the weapon to repair it and weapons dont have infinite repairs meaning eventually the weapon wont be repairable anymore. This is a downside bieng your supe awesome legendary weapon will be inneffective eventually but also nice since it allows you to get somewhat variety in the weapons you use.\n\n\nTl:DR Dont get if your an AMD user otherwise its a good game overall with a great co-op/story experience.\n","January 29, 2015","true","78.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarlaFaye/recommended/239140/","KarlaFaye","오 똥  🚀  (Ohshii)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarlaFaye/","110 products in account","RIght so, first and foremost, Dying Light is hands down the best co-op Zombie game I've ever played since Left4Dead 2, bar none. All those other Zombie genre games are cool and the gang and all that, but Dying Light imo beats all of them out in terms of everything EXCEPT for the competitve multiplayer aspect. Left4Dead 2 is still the best versus zombie modes I've played, however the co-op aspect, Dying Light absolutely slaughters any zombie game past and present imo.\n\nReally fluid combat, amazing graphics, good plotline with a decent few twists, good voice acting (the main character is actually funny, especially on the mission where he has to harass people for money), lots of missions and side missions as well as competitions for co-op purposes. I also like how you can seamlessly join and leave games without the game pausing to load to let people in. The crafting system is much like Dead Island minus the requirement to be at crafting stations which is absolutely outstanding. The new user interface compared to Dead Island's interface is damn near a complete overhaul for the best; you can clearly see that they took the same general concept that they used in Dead Island and listened to their QA team and players who chimed in on how they liked to see it work and made it all come together like Voltron. ^^ The lock picking system is basically like Elder Scrolls: Skyrim (I didnt play the ones before Skyrim sorry~) which is a really easy to learn and probably the best lock-picking system I've ever seen in a game. Also, the in-game voip works exceptionally well -- but they need to add a push to talk feature. For the fear factor I can see them not having it (hearing your friends yell when the zombies go ham, egg and cheese on them at night is hilarious), its also equally annoying as Im not interested in hearing neckbeards in public games breath all heavy and ragged on the mic, have 15 year old Xbox Live players calling me the N word every 4 seconds or hear people speaking another language to someone in RL and completely disregarding what anyone is saying/doing in-game. hahah.  ^^\n\nIt seems like recently, very few games I've seen that are remotely based off a previous title or more have put together the missing pieces to form a much better game. By that I mean Farcry 4 seems like Farcry 3 and that's still good and all but I lost interest pretty quick as the plotline imo wasn't nearly as exciting as Farcry 3 was. Borderlands TPS is literally a reskinned Borderlands 2 with even crappier plotlines, boring content and terrible DLC's. Dying Light literally takes all the good things about Dead Island and merges it with features from other games to make this an outstanding new addition to any Zombie fan's gaming library. ^^ I'm looking forward to the DLC's, because let's face it, it can't be any worse than Borderlands The Pre-Sequel's DLC's so far, lol.\n\nImo the only thing that this game lacks is a female protagonist. I really liked how Dead Island allowed for multiple characters for the main storyline each with their own background. This game focuses solely on one guy and his clusterf*ck of a journey through the land of Immortui.\n\nThe only downside to the controls of this game is with the parkour system being in place along with the grapple hook you can accidently bug yourself out in quite a number of ways. There's a few safehouses that if you grapple into you can get stuck in this floating animation bug with your arm stuck out and the grapple hook floating forever until you take damage or relog. You also stay floating in the air and can fly unlimited during this glitch. Or if you get stuck on boxes your character gets the swimming animation. Both of these glitches in single player can be inconvenient, but in multiplayer make for extrmely hilarious situations hahaha. I'm sure they'll fix those in due time though. ^^\n\nOh and lastly, the grapple hook in this game is amazing! I had no idea it was even in the game until I unlocked it and I said :O when I did haha. I was more than happy with the parkour style movement in this game, so when I was able to basically become Bionic Commando AND kill Zombies at the same time, the top of my head exploded and confetti, cake, rainbows, unicorns, glitter and cupcakes came out! ^^ <3 Best day ever!!\n\n\nTLDR:\nOverall though I still give this game a 9.5 out of 10 even without a female protagonist character. (#femshep best <3)\n\nControls: 9/10 (You can't climb DOWN ladders or ledges without falling or leaping off the side and grappling something near or below you to break the fall.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/recommended/239140/","CrazyCanuck84","CrazyCanuck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrazyCanuck84/","859 products in account","Overview\nAs a fan of all things zombie, I’ve been looking forward to Dying Light for a while now. Overall, it’s a great game, and it has much going for it, but there are some odd design issues, a serious case of couriering (is that a word?) and just some attention-to-detail features that make me go, what?\n\nI’ve played for about 28 hours, I’m at 70% story completion, I’ve finished 39 side missions, and I’ve done six of the quarantine zones, as of the time of this review.\n\nWant the TL:DR? Great game with great mechanics, a story that slowly devolves into a clichéd mess, with some technical issues that shouldn’t really exist, and a few questionable design choices spread throughout. Still a great game. If I were to put it on a numbered scale, it’d get a seven out of ten.\n\nThe Good\n+ Visuals are astounding, great atmospheric effects (such as debris floating around), explosions look terrific, zombies have great models. One touch I quite like is if a viral is in front of you and screams, their mouth actually opens and closes as it screams. Not a big deal, but adds a touch of realism.\n\n+ Sound is also great, be it the music or effects. Connecting with a melee weapon gives a satisfying crunch, and guns sound like how guns should; firing off a shotgun blast results in a roar, not a pathetic tinny sound many games use for gun sounds.\n\n+ The story, at least at the beginning. Sure, it’s rehashed (something happens, people become zombies), but it’s presented differently and keeps you intrigued for a bit, drawing you into wondering what happened.\n\n+ The main mission. The primary goal of the game changes a few hours into the story, but the missions that you undertake for the main story are great, and they aren’t recycled very much.\n\n+ Parkour. If Dying Light didn’t have a parkour element, it would definitely be your standard zombie exploration game. Not only does the parkour add an extra dimension, but it’s also done right; it doesn’t feel tacky or sloppy.\n\n+ Progression and perks. There are three categories you improve in: Survivor, Agility, Power. Survivor points are gained by completing quests and quarantine zones, as well as challenges. Agility points are gained by just playing the game; climbing, jumping, strafing. Power points are gained by killing; melee, firearms, explosions, traps. There are 25 levels of each, and the perks are pretty nice. They act as a tree, and to unlock one, you’ll have to unlock the first tier and go from there. It’s not too in-depth, but adds a nice touch.\n\n+ Night mode. Nighttime adds an extra layer of trouble for you; it’s pitch black, and there are more dangerous zombies with heightened senses. It’s basically a stealth mode. However, completing quests, exploring or just being outside doubles what you earn for the period.\n\n+ Random events. There are many random events. Air drops, which contain relief packages and some other goodies, are the big one for the first little bit. Get there quick enough, it’ll be yours. Take your time, you may have to fight off some other humans for it. Take too long, and you’ll lose the drop completely. There will be random survivors under attack who will reward you for helping them. Some people may turn into shopkeepers when you save them, giving you another location to buy and sell from. Some people might only be there to give some background on life in Harran before the outbreak. Maybe you’ll help a group of survivors fight off some zombies, only to have them attack you afterwards. Lots can happen!\n\nThe Bad\n- The story. As I said, the story starts off great, but after a couple of hours, it devolves into what has been seen hundreds of times before. I won’t give it away, but you can likely figure out what your goal changes to.\n\n- Hit detection/clipping. I’ve mainly seen this on the bigger guys with the huge rebars, but the hit detection is atrocious. He’ll begin swinging, I’ll dodge backwards completely out of range (even of the shockwave), yet I’ll still get hit by it. Same for clipping. I might run behind a truck, yet the attack still manages to get me.\n\n- First aid. To make a medkit, you need alcohol and gauze. Pretty realistic, as that will actually tend to wounds, although not restore you fully. Yet every single first aid/medical box you open will have gauze. Just gauze. No alcohol. A few hours in, I had maybe nine bottles of alcohol, yet I was up to 50 or so gauze. Just seems weird.\n\n- Night mode. Yes, night mode is good (see The Good). But it’s not really that much more difficult. Your survivor sense will show an outline of the dangerous ones, and the minimap always shows their vision cone, so it’s not at all challenging to avoid them. You’ll likely only run into them if you mistime a jump and fall hard and one’s nearby, or if you kill an enemy that makes a loud noise (hazmat guy by attacking the air compressor, or have one of the bloaters blow up).\n\n- Technical issues. Even after the 1.2.1 patch, there are a few technical issues. While they obviously won’t apply to everyone, every few times I quit the game, it doesn’t exit properly. It drops me to the desktop, but the game is still running in task manager. I then have to end the task, and upon restarting the game, it begins in windowed mode, and I have to set it to full screen.\n\nAside from the odd exit issue, cutscenes sometimes freezes for a few seconds while the audio plays. If I wind up getting hit directly by the belching zombie’s green blob thing, the game freezes for a few seconds. Lowering view distance seems to help, but I shouldn’t have to lower that to compensate for poor optimization.\n\nThe Rest\n+ Zombie models are pretty varied, with lots of different combinations. While you will run into reused models, they’ll be few and far between.\n\n- Godlike human enemies. Zombies, sure, they might take a little to knock down. But the humans are definitely of a godlike stature. There is no reason why, after burning for ten seconds from a Molotov cocktail, that they should survive a shot to the head from a pistol, and still require a few whacks to put down for good. That’s just ridiculous.\n\n- Not much variation in the boxes or crates you run across. If you see a green, white or yellow box that looks dirty or rusty, it’ll never require a lockpick. Likewise, if you come across a box that looks nice, or adorned with something, even if it’s in the dirtiest part of the slums, it’ll require lockpicking.\n\n- Most of the side quests are typical courier fare. Go talk to person, get item for them, return, get reward. This is a good 90% of the side quests, not including the quarantine missions. It’s like an MMO in the way they’ve handled Crane being a courier.\n\n- Protected survivors. Every now and then, you’ll see a shield icon on your map; these are survivors who need escorting. They are all annoying, they don’t shut up, it’s never A to B, and they all run headfirst into every zombie without waiting for an escort. For example, a fisherman wants you to escort him to his secret fishing spot. But before that, you’ll need to escort him to his rod. And listen to him talk about what a good deal it was. There’s also the American guy. I wanted to shoot his legs out and leave him for the zombies.","January 31, 2015","true","39.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","9","15","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/recommended/239140/","FreakOramaXD","FreakOrama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FreakOramaXD/","737 products in account","Dying Light, the second big title made by Techland after Dead Island, and it's a first person shooter, that has parkour going on with it, with zombies, in an open world setting, and it's good. I'd describe the game where it has Dead Island's zombies and nice combat, the open worldness and perspective of Far Cry, and the map design level and parkour of Assassin's Creed.\n\nStarting with the graphics, they look really great, especially noticeable after the second half of the game. The animations and the lip-sync in cut-scenes or character interactions are noticeably not that good, and the graphical effects like blurry fog/water-drops are an inconvenience, and an annoyance that you have to put up with throughout the game.\n\nThe parkour controls are good and simple, and the melee combat controls are great and 'meaty', with the fire-arm controls being decent. The inventory management system isn't that great to interface with, at least not at first, which certainly could have been better.\n\nThe open world is fun and varied to play and parkour around in, with buildings to go through, and rooftops to hop on to. Filled with good amount of zombies, loot, and side missions to play with, and it's not cluttered with it, for example like Ubisoft games. The open world is also split into two big sandbox areas, the first one is nice and all, but the second one is where the beauty of the game is. A lot more nice to look at and to play around in, with how it is designed, more traversal and parkouring routes to have fun in, and just overall a better feeling to it.\n\nThe story isn't anything new, but at least they're trying to progress it in a way. Also, the main character you play as, he can kill, parkour and whatnot, and you'd expect him to have the ability to do those things because of who he is and how he is presented in the story, not just a random dude who got caught up in the mess, knowing how to do everything and be the best at it with no past experience. So what I'm saying is, Techland knows how to present a character, that makes sense, better than how Ubisoft presents them in their games.\n\nThe game is lengthy, with decently long campaign, and there being a lot of side quests that's, that's not that bad, you can do and finish. There's only one quick-time battle event in the game, it's short but still an annoyance to have it happen, made me think "Really? Now you want to add a QTE?".\n\nThe coop is fun, having another person, two, or three with you, jumping, exploring, and killing zombies and other enemy humans in the open world that it has for us to mess around with is really fun, kind of makes you feel like you own the city and have a really powerful group. Be The Zombie mode is really fun, it's like a toxic version of spider man, basically you can keep yourself afloat all the time, which is fun, but going against people is really hard though. Haven't dug deep into it so I'm not sure if it's a bad or a good thing that it's hard.\n\nTechland really made a huge leap in quality from their first game, Dead Island, making Dying Light a nice surprise of fun and excitement, and the reason why I mention Ubisoft a couple of times is because they are doing a lot of stuff better then them, so much so that it's worth a mention. The game is fun and is worth your time and money. So, I'll just go hop back in coop and kill more zombies.\n\nShameless link[www.ksalue.com] to original post.","February 3, 2015","true","10.9"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","0"

Its very laggy for anyone without a good computer so I recoomend you get this to expand your options and get the most FPS: ( http://www.nexusmods.com/dyinglight/mods/18/? )\n\nIts anoying how broken and glitchy some parts are though. For example, if you have low FPS then its impossible for you to 100% the game because of how broken challanges are (Not like they are any fun or lead up to anything special, just a time waster) Anyway, if you have low FPS then your game will run slower, however all challanges have a timer and my god is this stupid but the timer counts down faster then it would if you had 30+ FPS. If you dont belive me try an agility challange ranked "medium" with less then 10 FPS and see if its even possible to reach the second to last checkpoints of ANY challange. I kid you not there is only 2 ways of fixing problems like these: Get that graphical mod in the link above and set everything to TF2 graphics just to do the challanges or use Cheat Engin.\n\nLast bit of rant is that I sometimes (often) start up the game hearing distorted sound and audio with clicking in the background. I cant find any fix or update for any hardware/software for this and its only random it appears in the game but not many people have this. The grappler is also buggy, sometimes it doesnt want to work and sometimes it wont let you grab onto anything after it pulls you in (Which is suicide). Finally, this isnt really much of a survival game because med kits are so easy to make that you wont ever run out of them later on, same for orange/legendary/unique weapons, you can just buy one and keep using it until you need an upgrade.\n\nSooo, if you have a crappy computer then maybe consider passing on it unless you dont mind TF2 graphics, if you have a great computer then I highly recommend it.","February 8, 2015","true","118.0"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","13","23","3","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bagobonez/recommended/239140/","bagobonez","Angry Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bagobonez/","220 products in account","Just finished the game today. Really enjoyed it. It is pretty similar to Dead Island with the biggest difference being the vertical aspect of movement that Dead Island lacked. Parkour is a lot of fun and is similar to Mirror's Edge. The world is huge and open. Just about every building can be entered and explored. Loot is everywhere. Combat is fun. Crafting is fun. The quests are fun. Challenges are fun. Movement is fun. Almost everything about this game is simply fun.\n\nThe storyline is really good as well and is lengthy. I logged 57 hours in the game and left out some of the stuff you can do although I feel confident that I covered almost all of it.\n\nI really only had 2 complaints. The first is that my frame rate would dip when one of the spitting special zombies would hit me in the face with spit. Possibly correctable with tweaked settings and/or improved hardware. The other is the "water blur" effect on the screen any time you get wet. It's super annoying and makes it nearly impossible to see anything for a good 5 seconds after you get out of the water.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this game. It's fun just to run/parkour around the city. It almost becomes an art form after you get the hang of it. Well done, Techland!","March 5, 2015","true","58.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I feel like I've played forever, between side missions and main story, and I'm far from halfway of the story... so it is worth the money, since you will be getting long hours, if you are completionist.\n\nZombies, violence, drugs and gore... if you are cool with that, I recommend it.","February 5, 2015","true","40.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkdavis/recommended/239140/","sporkdavis","Ypawinz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sporkdavis/","262 products in account","Take the best parts of Far Cry 3, Mirror's Edge, and your favorite zombie apocalypse game. Add in 4-player co-op, and invasions a la Dark Souls 2, and you've got a recipe for a great time.  I had heard about this game briefly back when it was announced and was so burned out on the zombie thing by then, I didn't think to give it a second look. When it was released, I remembered what I had heard, and after reading that it had co-op and invasions, decided I had to have it.\n\nI jumped into the story really not having any clue what the game was about, apart from zombies, and while it's not the most exciting, original, or believable thing, it was enough to draw me into the game and get me on a path to where I cared enough about the characters I met early on to keep going. It pretty much stayed that way throughout. - nothing that I was super enthralled in, but enough to keep me going.\n\nThe big thing throughout the game is the day/night cycle and the difference between the two. After the tutorial and first major quest, you'll understand what I mean.  I don't want to ruin the fun.\n\nThe parkour-esque aspect of the game felt as good, if not better, than Mirror's Edge. Running, jumping, sliding, climbing, grappling, it's all really fluid and feels really well. Your character gets tired when it makes sense and, while there are some questionably inhuman feats, most of what you're able to do is believable apart from maybe some of the grappling stuff.\n\nThe combat feels great. Early on it can be a bit weird as you get used to the combat stamina mechanic and learn how much you can dish out before you need to take a breather, but overall it is very smooth and oddly satisfying when you bust open, chop off, or stomp on someone's/something's head.  The gunplay isn't bad either, it's about what you'd expect from something like this. There aren't but a few gun options in the game, most of which are pretty uniform throughout. If there are upgrades or options to them, I haven't found them yet.  That said, guns aren't usually the best idea anyway, as the noise can attract some pretty unfriendly folks.\n\nThe multiplayer is really satisfying. Co-op takes the singleplayer experience to a new level. It lets you drop in/out of friends games, and vice versa, and let's you help each other advance the story, create friendly competitions, or just go on zombie squashing rampages together.   If you enable Hunter Invasions, other players can invade your game as a super crazy "Night Hunter" zombie and try and track down you and/or your buddies in a race to kill you before you can destroy all of its nests around town.  If you win, you get some xp and cool stuff, and if the zombie wins, it gets stronger and stronger.\n\nTL;DR - If you like ANY of the games I mentioned in the first sentence, take a small look at this. If you like everything I mentioned, get this game. You probably won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.  Good night.

CO-OP works fine now and it's better optimized so to all the people having read the bad reviews take THIS into account. If you're into this kind of game, I highly recommend it. It's GREAT!\n\nNow my review:\n\nI never actually intended to buy this game, until my friends suggested it. And here I am 50 hours later I've been playing one of the few games that have hooked me in a LONG time.\nIt has a bit of Far Cry and Mirrors edge with a dash of Fallout in it.\nThe parkour and freerunning system is so smooth you never want to use roads/stairs/streets etc.\nWhen night falls and you decide to stay outside safezones, you often find your self in FIGHT or FLIGHT situations.\n\nPros:\n\n- You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks\n- Great combat system with a lot of different meleeweapons (in the end game there are fewer though)\n- Night time is extremely fun and exhilarating, and offers various challenges. (It has day and night cycle, which if you choose you can skip by staying in a safezone and sleep until the morning).\n- Good weapon customization and crafting. You want a kitchen knife which electrifies zombies? Slap on a powercable some batteries and a conductor, tighten it with ductape and you're good to go. Real McGyver stuff right there. You want an old fashioned double-barrel shotgun to split zombies in half with? You get that too.\n- A lot of sidequests, varying from interesting to down right awesome!\n- Supersmooth parkour/freerunning system which makes escaping and/or exploring really fun\n- At night stealth is really a good option, which makes it exciting\n- You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks.\nAnd much more!\n\nCons:\n\n- Story was OK but nothing special, the ending was kind of dissapointing.\n- When you're at max level you have a smaller selection of weapons which are viable.\n- You can't just kill a zombie, you have to make sure it's dead by bashing it with your hammer until there's just a pulp left, or maybe that's just me.... (Not really a con, it's awesome).\n\nI really do recommend this game, and I think you should buy it. If you like open world games with deep survival elements you will not be dissapointed. You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks. The main reason I bought the game, but hey.. I now know that it's one of the best I've played in a long time!\n\nThank you for reading.

The core mechanics are all incredibly solid and entertaining, complemented by skill trees that actually matter, opening up your gameplay experience as you progress through them. While the main story is pretty generic, the characters, voice acting, and motion capture make it a far more involving experience than the laughable plot and delivery of the first game's story. Surprisingly, though, the side quests are where the game really shows its character. It's not quite Dead Rising levels of bonkers, but they're quirky and interesting enough to make you want to actually do them all. On the squishy side of the banana, the game is terribly optimized, especially for any AMD components. Still, it's not bad enough to ruin what is essentially a super fun game. Pick it up on sale and blast through it - it's a hunk of zombie slaying goodness.","February 4, 2015","true","48.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The feel of the game and sounds of the game are just perfect. A zombie survival done right. In a way its like a hardcore dead island, and some. The parkour is an awsome addiction and adds to the night rush. You are not a god that can kill anything no matter the numbers. It gets to a point were its fight or flight, and fighting might kill you. The Zombie AI ranges from dumb to really scary. Night time is not like other games were its just stronger zombies and a larger number of them, Dying Lights night time is more intense, the night zombies are fast and will chase you and call their friends. Facing more than 1 is deadly. Overall it is a very well amde game, a few bugs that are not even important.

The main attraction of this game is its freedom of movement. Your player character can traverse almost any path, building, walls, fences, or even poles as long as it is within reach.\n\nThe combat mechanics are intense in the beginning but slowly getting rather monotone near the end due to stronger equipment but make no mistake, it is still challenging.\n\nNow, the night cycle. It is really an incredible idea. It intensify the survival aspect of this game and you can actually really feel the horror at the first few night cycles (or even opt to skip the night directly) but I suppose I could say that this is how Dying Light is meant to play. During Night Cycle.\n\nPro:\n- fluid movement\n- realistic cinematic story telling from the first person point of view\n- intense FPS melee combat experience\n- realistic application of weapon type (blunt, sharp, heavy weapon, etc)\n- the sound and BGM intensify the horror which bring more fun\n\nCon:\n- despite how good the story telling is, it is actually rather short. Guess DLC will expand it somehow\n- type of weapon or weapon of choice is rather limited even with the number of variation\n\nAll in all, I suggest you play it during night.

When it was released, I remembered what I had heard, and after reading that it had co-op and invasions, decided I had to have it.\n\nI jumped into the story really not having any clue what the game was about, apart from zombies, and while it's not the most exciting, original, or believable thing, it was enough to draw me into the game and get me on a path to where I cared enough about the characters I met early on to keep going. It pretty much stayed that way throughout. - nothing that I was super enthralled in, but enough to keep me going.\n\nThe big thing throughout the game is the day/night cycle and the difference between the two. After the tutorial and first major quest, you'll understand what I mean.  I don't want to ruin the fun.\n\nThe parkour-esque aspect of the game felt as good, if not better, than Mirror's Edge. Running, jumping, sliding, climbing, grappling, it's all really fluid and feels really well. Your character gets tired when it makes sense and, while there are some questionably inhuman feats, most of what you're able to do is believable apart from maybe some of the grappling stuff.\n\nThe combat feels great. Early on it can be a bit weird as you get used to the combat stamina mechanic and learn how much you can dish out before you need to take a breather, but overall it is very smooth and oddly satisfying when you bust open, chop off, or stomp on someone's/something's head.  The gunplay isn't bad either, it's about what you'd expect from something like this. There aren't but a few gun options in the game, most of which are pretty uniform throughout. If there are upgrades or options to them, I haven't found them yet.  That said, guns aren't usually the best idea anyway, as the noise can attract some pretty unfriendly folks.\n\nThe multiplayer is really satisfying. Co-op takes the singleplayer experience to a new level. It lets you drop in/out of friends games, and vice versa, and let's you help each other advance the story, create friendly competitions, or just go on zombie squashing rampages together.   If you enable Hunter Invasions, other players can invade your game as a super crazy "Night Hunter" zombie and try and track down you and/or your buddies in a race to kill you before you can destroy all of its nests around town.  If you win, you get some xp and cool stuff, and if the zombie wins, it gets stronger and stronger.\n\nTL;DR - If you like ANY of the games I mentioned in the first sentence, take a small look at this. If you like everything I mentioned, get this game. You probably won't be disappointed. I know I wasn't.  Good night. Good luck.","February 4, 2015","true","52.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

CO-OP works fine now and it's better optimized so to all the people having read the bad reviews take THIS into account. If you're into this kind of game, I highly recommend it. It's GREAT!\n\nNow my review:\n\nI never actually intended to buy this game, until my friends suggested it. And here I am 50 hours later I've been playing one of the few games that have hooked me in a LONG time.\nIt has a bit of Far Cry and Mirrors edge with a dash of Fallout in it.\nThe parkour and freerunning system is so smooth you never want to use roads/stairs/streets etc.\nWhen night falls and you decide to stay outside safezones, you often find your self in FIGHT or FLIGHT situations.\n\nPros:\n\n- You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks\n- Great combat system with a lot of different meleeweapons (in the end game there are fewer though)\n- Night time is extremely fun and exhilarating, and offers various challenges. (It has day and night cycle, which if you choose you can skip by staying in a safezone and sleep until the morning).\n- Good weapon customization and crafting. You want a kitchen knife which electrifies zombies? Slap on a powercable some batteries and a conductor, tighten it with ductape and you're good to go. Real McGyver stuff right there. You want an old fashioned double-barrel shotgun to split zombies in half with? You get that too.\n- A lot of sidequests, varying from interesting to down right awesome!\n- Supersmooth parkour/freerunning system which makes escaping and/or exploring really fun\n- At night stealth is really a good option, which makes it exciting\n- You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks.\nAnd much more!\n\nCons:\n\n- Story was OK but nothing special, the ending was kind of dissapointing.\n- When you're at max level you have a smaller selection of weapons which are viable.\n- You can't just kill a zombie, you have to make sure it's dead by bashing it with your hammer until there's just a pulp left, or maybe that's just me.... (Not really a con, it's awesome).\n\nI really do recommend this game, and I think you should buy it. If you like open world games with deep survival elements you will not be dissapointed. You can bash a zombies skull in until your weapon breaks. The main reason I bought the game, but hey.. I now know that it's one of the best I've played in a long time!\n\nThank you for reading. Good night, and GOOD LUCK!","February 4, 2015","true","110.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The core mechanics are all incredibly solid and entertaining, complemented by skill trees that actually matter, opening up your gameplay experience as you progress through them. While the main story is pretty generic, the characters, voice acting, and motion capture make it a far more involving experience than the laughable plot and delivery of the first game's story. Surprisingly, though, the side quests are where the game really shows its character. It's not quite Dead Rising levels of bonkers, but they're quirky and interesting enough to make you want to actually do them all. On the squishy side of the banana, the game is terribly optimized, especially for any AMD components. Still, it's not bad enough to ruin what is essentially a super fun game. Pick it up on sale and blast through it - it's a hunk of zombie slaying goodness.","February 4, 2015","true","48.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The feel of the game and sounds of the game are just perfect. A zombie survival done right. In a way its like a hardcore dead island, and some. The parkour is an awsome addiction and adds to the night rush. You are not a god that can kill anything no matter the numbers. It gets to a point were its fight or flight, and fighting might kill you. The Zombie AI ranges from dumb to really scary. Night time is not like other games were its just stronger zombies and a larger number of them, Dying Lights night time is more intense, the night zombies are fast and will chase you and call their friends. Facing more than 1 is deadly. Overall it is a very well amde game, a few bugs that are not even important.

The main attraction of this game is its freedom of movement. Your player character can traverse almost any path, building, walls, fences, or even poles as long as it is within reach.\n\nThe combat mechanics are intense in the beginning but slowly getting rather monotone near the end due to stronger equipment but make no mistake, it is still challenging.\n\nNow, the night cycle. It is really an incredible idea. It intensify the survival aspect of this game and you can actually really feel the horror at the first few night cycles (or even opt to skip the night directly) but I suppose I could say that this is how Dying Light is meant to play. During Night Cycle.\n\nPro:\n- fluid movement\n- realistic cinematic story telling from the first person point of view\n- intense FPS melee combat experience\n- realistic application of weapon type (blunt, sharp, heavy weapon, etc)\n- the sound and BGM intensify the horror which bring more fun\n\nCon:\n- despite how good the story telling is, it is actually rather short. Guess DLC will expand it somehow\n- type of weapon or weapon of choice is rather limited even with the number of variation\n\nAll in all, I suggest you play it during night.

The game delivers on exciting parkour gameplay, a fun story, amazing amounts of freedom and exploration. One of the best aspects of the game is that it evolves from escaping zombies on the rooftops to destroying every one that moves. That sense of constant progression and satisfaction is there all the time and it is wildly addicting to say the least.

Would buy it again.\n\nIf you have a powerful PC and you like Zombies, open world games, looting, crafting and free running like in Mirror's Edge or Assassin's Creed, leveling like in Skyrim, then you will love this game for sure.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely breathtaking. I am currently running this on an i7 3930k with two GTX 680 (2gig) in SLI. It runs with everything on max ( except textures on "medium" and the view distance slider at 40% with a locked 60+fps without stutters ). On high texture the game fluctuates between 40-60fps. Definitely playable, but I prefer my FPS more stable than that, so medium textures it is. I have no regrets :D Game still looks breathtaking. I am afraid this game has ruined a lot of games for me this year. Once you see how the wind works in the game how the particles and foliage sways with it you will want wind like that in every game. Damn.\n\nAlso, don't be fooled, the medium textures in this game are extremely high rez and beautiful. They look sharper than the Ultra textures from Watch Dogs while the high textures are simply ridiculous. I haven't figured out what the "view distance" slider does, besides having an impact on performance. I can't spot the difference. Check Total Biscuit's video on that and you'll see what I mean.\n\nBy far the most fun I have had with a AAA game in the past 12 months. Haven't been this engrossed and immersed by a game in quite a while.\n\nThe drop-in COOP is extremely seemless and fun. It's too early for me to say anything about the story but it seems servicable and does it job.\n\nAnyhow. Felt I needed to write something about the game, as I am having an absolute blast.\n\nIf you think your PC can handle it even at lowest settings. Buy it.

But this game is beautiful. Not only does it deliver in the exploration but it delivers a very satisfying crafting experience, as well as brutal combat.\n\nLet me get into the first few hours of my experience with Dying Light, I was intrigued at the intro, the story is a cliche, but it really got me into thinking about the characters. And I thought that Itd be boring doing side quests, but every character seems to have his or her own personality, aside from some npcs looking the exact same, every quest has something different about it. And some quests align with eachother depending on what npc plays a part in the main story. But instead of playing the story I would find myself exploring the environment which is very pretty and there is a high level of detail in it.\nI saw a building in the distance that had a zombie on the rooftop, and I thought "Im gonna go kill that zombie."\nSo I sprinted off another rooftop, climbed through a building, saw a chest, picked its lock, looked around that building and inside and found a way to make it a safe house by pushing the bookshelves in front of the windows, preventing any zombies to climb in. After I had done this I heard a character say "Dont be a hero, get to a safe house now, youve got about one hour." I was like, one hour? I can go kill that zombie I saw on a rooftop and explore that building. So I set out to do just that. Before I knew it though, It was getting very dark. And as I arrived at the house it was night. And fear sets in. I was trying to sneak back to the safehouse I just recently secured but was spotted by a hunterzombie. And the chase was on, Now I had just started playing so I wasnt very good at the freerunning which at first is not seemless. You have to really pay attention to where you are going and jumping, which is good. It adds to the desperation you feel when running from this... thing. I was running through the darkness, jumping and climbing until I realized I had climbed very high and I jumped without thinking into a rooftop that broke underneath my feet. I hard screams all around me, I couldnt see a thing. I tried to climb out but it was too late, I had been caught by the Hunter.\n\nI loved every minute of that chase and desperation. Even though I died it made me go, WOW! I was actually scared by a zombie game. Anyway, moving on, coop is also satisfying. You and 3 friends can do quests, the main story, or challenges. And lets not forget the invasions by other players at night while they take on the role of a hunter.\n\n8.5/10","February 1, 2015","true","75.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"
