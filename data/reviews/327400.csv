You build colonies to gather trade goods to ship to the mother land for cash. There are also Three other Computer players competing with you. While building your Colony network, you slowly receive higher and higher taxes.  After much work, you can build up the Rebels in your country and try to fight for your Independence!\n\nBased on the game age, this is a Nine out of Ten!!\n","October 9, 2014","true","67.0"," 108 of 122 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","108","122","0","0"

For those new to Colonization, you'll find this to be a solid Sid Meier strategy game that deviates from the strict formula of the Civilization series.  If retro games aren't your thing, this game was also remade using the Civ 4 engine.\n\nThe gameplay focuses on building up an economic empire in the New World, with your primary source of income coming from shipping valuable goods back to Europe to sell.  Your eventual goal is to create a self-sufficient nation and declare independence from from your parent country back in Europe.  Along the way, you'll have to compete with other European powers settling the New World, as well as increasingly troublesome (but wealthy!) natives.\n\nStarting off, the game is quite forgiving.  The other European powers are generally more focused on building their own empires than on wiping you out, but can and will cause you trouble later.  Similarly, the Native Americans all start off friendly toward you and even give you free stuff, but their attitude will gradually sour toward you, even if you just leave them alone.  This will sound cold and heartless, but in the end, genocide is the best solution, as they will harass you without end otherwise.  The huge amounts of treasure you'll get from looting Indian villages is just a bonus.\n\nAs I said above, the gameplay deviates quite a bit from the standard Civ fomula.  There are a lot more resources, for one thing: 16 material goods, as well as a few immaterial resources, like liberty bells (increases rebel sentiment, which gives bonuses to production, and attracts Founding Fathers) and crosses (attracts immigrants).  Of the material goods, most are meant solely for selling, but the rest are vital for running your colonies.  I'll explain this a bit more indepth further down.\n\nAnother difference between this and Civ is that Population = Units.  Aside from ships, wagons, and artillery, all your units are colonists that can be given different equipment to create different units.  Each colonist can be trained in one profession, giving them a bonus to performing that job (usually, increasing resource yields).  When asigning a colonist to work a tile around your colony, they can only gather one resource at a time, but you won't usually need more than one of any type of gatherer except for farmers.  You can also asign colonists to work the buildings inside your colony.  For example, the weaver's house converts cotton into cloth.\n\nColonists are also your units.  Give them tools to turn them into a Pioneer so they can build roads, clear forests, and plow fields.  Give them horses to turn them into a Scout, which moves faster, sees farther, can interact with native villages, and gets better results from lost cities.  Give them muskets to turn them into Soldiers, your most basic and most common military unit, or equip a Soldier with horses to make them a stronger and faster Dragoon.  Also of note is that any colonist can found a colony; there's no "settler" type unit like in Civ.\n\nAs far as ships go, most of them are used for hauling loot and trading.  Of special mention, though, is the Privateer.  A Privateer's ownership is invisible except to the player that owns it.  This means that Privateers can attack other players even when you are at peace with them, but at the same time your Privateers are also fair game to any Frigates in the area.  Hurray for piracy!\n\nAnother difference from Civ is that there is no research or tech tree.  The closest analogue would be the Founding Fathers, which confer various bonuses, including things like unlocking buildings, and are earned with liberty bells.  Since liberty bells also increase the desire for independence among your colonists (which will eventually net you bonuses to resource production), you'll want lots of them anyway.\n\nIf you want a strong and self-suficient colony, there are a few things you absolutely need:\n\nOCEAN ACCESS:  Since a large part of the game revolves around trade, you absolutely need a way to load a ship up with goods.  Landlocked colonies aren't impossible, as you can use wagons to transport goods to a colony with a port, but I'd reccomend beginners stick with seaside colonies at first.\n\nFOOD:  Your colonists need to eat.  Shipping food to a perpetually starving colony is no fun and better avoided altogether.  Fortunately, food is pretty easy to get as long as you're not settling in the arctic.  Food can also be converted into horses, which is important for a strong military.  You need at least 2 horses in a colony and then they'll breed automatically.\n\nLUMBER:  Lumber is converted into hammers by a carpenter.  This is how you build buildings in your colonies.  You can buy buildings with gold, but that quickly gets expensive.  You can also ship lumber in from another colony, but this can be a pain.  Just make sure to keep one forest tile next to your colony, as you shouldn't need more than one lumberjack.\n\nORE:  Ore is converted into tools, which are used by Pioneers for terraforming.  20 tools are consumed for every terraforming job.  Also, all but the most basic buildings will also require tools to build.  As such, you'll need to have a steady supply of tools.  And once you're done terraforming and building buildings, tools can be turned into muskets.\n\nAside from the above, everything else is optional.  You don't need sugar, or furs, or cotton, or tobacco.  These will help you make some cash, but they're largely interchangeable with one another.\n\nSome last tips:  Remember, the natives are not your friends!  Or, at least, they won't be for very long.  Whatever you do, DO NOT give them horses or muskets.  You can make a lot of quick cash by trading with the natives early on, but they'll quickly wise up that you're scamming them.  You can prevent tax hikes by reenacting the Boston Tea Party, which will increase rebel sentiment in that colony, but also makes you unable to trade that resource in Europe anymore.  Lastly, make sure you're ready for a war of apocalyptic proportions before declaring independence.  I'm not kidding.\n\nThis game was perhaps my favorite growing up, and while it's aged a bit (really missing edge-scrolling and right-click-to-move), it's still a very solid game, and I'd heartily reccomend it to anyone interested in the genre.","October 10, 2014","true","8.9"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","20","20","0","0"

As long as the publishers decided to revive and redistribute this awesome classic, they could've cared more about the packaging and the distribution methods. Back in the days there was a Windows 95 version of the game with a higher resolution (640x480 instead of 320x200), but the older, inferior DOS version is the one chosen to be included in this package. Furthermore, I was lucky enough to have the game remaining in Window mode after Alt-tabbing once, but I heard others weren't that lucky with this DosBox version.\n\nAs some other reviewer said, if you already had the game in other form, it makes little to no sense to get it here on Steam too. They could've added some Steam achievements or trading cards or whatnot to it... but... did I mentioned laziness above?\n\nAs for the game itself, well, Sid Meier's Colonization was amazing 20 years ago and it still feels good even today. It's just as addictive as I remember it. I also had a good laugh when, to close it, I had to chose "Exit to DOS". I was running it on DOS those many years ago on a computer that was 20 times less powerful than my current smartphone. Nevertheless, Colonization aged so nicely.\n\nI was quite surprised to see that this 20-year old game is still smarter and more complex than many of nowadays' games. The way it drives you towards the unavoidable climax of having to declare Independence and fight the colonial troops is really impressive as it's discrete and gradual. You know it's gonna happen yet you can rarely feel properly prepared. It's that challenging nature of the 90's games, when games were truly hard and satisfying to win, not just feeding you false rewards.\n\nAnd it's complex, just like it's expected from a turn-based strategy game created by Sid Meier and based on Civilisation to be. You have to take into account the natives, the other nations, the available resources, the "King's demands", religions, trades, politics, and so on. Briefly, Colonization is impressively comprehensive especially when you think how old it is.\n\nThe graphics are decent for a DOS game. Blue is for sea, green is for land, you get the point. :) No one plays this game because of the graphics anyway.\n\nI conclusion, I highly recommend the game itself, but also condemn the packaging/the way they decided to just add in on Steam, without caring as much as they've should.","December 13, 2014","true","2.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","3"

If that's all you need to know, don't read on, buy it and i'll focus the rest of the review on what could have been.\n\nA turn based strategy offering, Colonization is a timeless classic that has immense replay value and an excellent soundtrack to boot. If a turn based strategy game is your thing, you cannot be disappointed, it's impossible.\n\nHowever, if you did already own it in another form, whether DOS, Amiga or other, what reasons are there to buy here, other than to have it in your library? I cannot honestly see any other reason.\n\nThe files and structure are identical to those that have been freely available (rightly or wrongly, it's always a point of debate) as 'Abandonware' for many years now. To run those files, you would have needed DOSBox which has handily been included as part of this package. That may in fact be a positive, Colonization in your Steam library, with one click access to DOSBox and no need to mount a path or create a config file. Some mention of DOSBox on the store page would have been helpful though, given other reviews now appearing about the release.\n\nBut it could have been so much more, more than what is offered which is essentially old files bundled together by someone that has bought the rights and is selling them at a price, albeit very reasonable. It's just a case of doing very little work and putting it for release on Steam.\n\nWhat about achievements? Imagine 'Achievement Unlocked: Armed Natives & Subsequently Beheaded'. What about visually improving the look of the game itself? Of course, there is a certain romance about playing an older game and the way it looked all of those years ago but it can work, look at Leisure Suit Larry & Secret Of Monkey Island, there is a place for a visually enhanced version of an older title. Such a missed opportunity in my opinion, Colonization: Special Edition* could have been something to take an even bigger pride of place in the collection.\n\n*And no, 'Civilization IV: Colonization' isn't it......","October 11, 2014","true","13.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","1"

A race!\n\nI tried downloading it, and doing the dosbox thing, but if any of you out there have experience as a game lover, the right speed, the right grapics, the right windows pack to use: it becomes a nightmare.\nOften graphics would cut out, flip out, change on a whim.

Not learn how to program a niche language from a forgotten time.\n\nThis is why this game, and worms, and other old school games are worth it on steam. While there are still the old 1992 bugs present in particular situations, the special price of this game at 3 bucks US$ is too good to pass up\nThat and the movability from system to system for what is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ for evolving systems and the proof will be in the pudding of steam maintaining compatability, rather than spending time trying to fix ancient code for a new audience.\n\n\n5 stars, and thank you Steam","February 10","true","49.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The later Civilization games stressed empire building, science and military domination. Colonization stresses more of an economic and diplomatic approach and I personally love it.  My only knock on the game are some of the bugs/limitations in the programming. For example, the unit cap, lacking combat system, inability to check market prices during a trade, inconsistencies with using a mouse, inability to forward through the sailing intro, sound unable to be completely muted (church noises and national anthems still play), and trade routes not loading/unloading correctly. There was a newer version released as part of Civ IV, but it lacked a functional customs house, and fell short of the original IMO.\n\nBottom line, great game and well worth the <$10 to purchase.

If you are in that camp... try the remake.","June 26, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game was so fun for me a couple of years ago and it is the reason I love the Civilization franchise now. Of course it can't stand up to the games nowadays but i strongly recommend giving it a try if you like this sort of games just to get the feeling how it all came to be.","June 19, 2015","true","21.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The unique challenge posed in this game, the one of actually declaring your independance and fighting for it, is a challenge indeed.  There never seems to be enough of everything to go around, so learning to make do with a shoe-string effort seems to be the norm.  I have supremely fond memories of the game and I'm glad to say the game has held up to those all these years later.  Warning: prepare to find yourself humming songs from the game for the next few years.","January 1","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ok for its time but for a game more than two decades old it has limitations.  Haven't found a game like it with a mild sense of humour in some of the diplomacy options, colourful and educational.  The Manual is very enjoyable to read and goes into greater detail about historic figures.\n\nOnly issues may be in the end game when you start hitting some limitations and lack of automation, or should I say the inability of the automation functions to work.  Definitely very replayable and enjoyable, and more fun that many recent games I've come across.","August 1, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's from around 1995, before internet was a household concept.  The game's graphics were not intended to be glorious.  Now, then...\n\nI didn't think I see this one again - An early create-a-nation strategy game, one of many with Sid Meier's name stamped on it.  Very few names stay relevant in the industry as his, over 20 years after the first Civilization game, and now there's Civilization: Beyond Earth.\n\nAnyway, the concept begins simply.  It's 1492 - a new world has been found.  This new world can be historical the Americas, a random new world, or one you create.  4 nations, each with an advantage that reflect its history, want to colonize it - England, Spain, France, or the Netherlands.\nYou are placed in charge of colonizing this land.  Explore, find a good place to settle, build, and use the land to create your fortune.\n\nOf course, natives already live here - interact with them.  They offer gifts, and teach you how to plant abundant cash crops.  They like to  trade, paying gold for cheap "Trade Goods."  But, your colonies grow, alarming the Indians of takeover, and you'll likely end up at war.  Keep this in mind before selling them horses or guns.  You can try to keep the peace (trading helps), or be the Spanish that just burn villages and take treasure.\n\nDeal with other European colonies strictly as rivals to exploit.  My strategy is be peaceful at first, let them develop their own colonies, then grab muskets and take it!  I do this because that's THEIR plan too.  These rivals claim they want peace - but if you have colonies on the same continent, their soldiers always like to camp just outside your Fort.\n\nWhen your settlers are not busy turning Ore into Tools into Muskets, there's the matter of money.  Main solution - grow sugar, tobacco, and cotton.  Then turn them into Rum, Cigars, and Cloth.  Load em onto ships bound for Europe.  Remember, prices are based on supply and demand.  Your rivals are also trading, and if everyone is selling Cigars, the price will drop.  It's why Silver always gets lower over time, while muskets and horses go up.\n\nWhy do all this?  Because you're creating a nation - strong and independent.  Your King doesn't understand this, thinking he can liberally tax you because "reasons."  So, your settlers create "Liberty Bells", culture points of a sort.  These grow rebel sentiment in your colonies, making them more productive and free-thinking.  They also attract Founding Fathers that offer fantastic advantages to your growing nation.\n\nEventually, boycotting taxes aren't enough.  The time for to declare independence will arrive.   Then comes the true test - the King's denial prompts him to send a GIANT force of Warships, artillery, and  "Redcoats."\n\nYou win by kicking the Lobsterbacks back across the Atlantic, if they're lucky.\n","December 22, 2015","true","44.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I still own my original Windows 3.1 disc and instruction manual from the release in '94, but the 3.1 version has been sketchy at best ever since Windows 95 was released with frequent and random crashes that has gotten progressively worse with each Windows release.  The DOS version and 3.1 play exactly the same as each other, the only real difference I noticed are the unit sprites are designed a little different on a couple units (veteran soldiers and fisherman were the most obvious to me), and this version I was able to play straight through without any crashing.\n\nIt's still a deceptively simple, but challenging game.  If you don't start on a good continent with plenty of wood and ore immediately available on your first turn, you might as well just start your game over, because it has always been pretty unforgiving if you're a turn or two behind the other European powers.  The AI is overall pretty predictable, dumb and aggressive, but I still remember the strategies I used to win this game 20 years ago and it was definitely a fun nostalgia trip.\n\nMy only gripe, I feel $7 for a 22 year old DOS game is oddly highly priced.","May 20","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
