The border is way too large, xbox one controller dead zone bug is alive and well (always the sign of great qa for a game), resolution issues, menus that even a console game would scoff at. Its a mess.\n\nWhich is a shame given how many times this game has been ported well. Even the nes version was better.\n\nWhy they keep going for cash grabs with the poor ports over the great stuff they did with games like Namco Museum and Namco Legends back in the ps2 era is beyond me.\n\nAvoid unless you enjoy playing dig dug with a keyboard's arrow keys while in a window that isnt made for any resolution of monitor on the planet.\n\nAt least it looks like Dig Dug, and the music is spot on, thats about the only positive.","April 20","false","0.7"," 44 of 66 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","44","66","6","3"

It's Dig Dug.  Nothing's changed in the 30+ years it's been around, and that's probably a good thing.  For a game you can probably find on Google and play for free, the price is a bit steep, especially since it doesn't come with any old instruction booklets or concept sketches, like Megaman Legacy Collection does, but it's finally a proper port of Dig Dug.  And it works, too.  Someone at Bandai-Namco finally saw the light and made an actual working port of an old arcade game.\nI'll add this to my ever-growing collection in a vain attempt to make a steam museum.","April 19","true","0.8"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","22","33","5","3"

Dig Dug is a great old arcade game... one of my faves, even. Its exactly what youd expect.\n\nA few minor issues... Like no fullscreen... and how the store page doesnt tell you that it has controller support. Little problems, but still a great port.\n\n*edit*\nIt does have controller support, but it doesnt mention it at all.","April 19","true","1.1"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","18","31","0","4"

(Need to Alt+F4 or end process)\n-No key mapping\n-No Fullscreen option (have to use Alt+Enter)\n-No 360 arcade stick support (Mad Catz stick vetical axis is flipped, PS3 one works perfectly)\n-Analog Stick deadzone is awful, often moves left while entering no input\n-Needlessly massive downloads for such small games (800mb+)\n\nGame's themselves are fine, but these shells they are in are atrocious. Some very basic functions have been missed and basic input support has not been offered. Unless these aren't fixed quickly, then I would suggest avoiding these or getting a refund if you have already purchased them.","April 27","false","0.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"
